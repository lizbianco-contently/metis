Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will proceed on my leader time.\n  As we all know, the war on terror did not end last month when \nAmerican forces shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad.\n  General Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, wrote to me \nyesterday to explain that this is a moment of elevated threat to our \ncountry and that the intelligence community is\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\nworking to analyze the information gained at the Bin Laden compound. \nAl-Qaida and its associate groups remain a threat to the United States.\n  And our intelligence community, military and law enforcement \nprofessionals still need the tools that enable them to gather and share \nintelligence in this fight.\n  That is why all Americans should be reassured today in knowing that \nthese dedicated men and women will continue to have those tools. I have \nno doubt that the 4-year PATRIOT Act extension that Members of both \nparties have agreed to will safeguard us from future attacks, and that \neverything we agreed to in this extension is necessary for this fight.\n  As FBI Director Bob Mueller has said, all the authorities it contains \nare critical. Every one requires the prior approval of an independent \nFederal judge. Nothing in this extension has ever been found to be \nunconstitutional. And most of these authorities have not even been \nchallenged in court--ever.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has conducted aggressive oversight \nof the programs authorized by these expiring provisions. Over the past \ndecade, we have seen how terrorists have proved themselves adaptable, \nhow they have altered their tactics and methods to strike us at home. \nBy extending this invaluable terror-fighting tool, we are staying ahead \nof them.\n  Now is not the time to surrender the tools authorized by this act, or \nto make them more difficult to use. It was absolutely imperative that \nwe renew these authorities under the PATRIOT Act. They have enabled \nothers to keep us safe for nearly a decade. Our law enforcement \nprofessionals have been able to use tools just like them in traditional \ncriminal cases for years. We should be relieved and reassured to know \nthey won't expire this week.\n\n\n                            A Looming Crisis\n\n  Mr. President, last June, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nADM Mike Mullen, made an observation that may have surprised some \npeople. A day after Democrats here in the Senate refused to allocate \ntens of billions of dollars in unemployment assistance unless the costs \ncould be added to an already unsustainable debt--he said that, in his \nview, the biggest threat to our national security is our debt.\n  A few months earlier, the President himself identified the debt as a \nlooming crisis. He pointed out that almost all of our long-term debt \nrelates to the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. And he said, ``if we \ndon't get control of that, we can't get control over our budget.'' He \nwas right.\n  But the co-chair of the President's debt commission may have put it \nbest just 6 weeks ago. Speaking about the consequences of the fiscal \npath we're on, Erskine Bowles said simply:\n  It's the most predictable crisis in history. The most predictable \ncrisis in history--and that was a Democrat talking. And yet Democrats \nin the Senate don't even want to talk about it.\n  Yesterday, here in the Senate, Democrats rejected every single \nproposal we have seen on our Nation's fiscal future. They took a pass. \nThey have chosen to ignore this crisis just like they ignored the last \none.\n  Three years ago, as the financial crisis approached, the senior \nSenator from New York was holding press conferences trying to link the \nwar in Iraq to what passed for an economic slowdown at the time. The \nmajority leader was postponing votes that we all knew would fail so \nDemocrats who were running for President could be here to vote on them. \nNow, in the face of a looming crisis we all admit is coming--they are \ndoing the same thing.\n  This crisis is staring us right in the face. The Democrats \nthemselves--from the President on down--say they see it. Yet, once \nagain, they are so focused on the next election they refuse to do \nanything to upset the status quo. They are more concerned about their \nown jobs than preventing a economic catastrophe that could affect \neverybody's job. They want to wait this out--while they hammer anybody \nwho proposes a solution. They rejected their own President's budget. \nThey rejected three Republican budgets. And they have not even bothered \nto offer a budget of their own. They're just marking time, treading \nwater.\n  So I think Democrats have lost the right to express concern about \nthis crisis. Until they propose some solution of their own, they are \npart of the problem.\n  The American people didn't send us here to hide in a corner until the \nnext election. They sent us here to act on their behalf, and this is \ntheir message: If you see a crisis coming, you better do something \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time during the quorum call be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto engage in a colloquy between Senators Udall, Feinstein, and Merkley.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to talk for just a couple of \nminutes about the issue of secret law that Senator Udall and I, as we \nare both members of the Intelligence Committee, have been working on \nfor quite some time. Then I am going to yield to our friend, the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nFeinstein, for a colloquy.\n  What this issue is all about is this: I believe there are two PATRIOT \nActs in America. The first is the text of the law itself, and the \nsecond is the government's secret interpretation of what they believe \nthe law means.\n  As an example, several years ago Americans woke up to learn that the \nBush administration had been secretly claiming for years that \nwarrantless wiretapping was legal. This disclosure greatly undermined \nthe public's trust in the Department of Justice and our national \nintelligence agencies, and it took Congress and the executive branch \nyears to sort out the situation.\n  I believe the American people will also be extremely surprised when \nthey learn how the PATRIOT Act is secretly being interpreted, and I \nbelieve one consequence will be an erosion of public confidence that \nmakes it more difficult for our critically important national \nintelligence agencies to function effectively. As someone who served on \nthe Intelligence Committee for 10 years, sitting right next to Senator \nFeinstein, I don't want to see that happen.\n  Let me yield now to Senator Udall. He will also have brief remarks, \nand any colleagues who want to speak, and then Senator Feinstein will \nlead us in the discussion of how we will be moving forward. So I yield \nto Senator Udall who has been an invaluable member on the Intelligence \nCommittee. He and I have worked on this since the day he joined our \ncommittee, and I am so appreciative of his involvement.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor his kind words. I also wish to echo his remarks about the \nleadership of the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee and her \nfocus on keeping our country safe and our citizens protected.\n  I also wish to make the point that, as my colleague from Oregon, I \nalso oppose reauthorization of the expiring provisions in the PATRIOT \nAct without significant reforms. I believe it is critical that the \nadministration make public its interpretation of the PATRIOT Act so \nMembers of Congress and the public are not kept in the dark.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank both Senator Wyden and \nSenator Udall for their comments. We did have a meeting last night. We \ndid discuss this thoroughly. The decision was that we would enter into \nthis colloquy, so I will begin it, if I may.\n  These Senators and I, along with the junior Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nMerkley, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Mark Udall, and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse met last night to discuss this \namendment, the legal interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act provisions and how these provisions are implemented.\n  I very much appreciate the strong views Senator Wyden and Senator \nUdall have in this area, and I believe they are raising a serious and \nimportant point as to how exactly these authorities are carried out. I \nbelieve we are also all in agreement that these are important \ncounterterrorism authorities and have contributed to the security of \nour Nation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for my special \nfriend from California, the distinguished chairwoman of the \nIntelligence Committee. I have literally sat next to her for more than \na decade. We agree on virtually all of these issues, but this is an \narea where we have had a difference of opinion.\n  I have said I wouldn't support a long-term reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act without significant reforms, particularly in this area. I \nam especially troubled by the fact that the U.S. Government's official \ninterpretation of the PATRIOT Act is secret, and I believe a \nsignificant gap has developed now between what the public thinks the \nlaw says and what the government secretly claims it says. That is why I \nand my colleagues from Oregon and Colorado and New Mexico have proposed \nan amendment that would make these legal interpretations public.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, let me say once again, as does \nmy colleague from Oregon, I oppose reauthorization of the existing \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act that we have been debating on the Senate \nfloor without significant reforms. I also have to say I believe it is \ncritical that the administration make public its interpretation of the \nPATRIOT Act so Members of Congress and our public are not kept in the \ndark. That is the important work we have in front of us, and we have a \nreal opportunity to accomplish those goals.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may respond, I have agreed that \nthese are important issues and that the Intelligence Committee, which \nis charged with carrying out oversight over the 16 various intelligence \nagencies of what is called the intelligence community, should be \ncarried out forthrightly. I also believe the place to do it is in the \nIntelligence Committee itself. I have said to these distinguished \nSenators that it would be my intention to call together a hearing as \nsoon as we come back from the Memorial Day break with the intelligence \ncommunity agencies, the senior policymakers, and the Department of \nJustice to make sure the committee is comfortable with the FISA \nprograms and to make changes if changes are needed. We will do that.\n  So it would be my intention to have these hearings completed before \nthe committee considers the fiscal year 2012 intelligence authorization \nbill so that any amendments to FISA can be considered at that time.\n  The fact is, we do not usually have amendments to the intelligence \nauthorization bill, but I believe the majority leader will do his best \nto secure a future commitment if such is needed for a vote on any \namendment. I have not agreed to support any amendment because at this \nstage it is hypothetical, and we need to look very deeply into what \nthese Senators have said and pointed out last night with specificity \nand get the response to it from the intelligence committee, have both \nsides hear it, and then make a decision that is based not only on civil \nliberties but also on the necessity to keep our country safe. I believe \nwe can do that.\n  I am very appreciative of their agreement to enter this colloquy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the \nIntelligence Committee for proposing this course of action for \naddressing the secret law issue. Obviously, colleagues would like more \ninformation on that, and they are going to be in a position to know \nthat the Intelligence Committee is going to be examining it closely. I \nwill just describe the next steps from there.\n  Senator Udall and I have discussed this issue with Senator Reid. \nSenator Reid indicated to the chairwoman and myself and Senator Udall \nthat we would have an opportunity through these hearings--and, of \ncourse, any amendments to the bill would be discussed on the \nintelligence authorization legislation, which is a matter that \nobviously has to be classified--but if we were not satisfied, if we \nwere not satisfied through that process, we would have the ability to \noffer an amendment such as our original one on the Senate floor.\n  Of course, the chairwoman would still retain full rights to oppose \nit, but we would make sure if this issue of secret law wasn't fixed and \nthere wasn't an improved process to make more transparent and more open \nthe interpretation of the law--not what are called sources and methods \nwhich are so important to protect our people--we would have an \nopportunity, if it wasn't corrected in the intelligence community, to \ncome to the floor.\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\n  Senator Reid has just indicated to all of us that he would focus on \ngiving us a vote if we believed it was needed on another bill--not the \nintelligence authorization--before September 30. So there is a plan to \nactually get this fixed, and that is what is key.\n\n  At this time I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as we begin to end this \nimportant colloquy, I wish to acknowledge the leadership of Senator \nWyden on this important matter. I also wish to acknowledge the \ninvolvement of the Senator from New Mexico, who is presiding at this \nmoment in time, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, who has been very involved \nin bringing this case to the attention of all of us. I wish to also \nthank my good friend from California, the chairwoman of the committee. \nShe has shown a great willingness to work with everybody and to listen.\n  I have to say I expect that once the committee examines this issue \nmore closely, I think many more of our colleagues will want to join us \nin reforming the law in this area. I think this is important. I do \nthink we can find the right balance between protecting civil liberties \nand protecting the health and welfare of the American citizens.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me just make one last comment. I also \nwish to express my appreciation to Senator Merkley, who has been an \nextraordinarily outspoken advocate of our civil liberties and our \nprivacy in striking a good balance between fighting terror and \nprotecting the rights of our people, and I have so appreciated his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Let me sum up. First, I am very grateful to our chairwoman and \npleased with this agreement. The chairwoman has indicated she believes \nthose of us who want to reform secret law have raised a serious and \nimportant issue. Those are her words. We are grateful for that because \nwe obviously believe very strongly about it. The chairwoman has said we \nwill hold hearings promptly to examine the secret law issue, give \nserious consideration to looking at reforms in the fiscal year 2012 \nintelligence authorization bill, and then, per our conversations with \nthe majority leader, if Senator Udall and I believed it had not been \ncorrected on the intelligence authorization bill, we would have the \nright to offer--and certainly the chairwoman could oppose it--an \namendment on the floor of the Senate on an unrelated bill. Senator \nReid, to his great credit, in an effort to try to resolve this and move \nit along, said to the three of us that he would be working to do that.\n  Again, our thanks to the chairwoman and all of my colleagues on the \nfloor, including Senator Merkley, who is not a member of the committee \nand knows an incredible amount about it and certainly showed that last \nnight in our discussions and was very helpful. I wish to yield to him.\n  So with the cooperation the chairwoman has shown all of us who are \ntrying to change this and the efforts of Senator Reid to make sure if \nwe didn't work it out we could come back to the floor again, I withdraw \nthe Wyden-Udall amendment for the time being. It ought to be clear to \neverybody in the Senate that we are going to continue to prosecute the \ncause of making more open and accountable the way the government \ninterprets this law in making sure that the American people have the \nconfidence that the way it is being interpreted is in line with the \ntext of the legislation.\n  I withdraw at this time the Wyden-Udall amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am deeply appreciative of the dialogue \nthat has just taken place. It was William Pitt in England who commented \nthat the wind and the rain can enter my house, but the King cannot.\n  It captured the spirit and understanding of the balance between \npersonal privacy, personal freedoms, and issues of the Crown regarding \nmaintenance of security. It was this foundation that came in for our \nfourth amendment of our Constitution that lays out clear standards for \nthe protection of privacy and freedoms.\n  So as we have wrestled with the standard set out in the PATRIOT Act, \na standard that says the government may have access to records that are \nrelevant to an investigation--now, that term is, on its face, quite \nbroad and expansive, quite a low standard, if you will. But what \nhappens when it is interpreted out of the sight of this Chamber, out of \nthe sight of the American people? That is the issue my colleague has \nraised, and it is a very important issue.\n  I applaud the chair of the Intelligence Committee for laying out a \nprocess whereby we all can wrestle with this issue in an appropriate \nvenue and have a path for amendments in the committee or possibly here \non the floor of the Senate because I do think it is our constitutional \nresponsibility to make sure the fourth amendment of the Constitution is \nprotected, the privacy and freedoms of citizens are protected.\n  I say thank you to the Senator from Colorado; my senior colleague, \nwho has led this effort from Oregon; my colleague from New Mexico, who \nis the Acting President pro tempore; and the chairwoman from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues very much. I \nbelieve this concludes our colloquy.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore, and we yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I voted against the \nmotion to invoke cloture on S. 990, the legislative vehicle for S. \n1038, the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT ACT. I opposed cloture \nbecause I believe the Senate has an obligation to consider substantive \namendments to improve the PATRIOT Act.\n  We are all aware that at the end of this week three provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act will expire. The three provisions are business records, \nroving wiretaps, and ``lone wolf'' terrorists.\n  I understand there is a delicate balance we must strike here between \npreventing and disrupting future terrorist attacks in the United States \nand protecting our cherished constitutional rights and civil liberties. \nWe must make sure that our law enforcement and intelligence \nprofessionals have the tools they need at their disposal to stop future \nterrorist attacks. At the same time, we must insure that our government \nuses our scarce resources wisely, and that it safeguards the very \nrights and liberties that are guaranteed by our Constitution to all \nAmericans.\n  The current legislation before the Senate simply extends the existing \nPATRIOT Act authorities for 4 more years, until 2015, without any \nchanges to the authorities given to the government or oversight of \ntheir use by Congress and the courts.\n  I think we can improve this legislation, as Congress seeks to strike \nthe proper balance that I have mentioned. I have studied this issue \nclosely as the former chairman of the Terrorism and Homeland Security \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee \nhas held numerous hearings on the implementation of the new PATRIOT Act \nauthorities. We have received testimony from government witnesses, \nincluding the inspector general of the Justice Department, on the \nimproper use of some of the PATRIOT Act authorities, and \nrecommendations to improve the PATRIOT Act.\n  Congress put these sunsets into this law for a reason. I have \nsupported these sunsets for the PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments \nAct. A sunset means that a law will not just continue on autopilot \nwithout any changes. Congress uses sunsets when giving extraordinary \nauthorities to the executive branch so that we have a check and balance \non the use of this power by the government. The separation of powers \nalso gives the courts a large role in reviewing and approving certain \ngovernment investigatory and surveillance activity under the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  A sunset means that the executive branch has to come back to Congress \nand ask for an extension of authority. Congress then has a \nresponsibility to look at how the law has been carried out, and make \nany needed improvements in the law, before again extending the \nauthorities in the law.\n  Without any action by Congress, a sunset leads to the expiration of \nthe law in question, as the authorities in the law will lapse. As a \nresult, when sunsets are involved I have found the executive branch is \nmore forthcoming with Congress in terms of sharing information and \nproviding classified\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nbriefings to Congress on how they use the authorities in question.\n  That is why I voted to oppose cloture. The Senate should have the \nability to consider substantive amendments to the PATRIOT Act, and not \nsimply extend the authorities as is, with no changes, for another 4 \nyears.\n  And the Senate already has a package of reforms ready for \nconsideration, after careful deliberation in committee. Earlier this \nweek, I was pleased to cosponsor an amendment offered by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy. In the 111th Congress, I was also pleased to \ncosponsor similar legislation offered by Chairman Leahy. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported this legislation to the full \nSenate in March 2011, as S. 193, the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension \nAct of 2011.\n  Broadly speaking, the Leahy amendment would increase judicial and \ncongressional review of surveillance authorities that sweep in U.S. \ncitizens, and would expand oversight and public reporting to ensure \nthat Americans can monitor the use of these authorities.\n  The Leahy amendment requires the government to meet a higher burden \nof proof when seeking business records from Americans, under the so-\ncalled section 215 orders. The amendment would require the government \nto show that the documents sought are relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation and are linked to a foreign group or foreign power. \nCurrent law merely requires the government to show the records are \nrelevant to an authorized investigation. Under the amendment, the \ngovernment must meet an even higher burden of proof to obtain \nbookseller or library records.\n  The Leahy amendment also makes it easier for Americans to challenge \nthe government when business records are sought. The amendment strikes \nthe 1-year waiting period before a recipient can challenge a \nnondisclosure order for section 215 orders, and also strikes the \nconclusive presumption in favor of the government on nondisclosure of \nsuch an order.\n  For the first time, this Leahy amendment would also write into law a \nsunset provision and greater oversight of the use of national security \nletters, NSLs, by the government. This would therefore add a fourth \nsunset to the PATRIOT Act. This provision would shift the burden to the \ngovernment to seek a court order for an NSL nondisclosure order, and \nallows the recipient of such an order to challenge it at any time.\n  Under the Leahy amendment, Congress will require a new series of \naudits to ensure protection of privacy and vigorous oversight of the \nnew authorities given to the government. The Justice Department \ninspector general would conduct audits of the use of three surveillance \ntools: orders for tangible things; pen registers and trap and trace \ndevices; and NSLs. The scope of such audits includes a comprehensive \nanalysis of the effectiveness and use of the investigative authorities \nprovided to the government, including any improper or illegal use of \nsuch authorities.\n  Finally, the Leahy amendment requires enhanced court review and \noversight of minimization procedures, which are designed to protect the \nprivacy of innocent and law-abiding Americans. The amendment requires \nincreased public reporting on the use of NSL's and FISA authorities by \nthe government, including an annual unclassified report on how FISA \nauthorities are used and their impact on the privacy of United States \npersons.\n  We now approach the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on \nthis Nation. The United States recently conducted a military and \nintelligence operation which led to the killing of the al-Qaida \nmastermind of the attacks, Osama bin Laden. America still faces threats \nto its security every day, and I thank our brave men and women in the \nUnited States military and our intelligence community for working \ntirelessly to keep America safe.\n  In my view, the Leahy amendment strikes the proper balance of giving \nour law enforcement and intelligence professionals the tools they need \nto prevent and disrupt future terrorist attacks, while simultaneously \nprotect our civil liberties. The amendment includes important new \nprotection for law-abiding Americans, and requires more vigorous \noversight by Congress and the courts as the government uses these new \npowers.\n  Although I hope that the Leahy amendment will still be made in order, \nit is important that we do not allow the PATRIOT Act authorities to \nexpire. It is important for our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to have these tools at their disposal as they seek to prevent \nand disrupt future terrorist attacks in the United States.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act has been an indispensable, \nlife-saving tool for the law enforcement and intelligence communities \nthat work tirelessly to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks. In \nthese dangerous times, the PATRIOT Act should give a little more peace \nof mind to millions of Americans and give those seeking to do us harm \ngood reason to rethink their diabolical plans.\n  Earlier this year, I voted to extend the PATRIOT Act. Today, I \nreaffirm my support for reauthorizing key PATRIOT Act provisions for an \nadditional 4 years.\n  Our Nation's security has and will always be a top priority for me. \nAs a member of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \naware of the constant threat our Nation faces from terrorists and \nindividuals who hate us and want to impose their radical view of the \nworld at all costs. Any changes or limits on the PATRIOT Act would only \ngive these extremists an opening to strike us.\n  While some may disagree on this issue, I simply cannot allow those \ntasked with protecting our people from being deprived of these vital, \nlawful means to help prevent an attack.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we have not been \nable to work out an agreement that will allow consideration of my \namendment to the pending USA PATRIOT Act sunset extension legislation. \nI think that a bipartisan majority of the Senate would have supported \nour improvements. We have missed an opportunity to move forward to help \nkeep our Nation secure while also strengthening our commitment to our \ncore constitutional principles of individual liberty and privacy.\n  The amendment I sought to offer represented a commonsense and \nreasonable package of reforms that would have improved the law, \nexpanded civil liberties and privacy protections, and better ensured \nproper oversight and accountability. This amendment earned the \ncosponsorship of Senator Paul and a dozen others since we began debate \non Monday, including Senators Cardin, Bingaman, Coons, Shaheen, Wyden, \nFranken, Gillibrand, Harkin, Durbin, Merkley, Boxer, and Akaka. I thank \nthese Senators for recognizing that the Senate should do better than \nmerely extend the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act for \nanother 4 to 6 years without a single improvement or reform.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Senate Judiciary Committee has diligently \nconsidered how to make improvements to current law. The language in our \namendment was the product of more than a year and a half of extensive \nnegotiations with Republicans and Democrats, the intelligence \ncommunity, and the Department of Justice. The committee reported a \nbipartisan bill last Congress and another similar bill in the current \nCongress. The bipartisan amendment that we sought to bring to the \nSenate preserved the ability of the government to use the PATRIOT Act \nsurveillance tools, while promoting transparency, accountability, and \noversight. It was not everything that everyone wanted but it was a \ncommonsense package of improvements that should have been adopted.\n  The Attorney General and others have repeatedly assured us that the \nmeasures to enhance oversight and accountability, such as audits and \npublic reporting, would not sacrifice ``the operational effectiveness \nand flexibility needed to protect our citizens from terrorism'' or \nundermine ``the collection of vital foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information.'' In fact, the Attorney General has \nconsistently said that the Senate Judiciary Committee-passed bill \nstruck ``a good balance'' by extending PATRIOT Act authorities while \nadding accountability and civil liberties protections.\n  One of the improvements we need to make is to repair a constitutional \ninfirmity in the current law. The so-\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\ncalled Doe v. Mukasey fix is needed to address a first amendment \nproblem with the national security letter statutes, and should not have \nbeen controversial in any way. Similarly, no one can seriously contend \nthat periodic audits by an inspector general of past operations \npresented any operational concerns to law enforcement or intelligence \ngathering. These are vital oversight tools that everyone should have \nsupported.\n  As it stands now, the extension of the PATRIOT Act provisions does \nnot include a single improvement or reform, and includes not even a \nword that recognizes the importance of protecting the civil liberties \nand constitutional privacy rights of Americans. We could have provided \nthe necessary tools to law enforcement and the intelligence community, \nbut could have done so while faithfully performing our duty to protect \nthe constitutional principles and civil liberties upon which all \nAmerican rely.\n  Today's Washington Post included an editorial that urged the Senate \nto extend the PATRIOT Act authorities but also to include ``additional \nprotections meant to ensure that these robust tools are used \nappropriately.'' The editorial observed that the bill ``would be that \nmuch stronger'' if it included the oversight and auditing requirements \nincluded in our amendment. That is why Senator Paul and a dozen other \nSenators had sponsored the amendment. That is why Senator Lee voted for \nthem this year in the Judiciary Committee. And I would note that \nSenator Kyl and Senator Cornyn supported them in the last Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of \ntoday's editorial from the Washington Post entitled, ``A Chance to Put \nProtections in the PATRIOT Act.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 25, 2011]\n\n             A Chance to Put Protections in the Patriot Act\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       Congress appears poised to renew important counterterrorism \n     provisions before they are to expire at the end of the week. \n     That much is welcome. But it is disappointing that lawmakers \n     may extend the Patriot Act measures without additional \n     protections meant to ensure that these robust tools are used \n     appropriately.\n       The Patriot Act's lone-wolf provision allows law \n     enforcement agents to seek court approval to surveil a non-\n     U.S. citizen believed to be involved in terrorism but who may \n     not have been identified as a member of a foreign group. A \n     second measure allows the government to use roving wiretaps \n     to keep tabs on a suspected foreign agent even if he \n     repeatedly switches cellphone numbers or communication \n     devices, relieving officers of the obligation of going back \n     for court approval every time the suspect changes his means \n     of communication. A third permits the government to obtain a \n     court order to seize ``any tangible item'' deemed relevant to \n     a national security investigation. All three are scheduled to \n     sunset by midnight Thursday.\n       House and Senate leaders have struck a preliminary \n     agreement for an extension to June 2015 and may vote on the \n     matter as early as Thursday morning. This agreement was not \n     easy to come by. Several Republican senators originally \n     wanted permanent extensions--a proposition rebuffed by most \n     Democrats and civil liberties groups. In the House, \n     conservative Tea Party members, who worried about handing the \n     federal government too much power, earlier this year bucked a \n     move that would have kept the provisions alive until \n     December. Congressional leaders were forced to piece together \n     short-term approvals to keep the tools from lapsing.\n       The compromise four-year extension is important because it \n     gives law enforcement agencies certainty about the tools' \n     availability. But the bill would be that much stronger if \n     oversight and auditing requirements originally included in \n     the version from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) were permitted \n     to remain. Mr. Leahy's proposal, which won bipartisan \n     approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, required the \n     attorney general and the Justice Department inspector general \n     to provide periodic reports to congressional overseers to \n     ensure that the tools are being used responsibly. Mr. Leahy \n     has crafted an amendment that includes these protections, but \n     it is unlikely that the Senate leadership will allow its \n     consideration.\n       At this late hour, it is most important to ensure that the \n     provisions do not lapse, which could happen as a result of a \n     dispute between Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) \n     and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) over procedural issues. If time \n     runs out for consideration of the Leahy amendment, Mr. Leahy \n     should offer a stand-alone bill later to make the reporting \n     requirements the law.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions be recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had an unfortunate series of votes \nlast night, in my opinion, because it was all arranged by our \nleadership in the Senate to have a series of votes to do nothing. That \nis unfortunate because the United States of America, and the Senate are \nproceeding with an idea that they do not have to have a budget. In \nfact, the majority leader, Senator\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\nReid, said it would be foolish to pass a budget. And as one of the \nstaffers said, on background: Well, if we pass a budget, we will have \nto tell people how much we are going to raise their taxes and talk \nabout spending reductions, and that will not be popular.\n  What did they do? One of the most incredible things I have ever seen \nin the Senate. Did they express regret that they could not pass a \nbudget, that they would not state for the American people a vision for \nspending and the financial future of America? No. What did they do? \nThey have the majority in the Senate. They called up the budget passed \nby the House of Representatives, which is a really historic budget, an \nhonest budget that deals fairly and objectively with the challenges we \nare facing, reduces spending, actually was able to reduce some taxes, \nand proposed, a decade out, that the Congress confront Medicare because \nit is going broke. So what did they do? They called up that budget. Did \nthey call it up to amend it? Did they call it up to offer us a chance \nto debate it and offer amendments and fix anything anybody did not like \nabout it? No. That was not what was done. They brought it up only with \nthe most limited debate before all four votes. They stacked all four \nvotes on four different budgets and projections and just voted them \ndown. They voted down every budget that was offered.\n  I have on my desk in my office the President's budget. It is four \nvolumes, hundreds of pages, and it lays out a budget. Every President \nsubmits budgets. They have a 500-person Office of Management and Budget \nstaff. Every year, they produce a budget. The law requires them to \nproduce a budget. This is the Code, the United States Code Annotated, \nand in this is the law that says a President should submit a budget and \nthe date by which he should do it. It says the U.S. Senate should \ncommence markup in the Budget Committee by April 1 and the Congress \nshould pass a budget by April 15. Last I heard, April 15 is long since \npassed.\n  How do you get a budget out of committee and to the floor of the \nSenate? What are we supposed to do by April 1? The chairman is supposed \nto call a markup, and he is supposed to bring up the budget he \nproposes, offer it to the Budget Committee. It is open for amendment, \nchange, and debate, then it is voted on. A budget should then come out \nof the committee to the floor of the Senate. It has expedited \nprocedures, but you are allowed to offer amendments, and there is 50 \nhours of debate--not too much. It does not require the normal 60 votes \nwe have to have for legislation here; it only requires a majority, 50 \nvotes.\n  That is basically designed, frankly--when the people wrote the Budget \nAct back in the 1970s--to allow the majority party to be able to pass a \nbudget because there were too many filibusters of budgets and no \nbudgets were getting passed. If you have the majority in the Senate, at \nleast you should be able to produce a budget. So it provides the \nDemocratic majority--the 53 Democratic Senators they have--the \nopportunity to produce a budget on a partisan basis if it cannot be \ndone on a bipartisan basis. So the normal process is, you work with \nyour colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and if you think a good \nagreement can be made in a bipartisan fashion, you do so and move a \nbipartisan budget.\n  I remember last year when Senator Gregg, our Republican ranking \nmember, talked about his conversation with Senator Conrad, and he said: \nHe is not letting me see the budget. It is going to be produced the \nnext morning. What that means is, he is going to produce a partisan \nbudget. He does not want our opinion. He is not going to show us what \nis in his budget until the day of the mark-up.\n  So this year, we wrote--all the Republican members; I am the ranking \nmember now--we asked the Budget chairman to show us his mark 72 hours \nbefore the mark-up because he had not consulted with us and it appeared \nhe was going to produce a partisan budget. Actually, he told me the \ndate the hearing would commence to mark up his budget, but he did \ndecline to give us any advance notice or opportunity to see what was in \nit.\n  All I am saying is that the procedure is set up realistically under \nthe Budget Act to allow the majority party to meet its responsibility \nto pass a budget. They do not need a single Republican vote to pass a \nbudget. I think it is better if you can get a bipartisan agreement. \nOftentimes in the past, there have been. But since budgets represent \nvisions for America, oftentimes in recent years they have gone on \npretty much a party line but not 100 percent. That is what I would say.\n  So the President submitted his budget, and it was roundly criticized \naround the country, and I was a very severe critic of it. So we offered \nthat budget last night. That was one of the four budgets that was \noffered. We brought it up. It is the only Democratic budget to be \nproduced. I believe the Progressive Caucus produced one in the House, \nbut, of course, it did not pass. It had a lot of tax increases, a lot \nof spending increases in it. It had no chance whatsoever of being \npassed. The American people sent us a message last year that they want \nus to get spending under control. They want us to reduce the size and \nscope of government. That is what they asked us to do.\n  So the President's budget came up last night, and, 97 to 0, every \nDemocrat voted against the President's budget. Well, they should \nbecause it was unacceptable. I have referred to it as the most \nirresponsible budget in the history of our country because we are in a \ndeeper financial hole than we have ever been. That is just a fact, and \nit is not a short-term, little problem; it is a problem that is getting \nworse in the years to come.\n  So the American people have come to the conclusion that we need to \nchange the trajectory of debt that we are piling on year after year, \nmonth after month, day after day, by the billions--trillions, really.\n  The President's budget, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office, \nwould produce uncontrolled debt year after year after year, in amounts \nnever before contemplated in our country, making the debt trajectory of \nour current baseline spending worse, not better.\n  I was under the impression everybody understood we had to change and \nget better. I thought, when we came in with this Congress, the debate \nwould be over how much to change in the right direction, how much could \nwe do to reduce the deficits, put us on the right path. Not the \nPresident's budget, which made things worse.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed his \nbudget and scored it, as we say, the lowest single deficit that budget \nwould produce is $748 billion, the lowest deficit to be produced under \nhis 10-year budget. President Bush was criticized for spending. The \nhighest budget deficit he had was $450 billion. That was the highest \nPresident Bush had, and he was criticized for that by many of my \nDemocratic colleagues quite vociferously.\n  President Obama is now heading to his third trillion dollar budget \ndeficit. This year, it is going to be $1.5 trillion, it looks like \nthree times the size of President Bush's highest deficit. As I said, \nthe lowest deficit they are projecting is $748 billion, and then it \nstarts going back up again. In his 10th year, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the deficit will be $1.2 trillion.\n  It is an indefensible, irresponsible budget. I am stunned that it was \npresented here. It has been widely criticized, as well it should be. So \nit was voted down last night.\n  If you are going to vote down something, should you not offer \nsomething in its place? That is what the fiscal commission that \nPresident Obama appointed said. That was their rule. That is what they \npromoted publicly: If you oppose a budget, you should offer your own. \nAnd, in fact, after Congressman Ryan, who served on the fiscal \ncommission with Mr. Bowles and Senator Simpson, the cochairmen, he \nproduced a budget. They gave him great credit. They said it was honest \nand courageous, and it faced the challenges of America, and it deserved \nrespect, and then said: Anybody who does not agree with that should \nshow what they would do.\n  So yesterday afternoon, we had the spectacle of Democratic Senators \nhammering and complaining about the Ryan budget, which in my opinion is \nthe most historic and responsible budget to be produced in decades. No, \nit is not perfect. It is perfectly acceptable to believe that it ought \nto be amended.\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\nBut it was a historic, honest attempt at dealing with the fiscal \nchallenges we face, and would put us on a financial path to solvency \nand stability and eliminate the risk we are facing. We probably should \ndo more to reduce spending than he proposed. But it was courageous and \nbold and honest and without gimmicks. I thought a very impressive \ndocument. I looked forward to debating parts of it in our Budget \nCommittee.\n  So what did we have last night? Yesterday? They just brought it up \nand every Democratic Member voted it down. And why? Because he had the \ngumption to actually suggest that for people 55 and younger, we should \nbegin to create a Medicare system that would be solvent and effective \nand save Medicare, because the trustees have reduced the year again at \nwhich it goes insolvent. Senator Reid and Senator Schumer had cleverly \nthought up this theory and were explicit about it. Their theory was \nthey would not bring up their own budget. They would not tell the \nAmerican people how much they wanted to increase their taxes. They \nwould not tell the American people they were going to cut anything, \nbecause they might make someone unhappy and be unpopular. They would \njust call up the Ryan budget and attack Republicans as wanting to kill \nMedicare, and produce nothing in response. They do not have any plan to \nfix the situation we are in.\n  I am disappointed about that. It is unthinkable that we would be \nrecessing and going home for a week without commencing markup hearings \nin the Budget Committee to produce a budget that we are required by law \nto produce. It is unthinkable we would do that.\n  I will be presenting to the majority leader a letter today from \nSenators on our side of the aisle--large numbers of Senators have \nsigned it, saying, we do not need to go home until we have confronted \nthis problem, and you have shown us how we are going to move forward to \nmeet our statutory responsibility to pass a budget.\n  I think that is reasonable. That is what we are going to be asking \ntoday. I am not going to vote to go home without having met our duty. \nWe call up our young men and women in uniform. We say: You will go to \nIraq for a year. They say: Well, I would rather not go. It is in your \ncontract. You signed up. You have to go. It is your duty. And they say, \nyes, sir, and they go.\n  Many of them have lost lives and limbs and we ought to remember them \nthis Memorial Day. But Do not we have a duty here? I think we do. I \nthink we have a duty to the United States of America to produce a \nbudget, whether or not it is law. But it is law in the United States \nCode. That is our duty. We do not need to be going home until we \nfulfill it, and we have a plan to go forward with it. I want to say \nthis is not a little bitty matter with me. We are not going to have \nfour votes--as we did yesterday--and then the majority leader is going \nto say, see, it is foolish to produce a budget. I told you we could not \nproduce a budget. We are not going to fool with having a budget this \nyear.\n  It has been 757 days since the Senate has had a budget, because the \nmajority leader did not bring up a budget last year either. Does \nanybody have any wonder about why we are going to have a $1.5 trillion \ndeficit this year, why 40 cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed? \nWe spend $3.7 trillion and we take in only $2.2 trillion.\n  Experts and financial wizards all over the world are telling us, what \nare you doing in the United States? You are about to threaten the \nworld's most prominent economy. It could have worldwide ramifications. \nOur debt to GDP compares with Portugal and Spain, almost as high as \nGreece. It will be 100 percent by September 30 of this year.\n  And we are going away without a budget again. The people who have \nasked to be given a leadership responsibility in the Congress cannot \neven comply with the Budget Act. They refuse to stand before the \nAmerican people and say what they want to tax, what they want to spend, \nwhat they want to cut--because it would not be popular. It would be \nfoolish.\n  I do not think so. It is not acceptable. You asked to be the leader \nof this Congress. You asked to be the President of the United States. \nYou have a responsibility to submit a responsible budget, an honest \nbudget, a fact-based budget, a budget the American people have an \nopportunity to understand, to read and study before we vote. And if the \nAmerican people find we have cast a bad vote, they can cast a good vote \nto throw some people out of Congress.\n  They threw some people out last fall. It does not look like we have \ngotten the message--Business as usual. We are in denial. We do not have \nto change. Oh, no, you cannot cut this spending program. What do you \nmean you cannot cut spending programs? Give me a break. The Alabama \nGovernor, Dr. Bentley, had to announce a 15-percent reduction in \ndiscretionary spending. Why? He did not have the money. Is that \nsomething we have forgotten in Washington--when you do not have money, \nyou should not spend it?\n  Well, you say, it is all because of this economy, or something else. \nLook, under President Obama, nondefense discretionary spending in 2 \nyears went up 24 percent. We are going broke. We are increasing \nspending on all the government programs. On an average, in the last 2 \nyears that is 12 percent a year. You know, the value of your money will \ndouble in 10 years if your interest is 7 percent. At 12 percent, I \nguess the size of government would increase and double in 6 years.\n  Great scott. No wonder people are upset with us. We have been \nspending incredibly recklessly. Also the 12 percent I mentioned--24 \npercent in 2 years--that does not include the stimulus package, the \nalmost $900 billion stimulus package that was thrown out the door with \nalmost no oversight. It was just designed to spend. And do you \nremember, it was supposed to stimulate the economy.\n  We probably have had the slowest ever rebound from a recession. It \nhas been a very shaky recovery. They will say, well, we should have \nspent more. But Rogoff and Reinhart, the professors, tell us, when your \ndebt gets as high as that of the United States, then you begin to show \na decline in growth. One percent of GDP growth is reduced when your \ndebt reaches 90 percent of GDP. We reached that this year, and we will \ngo over 100 percent by September 30.\n  This is the budget that the President has submitted to us. He has a \nlarge staff over there. They maintain it. A large number of them have \nbeen there for many years. The President submitted to us a budget. It \nwas rejected yesterday 97 to 0. It confirms the fact that we do not \nhave a legitimate budget before us. The President's budget has been \nrejected utterly. The Democrats have refused to produce one.\n  They say: Why don't you have a mark-up and offer your budget? I \ncannot call a mark-up. The chairman calls the mark-up. The majority \nleaders confer and tell the chairmen when to call a mark-up. They \ndecided not to call a budget mark-up. We do not have an opportunity to \ngo to the Budget Committee and pass a budget.\n  We had such tremendous interest, and a lot of the new people who got \nelected to the Senate last fall wanted to be on the Budget Committee. \nThey traveled their States. They had heard from their people all over \ntheir States that they wanted us to control spending. They wanted to be \non the committee. It was the committee which had more interest and more \npeople pushing to be on it than any other committee. We finally \nselected a fabulous group of people to serve on the committee. And now \nwe do not meet. Now we are not even going to mark up a budget. What a \ndisappointment for those new Members coming here with vim and vigor and \nready to do something about the future of the Republic.\n  You know, one of the things that was interesting about the \nPresident's budget is how much praise it got from our Democratic \ncolleagues who voted it down last night when it came out. This is what \nSenator Schumer said about it: ``This is a responsible proposal. I \nbelieve this approach should have bipartisan support.'' Senator Bill \nNelson: ``I personally think the President's budget is a step in the \nright direction.'' Senator Max Baucus: ``The President's budget \nstrengthens our economy.'' Senator Ben Cardin: ``President Obama has \ngiven us a credible blueprint.'' Senator Tom Carper: ``The President's \nbudget is an important step forward.'' Senator Frank Lautenberg: \n``President Obama's budget presents a careful evaluation of what our \nNation needs.''\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\n  They all voted no last night. You know, with friends like that, you \ndo not need enemies, as they like to say. But what about Mr. Erskine \nBowles, the man President Obama chose to serve as chairman of the debt \ncommission? Mr. Bowles talked about the budget. He was rather stunned \nactually when it came out. It came out I think on Friday. On Sunday, \nMr. Bowles said: ``It comes nowhere close to where they will have to go \nto avoid a fiscal nightmare.''\n  Can you imagine? This is the man President Obama chose to head the \ndeficit commission, and he hammered this budget.\n  He said it is nowhere close, and it is nowhere close to doing what we \nhave to do. So I believe what we went through yesterday was a sham, a \nmockery, a joke, and had no meaning. It was nothing but politics, \nnothing but an avoidance of responsibility to help provide leadership.\n  We all know some serious choices have to be made, and I will close \nwith these thoughts. We are going to need a partnership in the Senate \nbetween our parties. There are going to be some tough choices which \nhave to be made. In my view, we simply cannot continue at our rate of \nspending. It has to be reduced. But we have people in denial, who don't \nthink it has to be reduced. But when your lowest deficit in 10 years is \nprojected to be $740 billion, and this year's will be the highest in \nthe history of the Republic, $1.5 trillion or more--how do we get \nthere?\n  We are going to have to make some choices. I have saluted the Gang of \nSix, who have tried. Apparently, they have fallen on hard times and the \nprospects aren't good for that. Now the Vice President is meeting. \nThere is some excuse, they say, that we don't have to do our business \nopenly and before the public and stand and be accounted for because \nthat would not work. People are afraid to make tough choices and \ndecisions in public.\n  I believe the American people are not happy with us. I know they are \nnot happy with us. Seventy percent of them believe this country is on \nthe wrong track, and the biggest part of that, surely, is our fiscal \nmanagement. They know this debt cannot be sustained. So we need to do \nsomething. The best way to do it is to follow the regular order, follow \nthe legally constituted method of budget processing. Let's have a \nBudget Committee meeting, and if the Gang of Six has ideas, let's have \nthem brought up in the Budget Committee and vote on them. If Vice \nPresident Biden wants to send something over, I am glad to hear it. If \nthe President wants to send his people over to defend this budget that \nhas been rejected 97 to zero, let them do it.\n  I will tell you what he and his Budget Director, Mr. Lew, said--can \nyou believe it? They said this budget will allow us to live within our \nmeans and not spend money we don't have. That is the way they promoted \nthis budget. It was rejected last night. If it caused us to live within \nour means and allowed us to pay down our debt then I would vote for it. \nIt did not come close to that. Yet the President talked about it all \nover the country, and his staff ran around saying this budget will \nallow us to live within our means. That is totally inaccurate, and that \nis irresponsible. What the President should have done, and what our \nDemocratic leaders have to help us with, is go to the American people \nand, with clarity, without equivocation, say we cannot continue. We \nmust tell them big changes have to be made, and we are so sorry this \ncountry has gotten in the shape we are in. We must say that we are \ngoing to make some changes, and we urge you to help us stick together \nand do it. We must do this to put the country on the right path.\n  But what do we have? We have Congressman Ryan, in the Republican \nHouse, who had the temerity, the courage, the discipline, and the sense \nof duty sufficient to pass a budget that would actually do what needs \nto be done. They called it up and attacked it with everything they had, \nbut they will not produce anything of their own.\n  It cannot be denied that this is a failure of leadership. I believe \nthe process and path we are on now is dangerous; it is not public, it \nis secret. They tried to produce a secret plan on comprehensive reform \nof immigration. The American people heard about it, and down it went. \nThey tried to negotiate in secret this health care reform bill. They \nwere able to hold their votes on a straight party-line vote--60 to 40--\nbut the American people were not happy with the process or results and \na lot of people who participated in that spectacle didn't come back \nafter this last election.\n  That is not the path we are hearing from our constituents. Our \nconstituents are saying: You work for us. We want to see you publicly \nstand and defend the values we believe in. If you don't do so, we are \ngoing to hold you accountable. I think that is democracy in America, \nand that is healthy. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I \nrespect the American people who are watching Congress and demanding \nthat we change the trajectory we are on.\n  I believe strongly that we need to do better. I believe strongly that \nthis Congress should have in play and commit before we recess--or not \nrecess--a plan to deal with the financial crisis our Nation faces. When \nwe do that, we can feel like we are fulfilling our duty both in law and \nmorally to the people who have given us the honor of serving in this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, last week, I spoke on the floor regarding \nthe resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is managing director of \nthe International Monetary Fund, due to the serious criminal charges he \nis now facing in New York.\n  Mr. Strauss-Kahn has since resigned, but it appears he will now \nreceive at least a $250,000 taxpayer-funded severance pay package from \nthe IMF and may be eligible for further undisclosed amounts in annual \nIMF retirement benefits.\n  Since the United States is the largest contributor to the IMF, we now \nface the potential share scenario where the American taxpayer is partly \nunderwriting severance payments and retirement packages to a man who is \npending a criminal conviction as a felon.\n  This is clearly unacceptable, and it is my hope that the U.S. \nexecutive director to the IMF, Meg Lundsager, advocates that no future \nbenefits pass to Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, if he is convicted of the \ncrimes with which he is charged.\n  As you know, the IMF is spearheading efforts to manage a very wide \nand deep European debt crisis. Despite my reservations about U.S. \ntaxpayer bailouts for Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, the institution \ndoes play a very critical role in financial leadership. I think it \nneeds to set an example, especially with regard to its now-disgraced \nleader.\n  Mr. Strauss-Kahn has failed to live up to the expectations of his \ninstitution and what the American taxpayers support.\n\n\n                             State Bailouts\n\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Treasury is scheduled to borrow over $1.4 \ntrillion this year, and we have a scheduled interest payment of over \n$220 billion. We will pay more in interest this year than we do for the \ncost of the U.S. Army. I am very concerned about this situation and \nalso an underreported financial situation developing in American \nStates. The situations in my home State of Illinois and the State of \nCalifornia are the most dire. I would regret any attempt by these \nStates to seek a Federal bailout. To defend the full faith and credit \nof the United States, I think we should move forward with a resolution \nthat I introduced with a number of other Senators, S. Res. 188, that \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that we should have no Federal \nbailout for the States.\n  This is an issue that has concerned the Senate once before. In the \n1840s, we faced a funding crisis of the States. The Senate wisely \nadvised then-Secretary of the Treasury Daniel Webster to seek or report \non any discussions that he might have had that could have led to \nguaranteeing State debt. It was the Senate's express resolution that \nprevented Treasury Secretary Webster from bailing out the State's\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\ndebt. The crisis at the time was even reflected in Charles Dickens' \nfamous book ``A Christmas Carol,'' in which Scrooge was described as \nsomeone who was less than wealthy because he had overinvested in what \nwere called United States sovereigns. In fact, the phrase in the \n``Christmas Carol'' is ``not worth a United States sovereign'' because \nof the spend-thrift policies of many State governments at the time.\n  The Senate at that time took the correct action to prevent the spend-\nthrift actions of several States from contaminating and ruining the \ncredit rating of the United States itself.\n  Our credit rating is already under stress with reports, especially by \nStandard & Poors, that we may face a loss in the AAA credit rating \ninvented to symbolize the strength of the United States if we don't \nchange the spending course soon. A way to accelerate the loss of a AAA \ncredit rating is to guarantee or somehow bail out spend-thrift States \nsuch as Illinois or California.\n  In Illinois, we have a very courageous State treasurer who just took \noffice and made a clear statement. Treasurer Dan Rutherford has told \nthe leaders of my own State they need to stop borrowing, they need to \nstop spending. He is seeking no Federal bailout for his State. The \nState situation is quite dire.\n  By one estimate, the revenues and pensions of the State of Illinois \nare the worst funded in America. Less than 40 percent of the pensions, \nby one estimate, have been funded. With this type of track record, you \ncould see a situation in which California or Illinois, in a crisis, \nwould seek a bailout from the Senate and from the House. I think we \nshould repeat the wise precedent set in the 1840s, the advice we sent \nto Treasury Secretary Daniel Webster to set a clear marker for our own \nTreasury Secretary to make sure there is no bailout for the States. To \nprotect our credit rating, I think this action is necessary, especially \nto reassure the credit rating agencies.\n  What would happen if we don't? Could we provide temporary benefits to \nIllinois and California? We could. Could we underwrite their policies \nof spend-thrift ways? We could. Would we accelerate a loss of the AAA \ncredit rating of the United States? We could. We are already seeing an \nexample of what happens when you drive your national economy off a \ncliff. Many of us originally hailed from our long-time ancestors who \npassed from Ireland, and recently the Irish Government finances \ncollapsed as they lost their credit rating. Because interest rates \nspiked in that country so fast, 53 percent of mortgages in Ireland were \nforeclosed in a short space of time after the loss of their credit \nrating.\n  We need to act to protect the people of the United States from such \nan economic fate. That is why we need to say no to any State bailouts, \nwhy we need to cut spending in Washington, and why we need to make sure \nthat at all costs we defend the credit rating of the United States. It \nis our sacred duty to make sure that what is befalling the people of \nGreece and the people of Portugal and the people of Ireland, being \nmisruled by governments that said yes to every special interest \nspending idea and no to their economic future, does not infect the \ncredit rating of the United States.\n  That is why this resolution is so needed, and that is why I am so \nproud to submit it today in the full and complete historic financial \ntradition of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1085 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                             Cote D'Ivoire\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have made four speeches on the floor in \nthe last month about the disaster, the catastrophe that is taking place \nin a country in west Africa called Cote d'Ivoire. Cote d'Ivoire is a \ncountry whose President, the legitimate President, I might add, is \nLaurent Gbagbo, with his wife Simone. Someone named Alassane Quattara, \nfrom the northern part of Cote d'Ivoire, with a rigged election, came \nin; it was certified. It was all set up before we knew what was going \non.\n  That individual's name is Quattara. His death squads today, this very \nmoment as we speak, are roaming the streets of Abidjan in Cote \nd'Ivoire. He is murdering and he is raping. Right now they have in \ncaptivity Laurent Gbagbo, the legitimate President of Cote d'Ivoire. I \nthink they are in the process of perhaps killing him right now. We \ndon't know that. The State Department does not know it. No one knows \nit.\n  We had a hearing. The State Department was totally without compassion \nor concern over what is happening in the streets of Abidjan. We saw, we \nwitnessed on video, the helicopters coming through and destroying that \ncity. We have friends there right now who tell us that even today the \ndeath squads of Alassane Quattara are roaming the streets murdering \npeople. No one can say within 10,000 people how many people they \nmurdered.\n  My concern is it is too late to do anything about that. They rigged \nthe election. I documented it. I sent the documentation to the State \nDepartment. They paid no attention to it. France was behind the whole \nthing. France wants to have as much control as they can of west Africa. \nThey conned the United Nations into it and our State Department went \nalong with it.\n  What is happening right now is so inhumane. I wish I had the pictures \nI showed before. The beautiful First Lady, Simone Gbagbo, is a \nbeautiful lady, and they took her into captivity, pulled her hair out \nby the roots, and ran through the streets of Abidjan, holding up her \nhair in their hands. They are murdering everyone who is a friend of \nthat administration.\n  Well, I have one plea right now. There are a lot of options on what \nthey can do. They can murder the President and First Lady--and they are \nconsidering that now. They are trying to consider some way to make it \nlook like suicide. I don't know what they are doing. The State \nDepartment doesn't know what they are doing. Unfortunately, the State \nDepartment doesn't even care what they are doing.\n  One of the options would be to allow the President and the First Lady \nand some who are close to go to another country in Sub-Saharan Africa \nand be able to stay in that country. We have already located host \ncountries to allow that to take place.\n  So I am making an appeal right now. I can't get the Secretary of \nState to talk to me about it. I can't get anyone else but just a \nhandful of people, but we need to do something and do something now--\ntoday. If we wait until after this recess, I would almost say their \nblood will be on the hands of the State Department because we can do \nsomething about it now. All we have to do is encourage the new, \nillegitimately elected President of Cote d'Ivoire--Alassane Ouattara--\nand his administration to give an opportunity for another state to host \nthese two individuals. Quite frankly, I think that would be a very \nsmart thing politically for him to do because with the other two \noptions, we all know what happens. We know what martyrs are, and that \nis what would happen.\n  So this is, I guess, a final appeal to anyone who is sensitive to the \ntorturing, raping, and murdering that is going on today to join me in \nencouraging the State Department, the United Nations, France, and \nAlassane Ouattara to turn over President and Mrs. Gbagbo to a host \ncountry for their asylum.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            Oil Speculation\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we have all heard the phrase \n``drill, baby, drill.'' Well, it is interesting that the pro-oil \ncompany folks think that all of our answers have to do with drilling \nbecause, lo and behold, we have actually increased our domestic \nproduction. Let me quote from a Reuters story from May 25:\n\n       Crude oil production, especially in the deep waters of the \n     Gulf of Mexico, increased by 334,000 barrels per day between \n     2005 and 2010, which also cut into foreign oil purchases.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the article goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n\n       Imports of crude and petroleum products accounted for 49.3 \n     percent of the U.S. oil demand last year, down from the high \n     of 60.3 percent in 2005. It also marked the first time since \n     1997 that America's foreign oil addiction fell under the 50 \n     percent threshold.\n\n  Now, that is worth noting. That is really something because the trend \nis reversing. Maybe it is that we are getting more energy conscious. \nMaybe it is that we are expending less gasoline in our vehicles because \nof the higher miles-per-gallon standards. Maybe we are remembering to \nturn off the lights when we leave the room. Maybe we are being a lot \nmore sensitive to how vulnerable we are because we depend--as we have \nin the past--on upwards of 60 to 70 percent of our daily consumption \nfrom foreign shores, places such as Nigeria and the Persian Gulf and \nVenezuela.\n  Now, I have just named three very unstable parts of the world that \ncould, at any moment, cut off that production. So maybe America is \nfinally waking up to the fact that, lo and behold, we have to be \nconcerned about our energy sources and not depend so much on foreign \nproduction.\n  The mantra ``drill, baby, drill'' implies that if we just continue to \ndrill--in places where we can drill domestically--that is going to \nsolve our problem. But that ignores the fact that it takes about 10 \nyears to take an oilfield and get it into production. So that doesn't \nsolve our problem now as we are facing these high gas prices. That is \nwhat I want to talk about, the high gas prices.\n  We ought to drill where we should. A lot of people do not know that \nof the 37 million acres that are leased in the Gulf of Mexico only 7 \nmillion are drilled. There are 37 million acres leased in the Gulf of \nMexico, but only 7 million of those 37 million acres are drilled. So \nlet's do drill, baby, drill. Let's drill on all those leases, those 30 \nmillion acres in the gulf and elsewhere that are existing leases and \nthat haven't been drilled.\n  But it is not the world oil market and the U.S. consumption that is \ncausing these gas prices to go up. There are other factors, and I want \nto talk about that as well. It is true there are new demands on oil \nconsumption from burgeoning countries such as China and India, and that \ncauses more oil to be consumed from the world marketplace. But remember \nwhat I just cited; that the United States is lowering its consumption \nof imported oil. So that is clearly not a factor affecting the price of \noil worldwide or the price at the pump we pay for the refined gasoline.\n  No, there is another reason. That reason happens to be the \nspeculators who are out there running up the price on commodity \nexchanges for oil futures contracts. Those prices run up until they are \nready to dump them, and then suddenly they go down.\n  I want to call the attention of the Senate to a New York Times story \nfrom May 24--just a couple of days ago--entitled ``U.S. Suit Sees \nManipulation of Oil Trades.'' Let me quote from the article.\n\n       The suit says that in early 2008 they tried to hoard nearly \n     two-thirds of the available supply of a crucial American \n     market for crude oil, then abruptly dumped it and improperly \n     pocketed $50 million.\n\n  So the Federal commodities regulators filed a civil lawsuit against \ntwo obscure traders in Australia and California and three American and \ninternational firms. This was in the context of 3 years ago, in 2008, \nwhen oil prices had surged past $100 a barrel. There were those \nsuspicions then that traders had manipulated the market, and that \nultimately has led to a number of commentaries and investigations.\n  Well, the regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have \nnow filed this suit, and they are looking into the fraud being utilized \nin these oil and gas markets, particularly the commodity futures \nmarkets.\n  In the past months, I have come to the Senate floor several times to \ndiscuss the net result of all of this, which is what we pay at the \npump, and how it directly links to these oil speculators and the game \nthey play in running up the price of oil. Using the data from the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and price data from the Energy \nInformation Administration, we have shown on this floor in speech after \nspeech--until I am blue in the face--the direct link between the rising \nlevel of speculators and their speculation in our energy markets and \nthe skyrocketing oil and gas prices.\n  When the top executives of the five largest oil companies in the \nUnited States testified a week ago in our Senate Finance Committee on \nwhat role speculation played in the oil markets, I asked them to please \nexplain why gas prices are remaining so high when oil prices have begun \nto fall. Madam President, you should have heard the mumbling around \nthat followed. The truth is, speculators, whether they are active \ntraders or passive investors, have hijacked our oil markets in recent \nyears, and the American people are the ones who are suffering the \nconsequences because the price of that gas goes up when we pump it into \nour cars.\n  Oil prices are set in futures markets, such as those regulated by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. Futures contracts--meaning we buy \na contract of oil at a specified price to be delivered at a future \ndate--allow oil producers to lock in prices on their future output. \nThose contracts also allow large consumers of fuel, such as airlines, \nto lock in a price as a hedge against inflation and that future price \nswinging way up.\n  The futures markets were intended to bring actual producers and real \nconsumers of oil together, and, in doing so, the supply would match the \ndemand. Speculators then were allowed to play a limited role to ensure \nthere was sufficient liquidity in the market. But then here is what \nhappens--and this is what happened back in 2008 when the price of gas \nwent so high. Speculators constitute now anywhere from two-thirds to 80 \npercent of the market. They are no longer a bit player, they are the \nmain player, and this is what we need to end.\n\n  In last year's financial reform bill, we directed the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission to set hard limits on the speculative \npositions. We gave them a deadline of last January 21. Now we are here \nmonths past the deadline, but the CFTC has not yet finalized a rule.\n  Why should they do this? If you are a legitimate user of oil--say, an \nairline--you have every reason to want to hedge against the price of \nthat oil going way up, so you buy a contract for delivery of oil at a \nspecified price at a future date. But if you are a speculator--buying \nand selling oil futures contracts, having no intention to use the oil, \nhaving only to put as a downpayment a bare percentage of the total \ncontract price--you can manipulate that price upwards by buying and \nselling those contracts. This is exactly what happened back in 2008. It \nis what is happening again, as we have seen the price of a barrel of \noil go up and up.\n  We passed the law last year. The Commission has the authority. We \nshould not have to pass another law that requires them to do it, but if \nthe CFTC cannot get the job done, then we are going to have to. That is \nthe bottom line.\n  The American people are outraged. Here America is lowering its \nconsumption of oil, here America is lowering its imports of oil, here \nwe are getting more energy conscious, and yet the price of gas keeps \ngoing up. It is time to put an end to this.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in a few minutes my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nCardin, will be introducing a bill which I am a cosponsor of, along \nwith a large bipartisan group of our colleagues. I wish to emphasize at \nthe outset that some may characterize this legislation as anti-Russian. \nIn fact, I believe it is pro-Russian. It is pro the people of Russia. \nIt is pro the people who stand up for human rights and democracy in \nthat country which, unfortunately, seems to be sadly deprived of.\n  This legislation, as my colleague and friend Senator Cardin will \ndescribe, requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \nSecretary of the Treasury, to publish a list of each person whom our \ngovernment has reason\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\nto believe was responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei \nMagnitsky; participated in efforts to conceal the legal liability for \nthese crimes; committed those acts of fraud that Magnitsky uncovered; \nis responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross \nviolations of human rights committed against individuals seeking to \nexpose illegal activities in Russia or exercise other universally \nrecognized human rights.\n  Second, the individuals on that list would become the target of an \narray of penalties, among them, ineligibility to receive a visa to \ntravel. They would have their current visas revoked, their assets would \nbe frozen that are under U.S. jurisdiction, and U.S. financial \ninstitutions would be required to audit themselves to ensure that none \nof these individuals are able to bank excess funds and move money in \nthe U.S. financial system.\n  I guess the first question many people will be asking is who was \nSergei Magnitsky? Who was this individual who has aroused such outrage \nand anger throughout the world? He was a tax attorney. He was a tax \nattorney working for an international company called Hermitage Capital \nthat had invested in Russia. He didn't spend his life as a human rights \nactivist or an outspoken critic of the Russian Government. He was an \nordinary man. But he became an extraordinary champion of justice, \nfairness, and the rule of law in Russia where those principles, \nfrankly, have lost meaning.\n  What Sergei Magnitsky did was he uncovered a collection of Russian \nGovernment officials and criminals who were associated with the Russian \nGovernment officials who colluded to defraud the Russian state of $230 \nmillion. The Russian Government in turn blamed the crime on Heritage \nCapital and threw Magnitsky in prison in 2008.\n  Magnitsky was detained for 11 months without trial. Russian \nofficials, especially from the Interior Ministry, pressured Magnitsky \nto deny what he had uncovered--to lie and to recant. He refused. He was \nsickened by what his government had done and he refused to surrender \nprinciple to brute power.\n  As a result, he was transferred to increasingly more severe and more \nhorrific prison conditions. He was forced to eat unclean food and \nwater. He was denied basic medical care as his health worsened. In \nfact, he was placed in even worse conditions until, on November 16, \n2009, having served 358 days in prison, Sergei Magnitsky died. He was \n37 years old.\n  Sergei Magnitsky's torture and murder--let's call it what it really \nwas--is an extreme example of a problem that is unfortunately all too \ncommon and widespread in Russia today: the flagrant violations of the \nrule of law and basic human rights committed by the Russian Government \nitself, along with its allies.\n  I note the presence of my colleague and lead sponsor of this \nimportant legislation. I hope in his remarks perhaps my friend from \nMaryland would mention the latest in the last few days which was the \naffirmation of the incredible sentence on Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky and \nhis associate which is, in many ways, tantamount to a death sentence; \nagain, one of these blatant abuses of justice and an example of the \ncorruption that exists at the highest level of government.\n  I wish to say again I appreciate the advocacy of my colleague from \nMaryland and his steadfast efforts on behalf of human rights in Russia, \nBelarus, and other countries. It has been a great honor to work with \nhim and for him in bringing this important resolution to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the appropriate time, the Senator \nfrom Maryland and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator McCain, not just for \ntaking time for this colloquy concerning Mr. Magnitsky but for his \nlongstanding commitment to justice issues, human rights issues, and the \nvalues the United States represents internationally.\n  We have had a long, proud, bipartisan, and, most importantly, \nsuccessful record of promoting basic American values such as democratic \ngovernance and the rule of law around the world. Engaging the countries \nof the Eastern Bloc in matters such as respect for human rights was \ncritical to winning the cold war. We will never know how many lives \nwere improved and even saved due to instruments such as the Helsinki \nFinal Act and the Jackson-Vanik amendment. These measures defined an \nera of human rights activism that ultimately pried open the Iron \nCurtain and brought down the Wall. Thankfully, the cold war is over and \nwe have a stronger relationship, both at the governmental and societal \nlevels, with countries in Eastern Europe. But, sadly, internationally \nrecognized rights and freedoms continue to be trampled and, in many \ncases, with absolute impunity.\n  With the possibility of Russia's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization, and the Presidents of the United States and Russia \nmeeting in France, ours is a timely discussion.\n  Last week, I joined my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nArizona, and 14 other Senators from both parties to introduce the \nSergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act--a broad bill to \naddress what the respected watchdog Transparency International dubbed a \n``systematically corrupted country'' and to create consequences for \nthose who are currently getting away with murder.\n  Actions always speak louder than words. The diplomatic manner of \ndealing with human rights abuses has frequently been to condemn the \nabusers, often publicly, with the hope that these statements will be \nall they need to do. They say oh, yes, we are against these human \nrights violations. We are for the rule of law. We are for people being \nable to come forward and tell us about problems and be able to correct \nthings. They condemn the abusers, but they take no action. They think \ntheir words will be enough. Well, we know differently. We know what is \nhappening today in Russia.\n  We know the tragedy of Sergei Magnitsky was not an isolated episode. \nThis is not the only time this has happened. My colleague from Arizona \nmentioned the Mikhail Khodorkovsky case. Mr. Khodorkovsky is today in \nprison with even a longer sentence. Why? Because he had the courage to \nstand up and oppose the corrupt system in Russia and something should \nbe done about it. That is why he is in prison, and that is wrong.\n  So it is time we do something about this and that we make it clear \nthat action is needed. For too long, the leaders in Russia have said we \nare going to investigate what happened to Sergei Magnitsky. We think it \nis terrible he died in prison without getting adequate medical care. As \nSenator McCain pointed out, here is a person whose only crime was to \nbring to the proper attention of officials public corruption within \nRussia. As a result of his whistleblowing, he was arrested and thrown \nin jail and died in jail. He was tortured. That cannot be allowed, to \njust say, Oh, that is terrible. We know the people who were \nresponsible. In some cases they have been promoted in their public \npositions. Well, it is time for us to take action. That is why we have \nintroduced this legislation.\n  While this bill goes far beyond the tragic experiences of Sergei \nMagnitsky, it does bear his name, so let me refresh everyone's \nrecollection with some of the circumstances concerning his death. I \nmention this because some might say, why are we talking about one \nperson? But as the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin said, ``One death is a \ntragedy; one million is a statistic.'' I rarely agree with Dictator \nStalin, but we have to put a human face on the issue. People have to \nunderstand that these are real people and real lives that have been \nruined forever as a result of the abuses within Russia.\n  Sergei was a skilled tax lawyer who was well known in Moscow among \nmany Western companies, large and small. In fact, he even did some \naccounting for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. Working at the \nAmerican law firm of Firestone Duncan, Sergei uncovered the largest \nknown tax fraud in modern Russian history and blew the whistle on the \nswindling of his fellow citizens by corrupt officials. For that he was \npromptly arrested by the subordinates of those he implicated in the \ncrime. He was held under torturous conditions in detention for nearly a \nyear without trial or\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nvisits from family. He developed severe medical complications which \nwent deliberately untreated, and he died on November 16, 2009, alone in \nan isolation cell while prison doctors waited outside his door. Sergei \nwas 37 years old. He left behind a wife, two sons, a dependent mother, \nand so many friends.\n  Shortly after his death, Philip Pan of the Washington Post wrote:\n\n       Magnitsky's complaints, made public by his attorneys as he \n     composed them, went unanswered while he lived. But in a \n     nation where millions perished in the Soviet gulag, the words \n     of the 37-year-old tax lawyer struck a nerve after he died . \n     . . his descriptions of the squalid conditions he endured \n     have been splashed on the front pages of newspapers and \n     discussed on radio and television across the country, part of \n     an outcry even his supporters never expected.\n\n  I think Senator McCain and I would agree, there is a thirst for \ndemocracy around the world. People in Russia want more. They want \nfreedom. They want accountability. They want honest government \nofficials. They are outraged by what happened to Sergei Magnitsky.\n  I would point out just last week I met with a leader of the Russian \nbusiness community who came here and traveled at some risk, I might \nsay. Just visiting me was a risk. We have people from Russia who are \nbeing questioned because they come and talk to us. But he said to me \nthat what happened here needs to be answered by the Russian \nauthorities. He understands why we are introducing this legislation.\n  A year after his death, and with no one held accountable, and some of \nthose implicated even promoted and decorated, The Economist noted:\n\n       At the time, few people outside the small world of Russian \n     investors and a few human-rights activists had heard of Mr. \n     Magnitsky. A year later, his death has become a symbol of the \n     mind-boggling corruption and injustice perpetrated by the \n     Russian system, and the inability of the Kremlin to change \n     it.\n\n  Regrettably, we know Sergei's case, egregious as it is, is not \nisolated. Human rights abuses continue unpunished and often unknown \nacross Russia today.\n  To make this point more clear, let's look at another example far \noutside the financial districts of Moscow and St. Petersburg in the \nNorth Caucasus in southern Russia where Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, \ncondones and oversees massive violations of human rights, including \nviolations of religious freedom and the rights of women. His militia \nalso violates international humanitarian laws. As of this April, the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights has ruled against Russia in 186 cases \nconcerning Chechnya, most involving civilians.\n  So Sergei Magnitsky's case is not an isolated case of abuse by the \nRussian authorities. There has been a systematic effort made to deny \npeople their basic human rights, including one individual, Natalia \nEstemirova, who personally visited my office at the Helsinki \nCommission. She was a courageous human rights defender who was brutally \nassassinated.\n  So it is time for Russia to take action. But we cannot wait; we need \nto take action.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield back to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank my colleague from Maryland for a very \neloquent and, I think, very strong statement, to which I can add very \nlittle. But isn't it true, I ask my friend, that this Magnitsky case \nand the Khodorkovsky case, which I would like for us to talk a little \nbit more about, are not isolated incidents?\n  In other words, this is the face of the problem in Russia today. As \nthe Senator mentioned, in its annual index of perceptions of \ncorruption, Transparency International ranked Russia 154th out of 178 \ncountries--perceived as more corrupt than Pakistan, Yemen, and \nZimbabwe. The World Bank considers 122 countries to be better places to \ndo business than Russia. One of those countries is Georgia, which the \nWorld Bank ranks as the 12th best country to do business.\n  In other words, isn't it true in the Magnitsky case, it is what has \nbeen taking place all across Russia, including this incredible story of \nKhodorkovsky, who was one of the wealthiest men in Russia, one of the \nwealthiest oligarchs who rebelled against this corruption because he \nsaw the long-term consequences of this kind of corruption and was \nbrought to trial, convicted, and then, when his sentence was completed, \nthey charged him again?\n  Talk about a corrupt system, isn't it true that Vladimir Putin said \nhe should ``sit in jail,'' and we now know that the whole trial was \nrigged, as revealed by people who were part of the whole trial? In \nother words, isn't it true, I would ask my friend from Maryland, that \nwhat we are talking about is one human tragedy, but it is a tragedy \nthat is unfolding throughout Russia that we do not really have any \nknowledge of? And if we allow this kind of abuse to go on unresponded \nto, then, obviously, we are abrogating our responsibilities to the \nworld; isn't that true?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I say to Senator McCain, you are absolutely right. This \nis not isolated. Magnitsky is not an isolated case of a lawyer doing \nhis job on behalf of a client and being abused by the authorities. We \nhave a lot of examples of lawyers trying to do their jobs and being \nintimidated and their rights violated.\n  But in Mr. Khodorkovsy's case, we have a business leader who was \ntreated the same way just because he was a successful business leader. \nEven worse, he happened to be an opponent of the powers in the Kremlin.\n  So we are now seeing, in Russia, where they want to quell opposition \nby arresting people who are just speaking their minds, doing their \nbusiness legally, putting them in prison, trying them, and in the \nKhodorkovsky case actually increasing their sentences the more they \nspeak out against the regime.\n  That is how authoritarian they want to be and how oppressive they are \nto human rights. But I could go further. If one is a journalist in \nRussia, and they try to do any form of independent journalism, they are \nin danger of being beaten, being imprisoned, being murdered. It is very \nintimidating. The list goes on and on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleague, what implications, if any, does \nthe Senator from Maryland believe this should have on the Russian entry \ninto the World Trade Organization?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Well, it is very interesting, I say to Senator McCain. I \njust came from a Senate Finance Committee hearing, and we were talking \nabout a free-trade agreement. I am for free-trade agreements. I think \nit makes sense. It is funny, when a country wants to do trade with the \nUnited States, they all of a sudden understand they have to look at \ntheir human rights issues.\n  I think all of us would like to see Russia part of the international \ntrade community. I would like to see Russia, which is already a member \nof a lot of international organizations, live up to the commitments \nthey have made in joining these international organizations.\n  But it is clear to me that Russia needs to reform. If we are going to \nhave business leaders traveling to Russia in order to do business, I \nwant to make sure they are safe in Russia. I want to make sure they are \ngoing to get the protection of the rule of law in Russia. I want to \nmake sure there are basic rights that the businesspeople in Russia and \nthe United States can depend upon.\n  So, yes, I understand that Russia would like to get into the WTO. We \nhave, of course, the Jackson-Vanik amendment that still applies. I \nunderstand the origin of that law, and I understand what needs to \nchange in order for Russia to be able to join the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  But I will tell you this: The best thing that Russia can do in order \nto be able to enter the international trade regime is to clean up its \nabuses in its own country, to make clear it respects the rule of law; \nthat businesspeople will be protected under the rule of law and \ncertainly not imprisoned and tortured, as in the cases of Mr. \nKhodorkovsky and Mr. Magnitsky. We do not want to see that type of \nconduct.\n  If Russia would do that, if they would reform their systems, then I \nthink we would be a long way toward that type of integration and trade.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Maryland for an eloquent \nstatement about the situation as regards\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nRussia. I thank him, and I can assure my colleague from Maryland that, \nas we speak, this will provide--and this legislation which he has \nintroduced, will provide--some encouragement to people who in Russia \nnow, in some cases, have lost almost all hope because of the corruption \nof the judicial system, as well as other aspects of the Russian nation.\n  We all know that no democracy can function without the rule of law; \nand if there are ever two examples of the corruption of the rule of \nlaw, it is the tragedy of Sergei Magnitsky and, of course, Mr. \nKhodorkovsky, who still languishes in prison; who, in his words, \nbelieves he--by the extension of his prison sentence--may have been \ngiven a death sentence.\n  So I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield for just one final comment?\n  I think the Senator is right on target as to what he has said. I \nappreciate the Senator bringing this to the attention of our colleagues \nin the Senate.\n  I will respond to one other point because I am sure my colleague \nheard this. Some Russian officials say: Why are we concerned with the \ninternal affairs of another country? I just want to remind these \nRussian officials, I want to remind my colleagues here, that Russia has \nsigned on to the Helsinki Final Act. They did that in 1975, and they \nhave agreed to the consensus document that was issued in Moscow in 1991 \nand reaffirmed just last year with the heads of state meeting in \nAstana, Kazakhstan, just this past December. I am going to quote from \nthat document:\n\n       The participating States--\n\n  Which Russia is a participating state--\n\n     emphasize that issues relating to human rights, fundamental \n     freedoms, democracy and the rule of law are of international \n     concern, as respect for these rights and freedoms constitutes \n     one of the foundations of international order. They \n     categorically and irrevocably declared that the commitments \n     undertaken in the field of the human dimension are matters of \n     direct and legitimate concern to all participating States--\n\n  The United States is a participating state--\n\n     and do not belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the \n     State concerned.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. That was a statement by the Government of Russia?\n  Mr. CARDIN. That was a statement made by the 56 states of the OSCE at \na meeting of the Heads of State, which happens about every 10 years. It \njust happened to have happened last year. Russia participated in \ndrafting this statement. Russia was there, signed on to it, and said: \nWe agree on this. It is a reaffirmation as to what they agreed to in \n1991 in Moscow where we acknowledged that it is of international \ninterest, and we have an obligation and right to question when a member \nstate violates those basic human dimension commitments. Russia clearly \nhas done that. We have not only the right but the obligation to raise \nthat, and I just wanted to underscore that to my colleagues.\n  I say to Senator McCain, your comments on the Senate floor are so \nmuch on point. I think people understand it. They understand the basic \nhuman aspect to this. But sometimes they ask: Well, why should America \nbe concerned? Do we have a legitimate right to question this? Russia \nsigned the document that acknowledges our right to challenge this and \nraise these issues.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I hope we would \nget, very rapidly, another 98 cosponsors.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have been engaged in a very important \ndebate on our budget over the last few days, and this debate will \ncontinue over the next several weeks, indeed, for probably several \nmonths. It is not a new debate. Like past debates, at the heart of it \nare important programs to middle-income Americans, such as Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. In some quarters, they are under attack. \nThis does not have to be the case.\n  In the 1990s, Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, with \na Democratic President, were able to deal with this issue of deficits \nwhile preserving these programs and strengthening, indeed, in many \ncases, these programs. We were able to also provide the kind of \neconomic growth that generated job creation, not just increased GDP or \nincreased profits on Wall Street, but jobs on Main Street.\n  Much of these efforts were, frankly, undone, beginning in 2000 with \ntax cuts that did not, as advertised, produce the kind of private \nemployment growth that was necessary for our economy, that shifted the \nburden to middle-income taxpayers, while giving the wealthiest \nAmericans extraordinary relief and unfunded entitlement programs, such \nas Medicare Part D and two major conflicts, none of which were paid \nfor.\n  So now we, once again, face a situation where we have a significant \ndeficit, and we need to address it. President Obama has begun that \nprocess with the same commitment to maintaining Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security, not without reforms and strengthening, but making sure \nthat middle-income Americans and all Americans can have access to these \nvital programs.\n  We have taken significant steps in the long run to reform our health \ncare system with the Affordable Care Act.\n  We hope that act is implemented efficiently and effectively so we can \nbegin to realize long-term savings to bend the proverbial cost curve of \nour health programs, not just our Federal health care programs but our \nhealth care costs across the board that are borne by private insurers \nas well as private programs.\n  In fact, ironically, it seems to me that one of the major \naccelerators of the Medicare Program is the fact that so many \nAmericans--about 40 million--do not have access to consistent quality \nhealth care now. Yet, when they turn 65, by right they have access to a \npanoply of services. I have had discussions with doctors, and they will \ntell me that they say several times a day to their new Medicare \npatients: I wish I saw you 10 years ago because I would not have to \napply the expensive diagnostic and treatment. I could have done \nsomething much easier, much less costly if you had coverage and access.\n  So that is one of the long-term efforts we have underway, but we have \nto do a lot more to go ahead and deal with the issues before us.\n  We have seen Republican budget proposals, but frankly I do not think \nthey strengthen the middle class here in the United States, nor do they \nprovide the kind of sensible investment that will lead to job creation \nand provide the opportunities that are necessary for succeeding \ngenerations in America. I think they are more dedicated to an \nideological commitment to simply reduce taxes, and that is something \nthat has to be tested and should be tested in the history of the last \nseveral years. That was the same argument that was made in 2001, that \nsuch tax cuts would generate huge growth in private employment, unleash \nhuge economic forces here in the United States, and frankly, over the \nlast 10 years, that has not been the case.\n  So I think we have to be sensible. I think we have to address the tax \nreforms and tax reductions to middle-income Americans, not continue to \nfavor the richest Americans, when it comes to tax proposals. So much of \nwhat the Republican budget seems to do is continue what they started in \n2001--huge relief for the wealthiest Americans. But it is increasingly \nputting the burden on Middle America. In fact, it has been estimated \nthat under the Republican budget, individuals making over $1 million \nwould receive an average tax cut of $125,000 a year. That is a huge cut \nrelative to whatever a working, middle-income American might receive.\n  One of the other aspects of this budget is the impact it would have \non Medicare. Medicare is central to every family in the country. In \nfact, look around at not just someone who is earning a wage hour by \nhour, but look at the small businessperson, a man or a woman. Their \nretirement plan rests on the assumption that they will have access to \nMedicare. The Republican's proposal, as I understand it, essentially\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nends that for individuals who are about 55 years old or younger. Well, \nin the next 10-plus years or so, they are going to have to come up with \na lot of money to pay for the Medicare they assumed they would receive \nautomatically when they retire at 65. That is not just the wage earner, \nthe hourly worker who goes in there; that is the small businessperson \nwhose postretirement plan rests fundamentally on Medicare and them \nbeing able to buy a supplemental health care plan to that.\n  So these are fundamental and, in fact, earth-shattering proposals, in \nmy view.\n  Currently, seniors on traditional Medicare pay approximately $1,700 \nin annual premiums. They are charged a limited amount for every \nhospital stay, have a reasonable deductible for every major procedure \nand treatment, and pay copays for services and prescription drugs. They \nare even able to buy, as I alluded to, these Medigap plans so they can \nsupplement what Medicare provides with additional resources, and these \nsupplemental plans are very affordable. On average, Medicare then \nspends $11,762 on every senior, and that is just an average.\n  But this would all change, and it would inject a huge amount of \nuncertainty if the budget that is proposed by Republicans, that is \nstill being debated by the Republicans, that is still being supported \nin many cases by Republicans is in any way enacted.\n  In the year 2022, under the proposal, if the Republican budget were \nenacted, every senior who becomes eligible for what we now call \nMedicare would be given $8,000 to address all their health care needs \nand then sent to the marketplace to buy health care private insurance.\n  Now, I guess I have reached a point in my life where I can reflect \nand remember that as a youngster in the 1950s, there was, in \npractically every one of my friends' homes, a grandparent who was there \nbecause they didn't have access to Medicare or Medicaid.\n  They were in a hospital bed in the living room or in some other room. \nThey were being cared for by typically the mother, who was also trying \nto care for youngsters such as myself and my contemporaries. The reason \nwas, regardless of how much money you have, at some point, insurance \ncompanies will not sell you insurance. You are old. You had health \nexperiences prior to that. You are a bad risk, and they are not in the \nbusiness of insuring bad risks. That was, as much as anything, the \ngenesis of Medicare--the recognition that the private health care \nmarket would not, regardless of the ability to pay, provide adequate \ncoverage. And I think we have forgotten that.\n  When the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization, \nlooked at the proposal, they essentially concluded that with this \n$8,000 transfer to a senior in lieu of traditional Medicare, the senior \nwould be on the hook for an additional $12,500 in health care costs. In \nfact, it would likely result in some seniors not even getting health \ncare insurance at all, not being able to afford it or at some point, \nparticularly as they aged, getting to the point where no one would \nwrite them health care insurance because of the obvious health risks \nthey were.\n  So this is a plan that I don't think comports with the reality of \nAmericans who have already planned to have access to Medicare and also \nthe reality that what is proposed--an $8,000 transfer payment to an \ninsurance company--would be inadequate to provide the kind of minimum \ncoverage we should be providing to our seniors.\n  We have had examples before where particular Republicans would \npropose that they had a new, novel way to provide private health care \ninsurance in lieu of traditional Medicare. When Medicare Advantage was \nestablished in 2003, seniors had the option of enrolling in private \nhealth insurance plans that were argued by their advocates as being \ncost-effective, as putting pressure on the public health care plan \nknown as Medicaid. Madam President, 60,000 seniors in my State of Rhode \nIsland enrolled. Private Medicare Advantage plans sell consumers on \nadditional benefits and smaller copays. They went out--very \nselectively, I suspect--recruiting seniors in a way that they hoped \nattracted the healthiest seniors, not the sickest seniors, to lower \ntheir costs. However, in reality, most of these plans tended to cost \nmore than traditional Medicare as the smaller copays were largely \noffset by higher monthly premiums.\n  So there are those who are still seriously proposing this Republican \napproach to Medicare. I think it will be a mistake. I think it would \nreduce access to health care coverage for seniors. I do not think the \nprivate market will jump up with $8,000. I do not think you will see \nthat Congresses in the future will escalate the cost of these vouchers \nor transfers to private insurance companies in any way that would be \ncommensurate to the real cost seniors would face.\n  As a result, I think this proposal will do serious harm to health \ncare and particularly to the middle-income American who, regardless of \nwhether they are running a small business or working for an hourly \nwage, will now face the prospect of the great uncertainty, the great \nunknown of no adequate health care coverage when they reach 65. We will \ngo back in time to the period of my youth where, quite frankly, seniors \ndid not have the kind of health care coverage they have today and I \nbelieve the kind of health care coverage they deserve.\n  With respect to Medicaid, there are also proposals here and the \nthought that Medicaid is just a program for children and poor \nAmericans. But, frankly, if you look at the statistics, there are \n26,000 seniors in my State who are on Medicaid, principally because of \nnursing home care. And we have to ask ourselves, if these plans to \nprovide block grants to States are enacted under the Republican \nproposal, whether those seniors still can maintain themselves in these \nnursing facilities, whether the costs will be so great on the States \nthat they will be unable to keep up the level of effort, the level of \nsupport they are today.\n  What seems to be inherent in all of those proposals is not savings \nbut shifting costs, not reforming the system to be more efficient and \nmore effective but simply shifting the cost onto seniors, shifting the \ncost onto particularly middle-income Americans.\n  So, I am pleased that we did not accept these Republican budget \nproposals, which are the wrong way to address our budget issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for allowing me to go first. I will be relatively brief.\n  I have spoken on the floor on a number of occasions regarding my \nfrustration about the Senate not spending enough time debating what I \nthink is the key, essential issue and challenge facing us, probably \ngreater than any other challenge facing this body in a long time. My \nfrustration only grew yesterday as we voted down four budget proposals.\n  You know, it has been 757 days since we have passed a budget in this \nbody, and so far, no budget has been proposed this year out of the \nBudget Committee for us to examine. The President offered up a budget \nearlier this year that would have spent more, taxed more and borrowed \nmore. It was voted down last night in what I think probably was a \nhistoric vote. I did not go back and check the records, but I am not \naware of any budget that has ever been presented by the executive \nbranch to the Congress for approval that has not received at least some \nvotes.\n  The vote last evening was 97 to 0 against the President's budget. It \nis almost unthinkable that a President--the executive branch--would \nsend a budget to the floor to be debated and voted upon and not achieve \none vote. I think what it tells us is that, obviously, that budget was \nnot designed to gain any kind of bipartisan support. But it didn't even \nobtain any partisan support.\n  It was not taken seriously, at a time when we need to have in front \nof us a serious budget to debate and vote on. As I said, there have \nbeen 757 days without a budget before us. You cannot run a company, a \nfamily, or run anything, unless you prepare a budget and avoid going \ninto debt. That is where we are today.\n  Republicans did come forward with three proposals. Unfortunately, all \nof those were voted down. You can argue that none of those three were \nsufficient\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nto garner enough support. All three received a significant level of \nsupport--particularly two of them. Yet there were not enough votes to \npass this body. So while the House has passed a budget, which we voted \non yesterday, but unfortunately fell short, these are the only \nproposals we have had in front of us to debate. These are the only \nproposals we have had to vote on and set the structure for how we are \ngoing to spend the taxpayers' money.\n  So here we are now approaching the month of June, 5 months into the \ncurrent calendar year, and 9 months into the fiscal year, and we still \ndon't have a handle on how we are going to spend the taxpayers' money, \nwhat restrictions and restraints we will put on that, and how we can \nlive within our means.\n  This is the debate this Congress should undertake, and it has not \nbeen undertaken. Many of us have come to the floor in situations such \nas this where we have asked for some time to speak, but the issue \nitself has not been put before us. We know there are negotiations going \non relative to how to put a plan into place, but we are a long way from \nthat.\n  I am here once again to try to urge my colleagues to work together \nand try to achieve a result--or at least a product on which we can have \nserious debate to determine the future of how we are going to spend the \ntaxpayers' dollars in a responsible way. The most important factor we \nhave to address is the need, in my opinion, to rein in Washington's \nexcessive spending. The bottom line is that government spending is out \nof control. The public understands this. I think the response in 2010 \nto those of us who were running in all the elections sent an \nunmistakable, long, loud, easily understood signal: We have too much \ngovernment, we cannot afford the government we have, and we cannot \ncontinue to add even more government, which pushes us deeper into debt.\n  Nearly $1.4 trillion of our spending is discretionary spending that \nrequires us to borrow money. That borrowed money increases our debt \nobligation reinforcing the need to rein in our spending. This is \nsomething we should debate, something that is part of the \nresponsibility of the Congress and Senate. When we are talking about \naddressing a national debt of over $14 trillion, we need to get \nserious. A little nick here, a little nick there in spending reductions \nwill not solve the problem. We need to look at the larger picture. We \nare staring down $14.3 trillion in debt. Credit ratings by Standard & \nPoor's have downgraded the outlook for the U.S. debt, with a negative \nwarning. Economic growth is sputtering across the country. Unemployment \nremains high, and States are dipping deeper into the red, zeroing in on \nbillions--which is a lot of money, but it is only a minuscule amount \ncompared to the trillions we are saddled with in debt that we ought to \nbe addressing. It is time for Congress and the administration to stop \nignoring the obvious. The rapid growth of mandatory spending is \nendangering our financial future.\n  I point to this chart on my left. It simply points out the dramatic \ngrowth that has occurred and will continue to occur over the years in \nthe future. It doesn't take a mathematician--although the math is \npretty simple--when you spend $3.7 trillion a year and take in $2.2 \ntrillion, that leaves you with a big deficit. But it doesn't take a \nmathematician or anybody with any sophistication in economics to \nunderstand that if we stay on the current path, we are going to \ncontinue to see this line escalate. This red on here is red ink. It is \nnet interest we will owe. What does that mean? It means that to \ncontinue borrowing in order to finance what we are doing, we are going \nto have to pay larger and larger rates of interest to the lenders \nbecause of the risks associated with our potential inability to pay \nback the loans we have taken.\n  This flow of red ink, this red tide--if we don't address this, it is \ngoing to make it difficult for Americans to buy cars, pay their \nmortgages, purchase homes, and buy groceries. The prices of products \nwill go higher because the interest rates will go higher. We are \nrunning ourselves into a desperate situation. I think everyone \nunderstands that. I think it has been made clear to the American \npeople.\n  We don't have to spin this whole message here in order to convince \nthe American people we don't have a problem. We do, and they understand \nthat. That is what 2010 was all about. We cannot continue to go forward \nin 2011 without providing any basis of a real solution to assure the \nfinancial world and the people that we are taking steps in order to \naddress this.\n  I think there is a consensus--and if anybody doesn't understand this, \nthey haven't looked at the problem--that we could tax Americans to \ndeath, we can cut discretionary spending by massive amounts, and we \nwon't begin to address the problem we have, unless we address the \nmassive amount of spending on mandatory programs. We don't have control \nover mandatory programs in terms of budgeting; they are simply there, \nand if you are eligible, you get to draw from the program. All of that \nis fine, if you have money to do it. But we are running out of money to \npay those recipients who are continuing to receive benefits from these \nentitlement programs. Unless we address those, we are not going to \nsolve the problem.\n  Let's take a couple of these, and let's look at Medicare. Everybody \nsays this is a political nonstarter. If you dare talk about it, you are \ngoing to get zinged in the next election, and you will be characterized \nas taking away benefits from the elderly, when the plans that have been \nput forward don't do anything of the sort. Nevertheless, it is \nimportant to understand the dimensions of the problem we are facing \nfrom this one entitlement. Over the next 10 years, Medicare spending--\nspending on this one entitlement--is expected to double.\n  A few weeks ago, the Medicare trustees announced that the hospital \ntrust fund would be exhausted by 2024--5 years earlier than estimated \nin last year's report. Who knows what next year's report is going to \ntell us.\n  The bottom line is this program is going to go broke. Failing to \nrestructure Medicare jeopardizes the medical benefits of present and \nfuture elderly Americans. So rather than terminating Medicare, as has \nbeen charged but is not true, rather than destroying Medicare, which \nhas been charged but is not true, what we are trying to do is find a \nway to restructure it in a way that Medicare will be viable and solvent \nso benefits will be available for future retirees.\n  When Medicare was first enacted in 1967, the program cost $2.5 \nbillion. At that time, Congress predicted that the program would cost \n$12 billion by 1990. That wasn't the case. We underestimated it just a \nbit--by $86 billion, which is more than just a bit. When it starts at \n$2.5 billion, and you project it will be $12 billion, and you ended up \nbeing off on that estimate by $86 billion, you have to start asking \nyourself some questions. You have to start thinking that maybe we got \nthis formula wrong, or maybe our assumptions didn't turn out as we \nthought they were going to on the cost of Medicare.\n  Today, Medicare is roughly $494 billion, with approximately $89.3 \ntrillion in total unfunded liabilities. These are staggering numbers. \nThey are numbers beyond our ability to comprehend. These numbers are \nbeyond our ability to sustain.\n  There is no possible way on Earth, no matter how fast or how hard we \ngrow, that we can reach solvency in the Medicare Program without any \naction. Why? Because after World War II, soldiers came home, and people \nhad deferred having families, and the so-called baby boom generation \nwas born. It has moved through our entire history, over the last 60 \nyears or so, like a pig moves through a python. Early on, there was a \nrush to provide housing for soldiers and their families. There was a \nmassive infusion of money into baby cribs and the need for hospitals \nand doctors and nurses to deliver children.\n\n  A few years later, all of a sudden, we had to build a massive number \nof new elementary schools. As this baby boom has moved through their \nlifespan, we have seen dramatic impacts on the economy--many of them \npositive. But the colleges that had to be expanded and built, and \nuniversities and training facilities, and the education that had to be \nprovided, the employment that needed to be provided--all of this has \nhad a dramatic impact on our economy. We have known for decades that \neventually the pig moving through the python was going to reach the \npoint of\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\nretirement, and when it reached the point of retirement, it was going \nto have an enormous impact on our finances.\n  Instead of anticipating this coming and putting into place structural \nplans that would accommodate the needs, legitimate needs of those for \nretirement income and benefits, we have instead ignored this reality. \nWe have pushed it down the road. Nobody wanted to touch it. Election \nafter election, it was said we better postpone that debate for the next \nelection because it is too hot to deal with now. Well, it is all coming \nundone. We are at the point almost of no return.\n  The proposals that have been put forward--you may not agree with \nevery portion of them, and I don't. But the House brought to us a \nbudget plan. You have to give Paul Ryan a great deal of credit for the \nextraordinary amount of work and effort he put into it. Maybe you don't \nlike all of it, but it is at least a plan to debate, modify, and \nadjust; it is something that gives us an opportunity to start down the \npath of paying off our debt, of maintaining solvency for the Medicare \nProgram.\n  That is what we ought to be debating instead of saying we are into \nanother cycle of ``gotcha,'' and you have touched the third rail. You \nmade the decision to put Medicare in play and go to the public and tell \nthem we are going to take away their health care benefits when they \nretire. The opposite is true. We are trying to save that for those who \nare retiring. We are trying to look at ways to restructure the program \nso it doesn't break Medicare, or break our entire economy.\n  Today, the average man is living into his 70s, and an average woman \ninto her 80s, or even 90s. As a result, more elderly Americans are on \nMedicare than originally anticipated. The Federal Government can no \nlonger continue with business as usual. It is time for some honesty for \nthe American people. Washington is promising to deliver benefits it \ncan't afford. We can no longer nickel and dime doctors and hospitals \nand force them to pay for the care Washington promised elderly \nAmericans. More and more doctors are forced to turn away Medicare \npatients. The American Medical Association revealed that 17 percent of \nthe more than 9,000 doctors surveyed are forced to limit the number of \nMedicare patients they accept. And among primary care physicians, this \nrate is 31 percent. Why? Because we don't have the money to reimburse \nthem for the cost it takes to provide that care.\n\n  The American Osteopathic Association said 15 percent of its members \nrefused Medicare and 19 percent declined to accept new Medicare \npatients. Physicians and hospitals in my home State of Indiana are \nfeeling the pain from the Congress's inaction as well. Hospitals such \nas Deaconess Clinic in Evansville, IN, say one-third of their patients \nare on Medicare. When hospitals and doctors are not receiving the \nnecessary compensation for services conducted on one-third of their \npatients, it has a devastating impact on their businesses.\n  If we don't reform Medicare, we lose Medicare. Let me repeat that. If \nwe don't take steps to reform Medicare, we lose Medicare. If we don't \nrestructure the program, more patients will lose the care they \ndesperately need.\n  Mr. President, a very prominent figure--a leader of this country--\nmade this statement:\n\n       Almost all of the long-term deficit and debt that we face \n     relates to the exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Almost all of it. That is the single biggest driver of our \n     Federal debt. And if we don't get control over that we can't \n     get control over our Federal budget.\n\n  That defines, in a very basic statement, exactly the challenge that \nis before us. It gives us the warning we need to heed, and it should \nspur us into action.\n  Let me repeat that statement once again.\n\n       Almost all of the long-term deficit and debt that we face \n     relates to the exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Almost all of it. That is the single biggest driver of our \n     Federal debt. And if we don't get control over that we can't \n     get control of our Federal budget.\n\n  That statement was made by President Barack Obama. It was not made by \na Republican. It was not made by an editorial piece in the Wall Street \nJournal. It was not made by a tea party leader or advocate. It was made \nby our current President. Our President has said we cannot sustain what \nwe are doing, and we have to address it or it is going to take down our \nwhole budget.\n  I think that is true--it has been backed up by analysts who have \nlooked at this whole situation, left, right, nonpolitical, political, \nwhatever. Why then are we not going forward with addressing this very \nquestion? That is what people sent us here to do in 2010. That is what \nthey are asking us to do now. Yet we are acting as if this statement by \nthe President of the United States has nothing to do with what we need \nto do, that we can simply ignore this and go forward and just cut a \nlittle here and cut a little there but we can't touch the \nentitlements--we can't touch Medicare.\n  The papers are full today with headlines saying that the results of \nthe New York special congressional race was because the people have \nbeen scared--well, they didn't say ``scared,'' but that it was people \nsaying ``don't cut our Medicare.'' What it should have said is, those \npeople who are saying ``don't cut our Medicare'' are basically saying \n``keep mine going until this thing runs out. I am afraid I might live \ntoo long, and then I won't have benefits at the end.'' But for sure our \nkids won't have it, for sure our grandchildren won't have it because at \nits current rate, as the President of the United States has \nacknowledged, it is unsustainable.\n  So we have two options here. We can continue with the status quo--we \ncan quibble over how much to cut from our discretionary spending, or \nthat portion of the budget which we have control of--and continue \nignoring the entitlement programs or we can make a commitment and have \nthe political will to fulfill that commitment by saving those programs \nthrough some sound restructuring. This does not mean current recipients \nof Medicare are going to be knee-capped or have their benefits dropped. \nThis does not mean that even those nearing retirement are going to face \nthat prospect. What it does mean is, if we don't put the structural \nreforms in now to address the future problems, we are going to lose the \nwhole program. The gravest threat to Medicare is doing nothing. If we \ndo nothing, not only will Medicare collapse but so will our fiscal \nhouse.\n  In the papers today, a former President--another Democrat, Bill \nClinton--has urged his fellow Democrats not to ``tippy-toe around'' \nMedicare. Continuing that quote, he said the program ``is part of a \nwhole health-care system that has a toxic effect on inflation.'' He \nwent on to say, ``We've got to deal with these things.''\n  Mr. President, I am here not to criticize the Democrats for putting \nus in this situation. I think we all bear some responsibility. The \ncountry does not want us to point fingers at each other, and they do \nnot want us to use this as a political advantage for the 2012 election. \nThey want us to do the right thing, which they all know needs to be \ndone, and I believe they will reward us and recognize us for at least \nhaving the courage to step forward and address a real problem that I \nthink everyone now understands and recognizes.\n  So whether it is the Paul Ryan plan coming out of the House, whether \nit is a Democratic budget plan coming out of the Budget Committee, \nwhether it is some other plan coming out between the negotiations that \nare going on--or should go on--between the executive branch and the \ncongressional branch, this is something we have to do. We have simply \ngot to put aside our partisanship and concerns and worry about the 2012 \nelections and rise above politics. We did that in 1983 when we \nrestructured Social Security. We had a Republican President, a \nDemocratic House leader, and members of the Democratic congressional \ncommittee and Senate committee--the political people--all stood \ntogether and said: This rises above the election. It is too important \nnot to address it.\n  We can just take this one issue and say: Let's take this out of \npolitics. Let's stand together as Republicans and Democrats, along with \nthe President, and do what is right for the country.\n  The bottom line is that no matter what we do here, if the President \ndoesn't support us in this effort, it will not succeed. He has the veto \npen, and he has the ability to lead or not lead. So I guess, as I have \nbefore, I am calling on the President and saying this important issue \ncan only be successful\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\nif he will engage and lead us and be part of this effort to solve a \nproblem that affects every living American and those yet to be born in \nthis country. It dramatically affects our future but sooner than any of \nus, I believe, think. It affects our economy and our ability to grow.\n  All of this has to be coupled with pro-growth policies. We can't cut \nour way out of all this. We can help restructure, we can help make cuts \nwhere necessary, and we can help our economy grow by putting policies \nin place that will stimulate the economy. That combination, put \ntogether in a package, is what we need to support. And I am hoping we \nwill put politics aside for this one issue that is so important to the \nfuture of our country.\n  Mr. President, I have probably said more than I needed to say at this \nparticular point in time. I appreciate the opportunity and again thank \nthe Senator from North Dakota for agreeing to let me go forward here. \nAs chairman of the Budget Committee, I know he is fully cognizant and \naware of these issues and is working to try to address them also. I \nhope we can work together to find a solution to this very urgent \nproblem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Indiana \nfor his thoughtful presentation. There are parts of it with which I \ndisagree, but the overall theme of what he has said is undeniably true.\n  I believe our country is in deep trouble. At the end of this year, we \nwill have a debt that is 100 percent of the gross domestic product of \nthe United States. We have had two of the leading economists in this \ncountry tell us, after a review of 200 years of economic history, that \nwhen a country reaches a gross debt of more than 90 percent of its GDP, \nits future economic prospects are diminished. And that is where we are. \nSo I agree with the Senator from Indiana that this is the time. We must \nfind a way to come together to craft a plan that deals with this debt \nthreat.\n  Five years ago, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, \nSenator Gregg, and I came up with the concept of a commission. That \neffort led to the commission that was in place last year, and it came \nup with a recommendation to reduce the debt $4 trillion over the next \n10 years, and 11 of 18 commissioners supported it. Senator Gregg and I \nboth supported it. We had five Democrats, five Republicans, and one \nIndependent. That is the only bipartisan plan that has emerged from \nanywhere. But we needed 14 of 18 to agree for it to come to a vote in \nCongress.\n  There were many parts of that plan I didn't like. I would have gone \nfurther than that plan. I proposed to the commission that we have a $6 \ntrillion plan of debt reduction because we could balance the budget in \n10 years with that kind of plan. But it was a step in the right \ndirection. It was a big step in the right direction. So I supported it, \nalong with the other 10 commissioners who did.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Indiana that I respect the \npresentation he just made because, in larger terms, it says what has to \nbe said. We all have to be truth-tellers. However uncomfortable the \ntruth is, we have to be truth-tellers. I believe the truth is that when \nthe revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years as a share of GDP and \nspending is the highest it has been in 60 years as a share of GDP, we \nhave to work both sides of the equation. We are going to have to cut \nspending, and I believe we are going to have to raise revenue.\n  None of it is very popular. If you ask the American people, they will \nsay to you: Well, yes, get the deficit and debt under control, but \ndon't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, and don't touch \ndefense. And by the way, just those three are about 80 percent of \nFederal spending if you add up all the mandatory programs and add up \ndefense. That is about 80 percent of Federal spending. And if you ask \nthe American people, they say: Don't touch any of them. On the revenue \nside, they say: Don't touch that. Well, do you know what is left? \nTwenty percent of Federal spending.\n  If you start asking them questions about the elements of that 20 \npercent, they reject every one except one--foreign aid. They say: Yes, \ncut foreign aid. A majority supports that. The problem is that is only \n1 percent of the budget. Here we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend, and even if we eliminate all foreign aid, it does not make a \nmaterial difference.\n  The other thing the American people support by a majority--the only \nother thing--is taxing the wealthy. Let me just say that I believe the \nwealthy are going to have to pay somewhat more. But that won't solve \nour problem because to solve the problem, you would have to have a top \nrate of 70 to 80 percent on corporations and individuals. What would \nthat do to the competitive position of the United States?\n  So I believe we all are going to have to be truth-tellers, and before \nwe are done, we are going to have to find a way to come together. I was \npart of that effort on the commission. I was part of that effort in \nthis group of six, which is now a group of five because one of our \nmembers left. And there is this other effort under way that is a \nleadership effort with the White House being involved. At the end of \nthe day, the White House has to be at the table.\n  What Senator Gregg and I had recommended was that the Secretary of \nthe Treasury be the chairman of the commission and the head of OMB be \none of the 18 members. That wasn't adopted by the Congress. We got 53 \nvotes in the Senate for our proposal, but 53 votes doesn't pass things \naround here. You have to have 60. You have to have a supermajority. So \nhere we are.\n  Let me just say again that I thank the Senator for his thoughtful \npresentation because that is what it is going to take. We are going to \nhave to be brave. We are going to have to show some political courage \nhere to do what is right for our country. So I appreciate the \nthoughtful remarks of the Senator from Indiana.\n  Let me make a brief review in response to some of what I have heard \nthis morning because I have heard some things with which I strenuously \ndisagree that I believe require a response. We all agree we are on an \nunsustainable path. We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar. That \ncannot be continued.\n  As I indicated earlier, this is a 60-year look at the spending and \nrevenue of the United States. We can see the spending line is the red \nline; the green line is the revenue line. The spending of the United \nStates as a share of national income is the highest it has been in 60 \nyears. The revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years.\n  Some of our colleagues say it is just a spending problem. Factually, \nI reject that. The facts show it is not just a spending problem--\nalthough it is clear we do have a spending problem. When spending is \nthe highest it has been in 60 years, clearly we have a spending \nproblem. But as this chart reveals, revenue is the lowest it has been \nin 60 years. So, clearly, we have a revenue problem as well.\n  Yesterday we voted on the package that came from the House of \nRepresentatives. The package that came from the House Budget Committee \nwas passed by the House of Representatives. Even though that package \nwas defeated overwhelmingly and on a bipartisan basis here yesterday, \nagain this morning we had colleagues come and talk about what a great \npackage it was. I do not believe it was a great package. I think it was \na terrible package, and here is why--and now I am quoting former \neconomic adviser to President Reagan, one of President Reagan's \neconomic advisers, Mr. Bartlett. He said, about the House Republican \nplan, the following:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them. Even as an opening bid to begin \n     budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot \n     be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list than a \n     fairytale utterly disconnected from the real world, backed up \n     by make-believe numbers and unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's \n     plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just pandering to the \n     tea party. A real act of courage would have been for him to \n     admit, as all serious budget analysts know, that revenues \n     will have to rise well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize \n     the debt.\n\n  This is a former economic adviser to President Reagan commenting on \nthe House Republican plan that we rejected on a bipartisan basis here \nyesterday.\n  Why does he say it is a monstrosity? He says it because even though \nrevenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years,\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nthe first thing the Republican budget from the House did was cut taxes \nfurther, an overwhelming tax cut for the wealthiest among us after they \nalready enjoyed very significant tax reductions over the last decade.\n  In fact, the plan that came from the Republican House would have \ngiven those who have over $1 million of income a year on average a tax \ncut of over $192,000. For those who are as fortunate as to earn over \n$10 million a year, the plan they sent over here would have given them \non average a tax cut of $1,450,000. That is a fact. That is just a \nfact.\n  Does that make any sense at all when the revenue of this country is \nthe lowest it has been in 60 years, that the first thing you do is dig \nthe hole deeper, give another $1 trillion of tax cuts going to the \nwealthiest among us? It makes no sense.\n  It did not end there because the plan from the House also would \npermit a scam that is occurring to continue. The scam I am referring to \nrelates to this little building down in the Cayman Islands, Ugland \nHouse. This little five-story building down in the Cayman Islands \nclaims to be the home of 18,857 companies. Really, 18,000 companies are \ndoing business out of this little five-story building down in the \nCayman Islands? Please. Mr. President, 18,000 companies are not doing \nbusiness out of this little five-story building down in the Cayman \nIslands. The only business that is going on is monkey business, and the \nmonkey business that is going on is avoiding the taxes they \nlegitimately owe to the United States.\n  You wonder why big companies making billions of dollars a year can \nannounce they owed no taxes to the United States--none? It is because \nthey are operating out of Ugland House down in the Cayman Islands where \nthere are no taxes, and they show their profits in their companies down \nin the Cayman Islands.\n  When I was tax commissioner in my State I found a company that \nreported all of their earnings down in the Cayman Islands. They did \nbusiness all across the country, but amazingly enough none of those \ncompanies showed any profits in the United States. They showed all \ntheir profits in the Cayman Islands where, happily, there are no taxes.\n  The Republican budget plan said: That is fine. Keep doing it.\n  That is not fine. It is not fair. We know from our own Permanent \nCommittee on Investigations in the Senate that these offshore tax \nhavens are proliferating. Here is a quote from our Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 to $70 billion from individuals and \n     another $30 billion from corporations engaging in offshore \n     tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of \n     dollars more.\n\n  The Republican plan from the House says: No problem. Keep on doing \nit. In fact, we will go you one more. We will give you more tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest among us.\n  I tell you, that plan cannot stand scrutiny. At the same time it \nsays: You know, because we have the lowest revenue in 60 years, and \nbecause we are going to give even more tax preferences, more tax \ncredits, more tax schemes to the wealthiest among us, we are not going \nto be able to keep Medicare.\n  I have heard colleagues say that these Draconian cuts to Medicare \nthat are in the House plan are a way of saving Medicare. You don't save \nMedicare by destroying it. That is what the House plan does, make no \nmistake. It ends Medicare as we know it. Why do I say that? Let me just \nshow you what it does.\n  Right now, under traditional Medicare, the individual pays 25 percent \nof their health care costs. That is how it works today. You pay about \n25 percent. A senior citizen eligible for Medicare pays about 25 \npercent of their costs. Under the House Republican budget plan that \nthey passed and sent to the Senate that we defeated yesterday by a \nbipartisan vote, they would increase what the individual pays from 25 \npercent to 68 percent, and they claim they are saving Medicare. It \ndoesn't look to me like they are saving it. It looks to me like they \nare completely undoing it.\n  When we add it all up, what is most striking is that the House \nRepublican plan, although it gives massive tax cuts to the wealthiest \namong us, another $1 trillion of tax cuts, even though it shreds \nMedicare and completely undermines Medicaid, which would mean another \n34 million people do not have health care coverage in this country \nbecause they completely undo the coverage for health care passed last \nyear so 34 million people are not going to have health care as a result \nof their plan--even with all of that and the other dramatic cuts--by \nthe way, they cut support for energy programs to reduce our dependence \non foreign energy, they cut that 57 percent; they cut education almost \n20 percent--even after all that you would think at least they got the \ndebt under control? No.\n  Amazingly enough their plan, according to their own numbers, would \nadd $8 trillion to the debt. Wow. They shred Medicare, they cut \neducation dramatically, they cut almost 60 percent of the funding for \nenergy to reduce our dependence on foreign energy--they cut that 57 \npercent, and they still add $8 trillion to the debt. That is a good \nplan? I don't think so. I don't think that is a plan that can stand \nmuch scrutiny.\n  We also heard a lot of complaints from the other side that we have \nnot gone to markup on the budget in the Senate. That is true. The \nreason we have not is because something is going on in this town that \nis very unusual. There are high-level bipartisan talks going on with \nthe White House on what the budget plan should be to deal with our \ndebt. This is something I have encouraged for years.\n  This year I have repeatedly called for a summit to deal with our \ndebt, to get a plan in place to cut spending, and, yes, to raise \nrevenue--hopefully without raising taxes but by eliminating tax \nexpenditures, tax loopholes, this kind of scam we have just talked \nabout of offshore tax havens and abusive tax shelters. That bipartisan \nleadership effort that is underway deserves a chance to succeed. If \nthey reach a conclusion, they may need a budget resolution. They may \nneed us to have a markup in the Budget Committee to implement their \nplan.\n  Some do not want to wait, they do not want a bipartisan agreement. \nBut we simply must have a bipartisan agreement if there is to be any \nchance for success.\n  The House is controlled by the Republicans. The Senate is controlled \nby the Democrats. There is a Democrat in the White House. The only \npossible way that a plan is actually passed into law and implemented is \nif we work together. I did it for all last year on the President's \ncommission. I have done it for months of this year with three \nDemocrats, three Republicans, spending hundreds of hours trying to come \nup with a bipartisan plan to implement the recommendations of the \ncommittee. So I don't take a back seat to anybody with respect to being \nserious about trying to get a plan to get our debt under control \nbecause it is a fundamental threat to the economic security of the \nUnited States.\n  But here is what the Republican leader himself said about the effort \nthat is underway, the bipartisan leadership effort:\n\n       [T]he discussions that can lead to a result between now and \n     August are the talks being led by Vice President Biden . . . \n     that's a process that could lead to a result, a measurable \n     result. . . . And in that meeting is the only Democrat who \n     can sign a bill into law; in fact, the only American out of \n     307 million of us who can sign a bill into law. He is in \n     those discussions. That will lead to a result. That is why we \n     have not gone to a budget markup, because we have the \n     patience to wait for the outcome of these bipartisan \n     leadership talks. The top Republicans are represented in the \n     Senate, the top Republicans in the House are represented, as \n     are the Democrats in the Senate and the House, led by the \n     White House.\n\n  The Republican leader said this as well about the talks:\n\n       We now have the most important Democrat in America at the \n     table. That's important. He is the only one of the 307 \n     million of us who can actually sign a bill into law. And I \n     think that's a step in the right direction. And the Biden \n     group is the group that can actually reach a decision on a \n     bipartisan basis. And if it reaches a decision, obviously we \n     will be recommending it to our members.\n\n  That is the point. Why would we go to a partisan budget markup and \nrefuse to wait for the leadership negotiation that is underway to \nsucceed, when we know if they do succeed in all likelihood they will \nneed us to do a budget\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nmarkup to implement what they decide?\n  I have the patience. I have spent 5 years working, first, with \nSenator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, then \nwith all 18 members of the fiscal commission, now with the group of \nsix--three Democrats and three Republicans--trying to put together a \nplan to implement what the commission recommended to get our debt under \ncontrol.\n  I have the patience to wait a few more weeks to see if the combined \nleadership of this country, Republican and Democrat, working with the \nPresident of the United States, can come up with a plan to get our debt \nunder control. We should all have that patience. We should all hope \nthey succeed. But we are not going to be sitting and waiting. While we \nare hoping for a successful outcome, this Senator will continue to work \nwith Republicans and Democrats to come up with a bipartisan plan to \nmeet our debt threat. All of us have that obligation. All of us have \nthat responsibility.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Chair inform me when I have spoken for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n\n\n                               Free Trade\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have been a long-time supporter of \nfree trade. I believe it is always a good thing when American \nbusinesses, manufacturers, and farmers have more market access for \ntheir products.\n  I have also been a longtime supporter of specific free trade \nagreements that are waiting to be acted on by the Congress: the South \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama agreements. We have had too many years of \ntalking about being long-time supporters of free trade agreements. Yet \nwe have not had an opportunity to back up our talk with votes because \nwe can't vote until the President presents them to Congress.\n  The time to present these free trade agreements is long overdue. The \nadministration needs to stop moving the goal posts every time we are \nabout to kick the ball through.\n  Take the Panama agreement as an example. The United States and Panama \nreached an agreement in principle in December of 2006. However, \ncongressional Democrats expressed concern regarding certain labor \nissues that existed in Panama at the time. The Bush administration \nnegotiated a deal with the congressional Democrats who had newly taken \nover the Congress in an agreement that was announced on May 10, 2007. \nAs a result, then-President Bush addressed the labor issues in the \ntrade agreement that the United States signed with Panama in late June \nof 2007.\n  If there were a big news conference on May 10, 2007 that there has \nbeen an agreement reached, wouldn't one think these agreements would be \npassed by now? Not so 4 years later.\n  Despite the fact that the demands made by congressional Democrats \nwere incorporated in the signed trade deal, congressional Democrats \nwould not allow a vote on the agreement. Instead, they moved the goal \nposts by demanding more changes be made by the Panamanian Government.\n  After President Obama took office, the trade issue was sidelined. \nAlong with others, I made a case that trade agreements needed to be a \npart of America's economic recovery effort. I got an opportunity to \nmake the case directly to the President in December of 2009. Then in \nJanuary 2010, the President said in a message to Congress that he \nwanted to double exports within the next 5 years. That is a very worthy \ngoal.\n  Well, it is pretty hard to double exports and help employers create \njobs while ignoring these trade agreements. Supporters of free trade \nand the jobs supported by trade average about 15 percent above the \nnational average. We are talking about good jobs, so there are reasons \nto keep the pressure on.\n  Finally, after many months of waiting, the trade ambassador went back \nto work to get the Panamanian Government to agree to meet the \nadditional demands set out by congressional Democrats in the Obama \nadministration. The ambassador also set out to gain further commitment \nfrom South Korea and Colombia.\n  The Panamanian Government has addressed the additional demands by \nmaking the necessary amendments to their laws. The additional concerns \nthe administration had with the South Korean and Colombian deals were \naddressed as well. Earlier this May, Ambassador Kirk indicated all \nthree trade agreements were ready for Congress to consider. But the \nObama administration decided to move the goal posts once again. Instead \nof moving these agreements forward for swift approval to help the \neconomy move along and the swift approval which I believe they will \nreceive when they get a vote, the administration now has another \nrequirement: approval of trade adjustment assistance.\n  While U.S. manufacturers and businesses and farmers risk losing more \nand more market share in these countries, Democrats keep coming up with \nreasons for holding up these trade agreements by moving the goal posts. \nThere is simply no reason to keep on moving the goal posts. The \nadministration has said these three trade agreements are ready. One of \nthe best things we can do right now for U.S. businesses, farmers, and \nworkers is to implement these trade agreements which will give a much-\nneeded boost to our economy.\n  I am not suggesting we do nothing on trade adjustment assistance, \nbecause I support that 40-year-old program, but reaching an agreement \non that program should not be used as another excuse for moving the \ngoal posts. All three of the pending trade agreements need to be sent \nto Congress without further delay.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to pass another 4-\nyear extension of the USA PATRIOT Act. I have served on the \nIntelligence Committee for over a decade and I wish to deliver a \nwarning this afternoon. When the American people find out how their \ngovernment has secretly interpreted the PATRIOT Act, they are going to \nbe stunned and they are going to be angry. They are going to ask \nSenators: Did you know what this law actually permits? Why didn't you \nknow before you voted on it? The fact is anyone can read the plain text \nof the PATRIOT Act. Yet many Members of Congress have no idea how the \nlaw is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch because that \ninterpretation is classified. It is almost as if there are two PATRIOT \nActs, and many Members of Congress have not read the one that matters.\n  Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the \npublic have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have \nno idea what their government believes the law actually means.\n  I am going to bring up several historical examples to try to \ndemonstrate what this has meant over the years. Before I begin, I wish \nto be clear I am not claiming any of the specific activities I discuss \ntoday are happening now. I am bringing them up because I believe they \nare a reminder of how the American people react when they learn about \ndomestic surveillance activities that are not consistent with what they \nbelieve the law allows. When Americans learn about intelligence \nactivities that are consistent with their understanding of the law, \nthey look to the news media, they follow these activities with \ninterest, and often admiration. But when people learn about \nintelligence activities that are outside the lines of what is generally \nthought to be the law, the reaction can get negative and get negative \nin a hurry.\n\n  Here is my first example. The CIA was established by the National \nSecurity Act of 1947 and the law stated that the agency was ``forbidden \nto have law enforcement powers or internal security functions.'' \nMembers of the Congress and legal experts interpreted that language as \na clear prohibition against any internal security function under any \ncircumstances. A group of CIA officials had a different interpretation. \nThey decided that the 1947 law contained legal gray areas that allowed \nthe CIA to monitor American citizens for possible contact with foreign \nagents. They believed this meant they could secretly tap Americans' \nphones, open their mail, and plant listening devices in their homes, \namong other\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nthings. This secret legal interpretation led the CIA to maintain \nintelligence files on more than 10,000 American citizens, including \nreporters, Members of Congress, and a host of antiwar activists.\n  This small group of CIA officials kept the program and their ``gray \narea'' justification to the program a secret from the American people \nand most of the government because, they argued, revealing it would \nviolate the agency's responsibility to protect intelligence sources and \nmethods from unauthorized disclosure. Did the program stay a secret? It \ndidn't. On December 22, 1974, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh \ndetailed the program on the front pages of the New York Times. The \nrevelations and the huge public uproar that ensued led to the formation \nof the Church Committee. That committee spent nearly 2 years \ninvestigating questionable and illegal activity at the CIA. The Church \nCommittee published 14 reports detailing various intelligence abuses \nwhich, in addition to illegal domestic surveillance, included programs \ndesigned to assassinate foreign leaders. The investigation led to \nExecutive orders reining in the authority of the CIA and the creation \nof the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n  In 1947, President Harry Truman and his top military and legal \nadvisers secretly approved a program named PROJECT SHAMROCK. PROJECT \nSHAMROCK authorized the Armed Forces Security Agency and its successor, \nthe NSA, to monitor telegraphs coming in and out of the United States. \nAt the outset of the program, companies were told that government \nagents would only read ``those telegrams related to foreign \nintelligence targets,'' but as the program grew, more telegrams were \nsent and received by Americans and they were read. During the program's \n30-year run, the NSA analysts sometimes reviewed as many as 150,000 \ntelegrams a month.\n  While the Ford administration said it made all pertinent information \nabout PROJECT SHAMROCK available, the Senate Intelligence Committee and \nthe Justice Department had kept the program secret from the public. \nThey argued that public disclosure was both unjustified and dangerous \nto national security, and it avoided Congress's questions regarding the \nlegality of the program by stating that the telegrams present somewhat \ndifferent legal questions from those posed by domestic bugging and \nwiretapping. That program didn't stay secret either.\n  The newly formed Senate Intelligence Committee ultimately disclosed \nthe PROJECT SHAMROCK program on November 6, 1975, arguing that public \ndisclosure was needed to build support--build support--for a law \ngoverning NSA operations. The resulting public uproar led to a \ncongressional investigation. The NSA's termination of PROJECT SHAMROCK \nand the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \nwhich attempted to subject domestic surveillance to a process of \nwarrants and judicial review.\n  Years later, during the Reagan administration, senior members of the \nNational Security Council secretly sold arms to Iran and used the funds \nto arm and train Contra militants to topple the Nicaraguan Government. \nSelling arms to Iran violated the official U.S. arms embargo against \nIran and directly funding the Contras was illegal under the Boland \namendment. That was the one Congress passed to limit U.S. Government \nassistance to the Contras.\n  But the officials at the National Security Council were convinced \nthey knew better. They were convinced that violating the embargo and \nillegally supporting the Contra rebels would help free American \nhostages and help fight communism in Nicaragua. Instead of engaging in \na public debate and trying to convince the Congress and the public they \nwere right, they secretly launched an arms program and hid it from the \nCongress and the American people. How did that work out for them?\n  The New York Times published a story of these activities on November \n25, 1987. A joint congressional committee was launched to investigate \nthe Iran Contra affair with televised hearings for over a month. The \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee and the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees held their own hearings. The first Presidential commission \ninvestigating the National Security Council was launched. Multiple \nreports were published documenting the administration's illegal \nactivities, and the Nicaraguan Government sued the United States. \nDozens of court cases were filed and National Security Council \nofficials--including two National Security Advisers--faced multiple \nindictments.\n  Finally, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a \nhandful of government officials made the unilateral judgment that \nfollowing U.S. surveillance law, as it was commonly understood, would \nslow down the government's ability to track suspected terrorists. \nInstead of working with the Congress, instead of coming to the Congress \nand asking to revise or update the law, these officials secretly \nreinterpreted the law to justify a warrantless wiretapping program that \nthey hid from virtually every Member of the Congress and the American \npeople.\n  It is not clear how long they thought they could hide a large, \ncontroversial national security program of this nature, but they kept \nit so secret that even when it yielded useful intelligence, \nclassification restrictions sometimes prevented the information from \nbeing shared with officials who could have used it.\n  I was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee at this point--a \nrelatively new member--but the program and the legal interpretations \nthat supported it were kept secret from me and virtually all of my \ncolleagues.\n  Again, did that program stay secret? The answer is no. After several \nyears, the New York Times published a story uncovering the program. The \nresulting public uproar led to a divisive congressional debate and a \nsignificant number of lawsuits. In my view, the disclosure also led to \nan erosion of public trust that made many private companies more \nreluctant to cooperate with government inquiries.\n  As most of my colleagues will remember, Congress and the executive \nbranch spent years trying to sort out the details of that particular \nprogram and the secret legal interpretation--the secret legal \ninterpretation--that was used to justify it. In the process of doing \nso, Congress also attempted to address an actual surveillance issue. I \nthink all my colleagues who were here for that debate would agree those \nissues could have been resolved far more easily, far less \ncontentiously, if the Bush administration had simply come to the \nCongress in the first place and tried to work out a bipartisan solution \nto them rather than, in effect, trying to rewrite the law in secret.\n  When laws are secretly reinterpreted this way, the results frequently \nfail to stand up to public scrutiny. It is not surprising, if you think \nabout it. The American law-making process is often cumbersome, it is \noften frustrating, and it is certainly contentious. But over the long \nrun, this process is a pretty good way to ensure that our laws have the \nsupport of the American people, since those that do not will actually \nget revised or repealed by elected lawmakers who follow the will of our \nconstituents. On the other hand, when laws are secretly reinterpreted \nbehind closed doors by a small number of government officials--and \nthere is no public scrutiny, no public debate--you are certainly more \nlikely to end up with interpretations of the law that go well beyond \nthe boundaries of what the American people are willing to accept.\n  Let me make clear that I think it is entirely legitimate for \ngovernment agencies to keep some information secret. In a democratic \nsociety, of course, citizens rightly expect their government will not \narbitrarily keep information from them, and throughout our Nation's \nhistory Americans have vigilantly guaranteed their right to know. But \nAmericans do acknowledge certain limited exceptions to the principle of \nopenness. We know, for example, that tax officials have information \nabout all of us from our tax returns. But the government does not have \nthe right or the need to share this information openly. This is \nessentially an exception to protect personal privacy.\n  Another limited exception exists for the protection of national \nsecurity. The U.S. Government has an inherent responsibility to protect \nour people from threats. To do this effectively, it almost always \nrequires some measure of secrecy. I do not expect General Petraeus to \npublicly discuss the details of every troop movement in Afghanistan any \nmore than early Americans\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nexpected George Washington to publish his strategy for the Battle of \nYorktown. By the same token, American citizens recognize that their \ngovernment may sometimes rely on secret intelligence collection methods \nin order to ensure national security, in order to ensure the safety of \nthe American people, and they recognize that these methods can often be \nmore effective when specifics are kept secret.\n  But while Americans recognize that government agencies sometimes rely \non secret sources and methods to collect intelligence information, \nAmericans also expect these agencies will cooperate at all times within \nthe boundaries of publicly understood law.\n  I have served on the Senate Intelligence Committee for a decade, and \nI do not take a backseat to anybody when it comes to protecting what \nare essential sources and methods that are needed to keep the American \npeople safe when intelligence is being gathered. But I do not believe \nthe law should ever be kept secret. Voters have a right and a need to \nknow what the law says and what their government thinks the text of the \nlaw means. That is essential so the American people can decide whether \nthe law is appropriately written and they are in a position to ratify \nor reject the decisions their elected officials make on their behalf.\n  When it comes to most government functions, the public can directly \nobserve the government's actions and the typical citizens can decide \nfor themselves whether they support or agree with the things their \ngovernment is doing. Certainly, in my part of the world, American \ncitizens can visit the national forests and decide whether they think \nthe forests are appropriately managed. When they drive on the \ninterstate, they can decide for themselves whether those highways have \nbeen properly laid out and adequately maintained. If they see someone \npunished, they can decide for themselves whether the sentence was \nappropriate, whether it was too harsh or too lenient.\n  But Americans generally cannot decide for themselves whether \nintelligence agencies are operating within the law. That is why the \nU.S. intelligence community evolved over the past several decades. The \nCongress set up a number of watchdog and oversight mechanisms to ensure \nthat the intelligence agencies follow the law rather than violate it. \nThat is why the Senate and House each have a Select Intelligence \nCommittee. It is also why the Congress created the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. It is why Congress created a number of statutory \ninspectors general to act as independent watchdogs inside the \nintelligence agencies themselves. All these oversight entities were \ncreated at least in part to ensure that intelligence agencies carry out \nall their activities within the boundaries of publicly understood law.\n  But the law itself must always be public. Government officials must \nnot be allowed to fall into the trap of secretly reinterpreting the law \nin a way that creates a gap between what the public believes the law \nsays and what the government secretly claims it says. Anytime that \nhappens, it seems to me there is going to be a violation of the public \ntrust. Furthermore, allowing a gap of this nature to develop is simply \nshortsighted. Both history and logic should make it clear--and that is \nwhy I brought these examples to the floor of the Senate--that secret \ninterpretations of the law will not stay secret forever and, in fact, \noften come to light pretty quickly. When the public eventually finds \nout that government agencies have been rewriting surveillance laws in \nsecret, the result, as I have demonstrated, is invariably a backlash \nand an erosion of public confidence in these government agencies.\n  I believe this is a big and growing problem.\n  Our intelligence and national security agencies are staffed by many \ntalented and dedicated men and women. The work they do is very \nimportant, and for the most part, they are extraordinarily \nprofessional. But when members of the public lose confidence in these \nagencies, it does not just undercut morale, it makes it harder for \nthese agencies to do their jobs. If you ask the head of any \nintelligence agency, particularly an agency that is involved in \ndomestic surveillance in any kind of way, he or she will tell you that \npublic trust is the coin of the realm, it is a vital commodity, and \nvoluntary cooperation from law-abiding Americans is critical to the \neffectiveness of our intelligence agencies.\n\n  If members of the public lose confidence in these government agencies \nbecause they think government officials are rewriting surveillance laws \nin secret, it is going to make those agencies less effective. As a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, I do not want to see that happen.\n  I wish to wrap up now with one last comment; that is, as you look at \nthese statutes, and particularly the ones I have outlined--where you \nhave so many hard-working lawyers and officials at these government \nagencies--I wish to make it clear I do not believe these officials have \na malicious intent. They are working hard to protect intelligence \nsources and methods and for good reason. But sometimes they can lose \nsight of the differences between the sources and methods, which must be \nkept secret, and the law itself, which should not. Sometimes they even \ngo so far as to argue that keeping their interpretation of the law \nsecret is actually necessary because it prevents our Nation's \nadversaries from figuring out what our intelligence agencies are \nallowed to do.\n  I can see how it might be tempting to latch onto this ``Alice in \nWonderland'' logic. But if the U.S. Government were to actually adopt \nit, then all our surveillance laws would be kept secret because that \nwould, obviously, be even more useful. When Congress passed the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, it would have been useful to \nkeep that law secret from the KGB so Soviet agents would not know \nwhether the FBI was allowed to track them. But American laws should not \nbe public only when government officials think it is convenient. They \nought to be public and public all the time. The American people ought \nto be able to find out what their government thinks those laws mean.\n  Earlier this week, I filed an amendment, along with my colleague from \nthe Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Udall, and that amendment \nwould require the Attorney General to publicly disclose the U.S. \nGovernment's official interpretation of the USA PATRIOT Act. The \namendment specifically states that the Attorney General should not \ndescribe any particular intelligence collection programs or activities \nbut that there should be a full description of ``the legal \ninterpretation and analysis necessary to understand the . . . \nGovernment's official interpretation'' of the law.\n  This morning, Senator Mark Udall and I--and we had the help of \nseveral colleagues: Senator Merkley, Senator Tom Udall--reached an \nagreement with the chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nFeinstein. She is going to be holding hearings on this issue next \nmonth.\n  Senator Mark Udall and I, as members of the committee, will be in a \nposition to go into those hearings and the subsequent deliberations to \ntry to amend the intelligence authorization. If we do not get results \ninside the committee, because of the agreement today with the \ndistinguished chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein, \nand the majority leader, Senator Reid, we will be in a position to come \nback to this floor and offer our original amendment this fall.\n  We are going to keep fighting for openness and honesty. As of today, \nthe government's official interpretation of the law is still secret--\nstill secret--and I believe there is a growing gap, as of this \nafternoon, between what the public believes that law says and the \nsecret interpretation of the Justice Department.\n  So I plan to vote no this afternoon on this legislation because I \nsaid some time ago that a long-term reauthorization of this legislation \ndid require significant reforms. I believe when more Members of \nCongress and the American people come to understand how the PATRIOT Act \nhas actually been interpreted in secret, I think the number of \nAmericans who support significant reform and the end of secret law--the \nend of law that is kept secret from them by design--I think we will see \nAmericans joining us in this cause to ensure that in the days ahead, as \nwe protect our country from the dangerous threats we face, we are also \ndoing a better job of being sensitive to individual liberty. \n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\nThose philosophies, those critical principles are what this country is \nall about. And we are going to stay at it, Senator Udall and I and \nothers, until those changes are secured.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today in conjunction \nwith my colleague from Oregon to discuss what is before us here on the \nfloor, which is the extension of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I rise as well to express my opposition to the extension of the three \nmost controversial provisions in the PATRIOT Act which are before us \nhere today. The process by which we have considered these provisions \nhas been rushed. I believe we have done a disservice to the American \npeople by not having a fuller and more open debate about these \nprovisions.\n  Along with Senator Wyden, I want to acknowledge the difficult \nposition the leader of the Senate, Senator Reid, has been in. I want to \nthank him for trying to find an agreement to vote on more amendments. \nWe were very close to reaching that agreement, but even in that \ncontext, the debate we have had on this bill has been insufficient.\n  If you look at what we are about to approve, it is a one-page bill \nwhich just changes the dates in the existing PATRIOT Act. This is a \nlost opportunity.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that what \nmost people--including many Members of Congress--believe the PATRIOT \nAct allows the government to do--what it allows the government to do--\nand what government officials privately believe the PATRIOT Act allows \nthem to do are two different things. Senator Wyden has been making that \ncase. I want to make it as well.\n  I cannot support the extension of the provisions we are considering \ntoday without amendments to ensure there is a check on executive branch \nauthority. I do not believe the Coloradans who sent me here to \nrepresent them would accept this extension either. Americans would be \nalarmed if they knew how this law is being carried out.\n  I appreciate the Intelligence Committee chairwoman, Dianne Feinstein, \nworking with us to hold hearings in the committee to examine how the \nadministration is interpreting the law. I believe that is a critical \nstep forward. However, that addresses only the overarching concern. I \nstill have concerns about the individual provisions we are considering \ntoday.\n  We just voted to invoke cloture to cut off debate on the 4-year \nextension of provisions that give the government wide-ranging authority \nto conduct wiretaps on groups and individuals or collect private \ncitizens' records. I voted no because the debate should not be over \nwithout a real chance to improve these authorities. I recently \nsupported a 3-month extension so the Senate could take time to debate \nand amend the PATRIOT Act. We were promised that debate, but that \nopportunity is literally slipping through our hands. I would like to \nstay here and continue making the case to the American people that this \nbill should and could be improved.\n  While a number of PATRIOT Act provisions are permanent and remain in \nplace to give our intelligence community important tools to fight \nterrorism, the three controversial provisions we are debating, commonly \nknown as roving wiretap, ``lone wolf,'' and business records, are ripe \nfor abuse and threaten Americans' constitutional freedoms.\n  I know we must balance the principles of liberty and security. I \nfirmly believe terrorism is a serious threat to the United States, and \nwe must be sharply focused on protecting the American people. In fact, \nwith my seats on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, much of my attention is centered on keeping \nAmericans safe both here and abroad. I also recognize that despite \nOsama bin Laden's death, we still live in a world where terrorism is a \nserious threat to our country, our economy, and to American lives. Our \ngovernment does need the appropriate surveillance and antiterrorism \ntools to achieve these important goals. However, we need to and we can \nstrike a better balance between protecting our national security and \nthe constitutional freedoms of our people. Let me give you an example. \nThis debate has failed to recognize that the current surveillance \nprograms need improved public oversight and accountability.\n  I know Americans believe we ought to only use PATRIOT Act powers to \ninvestigate terrorists or espionage-related targets. Yet section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act, the so-called business records provision, currently \nallows records to be collected on law-abiding Americans without any \nconnection to terrorism or espionage. If we cannot limit investigations \nto terrorism or other nefarious activities, where do they end?\n  Coloradans are demanding that in addition to the review of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, we place commonsense limits on \ngovernment investigations and link data collection to terrorist or \nespionage-related activities. If--or I should say when--Congress passes \nthis bill to extend the PATRIOT Act until 2015, it will mean that for 4 \nmore years the Federal Government will have access to private \ninformation about Americans who have no connection to terrorism without \nsufficient accountability and without real public awareness about how \nthese powers are used.\n  Again, I underline that we all agree the intelligence community needs \neffective tools to combat terrorism, but we must provide these tools in \na way that protects the constitutional freedoms of our people and lives \nup to the standard of transparency that democracy demands.\n  Again, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, while I cannot say \nhow this authority is being used, I believe it is ripe for potential \nabuse and must be improved to protect the constitutionally protected \nprivacy rights of individual innocent American citizens. Toward that \ngoal, I have worked with my colleagues to come up with commonsense \nfixes that can receive bipartisan support. For example, Senator Wyden \nand I filed an amendment that would require the Department of Justice \nto disclose the official legal interpretation of the provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. This would make sure the Federal Government is only using \nthose powers in ways the American people believe they are authorizing \nthem to.\n  While I believe our intelligence practices should be kept secret, I \ndo not believe the government's official interpretation of these laws \nshould be kept secret. This is an important part of our oversight \nduties, and I look forward to working with Chairwoman Feinstein in the \nIntelligence Committee to ensure this oversight occurs.\n  I have also filed my own amendments to address some of the problems I \nsee with the roving wiretap, ``lone wolf,'' and business record \nprovisions. For example, I joined Senator Wyden in filing an amendment \ndesigned to narrow the scope of the business records materials that can \nbe collected under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. And I just \nhighlighted some of the problems with that provision. Our amendment \nwould still allow enforcement agencies to use the PATRIOT Act to obtain \ninvestigation records, but it would also require those entities to \ndemonstrate that the records are in some way connected to terrorism or \nclandestine intelligence activities.\n  Today, law enforcement currently can obtain any kind of records. In \nfact, the PATRIOT Act's only limitation states that such information \nhas to be related to ``any tangible thing.'' That is right. As long as \nthese business records are related to any tangible thing, the U.S. \nGovernment can require businesses to turn over information on their \ncustomers, whether or not there is a link to terrorism or espionage. I \nhave to say that I just do not think it is unreasonable to ask that our \nlaw enforcement agencies identify a terrorism or espionage \ninvestigation before collecting the private information of law-abiding \nAmerican citizens.\n  These amendments represent but a few of the reform ideas we could \nhave debated this week. But without further debate on these issues, \nthis or any other administration, whether intentionally or \nunintentionally, can abuse the PATRIOT Act. And because of the need to \nkeep classified material classified, Congress cannot publicly fulfill \nour oversight responsibilities on behalf of the American people.\n  So, as I started out my remarks, I plan to vote against the \nreauthorization of these three expiring provisions\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nbecause we fail to implement any reforms that would sensibly restrain \nthese overbroad provisions. In the nearly 10 years since Congress \npassed the PATRIOT Act, there has been very little opportunity to \nimprove this law, and I, for one, am very disappointed that we are once \nagain being rushed into approving policies that threaten the privacy--\nwhich, under one definition, is the freedom to be left alone--of the \nAmerican people. It is a fundamental element and principle of freedom.\n  The bill that is before us today, in my opinion, does not live up to \nthe balanced standard the Framers of our Constitution envisioned to \nprotect both liberty and security, and I believe it seriously risks the \nconstitutional freedoms of our people. By passing this unamended \nreauthorization, we are ensuring that Americans will live with the \nstatus quo for 4 more long years. I am disappointed and I know that \nmany of our constituents would be disappointed if they were able to \nunderstand the implications of our inaction on these troubling issues.\n  As I close, I just want to say there is a gravitational pull to \nsecrecy that I think we all have as human beings. It is hard to resist \nit. And the whole point of the checks and balances our Founders put in \nplace was to ensure that power couldn't be consolidated and that power \nabused, again whether intentionally or unintentionally. We would all \nlike to be king for a day. We all have ideas about how we could make \nthe world a better place. But we know the dangers in giving that much \npower to one person or one small group of people.\n  Ben Franklin put it so well. I can't do justice to his remarks and \nthe way he stated them, but to paraphrase him, he said that a society \nthat would trade essential liberty for short-term security deserves \nneither. And our job as Senators is to ensure that we actually enjoy \nboth of those precious qualities, security and liberty.\n  This is an important vote today. This is an important undertaking. I \nknow we can, through the leadership of Senator Wyden and many of us who \ncare deeply about this, ensure that the PATRIOT Act keeps faith with \nthe principles we hold dear.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate everyone's patience. We are working toward the \nend, but we are not there yet.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Paul to offer \ntwo amendments en bloc and no other amendments be in order: Amendment \nNo. 363, firearm records, and amendment No. 365, suspicious activity \nreports; that there be 60 minutes of debate prior to votes in relation \nto the amendments, with the time equally divided between Senator Paul \nand the majority leader or their designees; that neither Paul amendment \nbe divisible; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the majority \nleader or his designee be recognized for a motion to table; if there \nare not at least 60 votes in opposition to a motion to table the above \namendments, the amendments be withdrawn; further, upon disposition of \nthe two Paul amendments, amendment No. 348 be withdrawn; that all \nremaining time postcloture be yielded back and the Senate proceed to \nvote on adoption of the motion to concur in the House amendment to S. \n990 with amendment No. 347; that no points of order or motions be in \norder other than those listed in this agreement and budget points of \norder and applicable motions to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Vermont,\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the agreement be modified to include the Leahy-\nPaul amendment with the same time for debate and a vote under the usual \nprocedures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I propounded this unanimous consent \nrequest: I would comment to my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, this amendment he has suggested has bipartisan support. He \nhas worked very hard on this. It is an amendment that we hope sometime \nthe content of which can be fully brought before the American people \nbecause it is something that is bipartisan and timely. I would hope we \ncan get consent to include his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object to the Leahy request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there any remaining objection to the request of the leader?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor. The \nleader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nfirst ask unanimous consent that an editorial in today's Washington \nPost in favor of my amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 25, 2011]\n\n             A Chance to Put Protections in the Patriot Act\n\n       Congress appears poised to renew important counterterrorism \n     provisions before they are to expire at the end of the week. \n     That much is welcome. But it is disappointing that lawmakers \n     may extend the Patriot Act measures without additional \n     protections meant to ensure that these robust tools are used \n     appropriately.\n       The Patriot Act's lone-wolf provision allows law \n     enforcement agents to seek court approval to surveil a non-\n     U.S. citizen believed to be involved in terrorism but who may \n     not have been identified as a member of a foreign group. A \n     second measure allows the government to use roving wiretaps \n     to keep tabs on a suspected foreign agent even if he \n     repeatedly switches cellphone numbers or communication \n     devices, relieving officers of the obligation of going back \n     for court approval every time the suspect changes his means \n     of communication. A third permits the government to obtain a \n     court order to seize ``any tangible item'' deemed relevant to \n     a national security investigation. All three are scheduled to \n     sunset by midnight Thursday.\n       House and Senate leaders have struck a preliminary \n     agreement for an extension to June 2015 and may vote on the \n     matter as early as Thursday morning. This agreement was not \n     easy to come by. Several Republican senators originally \n     wanted permanent extensions--a proposition rebuffed by most \n     Democrats and civil liberties groups. In the House, \n     conservative Tea Party members, who worried about handing the \n     federal government too much power, earlier this year bucked a \n     move that would have kept the provisions alive until \n     December. Congressional leaders were forced to piece together \n     short-term approvals to keep the tools from lapsing.\n       The compromise four-year extension is important because it \n     gives law enforcement agencies certainty about the tools' \n     availability. But the bill would be that much stronger if \n     oversight and auditing requirements originally included in \n     the version from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) were permitted \n     to remain. Mr. Leahy's proposal, which won bipartisan \n     approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, required the \n     attorney general and the Justice Department inspector general \n     to provide periodic reports to congressional overseers to \n     ensure that the tools are being used responsibly. Mr. Leahy \n     has crafted an amendment that includes these protections, but \n     it is unlikely that the Senate leadership will allow its \n     consideration.\n       At this late hour, it is most important to ensure that the \n     provisions do not lapse, which could happen as a result of a \n     dispute between Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) \n     and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) over procedural issues. If time \n     runs out for consideration of the Leahy amendment, Mr. Leahy \n     should offer a stand-alone bill later to make the reporting \n     requirements the law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, further reserving the right to object, I \nfind it extremely difficult--and I have\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\ngreat respect for Senator Paul as a cosponsor of my amendment--that one \nmore time we have a case where we could have two amendments on the \nRepublican side and we have one that is cosponsored by both Republicans \nand Democrats on this side, but we can't go forward with it. We have \ntwo amendments that have not gotten any committee hearings. We have one \non this side that has been voted on by a bipartisan majority, \nRepublicans and Democrats, twice out of committee, twice on the floor, \nand that can't go forward.\n  It is my inclination to object further. I realize the difficulty that \nwould put my friend from Nevada in, so I will not object. But I do feel \nthis ruins the chances to make the PATRIOT Act one that could have had \nfar greater bipartisan support, and we have lost a wonderful chance. \nBut I understand we have to do what the Republicans want in this bill, \nso I will withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in this editorial to which the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee refers, there are four very strong paragraphs \nindicating why his amendment is important and necessary. But in keeping \nwith the kind of Senator we have in the senior Senator from Vermont--\nthe final paragraph is also quite meaningful and it is meaningful \nbecause that is the kind of Senator we have from Vermont by the name of \nPat Leahy. This is the last paragraph:\n\n       At this late hour, it is most important to ensure that the \n     provisions do not lapse, which would happen as a result of a \n     dispute between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator \n     Rand Paul over procedural issues.\n\n  Here is the final sentence, which demonstrates why Pat Leahy is a \nfriend of the United States and is a legend in the Senate:\n\n       If time runs out for consideration of the Leahy amendment, \n     Mr. Leahy should offer a stand-alone bill later to make the \n     reporting requirements the law.\n\n  So I appreciate very much Senator Leahy being his usual team player.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator would yield for a moment, \nhe referred to that last line that this should be offered as a \nfreestanding bill. I assure the leader it will be offered as a \nfreestanding bill and I hope it is one that, because of bipartisan \nsupport, could be brought up at some point for a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is an extremely important plateau we \nhave reached. It has been very difficult for everyone. But now this \nbill can go to the President of the United States if these amendments \nare defeated, which I hope they are. It will go to the President \ntonight before the deadline of this bill, so this bill will not lapse. \nEven though the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, and I have had some \ndifferences, what we have done on this legislation has at least helped \nus understand each other, which I appreciate very much, and I \nappreciate his working with us. It has been most difficult for him and \nfor me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I am pleased today to come to the floor of the Senate to \ntalk about the PATRIOT Act. I am pleased we have cracked open the door \nthat will shed some light on the PATRIOT Act. I wish the door were open \nwider, the debate broader and more significant, but today we will talk \na little bit about the constitutionality of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I was a cosponsor of Senator Leahy's amendment, and I think it would \nhave gone many great steps forward to make sure we have surveillance on \nwhat our government does. It would have authorized audits by the \ninspector general to continue to watch over and to make sure government \nis not invading the rights of private citizens, and I do support that \nwholeheartedly.\n  Jefferson said if we had a government of angels, we wouldn't have to \ncare or be concerned about the power that we give to government. \nUnfortunately, sometimes we don't have angels in charge of our \ngovernment. Sometimes we can even get a government in charge that would \nuse the power of government in a malicious or malevolent way, to look \nat the banking records of people they disagree with politically, to \nlook at the religious practices of people they disagree with. So it is \nimportant that we are always vigilant, that we are eternally vigilant \nof the powers of government so they do not grow to such an extent that \ngovernment could be looking into our private affairs for nefarious \nreasons.\n  We have proposed two amendments that we will have votes on today. One \nof them concerns the second amendment. I think it is very important \nthat we protect the rights of gun owners in our country, not only for \nhunting but for self-protection, and that the records of those in our \ncountry who own guns should be secret. I don't think the government, \nwell intentioned or not well intentioned, should be sifting through \nmillions of records of gun owners. Why? There have been times even in \nour history in which government has invaded our homes to take things \nfrom us. In the 1930s, government came into our households and said \ngive us your gold. Gold was confiscated in this country in 1933. Could \nthere conceivably be a time when government comes into our homes and \nsays, We want your guns?\n  People say that is absurd. That would never happen. I hope that day \nnever comes. I am not accusing anybody of being in favor of that, but I \nam worried about a government that is sifting through millions of \nrecords without asking: Are you a suspect; without asking, are you in \nleague with foreign terrorists? Are you plotting a violent overthrow of \nyour government? By all means, if you are, let's look at your records. \nLet's put you in jail. Let's prosecute you. But let's not sift through \nhundreds of millions of gun records to find out whether you own a gun. \nLet's don't leave those data banks in the hands of government where \nsomeday those could be abused.\n  What we are asking for are procedural protections. The Constitution \ngave us those protections. The second amendment gives us the right to \nkeep and bear arms. The fourth amendment is equally important. It gives \nus the right to be free of unreasonable search. It gives us the right \nto say that government must have probable cause. There must be at least \nsome suspicion that one is committing a crime before they come into \none's house or before they go into one's records, wherever one's \nrecords are. The Constitution doesn't say that one only has protection \nof records that are in one's house. One should have protection of \nrecords that reside in other places. Just because one's Visa record \nresides with a Visa company doesn't make it any less private. If we \nlook at a person's Visa bill, we can find out all kinds of things about \nthem. If we look at a person's Visa bill, we can find out what doctors \nthey go to; do they go to a psychiatrist; do they have mental illness; \nwhat type of medications do they take.\n  If someone looked at my Visa bill, they could tell what type of books \nor magazines I read. One of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act is called \nthe library provision. They can look at the books someone checks out in \nthe library. People say, well, still, a judge has to sign these \nwarrants. But we changed the standard. The standard of the fourth \namendment was probable cause. They had to argue, or at least convince a \njudge, that you were a suspect, that you were doing something wrong. \nNow the cause or the standard has been changed to relevance. So it \ncould be that you went to a party with someone who was from Palestine \nwho gives money to some group in Palestine that may well be a terrorist \ngroup. But the thing is, because I went to a party with them, because I \nknow that person, am I now somehow connected enough to be relevant? \nThey would say, Well, your government would never do that. They would \nnever go to investigate people. The problem is, this is all secret. So \nI do not know if I have been investigated. My Visa bill sometimes has \nbeen $5,000. Sometimes we pay for them over the phone, which is a wire \ntransfer. Have I been investigated by my government? I do not know. It \nis secret.\n\n  What I want is protection. I want to capture terrorists, sure. If \nterrorists are moving machine guns and weapons in our country, \ninternational terrorists, by all means, let's go after them. But the \nworst people, the people we want to lock up forever--the people all of \nus universally agree about: people who commit murder, people who commit \nrape--we want to lock them up and\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nthrow away the book, and I am all with you. But we still have the \nprotections of the fourth amendment.\n  If someone is running around in the streets of Washington tonight--at \n4 in the morning--and we think they may have murdered someone, we will \ncall a judge, and we will get a warrant. Just because we believe in \nprocedural protections, just because we believe in the Constitution \ndoes not mean we do not want to capture terrorists. We just want to \nhave some rules.\n  I will give you an analogy. Right now, you have been to the airport. \nMost of America has been to the airport at some point in time in the \nlast year or two. Millions of people fly every day. But we are taking \nthis shotgun approach. We think everyone is a terrorist, so everyone is \nbeing patted down, everyone is being strip-searched. We are putting our \nhands inside the pants of 6-year-old children. I mean, have we not gone \ntoo far? Are we so afraid that we are willing to give up all of our \nliberty in exchange for security? Franklin said: If you give up your \nliberty, you will have neither. If you give up your liberty in exchange \nfor security, you may well wind up with neither.\n  Because we take this shotgun approach, we take this approach that \neveryone is a potential terrorist, I think we actually are doing less \nof a good job in capturing terrorists because if we spent our time \ngoing after those who were committing terrorism, maybe we would spend \nless time on those who are living in this country, children and \notherwise, frequent business travelers, who are not a threat to our \ncountry. Instead of wasting time on these people, we could spend more \ntime on those who would attack us.\n  I will give you an example--the Underwear Bomber. For goodness' \nsakes, his dad reported him. His dad called the U.S. Embassy and said: \nMy son is a potential threat to your country. We did nothing. He was on \na watch list. We still let him get on a plane. He had been to Nigeria. \nHe had been to Yemen twice. For goodness' sakes, why don't we take half \nthe people in the TSA who are patting down our children and let's have \nthem look at the international flight manifest of those traveling from \ncertain countries who could be attacking us? For goodness' sakes, why \ndon't we target whom we are looking at?\n  My other amendment concerns banking records. Madam President, 8 \nmillion banking records have been looked at in our country--not by the \ngovernment. They have empowered your bank to spy on you. Every time you \ngo into your bank, your bank is asked to spy on you. If you make a \ntransaction of more than $5,000, the bank is encouraged to report you. \nIf the bank does not report you, they get a large fine, to the tune of \n$100,000 or more. They could get 5 years in prison. They are \noverencouraged. The incentive is for the bank to report everyone. So \nonce upon a time, these suspicious-activity reports were maybe 10,000 \nin a year. There are now over 1 million of these suspicious-activity \nreports.\n  Do I want to capture terrorists? Yes. Do I want to capture terrorists \nwho are transferring large amounts of money? Yes. But you know what. \nWhen we are wasting time on 8 million transactions--the vast majority \nof these transactions being by law-abiding U.S. citizens--we are not \ntargeting the people who would attack us.\n  Let's do police work. If there are terrorist groups in the Middle \nEast and we know who they are, let's investigate them. If they have \nmoney in the United States or they are transferring it between banks, \nby all means, let's investigate them. But let's have some \nconstitutional protections. Let's have some protections that say you \nmust ask a judge for a warrant.\n  Some have said: How would we get these people? Would we capture those \nwho are transferring weapons? We would investigate. We have all kinds \nof tools, and we have been using those tools.\n  Others have said: Well, we have captured these people through the \nPATRIOT Act, and we never could have gotten them. The problem with that \nargument is that it is unprovable. You can tell me you captured people \nthrough the PATRIOT Act and I can believe you captured them and you \nhave prosecuted them, but you cannot prove to me you would not have \ncaptured them had you asked for a judge.\n  We have a special court. It is called the FISA Court. The FISA Court \nhas been around since the late 1970s. Not one warrant was ever turned \ndown before the PATRIOT Act. But they say: We need more power. We need \nmore power given to these agencies, and we do not need any \nconstitutional restraint anymore.\n  But my question is, the fourth amendment said you had to have \nprobable cause. You had to name the person and the place. Well, how do \nwe change, get rid of probable cause and change it to a standard of \nrelevance? How do we do that and amend the Constitution without \nactually amending the Constitution? These are important constitutional \nquestions. But when the PATRIOT Act came up, we were so frightened by \n9/11 that it just flew through here. There were not enough copies to be \nread. There was one copy at the time. No Senator read the PATRIOT Act. \nIt did not go through the standard procedure.\n  Let's look at what is happening now. Ten years later, you would think \nthe fear and hysteria would have gotten to such a level that we could \ngo through the committee process. Senator Leahy's bill went to \ncommittee. It was deliberated upon. It was discussed. It was debated. \nIt was passed out with bipartisan support. It came to the floor with \nbipartisan support. But do you know why it is not getting a vote now? \nBecause they have backed us up against a deadline.\n  There have been people who have implied in print that if I hold up \nthe PATRIOT Act and they attack us tonight, then I am responsible for \nthe attack. There have been people who have implied that if some \nterrorist gets a gun, then I am somehow responsible. It is sort of the \nanalogy of saying that because I believe you should get a warrant \nbefore you go into a potential or alleged murderer's house, somehow I \nam in favor of murder.\n  I am in favor of having constitutional protections. These arose out \nof hundreds of years of common law. They were codified in our \nConstitution because we were worried. We were incredibly concerned \nabout what the King had done. We were concerned about what a far \ndistant Parliament was doing to us without our approval. We were \nconcerned about what James Otis called writs of assistance. Writs of \nassistance were pieces of paper that were warrants that were written by \nsoldiers. They were telling us we had to house the British soldiers in \nour houses, and they were giving general warrants which meant: We are \njust going to search you willy-nilly. We are not going to name the \nperson or the place. We are not going to name the crime you are accused \nof.\n  If a government were comprised of angels, we would not need the \nfourth amendment. What I argue for here now is protections for us all \nshould we get a despot, should we someday elect somebody who does not \nhave respect for rights. We should obey rules and laws.\n  Is this an isolated episode we are here talking about, the PATRIOT \nAct, and that there is an insufficient time, that it is a deadline: \nHurry, hurry; we must act. It is not an isolated time.\n  We have had no sufficient debate on the war with Libya. We are now \nencountered in a war in Libya, so we now have a war in which there has \nbeen no congressional debate and no congressional vote. But do you know \nwhat they argue. They say it is just a little war. But you know what. \nIt is a big principle. It is the principle that we as a country elect \npeople. It is a principle that we are restrained by the Constitution, \nthat you are protected by the Constitution, and that if I ask the young \nmen and women here today to go to war and say we are going to go to \nwar, there darn well should be a debate in this body. We are abdicating \nthose responsibilities.\n\n  We are not debating the PATRIOT Act sufficiently. We are not having \nan open amendment process. It took me 3 days of sitting down here \nfilibustering, but I am going to get two amendment votes. I am very \nhappy and I am pleased we came together to do that. I wish we would do \nmore. I wish Senator Leahy's bill was being voted on here on the floor. \nI wish there were a week's worth of debate.\n  The thing is, we come here to Washington expecting these grand \ndebates. I have been here 4 months. I expected\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nthat the important questions of the day would be debated back and \nforth. Instead, what happens so often is the votes are counted and \nrecounted and laboriously counted. When they know they can beat me or \nwhen they know they can beat somebody else, then they allow the vote to \ncome to the floor. But some, like Senator Leahy's bill--I am suspicious \nthat it is not going to be voted on because they may not be able to \nbeat it. I support it.\n  So the question is, Should we have some more debate in our country? \nWe have important issues pressing on us. I have been here for 4 months, \nand I am concerned about the future of our country because of the debt \nburden, because of this enormous debt we are accumulating. But are we \ndebating it fully? Are we talking about ways we could come together, \nhow Republicans and Democrats, right and left, could come together to \nfigure out this crisis of debt? No. I think we are so afraid of debate \nbut particularly with the PATRIOT Act.\n  The thing with the PATRIOT Act is that it is so emotional because \nanyone who stands up, like myself, and says we need to have protections \nfor our people, that we should not sift through the records of every \ngun owner in America, looking and just trolling through records--\ninterestingly, we have looked at 28 million electronic records, when \nthe inspector general looked at this--28 million electronic records. We \nhave looked at 1,600,000 texts. If you said to me: Well, they asked a \njudge, and they thought these were terrorists, I do not have a problem. \nThe judge gives them a warrant, and they look at these text messages or \nelectronic records. But do you want them trolling through your \nFacebook? Do you want them trolling through your e-mails? Do you want a \ngovernment that is unrestrained by law?\n  This ultimately boils down to whether we believe in the rule of law. \nSo often we give lipservice to it on our side and the other side, and \neverybody says: We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. \nWhen you need to protect the rule of law is when it is most unpopular. \nWhen everybody tells you that you are unpatriotic or you are for \nterrorism because you believe in the Constitution, that is when it is \nmost precious, that is when it is that you need to stand up and say no.\n  We can fight. We can preserve our freedoms. We are who we are because \nof our freedoms and our individual liberty. If we give that up, we are \nno different from those whom we oppose. Those who wish to destroy our \ncountry want to see us dissolved from within. We dissolve from within \nwhen we give up our liberties. We need to stand and be proud of the \nfact that in our country it is none of your darn business what we are \nreading. It is none of your business where we go to see a doctor, what \nmovie we see, or what our magazines are. It is nobody's business here \nin Washington what we are doing. If they think it is the business of \nlaw enforcement, get a warrant. Prove to somebody--at least have one \nstep that says that person is doing something suspicious.\n  The thing is, these suspicious-activity reports--8 million of them \nhave been filed in the last 8 years. The government does not have to \nask for this; it is sort of like they have deputized the banks. The \nbanks have now become sort of like police agencies. The banks are \nexpected to know what is in the Bank Secrecy Act. They are expected to \nknow thousands of pages of regulations. But do you know what they tell \nyour bank. If you do not report everybody, if you do not report these \ntransactions, we will fine you, we will put you in jail, or we will put \nyou out of business.\n  That is a problem. It is a real problem that that is what has come of \nthis. I think we need to have procedural protections.\n  Madam President, if at this point there is a request from the Senator \nfrom Illinois to yield for a question or a comment, I would be happy \nto, if it is about the PATRIOT Act.\n  OK. The amendments I will be proposing will be about two things, and \nwe will have votes on them. We have been given the time to debate, \nwhich I am glad we fought for. We will basically be given a virtually \ninsurmountable hurdle. This will be maybe the first time in recent \nhistory I remember seeing this, but they will move to table my \namendments. In order for me to defeat the tabling motion, I will have \nto have 60 votes. It is similar to the votes we have when you have to \novercome a cloture vote or you have to overcome a filibuster. But we \nreally are not having any vote where there is a possibility of me \nwinning. There is really a forgone conclusion. The votes are counted in \nadvance.\n  I am proud of the fact that I fought for, though, and we got some \ndebate on the floor and that maybe in bringing this fight, the country \nwill consider and reconsider the PATRIOT Act. But we need to have more \ndebate. Senator Leahy's bill needs to be fully debated and needs to \ncome out. Maybe when there is not a deadline, maybe it will come \nforward. Maybe we can have some discussion.\n  But I guess most of my message is that we should not be fearful. We \nshould not be fearful of freedom. We should not be fearful of \nindividual liberty. And they are not mutually exclusive. You do not \nhave to give up your liberty to catch criminals. You can catch \ncriminals and terrorists and protect your liberty at the same time. \nThere is a balancing act. But what we did in our hysteria after 9/11 \nwas we did not do any kind of balancing act. We just said: Come and get \nit. Here is our freedom, come and get it. We do not care whether there \nis review in Congress. We do not care whether there is to be an \ninspector general looking at this.\n  One of my colleagues today reported: Well, there is no evidence those \n8 million banking investigations are bothering or doing anything to \ninnocent people. Well, there is a reason for there being no evidence: \nThey are secret. You are not told if your bank has been spying on you. \nIf your bank has put in a suspicious-activity report, you are not \ninformed of that.\n  So the bottom line is, just because there is no complaint does not \nmean there have not been abuses. There is something called national \nsecurity letters. These are written by officers of the law, by FBI \nagents. There is no review by judges. There have been 200,000 of these. \nThere has been an explosion of these national security letters, and we \ndo not know whether they are being abused because they are a secret.\n  In fact, here is how deep the secret goes. When the PATRIOT Act was \noriginally passed, you were not allowed to tell your lawyer. If the \ngovernment came to you with an FBI agent's request, you could not even \ntell your lawyer. This, is very disturbing. They finally got around to \nchanging that. But you know what. If I had an Internet service, if I am \na server and they come to me with a policeman's request, and they say: \nGive us your records--if I tell anyone other than my attorney, I can go \nto jail for 5 years.\n  What we have is a veil of secrecy. So even if the government is \nabusing the powers, we will never know. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. Does the Senator from Illinois wish to interject?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand there is time on the other side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 28 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to speak on the majority's time.\n  Mr. PAUL. I will finish up then. As we go forward on these, I would \nhope there would be some deliberation and that the vote, as it goes \nforward, people will think about that we need to balance our freedoms \nwith our security. I think we all want security. Nobody wants what \nhappened on 9/11 to happen again.\n  But I think we do not need to simplify the debate to such an extent \nthat we simply say we have to give up our liberties. For example, I \ncannot tell you how many times people have come up to me in Washington, \nunelected officials, and said: We could have gotten Moussaoui, the 19th \nhijacker, if we had the PATRIOT Act.\n  The truth is, we did not capture Moussaoui because we had poor police \nwork. Ask yourself: Did we fire anybody after 9/11? We gave people gold \nmedals. We gave them medals of honor for their intelligence work after \n9/11. To my knowledge, not one person was fired.\n  Do you think we were doing a good job before 9/11? We had the 19th \nhijacker in prison, in custody for a\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nmonth before 9/11. We had his computer. When they looked at Moussaoui's \ncomputer 4 days after 9/11 or the day after 9/11, they connected all of \nthe dots to most of the hijackers and to people in Pakistan.\n  Why did we not look at his computer? Was it because we did not have \nthe prerogative? They did not ask. An FBI agent in Minnesota wrote 70 \nletters to his superiors saying: Ask for a warrant. His superiors did \nnot ask for a warrant. Do you think we should have done something about \nthat after 9/11?\n  We gave everybody in the FBI and the CIA medals. We gave the leaders \nmedals for meritorious service, and no one blinked an eye. What did we \ndo? We passed the PATRIOT Act and said: Come and take our liberties. \nMake us safe. But to make us safe, we should not give up our rights to \nprotect what we read, to protect what we view, to protect where we go \nand who we associate with. We should not allow governments to troll \nwilly-nilly through millions of records.\n  You have heard of wireless wiretaps. A lot of these things are \nunknown because they are so secret that nobody knows. Even many of us \ndo not even know the extent of these things. But I can tell you, there \nis a great deal of evidence that we were looking at millions of records \nand that millions of innocent U.S. citizens are having their records \nlooked at.\n  Now, are we doing anything? Are we imprisoning innocent folks? No, I \ndo not think we are doing that. I think they are good people. I think \nthe people I have met in the FBI, the people I have met in our \ngovernment want to do the right thing. But what I am fearful of is that \nthere comes a time when we have given up these powers--for example, the \nconstitutional discussion over war.\n  If we say: Well, Libya is just a small war. We do not care. We say \nCongress has no say in this. What happens when we get a President who \ndecides to send 1 million troops into war and we simply say: Who cares. \nYou know, we let the President do whatever he has to do because he has \nunlimited powers.\n  We fought a war, we fought long and hard to restrict--we wanted an \nExecutive that was bound by the chains of the Constitution. We wanted a \nPresidency, an executive branch that was bound by the checks and \nbalances. That is what our Constitution is about. It is about debate. \nDebate is important. Amendments are important. Bringing forward \nsomething from committee that would have reformed the PATRIOT Act is \nincredibly important, to have those debates on the floor of the Senate.\n  That is why there is a certain amount of disappointment to having \narrived in Washington and to see the fear of debate of the \nConstitution, and that we need to be debating these things. We need to \nhave full amendments.\n  Can there be any excuse why the inspector general should not be \nreviewing other agencies of government to find out if our rights are \nbeing trampled upon.\n  So I would ask, in conclusion, as these amendments come forward, that \npeople think about it. Think about our constitutional protections. But \ndo not go out and say the Senator from Kentucky does not want to \ncapture terrorists or the Senator from Kentucky wants people to have \nguns and to attack us because the thing is, we can have reasonable \nphilosophical debates about this, but we need to be having an open \ndebate process. We need to talk about the constitutional protections, \nthe provisions that protect us all, and we need to be aware of that.\n  I tell people: You cannot protect the second amendment if you do not \nbelieve in the fourth amendment. You cannot protect the second \namendment if you do not believe in the first amendment. It is all \nincredibly important.\n  I hope as we go forward on this vote, and even though I will likely \nfail, because of the way the rules are set up on the vote, I hope as we \ngo forward that at least somebody will begin to discuss this, somebody \nwill begin to discuss where we should have some constitutional \nrestraint; that Senator Leahy will have a chance to bring his bill \nforward, and that there will be a full and open debate.\n  I hope we have cracked the door open and I have been a small part of \nthat.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that we have a \nconsent that will allow Senator Paul to offer two amendments, and then \nwe will go to final passage on this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will oppose the amendments offered by Senator Paul, and \nthen oppose the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I would like to \nexplain in my remarks why.\n  I voted for the PATRIOT Act in the year 2001. In fact, there was only \none Senator on the floor--who no longer serves--who voted against it. \nIt was a moment of national crisis. We were told then by the Bush \nadministration they needed new authorities to make certain that America \nwould be safe and never attacked again.\n  I want to salute Senator Patrick Leahy, as well as his counterparts \non both sides of the aisle, who worked night and day to put together a \nbipartisan version of this PATRIOT Act and had the good sense to \ninclude in it a sunset. We knew we were writing a law with high emotion \nover what had happened to our country. We wanted to make sure it was a \ngood law, but we made certain it would be temporary in nature, for the \nmost part, and we would return and take another look at it. I cannot \nvote for an extension, a long-term extension, of the PATRIOT Act \nwithout additional protections included for the constitutional rights \nof our American citizens.\n  It is worth taking a moment to review the history. The PATRIOT Act \nwas passed 10 years ago--almost 10 years ago--while Ground Zero was \nstill burning. Congress responded and passed it with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. It was a unique moment in our history. But even then \nwe were concerned enough to put a sunset and to do our best to review \nit in the future to determine whether it went too far when it came to \nour freedoms. I voted for it, but I soon realized that it gave too much \npower to government without enough judicial and congressional \noversight.\n\n  So 2 years after the PATRIOT Act became law, I joined a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators in introducing the SAFE Act, legislation to reform \nthe PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act was supported by advocates from the left \nand right, from the ACLU to the American Conservatives Union. \nProgressive Democrats and very conservative Republicans came together \nacross the partisan divide understanding Americans can be both safe and \nfree.\n  We wanted to retain the expanded powers of the PATRIOT Act but place \nsome reasonable limits to protect constitutional rights. When he joined \nthe Senate in 2005, Senator Barack Obama became a cosponsor of our SAFE \nAct. Here is what he said as a Senator:\n\n       We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices \n     our liberties or our safety. We can have one that secures \n     both.\n\n  I agree with then-Senator Obama. In 2006, the first time Congress \nreauthorized the PATRIOT Act, some reforms from the SAFE Act were \nincluded in the bill, and I supported it. However, many key protections \nfrom the SAFE Act were not included, so there are still significant \nproblems.\n  The FBI is still permitted to obtain a John Doe roving wiretap that \ndoes not identify the person or the phone that will be wiretapped. In \nother words, the FBI can obtain a wiretap without telling a court who \nthey want to wiretap or where they want to wiretap.\n  In garden variety criminal cases, the FBI is still permitted to \nconduct sneak-and-peak searches of a home without notifying the \nhomeowner about the search until a later time. We now know the vast \nmajority of sneak-and-peak searches take place in cases that do not \ninvolve terrorism in any way.\n  A national security letter, or NSL, is a form of administrative \nsubpoena issued by the FBI. We often hear NSLs compared to grand jury \nsubpoenas. But unlike a grand jury subpoena, a national security letter \nis issued without the approval of a grand jury or even a prosecutor. \nAnd unlike the grand jury subpoena, the recipient of an NSL is \nsubjected to a gag order at the FBI's discretion.\n  The PATRIOT Act also greatly expanded the FBI's authority to issue\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nNSLs. An NSL now allows the FBI to obtain sensitive personal \ninformation about innocent American citizens, including library \nrecords, medical records, gun records, and phone records even when \nthere is no connection whatsoever to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  The Justice Department's inspector general concluded that this \nstandard ``can be easily satisfied.'' This could lead to government \nfishing expeditions that target innocent people.\n  For years we have been told there is no reason to be concerned about \nthis broad grant of power to the FBI. In 2003, then-Attorney General \nAshcroft testified to our committee that librarians raising concerns \nabout the PATRIOT Act were ``hysterics'' and that ``the Department of \nJustice has neither the staffing, the time, nor the inclination to \nmonitor the reading habits of Americans.'' But we now know the FBI has, \nin fact, issued national security letters for the library records of \ninnocent people.\n  For years we were told the FBI was not abusing this broad grant of \npower. But in 2007, the Justice Department's own inspector general has \nconcluded the FBI was guilty of ``widespread and serious misuse'' of \nthe national security letter's authority and failed to report these \nabuses to Congress and the White House.\n  The inspector general reported that the number of national security \nletter requests has increased exponentially from about 8,500 the year \nbefore enactment of the PATRIOT Act to an average of more than 47,000 \nper year, and even these numbers were significantly understated.\n  We can be safe and free. I think it is important that the measure \nthat passed the Senate Judiciary Committee should have been on the \nSenate floor. It included an amendment which I offered with Senator \nLeahy and other provisions which I think are an improvement over the \ncurrent bill before us.\n  I will say one quick word about the amendment by Senator Paul. I do \nnot believe it is in our Nation's best interests to exempt gun records \nfrom terrorist investigations. For goodness' sake, when we are dealing \nwith people--terrorists using guns--searching the records to make \ncertain that we know the source of those guns and whether there are any \nother threats to this Nation is reasonable to do.\n  These should not be so sacred and sacrosanct that we do not ask the \nhard questions when our Nation's security is at risk. I would agree \nwith him that we ought to make certain there is a connection between \nthat request for gun record information and a suspected terrorist or \nspy. But to say these records cannot be asked for under the PATRIOT Act \ngoes too far. That is why I will oppose his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise to speak in opposition to Amendment No. 365, \nSenator Paul's amendment concerning suspicious activity reports, or \nwhat is referred to as SARS.\n  This amendment would prevent the Department of Treasury from \nrequiring any financial institution to submit a suspicious activity \nreport unless law enforcement first requests the report. If this \namendment should become law, it will effectively take away one of the \ngovernment's main weapons in the battle against money laundering and \nother financial crimes.\n  It will also negatively impact our efforts to detect and follow the \nflow of funds to and from international terrorists. It is important to \nremember that SARS are essentially tips from third-party financial \ninstitutions concerning suspicious transactions. Because law \nenforcement is not watching the financial transaction of every American \non a daily basis 24/7, they often have no idea that a person is even \nengaged in a financial crime until they receive a suspicious activity \nnotification from a financial institution. In a sense, SARs are not \nmuch different than the tips that law enforcement often receives from \nanonymous sources. These tips or leads can often form the basis for \ninitiating investigations that can be used to neutralize criminal or \nterrorist activities.\n\n  The problem with this amendment is that it would require the \ngovernment to look into a crystal ball in order to figure out when they \nshould request a SAR. With this logic, we should only allow law \nenforcement to act on an anonymous tip unless they ask for the tip to \nbe reported first. If a law enforcement or intelligence officer doesn't \nget a tip about suspicious activity, how in the world is he going to \nknow when it occurred in the first place? The answer here is simple: \nThey will likely never know it occurred until the criminal activity has \noccurred, and maybe it will even go undetected.\n  Look, for example, at the 9/11 hijackers. There was a minimum of 12 \nto 13 of those individuals who came into and out of the United States \nover a period of time. Money was transferred to and from those \nindividuals over a period of time. Under the requirements pre-PATRIOT \nAct, there was no suspicious activity detected. But after the enactment \nof the PATRIOT Act, there would be reason now for any financial \ninstitution to suspect the potential for suspicious activity from those \ntransfers of moneys.\n  That is exactly why we did what we did in the PATRIOT Act, and that \nis one of the reasons why we have not seen a subsequent direct attack \non U.S. soil from individuals who had been in the United States and \nhave received money through transfers, or whatever it may be. Let's \ndon't forget that section 215 business records cannot be obtained in an \narbitrary manner. There has to be, first of all, a determination that \nthere is some international connection between the individual whose \naccount has been deemed suspicious by the financial institution, and \nalso there has to be some follow-on procedure to determine that there \nis reason for the government to get hold of the financial records of \nthis individual.\n  In my mind, this amendment would put law enforcement in an \nunacceptable and unreasonable position. At the same time we are asking \nthem to pursue swindlers and money launderers more aggressively, we \nneed to preserve the requirement that financial institutions report \nsuspicious activities. We need to follow up on these leads not just \nfrom a criminal law enforcement perspective but from a national \nsecurity perspective as well.\n  Since 9/11, I have been involved with the Intelligence Committee all \nof those years. We do extensive oversight on this particular provision \nin the PATRIOT Act, as well as other provisions. We have hearings on \nthis from time to time, and we require the law enforcement officials to \ncome in and talk to us about what they are doing. To my knowledge, \nthere has never been one complaint or abuse that has been shown from \nthe use of this particular provision. This particular provision is \nworking exactly the way we intended it to work. It is a valuable tool \nfor our law enforcement.\n  Let me speak also about amendment No. 363, which is Senator Paul's \namendment concerning firearms records. Simply put, this amendment would \nmake it more difficult for national security investigators to prevent \nan act of terrorism inside the United States. The amendment would \nprohibit the use of a FISA business records court order to obtain \nfirearms records in the possession of a licensed firearms importer, \nmanufacturer, or dealer. Instead, national security investigators could \nonly obtain such records through a Federal grand jury subpoena during \nthe course of a criminal investigation or with a search warrant issued \nby a Federal magistrate upon a showing of reasonable cause to believe \nthat a violation of Federal firearms laws has occurred. That might not \nalways be possible.\n  For example, before MAJ Nidal Hasan began his deadly assault against \ninnocent military and civilian personnel at Fort Hood, TX, in November \n2009, there was no evidence that he had violated any criminal or \nFederal firearms laws. Thus, the FBI could not have relied on title 18 \nto obtain information about Hasan's purchase of the firearms used in \nthe attack.\n  As we have since learned, however, there was likely enough \nintelligence information to open a preliminary investigation on Hasan \nbecause of his contacts with a known al-Qaida member in Yemen, and seek \na section 215 order for information about his gun purchases. I don't \nunderstand why we would take this tool away from national security \ninvestigators, especially, here again, where there has been no \nindication of any abuse of this authority with respect to firearms or \nother sensitive records.\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n  Congress has conducted extensive oversight of the PATRIOT Act and \nFISA authority, and there have been no reports of any widespread abuse \nor misuse, and no reports that the government has ever used these \nauthorities to violate second amendment rights.\n  Moreover, the protections detailed in section 215 ensure that second \namendment rights are fully respected in the use of this authority. \nUnlike in criminal investigations where a Federal grand jury may issue \na subpoena for firearms records, any request for records under section \n215 must first be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt. As with all other section 215 records, the court must find that \nsuch records are relevant to an authorized national security \ninvestigation. This means the FBI cannot use this authority in a \ndomestic terrorism investigation, nor can the FBI randomly decide to \nsee whether an ordinary citizen or even a vocal advocate of the second \namendment owns a firearm.\n  There are two additional oversight safeguards that are built into the \nsection 215 process. First, each request for these sensitive records by \nthe FBI can only be approved by one of three high-level FBI officials--\nthe Director, the Deputy Director, or the Executive Assistant Director \nfor National Security.\n  Second, there are also specific reporting requirements that are \ndesigned to keep Congress informed about the number of orders issued \nfor these types of sensitive records.\n  One of the big lessons we learned after the 9/11 terrorist attacks \nwas that we needed to make sure national security investigators had \naccess to investigative tools similar to those that have long been \navailable to law enforcement. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act addresses \nthat need. It provides an alternative way to obtain business records, \nincluding firearms records, in situations where there may be a national \nsecurity threat but not yet a criminal investigation or violation.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of the second amendment. There is \nnobody in this body who has a better voting record on the second \namendment than I do. Probably nobody here owns as many guns as I own, \nbut I use them for legal and lawful purposes. I will work with the \nNational Rifle Association and any citizen group to make sure that \nneither this law nor any Federal law is misused to infringe on the \nsecond amendment rights of any law-abiding citizen. But this particular \namendment would harm legitimate national security investigations.\n  I want to take a minute to read a letter I received from Chris Cox, \nexecutive director of the National Rifle Association:\n\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: Thank you for asking about the \n     National Rifle Association's position on a motion to table \n     amendment No. 363 to the PATRIOT Act. The NRA takes a back \n     seat to no one when it comes to protecting gun owners' rights \n     against government abuse. Over the past three decades, we \n     fought successfully to block unnecessary and intrusive \n     compilation of firearms-related records by several Federal \n     agencies, and will continue to protect the privacy of our \n     members and all American gun owners.\n       While well-intentioned, the language of this amendment, as \n     currently drafted, raises potential problems for gun owners, \n     in that it encourages the government to use provisions in \n     current law that allow access to firearms records without \n     reasonable cause, warrant, or judicial oversight of any kind. \n     Based on these concerns, and the fact that the NRA does not \n     ordinarily take positions on procedural votes, we have no \n     position on a motion to table amendment No. 363.\n\n  For those reasons, I intend to vote against both of these amendments. \nWhile I appreciate the intent and the emotion with which my friend \nSenator Paul comes to the floor to advocate, we need to make sure we \nget these extensions in place immediately, so we have no gap in the \ncoverage available to our intelligence community, and that we continue \nto give them the tools they need to protect America and protect \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1114, a short-term one-month PATRIOT \nAct sunset extension bill, which is currently at the desk; that the \nbill be read the third time, and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COONS. I am disappointed my unanimous consent request was not \nagreed to. I wish to explain my action here today. The comments I am \nabout to give are an explanation of a vote I intended to take later \ntoday.\n  As Senator Chambliss said just before me, the powers of the PATRIOT \nAct are too important for us to risk their expiration as this body \nconsiders whether to amend them or revise them. I could not agree more.\n  I offered a 1-month extension in order that this body may take the \ntime that is needed and deserved to seriously debate and conduct \noversight over the PATRIOT Act. This is a significant piece of national \nsecurity legislation that I believe is worthy of further consideration \nand debate.\n  Law enforcement agencies--Federal, State, and local--work day in and \nday out to protect all of us from real threats that go largely unknown \nand unnoticed by most Americans. I want law enforcement to have all the \nappropriate tools in their toolbox to accomplish this goal.\n  Unfortunately, there are also, in my view, legitimate concerns about \nthe legislation on which we are about to vote--concerns that my \ncolleagues and I, including the occupant of the chair, on the Judiciary \nCommittee, reviewed and addressed in detail, and in a bill ultimately \npassed, S. 193, which forms the core of the Leahy-Paul amendment of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. We put those provisions before this Chamber. I \nam disappointed we don't have consent to move forward in order to have \ntime to debate these reforms to the PATRIOT Act. As Americans, the \nchoice between liberty and safety is not one or the other. We expect \nand demand both. Balancing the two responsibly requires careful \nconsideration to each.\n  We must be cognizant of our Nation's very real enemies who intend to \ndo us harm, just as they did on September 11. It was awareness of this \ndanger in the world that motivated this Congress, as we have heard in \nprevious speeches, to enact the PATRIOT Act, nearly 10 years ago now, \nin the wake of those attacks. A grave new threat called for bold new \nauthorities. Though I was not then in the Senate, I likely too would \nhave voted for its passage.\n  But this body's passage of that act did not amount to a permanent \nchoice of security over liberty. Because of the broad scope of the new \nauthorities in the PATRIOT Act, the bipartisan drafters of the bill \ninsisted upon placing key sunset provisions in the bill to ensure that \nCongress periodically reviewed how they were being used and assessed \nwhether they were still essential to our security.\n  Even in the unnerving weeks after \n9/11--an extraordinary time in the history of this Congress and this \nNation--the authors of the PATRIOT Act knew that the powers they were \ngranting needed to be monitored.\n  Sunsets are critical to ensuring that the PATRIOT authorities are not \nabused by the government. They are critical.\n  It's because of sunsets that every 4 years, the FBI must return to \nCongress and justify its use of the PATRIOT Act overall and three \nprovisions in particular: the roving wiretap, the lone wolf authority, \nand Sec. 215 orders, which allow the government to demand virtually any \ndocument or other evidence pertaining to an individual from a third \nparty.\n  Sunsets only work, however, if we in Congress have the innate courage \nto ask the difficult questions when they arise. If, instead, Congress \nshies away from the tough debate and simply extends the sunsets for \nanother 4 years, we surrender our responsibility to consider whether \nspecific provisions should be amended, reauthorized, or allowed to \nexpire.\n  If the proposed 4-year extension passes without amendment, it will \nhave been 9 years before Congress votes on reforms to PATRIOT--9 years.\n  What is the point of having sunsets in this bill if we are going to \nignore our oversight responsibilities?\n  Regretfully, I cannot support any measure that extends controversial \nand searching PATRIOT authorities until 2015 if this body does not \nfirst consider whether the act is in need of amendment. And so I must.\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n  The Judiciary Committee did exactly what it is supposed to do and has \nworked for months on improving the PATRIOT Act ahead of this deadline. \nIt was a difficult, bipartisan debate but the bill we produced is \nstrong and deserved to be considered by the full body. Chairman Leahy \ndeserves credit for crafting a set of commonsense, responsible \namendments.\n  In each of the last two Congresses, the Judiciary Committee reported \na bipartisan PATRIOT reauthorization bill. In each case, the bills \nwould have made important revisions to PATRIOT without compromising \nnational security. Also in each case, the bills were reported out in \nplenty of time for this full body to consider them. In each case, no \nfloor action was taken until such a late hour that meaningful debate \nover the expiring provisions has been precluded.\n  The Judiciary-reported bill, S. 193, which forms the basis of the \nLeahy-Paul amendment, deserves consideration. It deserves consideration \nbecause our serious consideration of reforms sends the strong message \nthat the PATRIOT authorities are not a blank check, that we in Congress \nare watching closely to make sure that the use of PATRIOT is consistent \nwith our shared national respect for individual liberty and freedom.\n  The Leahy-Paul amendment also deserves consideration because the last \n5 years have shown us that substantive revisions to PATRIOT are called-\nfor and, indeed, necessary. I would like to speak briefly about just \none necessary change, those to the national security letter program.\n  National security letters, or NSLs are administrative subpoenas that \nallow the government to demand subscriber information from third \nparties without even having to go to a judge. These orders are also \nextraordinary in that they prohibit recipients from telling anyone of \ntheir existence.\n  In 2007 and 2008, the Department of Justice inspector general found \nmassive abuses in the NSL Program, with tens of thousands of NSLs \nissued for purposes that had nothing to do with national security. \nFurther, in 2008, a court found that the gag order in each NSL was \nunconstitutional.\n  Plainly, NSLs are in need of revision, both to bring them in line \nwith the Constitution and to guard against abuses that have nothing to \ndo with national security. I support legislation that would require \nthat DOJ maintain sufficient internal guidelines to ensure that NSLs \nare only issued when the agents issuing them state facts that show \nrelevance to national security. I also favor amending the gag order so \nthat any recipient can immediately challenge it in court.\n  These simple reforms as well as the others contained in the Leahy-\nPaul amendment, do not make our Nation more vulnerable to attack. That \nis why, in 2010, the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence sent a letter to Congress expressing the view that \nlegislation almost identical to Leahy-Paul ``strikes the right balance \nby both reauthorizing these essential national security tools and \nenhancing statutory protections for civil liberties and privacy in the \nexercise of these and related authorities.''\n  These reforms make our Nation more secure because they strengthen our \nplace in the world as the cradle of liberty.\n  I don't want to repeal the PATRIOT Act, but at this moment we have a \nchoice, and a chance--our last chance for 4 years--we can push forward \nwith a bill that does nothing to improve PATRIOT--nothing to factor in \neverything that is changed in the last 5 years, or we can vote down \nthis long-term extension, vote for a short-term extension and move to \ndebate of the reforms that the Judiciary Committee has already worked \nup.\n  The PATRIOT Act is important to our national security, but I cannot \nsupport the abdication of Congress's role in strengthening it.\n  If I might, in summation, simply say this: If we were today to pass a \n4-year extension, without amendment or revision, it will have been 9 \nyears that Congress does not act in any substantive way on the \namendments. I join Senator Leahy in intending to vote ``no'' today, not \nbecause I believe the PATRIOT Act is fundamentally flawed or because I \nbelieve the United States doesn't face real enemies, but because I \nthink this Congress has not taken seriously its very real oversight \nresponsibilities, its need to strike that balance. The Judiciary \nCommittee did that hard work. For this Congress to not amend this bill \nwith the simple balanced and reasonable amendment offered in the Leahy-\nPaul amendment, I believe I am compelled to strike the balance between \nsecurity and liberty on the side of liberty today, by saying this body \nhas failed to act and to appropriately conduct thorough oversight of \nthis bill before we send it 4 years into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of Senator \nPaul, No. 365. This amendment would effectively wipe out a critical \ntool used against terrorists and drug traffickers. I want to explain \nexactly what these suspicious activities reports are and why they are \nso essential to the FBI and other law enforcement people.\n  First of all, who uses them? FBI, organized crime units, drug \ntrafficking task forces, border security, Secret Service, State and \nlocal police, and the intelligence community all use these SARs. \nSecond, what are they used for? There was a report from the GAO in 2009 \nwhich said the following: How are SARs used? They gave a number of \nexamples:\n  The FBI includes SAR data in its Investigative Data Warehouse to \nidentify:\n\n     financial patterns associated with money laundering, bank \n     fraud, and other aberrant financial activities.\n\n  Second, Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force's Fusion Center \ncombines SAR data with other data to:\n\n     produce comprehensive integrated intelligence products and \n     charts.\n\n  Third, the IRS uses SARs to identify:\n\n     financial crimes, including individual and corporate tax \n     frauds and terrorist activities.\n\n  We received a letter just today from the Attorney General of the \nUnited States strongly opposing this amendment of Senator Paul, and \nthis is what the Attorney General says:\n\n       SARs are a critical tool for our national security and law \n     enforcement professionals. SARs are used to alert \n     intelligence and law enforcement personnel to issues that \n     warrant further investigation and scrutiny. The purpose of \n     the SAR regime is to require financial institutions to report \n     on suspicious activities based on information that is solely \n     within their possession. Prior to the filing of a SAR, our \n     law enforcement and intelligence analysts often are not aware \n     that a particular bank account or individual may be \n     associated with criminal activity or may be engaged in \n     activities that pose a threat to national security, such as \n     the funding of terrorist activities.\n\n  Then the Attorney General goes on:\n\n       Conditioning the filing of SARs upon a request from law \n     enforcement would undermine this purpose. By definition, SARs \n     are designed to alert law enforcement to information not \n     otherwise within its possession.\n\n  The Paul amendment, No. 365, is very short, but what it does is say \nyou must have a request of an appropriate law enforcement agency for \nthe report before there is a requirement to file a suspicious activity \nreport. As the Attorney General points out in his letter, that would \ntotally undermine the purpose of the SAR requirement.\n  Finally, the Attorney General points out the following:\n  How much time do I have remaining, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The Attorney General further points out:\n\n       It is also important to note that SARs themselves are \n     confidential under law (i.e., not available to the public) \n     and cannot be used as evidence. They contain information \n     that, if used by law enforcement personnel, must be further \n     investigated and proven before adverse action is taken. The \n     reports are only made available to law enforcement, \n     intelligence, and appropriate supervisory agencies under \n     applicable authorities and are subject to the protections of \n     Federal law.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of the letter from the Attorney General.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                             Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: I understand that Senator \n     Paul may offer an amendment today to S. 990 which would \n     modify Section 5318(g)(1) of Title 31, United States Code, to \n     allow for the issuance of Suspicious Activity Reports \n     (``SARs'') by financial institutions ``only upon request of \n     an appropriate law enforcement agency. . . .'' I write to \n     express the Department's serious concerns about such an \n     amendment.\n       SARs are a critical tool for our national security and law \n     enforcement professionals. SARs are used to alert \n     intelligence and law enforcement personnel to issues that \n     warrant further investigation and scrutiny. The purpose of \n     the SAR regime is to require financial institutions to report \n     on suspicious activities based on information that is solely \n     within their possession. Prior to the filing of a SAR, our \n     law enforcement and intelligence analysts often are not aware \n     that a particular bank account or individual may be \n     associated with criminal activity or may be engaged in \n     activities that pose a threat to national security, such as \n     the funding of terrorist activities.\n       Conditioning the filing of SARs upon a request from law \n     enforcement would undermine this purpose. By definition, SARs \n     are designed to alert law enforcement to information not \n     otherwise within its possession. By placing the onus on law \n     enforcement to request information--about which it is \n     unaware--this amendment would take away from law enforcement \n     a critical building block of financial investigations and \n     terrorist financing intelligence. In this way, the proposed \n     amendment would severely undermine the usefulness of the SAR \n     regime, and eliminate an effective tool in the fight against \n     financial fraud and, critically, terrorism.\n       It is also important to note that SARs themselves are \n     confidential under law (i.e., not available to the public) \n     and cannot be used as evidence. They contain information \n     that, if used by law enforcement personnel, must be further \n     investigated and proven before adverse action is taken. The \n     reports are only made available to law enforcement, \n     intelligence, and appropriate supervisory agencies under \n     applicable authorities and are subject to the protections of \n     Federal law.\n       In sum, the current SARs regime is critical to our national \n     security and law enforcement activities, while also \n     respectful of the privacy interests of Americans.\n       For these reasons, I urge that the amendment not be \n     adopted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Paul amendment would throw out the \nwindow a legitimate and useful law enforcement tool. It has worked \neffectively. Three courts have said it is constitutional. I hope the \nPaul amendment is tabled, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, suspicious activity \nreports, or SARs, are just what they seem--reports by banks and other \nfinancial institutions when they come across obviously suspicious \nactivity by one of their customers. They have been, and continue to be, \nvaluable lead information for law enforcement in investigating and \nprosecuting terrorism, major money laundering offenses, and other \nserious crimes.\n  The Bank Secrecy Act authorizes Treasury to require financial \ninstitutions to report suspicious activity to law enforcement. In \nresponse, the Treasury Department has created an extensive and \neffective system for banks, casinos, securities firms, money service \nbusinesses, and other financial institutions to file SARs that are \nregularly reviewed by law enforcement.\n  SARs are used by the FBI, organized crime units, drug trafficking \ntask forces, border security, Secret Service, State and local police, \nand more. They have enabled the prosecution of a great number of \nserious crimes over the years.\n  Law enforcement agencies use SAR data daily to fight terrorist \nfinancing, money laundering, drug trafficking, corruption, financial \nfraud, mortgage fraud, and illicit money flows of all types. A 2009 GAO \nreport gave these examples of how SARs are used:\n\n       FBI includes SAR data in its Investigative Data Warehouse \n     to identify ``financial patterns associated with money \n     laundering, bank fraud, and other aberrant financial \n     activities.'' It uses SAR data to investigate ``criminal, \n     terrorist, and intelligence networks.''\n       The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force's Fusion \n     Center combines SAR data with other data to ``produce \n     comprehensive integrated intelligence products and charts.''\n       The IRS uses SARs to identify ``financial crimes, including \n     individual and corporate tax frauds, and terrorist \n     activity.''\n       The Secret Service uses SAR data to ``map and track trends \n     in financial crimes.''\n\n  Sharply restricting current law and longstanding practice, this \namendment would only authorize the reporting of SARs after a law \nenforcement agency makes a specific request of a bank, money service \nbusiness, or other entity, which would in turn require a demonstration \nthat suspicious activity already exists, rendering a SARS filing moot.\n  It would basically turn SARs reporting upside down by requiring law \nenforcement to establish the basis for an investigation before \nrequesting a SAR, rather than relying upon a SAR to initiate or \nsupplement an investigation that would then lead to a search warrant or \nsubpoena.\n  So instead of being used as leads, flagging drug or terrorism-related \nor money laundering activity for law enforcement, under the amendment \nSARSs would simply confirm suspicious activity. That would severely \ndegrade their value, which is to make law enforcement aware of \npotential criminal activity.\n  If the United States were to disable its SAR reporting system by \nrequiring individual requests for SAR reports, it would invite the \nworst of criminals to misuse U.S. financial institutions for their \nschemes, knowing their activities would not automatically be reported \nto law enforcement. It makes no sense, especially in a context where \nthere is no serious claim that these legal authorities have been \nmisused.\n  How does the system work now, as a practical matter? Let's say a drug \ndealer comes into a bank with $9,000 in cash and the cash reeks of \nmarijuana. Under current law, the teller is trained to flag that \ntransaction, and compliance officers in the bank's back office would \nassess it and likely file a SAR, to be examined by law enforcement.\n  Let's say that the same person does this in four or five banks in \ntown that same afternoon, with the same amounts, structured to be just \nbelow reporting limits, reeking of marijuana. Now he is effectively \nlaundered almost $50,000 in one day. I would say we at least want to \nknow about that, and the system now enables that. Under this amendment, \nthat would all go by the boards.\n  Let's say the person is a terrorist conspirator or arms proliferator. \nSame scenario, only this time with a twist--a series of large \nstructured cash deposits in a series of banks here on the same day, \nthat are then the next day wired to the same overseas account in \nPakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq, withdrawn by a coconspirator there, \nand used to buy IEDs to hit U.S. troops.\n  Would we not want those transactions at least flagged by responsible \nbank officials and assessed for patterns? I think so, and I think my \ncolleagues will agree.\n  If the thresholds in this amendment were implemented, very few SARs \nwould be filed because there would be no reason for law enforcement to \nrequest that SARs be filed after identifying suspicious activity by \nother means. Law enforcement would instead obtain a search warrant to \nobtain all relevant information--i.e., the underlying bank records--\nfrom the financial institution.\n  The amendment would also cause the United States to be in \nnoncompliance with international anti-money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing standards--for instance, the recommendations of the Financial \nAction Task Force, FATF, which require suspicious activity reporting \nwhen a financial institution has reasonable grounds to suspect criminal \nactivity.\n  This is a very serious problem. For years other countries have looked \nto us for guidance and best practices on these issues. This amendment \nwould make the United States an outlier bank secrecy jurisdiction.\n  SARs themselves do not unreasonably impinge on personal privacy. The \nreports are confidential and cannot be used as evidence. They contain \nallegations that must be further investigated and proven before adverse \naction is taken by law enforcement.\n  The reports are only made available to law enforcement, intelligence, \nand appropriate supervisory agencies under applicable authorities and \nare subject to the protections of the Federal Privacy Act.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this unwise and ill-conceived \namendment.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today's vote to extend \nexpiring provisions of the so-called PATRIOT Act is not the first time \nCongress has extended the sunset provisions, nor will it be the last. \nIn 2006, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act was passed \nand, among other things, extended until December 2009 the three \nprovisions we are discussing today. When those provisions were set to \nexpire, a 3-month extension was included in the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act. Three months later, Congress passed a 1-year \nextension until February 2011. As that deadline loomed, and without \nsufficient time to have a real debate, we passed the extension that \nexpires at midnight tonight.\n  Immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it may have been \nunderstandable that our emotions made it unlikely that we would have a \nrationale and deliberative debate about the PATRIOT Act. But at the \ntime, as I voted against the bill, I said on the House floor that ``the \nsaving grace here is that the sunset provision forces us to come back \nand to look at these issues again when heads are cooler and when we are \nnot in the heat of battle.''\n  But that hasn't happened. Each time a sunset date nears, we hear a \nlot of highly charged rhetoric from Members in both parties and in both \nChambers of Congress about how devastating it will be to our national \nsecurity if we let the PATRIOT Act expire. I find this to be deeply \ndisturbing because it demonstrates that 10 years after the attacks on \n9/11 we are still using fear to prevent an open and honest debate.\n  Let's put this rhetoric aside and discuss the facts. First, the \nPATRIOT Act is not about to expire. Three provisions of the law are set \nto expire, but the vast majority of the authorities contained in the \nlaw will remain unchanged.\n  Two of the expiring provisions were enacted as part of the PATRIOT \nAct. Section 206 of the act amended FISA to permit multipoint, or \n``roving,'' wiretaps. Section 215 enlarged the scope of materials that \ncould be sought under FISA to include ``any tangible thing.'' It also \nlowered the standard required before a court order may be issued to \ncompel their production. The third provision was enacted in 2004 as \npart of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, IRTPA. \nThis provision changed the rules regarding the types of individuals who \nmay be targets of FISA-authorized searches. Also known as the ``lone \nwolf'' provision, it permits surveillance of non-U.S. persons engaged \nin international terrorism without requiring evidence linking those \npersons to an identifiable foreign power or terrorist organization.\n  Let's also be clear about what would happen if these provisions did \nexpire. The two provisions from the PATRIOT Act that amended FISA \nauthorities would read as they did before the PATRIOT Act was passed in \n2001. That means they would not be revoked completely but instead would \nbe more limited in scope. And what would happen if the ``lone wolf'' \nprovision expired? Not much. In the 7 years since its enactment, it is \nnever been used.\n  Even if the provisions expire, they contain exceptions for ongoing \ninvestigations, and the government can continue to use those provisions \nbeyond the sunset date. This is what a recent CRS report says about \nthis:\n\n       A grandfather clause applies to each of the three \n     provisions. The grandfather clauses authorize the continued \n     effect of the amendments with respect to investigations that \n     began, or potential offenses that took place, before the \n     provision's sunset date. Thus, for example, if a non-U.S. \n     person were engaged in international terrorism before the \n     sunset date of May 27, 2011, he would still be considered a \n     ``lone wolf'' for FISA court orders sought after the \n     provision has expired. Similarly, if an individual is engaged \n     in international terrorism before that date, he may be the \n     target of a roving wiretap under FISA even after authority \n     for new roving wiretaps has expired.\n\n  Those are pretty broad exceptions, and I am fairly confident that our \nability to protect the Nation would continue even if the three \nprovisions expire. So let's put the hyperbole aside and not stoke \nirrational fears for political expediency.\n  I am very disappointed that we couldn't have a candid debate and an \nopportunity to vote on several amendments. With a decade of hindsight, \nmore voices from very different places on the political spectrum agree \nthat the entire law bears scrutiny and debate. We should no longer \nneglect our duty to review the full scope of a law with such serious \nconstitutional challenges before rushing to reauthorize it, again.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I support a clean reauthorization of \nthe expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and against Senator \nPaul's amendment on firearms records. Over the years, I have always \nsupported and defended the second amendment. I have consistently voted \nto ensure that the Federal Government does not limit the constitutional \nrights of the millions of American gun owners. I cannot support the \namendment offered today by Senator Paul because it will damage the \nprospects of ensuring that critical national security laws are not \nreauthorized and could potentially hurt the second amendment rights of \nAmerican citizens. In fact, the National Rifle Association said today \nin a vote alert, ``While well-intentioned, the language of this \namendment as currently drafted raises potential problems for gun \nowners, in that it encourages the government to use provisions in \ncurrent law that allow access to firearms records without reasonable \ncause, warrant or judicial oversight of any kind.''\n  Senator Paul's amendment actually removes protections from firearms \nowners. Currently, under the PATRIOT Act, in order to obtain firearms \nrecords, investigators must first go through a rigorous application \nprocess and then seek a Federal judge's approval. Senator Paul's \namendment would remove this judicial review.\n  If Senator Paul's amendment became law and removed judicial review, \ninvestigators would then use a grand jury subpoena in order to obtain \nthe records. A grand jury subpoena is a process that has neither a \nrigorous approval process, nor judicial review. Thus, Senator Paul's \namendment, while intending to protect second amendment rights, actually \nbackfires in that effort.\n  First, let's talk about the rigorous approval process that controls \nwhether firearms records can be obtained under the PATRIOT Act. And \nremember, this process does not exist under criminal law when using a \ngrand jury subpoena. To obtain gun records under the PATRIOT Act, a \nsection 215 order is used. The use of section 215 orders has been \nreviewed by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General, \nwhich issued a report in March 2007 that outlined the existing process; \nthat is, the 10 layers of review before it is even sent to a Federal \njudge are as follows:\n  No. 1, the FBI field agent.\n  No. 2, the FBI field office supervisor.\n  No. 3, the field office's Special Agent in Charge.\n  No. 4, the field office's District Counsel.\n  No. 5, it is then forwarded to FBI headquarters, where it is reviewed \nby a National Security Law Branch lawyer.\n  No. 6, the National Security Law Branch Supervisor.\n  No. 7, the request is then sent to the Department of Justice's Office \nof Intelligence for review by a lawyer.\n  No. 8, if the request survives these seven approvals, the request is \nsent back to the field office for an accuracy review.\n  No. 9, the request is then approved by an Office of Intelligence \nsupervisor.\n  No. 10, then one of the three highest ranking officials in the FBI \nmust personally approve the request, either the Director, the Deputy \nDirector, or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security.\n  After approval by the field office, the FBI's National Security Law \nBranch, the DOJ's Office of Intelligence, the field office again, and \nfinally by one of the three highest officials of the FBI, then an \nOffice of Intelligence lawyer presents the application package to the \ncourt for approval.\n  A federally appointed district judge, serving on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court, FISA, reviews the request and holds a \nhearing. At this hearing, the court can ask questions and make any \nchanges the independent judge deems appropriate. If approved, the \nsigned order is then returned to the FBI field office to be served by \nthe agent.\n  This is a very long process, and it takes, on average, over 140 days \nto get\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\na section 215 order. It requires 11 separate approvals before any \nrecords could be obtained. Yet Senator Paul's amendment will completely \neliminate this investigative tool. A section 215 order provides greater \nprotections of second amendment rights than the alternative, which is a \ngrand jury subpoena as part of a criminal investigation.\n  The alternative method of obtaining firearms records is a grand jury \nsubpoena. It is rarely used as an alternative in the national security \ncontext. First, investigators must have a criminal nexus before it can \nseek a grand jury subpoena. This means there must be either criminal \nactivity or a Federal firearms violation. Sometimes, when investigating \nterrorism, no criminal nexus exists. Senator Paul's amendment would \nprevent obtaining gun records in foreign intelligence investigations \nthat have no criminal nexus.\n  More often, a suspected terrorist comes across our radar long before \nhe ever does anything that would rise to the level of a criminal \nviolation. Senator Paul's amendment would mean that the FBI could not \nget information that a suspected terrorist is legally buying firearms \nuntil after he actually takes the shot or does something else criminal. \nAt this point, it is too late to prevent an act of terrorism from \noccurring.\n  It does not make any sense to allow criminal investigators access to \nfirearms records but prohibit terrorism investigators the same access. \nThat scenario is why we in Congress acted to amend the law following 9/\n11. This is simply another attempt to rebuild ``the wall'' between \nintelligence and criminal law that caused the failure connecting the \ndots prior to 9/11.\n  Remember, these sorts of records are crucial to the early stages of a \nterror investigation. It allows the government to connect the dots. \nThis authority can only be used with prior approval from a Senate-\nconfirmed, lifetime-appointed, independent, article 3, Federal district \ncourt judge. I am not sure how many more times I need to repeat the \nfact, that records are only provided after judicial review.\n  Those who claim that there are no controls have not read or have not \nunderstood the law.\n  I trust an independent judge who can, and will, say no if legal \nrequirements are not met, if a request appears to over-reach, or if the \nlaw does not allow it.\n  Judicial review is one very important safeguard in place every time a \nsection 215 order is requested, which is the tool to request firearms \nrecords. This safeguard is over and above those that exist in criminal \ncases. A vote for the Paul amendment is a vote to take away this \njudicial review.\n  No judge reviews a grand jury subpoena before it is issued. Yet, in \nmore serious, national security cases, to obtain firearms records, a \njudge must approve the request and issue an order. That means it is \nmore difficult to obtain records with a section 215 order in a national \nsecurity case than it is in a less serious criminal case with a grand \njury subpoena.\n  I don't know why we insist on making it harder to investigate acts of \nterrorism than to investigate fraud and illegal drugs.\n  Section 215 orders offer more protection than what the Constitution \nrequires. The Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Miller, has held that business \nrecords, such as banking deposit slips or car rental records or \nfirearms records, are not subject to fourth amendment protections \nbecause the customer has no reasonable expectation of privacy in \ndocuments that are in the possession of third parties.\n  The constitutional argument that a section 215 order is an \nunreasonable search in violation of the fourth amendment is completely \ncontrary to what the Supreme Court has been saying for over 35 years. \nThus, section 215 orders offer greater protection than what the \nConstitution requires.\n  There are no reported abuses of section 215 orders. And if this tool \nwas being abused, people know that I would be eager to hold \ninvestigators accountable.\n  In fact, I will pledge to work with all groups and supporters of the \nsecond amendment, such as the National Rifle Association, to ensure \nthat PATRIOT Act authorities are not used to circumvent existing \nprohibitions on obtaining U.S. citizen gun records. I support the goal \nSenator Paul is trying to achieve, namely protecting the constitutional \nrights of all gun owners. However, his amendment goes too far.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment 363 and support a clean \nextension of the expiring PATRIOT Act authorities.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, although the PATRIOT Act is not a perfect \nlaw, it provides our intelligence and law enforcement communities with \ncrucial tools to keep our homeland safe and thwart terrorism. While I \nam disappointed we were not able to include any of the sensible \noversight and civil liberties protections included in the bill reported \nby the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, I strongly support \nthe Senate's effort to ensure that these important authorities do not \nexpire.\n  The raid that killed Osama bin Laden also yielded an enormous amount \nof new information that has spurred dozens of investigations yielding \nnew leads every day. Without the PATRIOT Act, investigators would not \nhave the tools they need to follow these new leads and disrupt \nterrorist plots, putting our national security at risk.\n  Finally, we have worked expeditiously to pass this legislation to \nreauthorize these critical intelligence tools. If for some reason this \nbill is not enacted before May 27 and there is a brief lapse in the \nauthorities, there should be no doubt that it is Congress's intent that \nthis bill reauthorizes the authorities in their current form and does \nso until June 2015.\n  How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 22 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Who controls that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the majority, and \nthe Senator from Kentucky controls 2 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I am happy to yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. REID.

Had I been able to attend today's vote, I would have voted \nagain with the majority to extend these provisions.\n  Additionally, I would have voted to table amendment No. 363, which \nwould have prohibited the use of any PATRIOT Act authorities to \ninvestigate or procure records relating to firearms. I would also have \nvoted to table\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\namendment No. 365, which would have sharply curtailed existing rules \nthat help the Treasury track the financial activities of terrorists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be no more votes today. That was \nthe last vote for this week. We will have a vote on the Monday we get \nback in the evening at around 5 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3402-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor and \ncommemorate the men and women who died fighting for our great country.\n  Memorial Day is a day to honor those American heroes who made the \nultimate sacrifice for our Nation. It is because of their sacrifice \nthat we can safely enjoy the freedoms our great country offers. It is \nbecause of their unmatched commitment that America can remain a beacon \nfor democracy and freedom throughout the world.\n  Memorial Day is a day of remembrance, but it is also a day of \nreflection. When our brave men and women volunteered to protect our \nNation, we promised them we would take care of them and their families \nwhen they return home.\n  On this Memorial Day, we need to ask ourselves: Are we doing enough \nfor our Nation's veterans? Making sure our veterans can find jobs when \nthey come back home is an area where we must do more.\n  For too long, we have been investing billions of dollars training our \nyoung men and women to protect our Nation, only to ignore them when \nthey come home. For too long, we have patted them on the back and \npushed them into the job market with no support. That is simply \nunacceptable, and it does not meet the promise we made to our \nservicemembers.\n  Our hands-off approach has left us with an unemployment rate of over \n27 percent among young veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThat is 1 in 5 of our Nation's heroes who cannot find a job to support \ntheir family and who do not have an income to provide the stability \nthat is so critical to their transition home.\n  That is exactly why earlier this month I introduced the Hiring Heroes \nAct of 2011, which is now cosponsored by 17 Senators and has garnered \nbipartisan support. This legislation will rethink the way we support \nour men and women in uniform when they come home to look for a job.\n  I introduced this critical legislation because I have heard firsthand \nfrom so many veterans that we have not done enough to provide them with \nthe support they need to find work.\n  I have heard from medics who return home from treating battlefield \nwounds who cannot get certification to be an EMT or drive an ambulance. \nI have heard from veterans who tell me they no longer write that they \nare a veteran on their resume because they fear the stigma they believe \nemployers attach to the invisible wounds of war.\n  These stories are heartbreaking and they are frustrating. But more \nthan anything, they are a reminder that we have to act now.\n  My legislation will allow our servicemembers to capitalize on their \nservice. For the first time, it will require broad job skills training \nfor anyone leaving the military as part of the military's Transition \nAssistance Program. Today, over one-third of those leaving the Army do \nnot get any of that training.\n  My bill will also require the Department of Labor to take a hard look \nat what military skills and training should be translatable into the \ncivilian sector and will work to make it simpler to get those licenses \nand certifications our veterans need.\n  All of these are real, substantial steps to put our veterans to work. \nAll of them come at a pivotal time for our economic recovery and our \nveterans.\n  I grew up with the Vietnam war. I have dedicated much of my Senate \ncareer helping to care for the veterans we left behind that time. The \nmistakes we made then cost our Nation and our veterans dearly. Today, \nwe risk repeating those mistakes. We cannot let that happen again.\n  Our Nation's veterans are disciplined, they are team players who have \nproven they can deliver under pressure like no one else. So let's not \nlet another year and another Memorial Day go by without us delivering \nfor them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time that \nwould expire at 6:15 be extended to 6:30, and other times adjusted \naccordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3402-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3402-S3406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ISRAEL'S BORDERS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to \nvisit with one of my true heroes, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was here and \ngraced us with his presence this week. Last March, I was in Jerusalem, \nhad some quality time with him, and we kind of relived the experiences \nwe have had in the past when he was Prime Minister before. That was \nback in the middle 1990s. I had a chance to talk to him. As I recall, \nhis concern at that time--what he said at that time--two major \nconcerns. One is, what is happening in Iran, and then, of course, \nmaking sure that the land in Israel right now will stay there.\n  Recently, I had a chance to visit with him again. I was quite \nsurprised when he came here and he was met with this suggestion that \nthings are going to change and that maybe we would encourage Israel to \ngo back to their 1967 borders.\n  I can assure you that we will do everything we can to keep that from \nhappening. I want to make sure we get the message out there, that this \nmay be President Obama talking, it is not the majority of people in \nAmerica, as was witnessed by the 30 standing ovations that Prime \nMinister Netanyahu got in his joint speech.\n  It sounded familiar when we are talking about this, about the land. I \nremembered that it was 10 years ago--10 years ago right now, 2001--that \nI made a speech, and it jogged my memory when I heard the President \ntalking about going back to the 1967 borders. So I dug up that speech. \nI found it, and I found that it is so appropriate today.\n  This was a speech, by the way--the research done for this speech was \ndone by a guy named Willie George. He was a preacher, a pastor, but a \nhistorian. I want to put the same perspective on this we did 10 years \nago and see how that applies today.\n  First of all, I am going to do something that is unusual on the floor \nof the Senate; that is, I am going quote Ephesians 6. Listen carefully. \nIt says: For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against \nprincipalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this \nworld, against spirit wickedness in high places.\n  It is significant that we look at that, because make no mistake about \nit, the war that was started 10 years ago and the war we are in right \nnow, that we are fighting now, is first and foremost a spiritual war, \nnot a political war--never has been a political war. It is not about \npolitics. It is a spiritual war. It has its roots in spiritual \nconflict. It is a war to destroy the very fabric of our society and the \nvery things for which we stand.\n  Many of the wars in history are wars where people are trying to take \nover something another country has. That is not what this is about. Not \nabout getting mineral deposits, not about getting land from other \ncountries. This is a different war.\n  It is not simple greed that motivates these people to kill. One may \nask, what is it about our Nation that makes\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nthem--here I am talking about some of the Hamas, Hezbollah, the \nterrorists--hate us so much? I suggest there are three things. First, \nin our country we have the freedom and the right to choose the kind of \nworship we want. I happen to be a Jesus guy, a born-again Christian, \nall that. I believe the way to the Lord God is through his Son.\n  While I believe that, I believe every American has the right to \nchoose whether he or she wants to believe that. Some people have the \nnotion that if you are a Christian who believes in the Bible, you are \ntotally intolerant, you do not allow other people to have a choice. \nNothing can be further from the truth.\n  The nations of this world where Christianity is the dominant way of \nworship, we also find Jewish synagogues, we find Islamic mosques, we \nfind freedom of worship. You will not find the same kind of things in \nthe militant Islamic nations of this world. They do not allow Christian \nchurches. They do not allow synagogues to open freely. They do not \nallow people the freedom. They persecute people. So one of the reasons \nAmerica is hated so much is that we have allowed people through the \nyears to choose what they are going to do. It is their choice.\n  The second reason we are hated so much is we have opened the door for \npeople to achieve their God-given place on this Earth. We have not \nrestrained people. We have allowed people freedom of expression, the \nfreedom to pursue dreams, the freedom to pursue goals. This is not true \nin other places in the world. These freedoms are not found in every \nnation. America is great because we have magnified the rights of \nindividuals, protected the rights of individuals in our culture. We are \ncareful to allow people to have expressions in our society, and we are \nhated for it.\n  The third reason we are hated by these people is because we are a \nnation of laws. We are a people ruled by laws. Lest one think that is \ncommon, go around the world and look at these other countries in the \nworld. Most of the world's countries do not have a 200-year-old \nConstitution. They are ruled by dictators. They are ruled by the whims \nof those leaders or by political parties as they change. The rule of \nlaw is what makes civilization possible. The rule of law is what makes \nan orderly society work. If there is no rule of law, the strongest, \ntoughest bully on the block is the one who is running the country. \nAmerica is a country of law and order. Because of this philosophy of \nthe people who founded our Nation, they believed in the rule of law \nbecause of what they knew from the Bible. Our Constitution and the \nconstitutions of most governments around the world, similar to ours, \nare, indeed, based on the Ten Commandments. Our fathers knew the Ten \nCommandments and the laws of God should be a basis for all laws. They \nunderstood the concept of absolute right and absolute wrong. There were \nnot many who believed in what we call today situational ethics or where \nthings change according to our needs. They believed in absolute right \nand absolute wrong. That is the reason we are hated so much as a \nnation.\n  We are hated because we are a beacon of light, a beacon of freedom \nall the way around the world. We know contemporarily what that means. \nOne of the greatest speeches of all time that I remember is a speech \nthat was made by Ronald Reagan. It is called a Rendezvous with Destiny. \nIn this speech he talked about--this was back when Castro had first \ntaken over Cuba. He talked about the atrocities in Communist Cuba, and \npeople were trying to escape. One man escaped in a small boat, as many \nothers did. He lived and reached the coast of Florida. As his boat \nfloated up on the coast, he started telling the people who were there \nabout the atrocities in Communist Cuba. A lady responded and said: \nWell, I guess we in this country do not know how lucky we are. He said: \nNo. It is how lucky we are, because we had a place to escape to.\n  What he was saying is we were that beacon of freedom. And we are \nhated because we are a beacon of freedom. That is the third reason for \nthe rest of the world. We are hated because in America we have the \nfreedom of choice, the freedom of worship; we have freedom of \nexpression; we are a nation of laws.\n  Why was America attacked on September 11? Why did they single us out? \nAmerica was attacked because of our system of values. It is a spiritual \nwar, not just because we are Israel's best friend. We are Israel's best \nfriend in the world because of the character we have as a nation. One \nof the reasons God has blessed our country is because we have honored \nHis people.\n  Right up on there on your desk, Mr. President, you have a Bible. Look \nup Genesis 12:3. It says, ``I will bless them that bless you and curse \nhim that curses you.''\n  He was talking about Israel. One of the reasons America has been \nblessed abundantly over the years is because we as a society have \nopened our doors to the Jewish people. The Jewish people have been \nblessed in the United States of America.\n  When the tiny state of Israel was founded in 1948, we stood in \nbeginning with Israel. We were the first country to stand for Israel. \nAnd because we took a stand, other nations in the world took a stand. \nThey followed quickly. The United States made it possible for there to \nbe an Israel. We stood with Israel again and again in its fight to \nsurvive. Make no mistake about it, it is not just because of our \nsupport of Israel, it is what we believe as a nation that caused us to \ncome under attack.\n  Israel is under attack in the Middle East because it is the only true \ndemocracy that exists in the Middle East. There are more than 20 Arab \ncountries that are in northern Africa and in the Middle East, and \nnearly every one of those is run by a dictator. Israel is the only true \ndemocracy that exists in the Middle East.\n  Did you know, if you are an Arab in Israel, and you are an Israeli \ncitizen as an Arab, you can vote in the elections? In fact, in the \nKnesset--that is their Congress--they have a political party that is \nfor Arabs. They have their own party in the Knesset.\n  Israel is the only true democracy that exists in the Middle East. It \nhas a Western form of government based on the laws we see in the Bible. \nThe laws of God our country is based on are the same laws from which \nIsrael gets its laws--it represents the laws of God. That is the reason \nit is under attack.\n  We ought to be Israel's best friend. If we cannot stand for Israel \ntoday, can we ever again be counted on as a beacon, a beacon of freedom \nfor the oppressed nations? You may ask, what does this have to do with \nthe attack on America that happened 10 years ago. We are under attack \nbecause of our character, and because we have supported the tiny little \nnation in the Middle East. That is why we are under attack. If we do \nnot stand for this tiny country today, when do we start standing for \ntiny little countries in the world?\n\n  Many years ago, Yasser Arafat and others did not recognize Israel's \nright to the land, very much like our President Obama. Even today, many \ndo not recognize Israel's right to exist. There are seven reasons I \nconsider to be indisputable and incontrovertible evidence and grounds \nto Israel's right to the land. You have heard this before, because you \nheard it from me 10 years ago. It was similar. It is in the Record now. \nI kept it.\n  Most know this, that they are going to be hit by skeptics who are \ngoing to say we are being attacked all because of our support for \nIsrael, and if we get out of the Middle East, all of the problems will \ngo away. That is not so. It is not true. We all know in our hearts it \nis not true. If we withdraw, it would come to our door. It would not go \naway.\n  I have some observations to make about that in a minute. But first, I \nam going to tell you the seven reasons that Israel has the right to the \nland. I am saying this because I am still in shock over what happened \nthis last week. But I am relieved from the response we got from this \ngreat man, Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n  Israel has the right to the land--reason No. 1--because of all of the \narcheological evidence. This is reason No. 1. It supports it. Every \ntime there is a dig in Israel, it does nothing but support the fact \nthat Israelis have had a presence there in that land for over 3,000 \nyears, the coins, the cities, the pottery, the culture. There are other \npeople and other groups there, but there is no mistaking the fact that \nthe Israelis have been present for 3,000 years. It predates\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nany claim any other people in the region might have. Ancient \nPhilistines are extinct. They are not around anymore. Many other \nancient people are extinct. They do not have an unbroken line to this \nday that the Israelis have.\n  Even the Egyptians of today are not racial Egyptians of 2,000 years \nago. They are primarily an Arab people. The land is called Egypt, but \nthey are not the same racial and ethnic stock as old Egyptians of the \nancient world. The Israelis are, in fact, descended from the original \nIsraelites. The first proof then is the archeological proof.\n  The second proof of Israel's right to the land is the historic one. \nHistory supports it totally, completely. We know there has been an \nIsrael up until the time of the Roman Empire. The Romans conquered the \nland. Israel had no homeland. Although Jews were allowed to live there, \nthey were driven from the land and dispersed in 70 AD and 135 AD. But \nthere was always a Jewish presence in the land. The Turks who took over \nabout 700 years ago and ruled the land up until about World War I had \ncontrol. Then the land was conquered by the British. The Turks entered \nWorld War I on the side of Germany. The British knew they had to do \nsomething to punish the Turks and also to break up the empire that was \ngoing to be a part of the whole effort of Germany in World War I. So \nthe British sent troops against the Turks in the Holy Land. This is a \ngood one.\n  Of the generals who led the British into the Holy Land was a guy \nnamed Allenby. He was a general. He was a Bible-believing Christian. He \ncarried a Bible with him everywhere he went. He knew the significance \nof Jerusalem. The flight before the attack against Jerusalem, to drive \nout the Turks, Allenby prayed that God would allow him to capture the \ncity without doing damage to the holy places.\n  That day Allenby--this is World War I now, keep in mind. He sent a \nbunch of biplanes into the Holy Land as a reconnaissance mission. You \nhave to understand, these Turks had never seen a biplane. They had \nnever seen any kind of airplane. They looked up and they saw these cute \nlittle machines flying around. They are terrified.\n  Then they were told that they were being opposed by a man named \nAllenby. This is a true story. History supports it. Allenby--in their \nlanguage--means ``man sent from God'' or ``prophet from God.'' They \ndared not fight against a prophet from God. So the next morning, when \nAllenby went into Jerusalem, he went in, he captured it without firing \na shot. And that is history. That is actually what happened. That is \nthe history we are talking about.\n  Out of gratitude to the Jews, and out of gratitude to the Jewish \nbankers and the financiers and others who lent the financial help on \nthe homeland, the Jewish people--the homeland that is now Israel, and \nall of what was then the nation of Jordan, was given to the Jewish \npeople.\n  The homeland that Britain said it would set aside consisted of what \nis now Israel and what then was Jordan, the whole thing. That was what \nthe British promised the Jews in 1917. In the beginning, there was some \nArab population there and some Arab support for this gift. There was \nnot a huge Arab population in the land at the time. There was a reason \nfor that. The land wasn't able to sustain any kind of a large \npopulation. The people didn't have the development needed to handle any \nkind of population of the land. It wasn't wanted by anyone at that \ntime. Can you believe it wasn't wanted at that time by anyone?\n  You remember Mark Twain--Samuel Clemens--who wrote ``Huckleberry \nFinn'' and ``Tom Sawyer.'' He took a tour of the Holy Land in 1867. \nThis is what he said about Israel:\n\n       A desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given \n     over wholly to weeds, a silent mournful expanse. We never saw \n     a human being on the whole route. There was hardly a tree or \n     a shrub anywhere. Even the olive and the cactus, those fast \n     friends of worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.\n\n  Where was this great Palestine at that time? It wasn't there. The \nPalestinians weren't there. Palestine didn't exist. Palestine was a \nregion named by the Romans, but at the time it was under the control of \nthe Turks. There was no population there because the land would not \nsupport it. There was the Palestinian Royal Commission that was created \nby the British. It quotes an account of the conditions on the coastal \nplain along with the Mediterranean Sea in 1913. This is what they said \nabout Israel at that time:\n\n       The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer \n     track, suitable for transport by camels or carts. No orange \n     groves, orchards, or vineyards were to be seen until one \n     reached the Yavnev village. Houses were mud. Schools did not \n     exist. The western part toward the sea was almost desert. The \n     villages were few and thinly populated. Many villages were \n     deserted by their inhabitants.\n\n  The French author Voltaire described Palestine as ``a hopeless, \ndreary place.''\n  In short, under the Turks, the land suffered from neglect and low \npopulation. It is a historical fact. The nation became populated with \nboth Jews and Arabs. The land came to prosper when Jews came back and \nbegan to reclaim it. Historically, they began to reclaim it. Even if \nthere had never been any archeological evidence to support the rights \nof the Israelis to the territory, it is important to recognize that \nother nations in the area have no longstanding claim to the country \neither.\n  This may surprise you. I will say that Saudi Arabia was not created \nuntil 1913, Lebanon, in 1920, and Iraq didn't exist as a nation until \n1932, Syria until 1941. The borders of Jordan were established in 1946 \nand Kuwait in 1961.\n  Any of these nations that would say Israel is only a recent arrival \nwould have to deny their own rights, as they were recent arrivals as \nwell. They didn't exist as countries. They were all under the control \nof the Turks. Historically, the land was given to the Israelis in 1917, \nand then, of course, we know Israel gained its independence in 1948.\n  So we have the archeological reasons. We have seven reasons. Here is \nthe third reason. The third reason the land belongs to Israel is \nbecause of the practical value of the Israelis being there. Israel \ntoday is a modern marvel of agriculture. Israel is able to bring more \nfood out of a desert environment than any other country in the world. \nThe Arab nations ought to make Israel their friend and import \ntechnology from Israel that would allow all the Middle East, not just \nIsrael, to be exporters of food. So Israel, unarguably, has success in \nagriculture. They have been able to develop when nobody else has.\n  The fourth reason I believe Israel has a right to the land is on the \ngrounds of humanitarian concerns. There were 6 million Jews slaughtered \nin Europe in World War II. The persecution against the Jews was very \nstrong in Russia since the advent of communism. Persecution was against \nthe Jews even before that time under the czars.\n  These people have a right to their homeland. If we are not going to \nallow them a homeland in the Middle East, then where? What other nation \non Earth is going to cede territory? They are not asking for a great \ndeal. The whole nation of Israel fits into my State of Oklahoma seven \ntimes. So on humanitarian grounds alone, Israel ought to have the land.\n  The fifth reason I disagree with President Obama and think Israel \nshould have the right to the land, without any changes and not going \nback to 1967, is because it is a strategic ally to the United States. \nWhether we realize it, Israel is a detriment, an impediment to certain \ngroups hostile to democracies and to those things we believe in, \nhostile to the very things that make us the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world. Israel has kept them from taking complete control \nof the Middle East. If it were not for Israel, they would overrun the \nregion. Israel is our only strategic ally.\n  It is good to know we have a friend in the Middle East we can count \non. They vote with us in the U.N. more than England, Germany, Canada, \nand France--more than any other country in the world. So they have been \nour consistent ally for strategic reasons.\n  The sixth reason Israel should be entitled to the land is that Israel \nis a roadblock to terrorism. The war we are now facing is not a war \nagainst a sovereign nation, it is a fluid group of terrorists moving \nfrom one country to another. They are almost invisible. That is whom we \nare fighting against. We need every ally we can get. If we do not stop \nterrorism in the Middle East, it will be on our shores. I have said \nthis and said this and said this.\n  One of the reasons I believe that spiritual door was opened for an \nattack against the United States is because\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\nthe policy of our government has been to ask the Israelis, and demand \nwith pressure, that they not retaliate against the terrorist attacks \nthat have been launched against them.\n  Since its independence in 1948, Israel has fought four wars, and they \nwere not the aggressor in any of them. Some people may argue that they \nwere the first ones there with Egypt. Everybody knew what was going to \nhappen in Egypt. Israel was attacked in all four cases. Israel won all \nfour wars against the impossible odds. They are great warriors. I have \nspent some time over there. They consider it a level playing field when \nthey are outnumbered 2 to 1. They are great people.\n  There were 39 Scud missiles that landed on Israeli soil during the \ngulf war. Our President asked Israel not to respond. Our policy was \ntrying to get them not to respond. We asked them not to respond. In \norder to have the Arab nations on board, we asked Israel not even to \nparticipate in the war. They showed incredible restraint, and they did \nnot. We asked them to stand back and not do anything over these \nattacks.\n  We have criticized them. They have been criticized in our media, \nlocal people in television and radio offer criticisms of Israel not \nknowing the true issues. We need to be informed.\n  Years ago, I was so thrilled when I heard a reporter pose a question \nto our former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, during the gulf war. He \nsaid:\n\n       Mr. Powell, the United States has advocated a policy of \n     restraint in the Middle East. We have discouraged Israel from \n     retaliation again and again and again, because we have said \n     that it leads to continued escalation--that it escalates the \n     violence.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Are we [the United States] going to follow that preaching \n     ourselves?\n\n  Mr. Powell indicated we would strike back. In other words, we can \ntell Israel not to do it, but when it hits us, we are going to do it. \nThat is one of the reasons I believe the door was opened--because we \nheld back our tiny little friend. We have not allowed them to go to the \nheart of the problem. This was a mistake.\n  Terrorism is not going to go away. If Israel were driven into the sea \ntomorrow, if every Jew in the Middle East were killed, terrorism would \nnot end. You know that in your heart. Terrorism would continue.\n\n  It is not just a matter of Israel in the Middle East; it is the heart \nof the very people who are perpetuating this stuff. Should they be \nsuccessful in overrunning Israel--they will not be--but should they be, \nit would not be enough. They would never be satisfied. We learned that \nat Camp David.\n  The seventh reason--and this will upset some people, but I have to \nsay it, and it is printed up there--that Israel has a right to the \nland--and this is the most important reason--because God said so. As I \nsaid a minute ago, look it up in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 13, \nverse 14, 15 and 17, the Bible says:\n\n       The Lord said to Abram, ``Lift up now your eyes, and look \n     from the place where you are northward, and southward, \n     eastward, and westward: for all the land which you see, to \n     you will I give it, and to your seed forever. . . . Arise, \n     walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth \n     of it; for I will give it to thee.\n  That is God talking about Israel.\n  The Bible says that Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the \nplain of Mamre, which is what we call the Hebron, and built there an \naltar before the Lord. Hebron is in the West Bank, right here on the \nmap. It is this place where God appeared to Abram and said: ``I am \ngiving you this land,'' the West Bank.\n  Everybody will yell and scream because I am quoting the Bible, but \nthat is their problem, not mine.\n  This is not a political battle at all; it is a contest over whether \nthe Word of God is true.\n  The seven reasons, I am convinced, clearly establish that Israel has \na right to the land.\n  Years ago on the lawn of the White House, Yitzhak Rabin shook hands \nwith PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. It was a historic occasion. It was a \ntragic occasion.\n  At the time, the official policy of the government of Israel began to \nbe ``let us appease the terrorists. Let us begin to trade the land for \npeace.'' They tried. This process continued unabated. Here in our own \nNation, at Camp David in the summer of 2000--I remember it so well--\nthen-Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the most generous concessions to \nYasir Arafat that had ever been laid on the table.\n  He offered him more than 90 percent of all of the West Bank \nterritory, sovereign control of it. There were some parts he didn't \nwant to offer, but in exchange for that, he said he would give up land \nin Israel proper that the PLO was not even asking for. He also did the \nunthinkable--we cannot imagine it today. He even talked about dividing \nJerusalem and allowing the Palestinians to have their capital in the \neast. Arafat stormed out of the meeting. Why would he do that? \nEverything he asked for was offered to him.\n  A couple months later, there began to be riots and terrorism. The \nriots began when Ariel Sharon went to the Temple Mount--and we remember \nthis. This was used as the thing that lit the fire and caused the \nexplosion. This is the excuse the terrorists used.\n  Did you know Sharon did not go to the Temple Mount unannounced? He \ncontacted the Islamic authorities before he went. He secured their \npermission. He had permission to be there. It was no surprise. Their \nresponse was carefully calculated. They knew they would not pay \nattention to the details. So they would portray this in the Arab world \nas an attack on the holy mosque. They would portray it as an attack on \nthat mosque and use it as an excuse to riot. We know what happened \nsince that time. Over the following years, during the time of the peace \nprocess, where the Israeli public has pressured its leaders to give up \nland for peace because they are tired of fighting, there has been \nincreased terror.\n  It hasn't helped, hasn't worked. Nothing worked. It has been greater \nthan at any other time in Israel's history. Showing restraint and \ngiving in hasn't produced any kind of peace. It is so much so that the \nleftist peace movement in Israel didn't exist because the people felt \nthey were deceived.\n  They did offer a hand of peace, and it was not taken. That is why the \npolitics of Israel have changed drastically. The Israelis have come to \nsee that ``no matter what we do, these people do not want to deal with \nus. They want to destroy us.'' That is why even yet today the \nstationery of the PLO has upon it a map of the entire State of Israel, \nnot just the tiny part they call the West Bank. They want it all.\n  The unwavering loyalty we have received from our only consistent \nfriend in the Middle East has to be respected and appreciated by us. No \nlonger should foreign policy in the Middle East be one of appeasement. \nAs Hiram Mann said:\n\n       No man survives when freedom falls. The best men rot in \n     filthy jails and those who cried ``appease, appease'' are \n     hanged by those they tried to please.\n\n  Islamic fundamentalist terrorism came to America on 9/11. We have to \nuse all our friends and assets, all our resources, to defeat the \nsatanic evil.\n  Patrick Henry said:\n\n       We will not fight our battles alone. There is a just God \n     who reigns over the destiny of nations who will raise up \n     friends who will fight our battles with us.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means \n     which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The \n     millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and \n     in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by \n     any force which our enemy can send against us.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       We will not fight our battles alone. There is a just God \n     who reigns over the destiny of nations who will raise up \n     friends who will fight our battles with us.\n\n  He was talking about all of our friends, including Israel. That is \nwhat is happening. I thank God Israel is in the battle by our side. It \nis time for our policy of appeasement in the Middle East and \nappeasement to the terrorists to be over. With our partners, our \nvictory must and will be absolute.\n  I mentioned that a few weeks ago I was with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nin Israel. At that time, he had this growing concern for the land. We \ndid not know what was coming. We did not know what was going to happen. \nWe did not know that which did happen just a week ago was going to \nhappen. I quote from the Associated Press. I am so proud of him. Think \nof the courage it took for Prime Minister Netanyahu to stand next to \nthe most powerful man in the world and make a statement like this. He \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\n\n       [He] sat alongside President Barack Obama on Friday and \n     declared that Israel would not withdraw to the 1967 borders \n     to help make way for an adjacent Palestinian state. Obama had \n     called on Israel to be willing to do just that thing a day \n     earlier.\n       Prime Minister Netanyahu said his Nation could not \n     negotiate with a newly constituted Palestinian unity \n     government that includes the radical Hamas movement, which \n     refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.\n\n  And its commitment to Israel's destruction.\n  Those are the seven reasons I believe the land belongs to Israel. We \nneed to respect that, and we need to declare: God bless Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3406-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COTE D'IVOIRE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know I have a couple more. I would like \nto cover one last topic because something is about to happen in the \nnext week. Some people are going to be killed. It has nothing to do \nwith Israel; nothing to do with the subject here. It is very serious.\n  You might recall six different times on the floor of the Senate I \nhave talked about the problems that are taking place in a country in \nWest Africa called Cote d'Ivoire. The fact is we had a President--his \nname is Laurent Gbagbo--with his wife Simone. They were ruling when an \nelection came along. It was stolen from him by a man named Alassane \nOuattara. He is in the northern part of Cote d'Ivoire.\n  What I have tried to show--I explained well before this all happened, \nbefore we got involved, that France and the United Nations and now our \nState Department are joining in with them. This picture was in \nyesterday's paper. This is one of Ouattara's death squads that are \nkilling people in Abidjan, which is the capital.\n  I show this picture. It is one that shows this is still happening \ntoday. Reprisal attacks are still being committed by forces loyal to \nAlassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast 6 weeks after he came to power vowing \npeace and reconciliation.\n  It also said that Alassane Quattara, championed by the French and the \nUnited Nations during a deadly post-election conflict, has failed to \ncondemn atrocities against real or perceived supporters of ousted \nPresident Laurent Gbagbo.\n  Those are the death squads of Ouattara. This is a picture of them. \nYou can identify them. They are in there killing people. We don't know \nhow many tens of thousands of people have been murdered in cold blood. \nAmnesty International came out the other day and criticized the U.N. \nmission for ignoring pleas for help and failing to prevent the massacre \nin the town of Duekoue. That is the town of Duekoue. See the charred \nbodies. People are saying they actually had hogs eating the bodies. \nThis is what Ouattara did in a little town called Duekoue.\n  I have another picture of what is happening. It is really criminal. \nThese are all of Ouattara's people. These are the ones our State \nDepartment supported, and it is serious. Amnesty reports that a manhunt \nwas launched against Gbagbo loyalists in Abidjan, and several senior \nofficials close to him were beaten in the hours after his arrest.\n  This is a picture of the Secretary of the Interior. We had a hearing \nthe other day, and our State Department tried to say Ouattara is hiring \na lot of the people from the Cabinet of Laurent Gbagbo. There is the \nSecretary of the Interior. They shot him in the face so it would take a \nlong time to painfully die. He died.\n  Here is another member of the Cabinet being executed. This is what is \ngoing on. Nobody cares. Anyway, I care.\n  What we are looking at right now is the Ouattaras publicly.\n  There is a way out of this right now. What has happened is Ouattara \nis trying to figure out a way to kill the President and the First Lady. \nI will wind up by letting you know and seeing firsthand what we are \ntalking about.\n  President Gbagbo is someone I have known quite well. He is a jovial \nguy. This is a picture as I remember him. I spent a lot of time with \nhim. This is right after his arrest. He was beaten almost to death. We \nsee what has happened to his face.\n  His wife is a beautiful lady, Simone Gbagbo. I have been with her \nmany times. She is a beautiful lady. She is the First Lady. I first \nknew her 15 years ago when she was a member of Parliament before they \nwere married. There she is. You will not find a more beautiful lady \nthan that. There she is, after they ravaged their home--Ouattara and \nthe United Nations in agreement with our State Department. This is what \nshe looked like the next day. They went in and grabbed her by the hair \nand pulled her hair out. You can see other things happened to her.\n  I hesitate to put up the last photo, but this one you have to put \nyour imagination to work. It takes a lot of imagination to see what is \nhappening. There she is, the beautiful First Lady. You can imagine what \nhappened with all of Ouattara's people around here.\n  What is the answer? All we have to do is encourage the State \nDepartment to take a different stand and say: Let's take the Gbagbos--\nthe President and the First Lady--and allow them to have asylum. I \nalready located a country in Sub-Saharan Africa willing to host them. \nThat is all that needs to happen.\n  By the time we get back 9 days from now after this recess, both of \nthem will be dead if we do not do something. As we speak right now, \nthey are being tortured.\n  There we have it. We have an opportunity to do something. We can save \nnot only these people but save those around them who have always loved \npeace in Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. \nHe and I share a passion and interest in the continent of Africa. He \nhas traveled there many more times than I have. We have talked about \nthe situation on that continent. I give special accolades to him for \ncontinuing to raise questions relative to that continent and the people \nwho live there. It is an important part of the world, and for far too \nlong it has been exploited.\n  I am glad, on a bipartisan basis, we both believe the United States \nshould focus more attention on that important continent.

Mr. President, it was 10 years ago I was contacted in my \nChicago office by a mom, a Korean American. She had a problem. She had \ncome to this country from Brazil with her young daughter. The family \nwas originally from Korea, but they came to the country from Brazil. \nHer daughter came at the age of 2 and grew up in Chicago. She was a \nbright girl with a lot of talent and particularly turned out to be a \nmusical prodigy. By the time she was ready to graduate from high \nschool, she had offers to go to the best music schools--the Manhattan \nSchool of Music, the Julliard School of Music.\n  As she filled out her application forms, there was a little blank \nthat said ``citizenship.'' She turned to her mom and said: What am I \nsupposed to put here? Her mom said: I don't know. We never filed any \npapers. You were brought in here at the age of 2. We better do \nsomething.\n  Her daughter said: What are we going to do?\n  Her mom said: We are going to call Senator Durbin.\n  They called my office hoping to come up with a solution. \nUnfortunately, I could not. The law is very clear. She not only would \nhave been deported from America, she would have been deported back to \nBrazil, a place where the little girl had never lived or a language she \nnever mastered. She was supposed to wait there for 10 years and try to \nget back in the United States.\n  It struck me that was unfair. That is when I introduced the DREAM \nAct. The idea behind the DREAM Act is to give young children who are \nnow in young adulthood a chance to become legal in America. I \nintroduced the bill 10 years ago and called it up several times on the \nSenate floor in the last 10 years. I think on every occasion we had a \nmajority vote. The last time we had 55 votes of 100 in the Senate, but \nthe filibuster rule requires 60. It fell short of passing.\n  What the bill says is very basic. The DREAM Act would give students a \nchance to become legal if they came to the United States as children; \nthey are long-term residents of the United\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nStates; they have good moral character; they graduate from high school; \nand they complete at least 2 years of college or military service in \ngood standing. It is not too much to ask to give these young people a \nchance.\n  Two weeks ago, I reintroduced the DREAM Act with 33 of my colleagues. \nI am going to do everything I can to pass the legislation this year or \nnext year. This is a matter of simple justice. There is not another \nsituation in America where we hold children accountable for the \nwrongdoing of their parents except in this case. It is just not fair. \nThese children did not have a vote or a voice in coming to America. \nThey were brought here, and they did the right thing once they came.\n  They went to school. They did well. They got up every morning and \npledged allegiance to the only flag they knew. They sang the National \nAnthem--the only one they knew. They believed they were really \nAmericans, but a rude awakening came when they came to learn they were \nnot. I guess they might have been viewed more as people without a \ncountry.\n  What will the passage of the DREAM Act bring us other than justice? \nIt will bring us some of the most talented people in America who want \nto make this a better nation. These are young people who really worked \nhard. Their parents were immigrants to this country and most of the \ntime had to take very difficult jobs and work extra hard so the kids \ncould finish school. Many of these young people turned out to be \nexcellent students--valedictorians of their classes and stars in many \nother respects. Now some of them just want a chance to serve in our \nmilitary. That says a lot about them too, that they are willing to risk \ntheir lives for America.\n  Is there any question about their patriotism or their love of this \ncountry or they want to finish college so they can use their skills and \neducation to improve their lives and make this a better nation.\n  We have the support of the Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, for the \nDREAM Act, GEN Colin Powell--a man I respect very much--Rupert Murdoch, \na very conservative Republican businessman supports it, and CEOs of \ncompanies such as Microsoft and Pfizer.\n  Every day I hear from another one of these dreamers. They come up to \nme sometimes very quietly and sometimes very publicly and tell me their \nstories. Just the other day a young man came up to me as I was leaving \na speech here in Washington, and he said: Senator, I just want to let \nyou know I am finishing law school. I cannot be licensed in America \nbecause I am not an American citizen. I will pursue my education until \nyou pass the DREAM Act.\n  I thought about it. This poor young man deserves a chance to use his \neducation not just to continue it. That gives me more of an incentive \nto work on this issue.\n  Let me tell a story tonight in the few minutes I have about two of \nthese dreamers. This is Juan Gomez. This handsome young man was brought \nto the United States from Colombia in 1990 at the age of 2. He is an \nacademic all-star at Killian Senior High School in Miami, FL. He earned \nclose to 2 years of college credit with high scores on 13 advanced \nplacement exams. He scored 1410 out of 1600 on the SAT, and he finished \nin the top 20 percent of his class. His economics teacher nicknamed him \n``President Gomez'' and said he is one of the best students ever to \ngraduate from Killian High School.\n  In 2007, during his senior year in high school, he was placed in \ndeportation proceedings. What happened next is an amazing story.\n  Scot Elfenbein was the student body President at Juan's high school. \nHe was also Juan's best friend. He thought it was basically unfair that \nthis young man would be rooted out of school and tossed back into a \ncountry he never remembered. Scott started a Facebook page devoted to \nstopping Juan's deportation. Here is what he wrote on the Facebook \npage:\n\n       We need your help in saving Juan from being sent to \n     Colombia--a country he doesn't even remember. For those of \n     you who know Juan, he is the smartest and most dedicated kid \n     you ever met. He deserves more than to just be deported. Many \n     of us owe him. I know he helped everyone one way or another \n     in school. It's the least we can do for him.\n\n  Thanks to Scott's initiative, 2,000 people joined Juan's Facebook \npage. Then Juan's friends came here on Capitol Hill to lobby for him. \nThey persuaded Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Senator Chris \nDodd to introduce a bill to stop his deportation. Representative Diaz-\nBalart is a Republican, but he is also one of the lead sponsors of the \nDREAM Act in the House. My good friend and former Senator Chris Dodd \nis, of course, a Democrat. So it is obvious this isn't a partisan \nissue. Republicans and Democrats should basically come together and \nagree that to punish this young man because his parents came here \nillegally is fundamentally unfair.\n\n  After his deportation was stayed, Juan was admitted to Georgetown \nUniversity on a full scholarship. He is going to graduate from \nGeorgetown in May. And thanks to Congressman Diaz-Balart, he has a \ntemporary work permit and has been offered a job at a top financial \nservices firm in New York City. Can we use a person with his skill? Of \ncourse we can. Every year we import thousands of foreigners on H-1B \nvisas. Do you know why? Because we say we need these bright minds in \nAmerica. Well, if we need bright minds in America, why are we exporting \nthose who were raised here and who can bring their skills and talents \nto a better life for themselves and our Nation?\n  Let me introduce another person to you. Her name is Ola Kaso. She was \nbrought to the United States by her mother from Albania in 1998 when \nshe was 5 years old. Ola is a senior in high school in Warren, MI. She \nis the valedictorian of her class. She has taken every advanced \nplacement class offered by her school. She has a 4.4 grade point \naverage--a very bright young lady. Ola is on the varsity cross-country \nand tennis teams, she is treasurer of the student council and treasurer \nof the National Honor Society at her school. She tutors students who \nare learning English. Ola was also a member of her homecoming court. \nThis is a great picture of her. Here she is at her high school at \nhomecoming.\n  She sent me a letter. She has been accepted into the honors program \nat the University of Michigan, where she will be a pre-med student. \nHere is what her letter said:\n\n       I aspire to ultimately becoming a surgical oncologist, but \n     more importantly, I intend to work for patients who cannot \n     afford the astronomical fees accompanying lifesaving \n     surgeries, patients that are denied the medical treatment \n     they deserve. My goal is not to increase my bank account; my \n     goal is to decrease preventable deaths. I wish to remain in \n     this country to make a difference.\n\n  Do we need her? You bet we do.\n  Two months ago, Ola was placed in deportation proceedings. Just like \nJuan Gomez and many other DREAM Act students, Ola's friends decided to \nrally behind her. Senator Levin, a cosponsor of the DREAM Act, asked \nthe Department of Homeland Security to reconsider her case. This week, \nthe Department granted a stay of deportation to give her a chance to \ncontinue her education. That was the right thing to do. It makes no \nsense to send someone like Ola, who has so much to contribute to \nAmerica, to a country she barely remembers.\n  I introduced the DREAM Act in 2001. Since then, I have met so many of \nthese young immigrant students who are qualified for the DREAM Act. \nLike Juan Gomez and Ola Kaso, they are Americans in their hearts. They \nare willing to serve our country and to die for it if we would only \ngive them a chance. Simple justice and fairness requires it.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. It is the right thing \nto do. It will make America a stronger and better nation. One thing I \nam sure of is that if we give these young dreamers a chance, they won't \nlet us down.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would first like to thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, for allowing me to take a few minutes to \nspeak about something very important in my State--the fact that \ntomorrow would be Hubert Humphrey's 100th birthday.\n  Hubert Humphrey was our ``Happy Warrior'' in Minnesota. He was the \nson of a smalltown South Dakota drugstore owner who lifted himself up \nthrough hard work and determination to become the mayor of Minneapolis, \na U.S.\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nSenator representing Minnesota, and the 38th Vice President of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I actually have Hubert Humphrey's desk--something I requested when I \ngot to the Senate. It somehow got in a different category, and for the \nfirst 2 years I had the desk of the former Senator from New Hampshire, \nGordon Humphrey. But then, lo and behold, with the start of this last \nCongress, I did get Hubert Humphrey's desk.\n  I was a senior in high school when Hubert Humphrey passed away, and I \ncan still remember standing in line for his funeral in St. Paul. It was \nJanuary, and it was one of those days where it was below zero--\nfreezing. Yet there we were, standing outside the State capitol, all of \nus in our puffy winter jackets, 40,000 people waiting to pay our \nrespects. That is how much Hubert Humphrey was loved in our State, \nloved enough for people to stand outside for hours in the dead cold of \na Minnesota winter.\n  I can honestly say that Humphrey had an enormous impact on my own \nviews of public service. You can go down the list of landmark Federal \nlegislation in the past 60 years, and his fingerprints are all over \nthem--civil rights, Medicare, nuclear arms control, the Peace Corps, \nthe list goes on and on. Hubert Humphrey's impact continues to be felt \nin our State.\n  Humphrey was a compassionate man, but he was no pushover. He never \nbacked down from a fight worth fighting. When he was asked to speak at \nthe Democratic National Convention in 1948, he dove headfirst into one \nof the most controversial topics at the time--racial inequality. It was \na gutsy move, especially considering how divisive civil rights issues \nwere for the Democratic Party. And let's not forget that as a 37-year-\nold mayor of Minneapolis--and the Presiding Officer can relate to this \nas a former mayor himself--Humphrey's political career was just getting \noff the ground. He had a lot to lose. But he was convinced that \nsegregation and Jim Crow were hurting our country, and he was \ndetermined to challenge the status quo on the national stage even if it \nmeant risking his political career. That was Hubert Humphrey.\n  I think the last, most important thing to point out about Hubert \nHumphrey is that he was above all things an optimist. To this day, the \nSenate, according to our colleagues, has never seen anyone quite like \nhim--bursting with energy, idealism and hopefulness, a happy warrior.\n  I have a picture of the ``Happy Warrior'' hanging in my front office, \nand it hangs there in a visible place for a good reason. It is because \nI am convinced that now more than ever our Nation needs a good dose of \nthe hope and optimism that defined Hubert Humphrey's life.\n  The truth is, we have to go back decades to find a time when we were \nconfronted with so many challenges--two difficult wars, a crushing debt \nload, and our quest to end our dependence on foreign oil and develop \nour own homegrown energy. The way we choose to address these challenges \nwill determine the course of our Nation for decades to come. History \nwill tell us whether we are right or wrong, timid or courageous.\n  I believe we must choose courage, but not only that, we must also \nchoose optimism. We must take a page from Hubert Humphrey's book and \nstrive for that resilience he displayed in public life. I think about \nthe inscription on his gravestone at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. \nIt is a quote from Humphrey himself:\n\n       I have enjoyed my life, its disappointments outweighed by \n     its pleasures. I have loved my country in a way that some \n     people consider sentimental and out of style. I still do. And \n     I remain an optimist with joy, without apology, about this \n     country and about the American experiment in democracy.\n\n  These are words that resonate today, words that remind us of the \namazing life and legacy of a man who did so much for the causes of \njustice, democracy, and accountability. America is a better place for \nhis leadership, and that is why we honor him today.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from Oklahoma for allowing \nme to put in these good words for Senator Humphrey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If we look \naround and take in the whole picture here, there is nobody here, \nessentially, and they are not going to be here for 9 or 10 more days. \nThe question I put forward is, If your own personal household was in \ntrouble, financially or otherwise; if you knew you weren't going to be \nable to pay the bills; if you knew your credit cards were maxed out, \nwould you just sit on the couch and do nothing or would you work to \nprotect your family? Would you go out and do whatever you could? Would \nyou take advantage of every opportunity to secure the future for your \nfamily?\n  Well, we have big problems in our country, and it doesn't matter how \nwe got here. The fact is, we are borrowing $4.3 billion a day. The \ninterest on our debt is $2.8 billion a day. We are at a point where if \nwe don't start making the very difficult decisions for our country \ndespite our fear of the political consequences, we will be like the \nperson who, when his family was in trouble, didn't try to solve the \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, we don't have a budget. Yesterday we had political \nvotes on budgets, but it was a game. For the last 2-plus years, no \nbudget has come through the Senate. There is a reason for that, and the \nAmerican people need to know it is not because of our great budget \nchairman, whose name is Senator Kent Conrad. It is not his fault there \nis not a budget. It is because of the leadership in the Senate. The \nleadership does not want the votes that come along with a budget. You \nsee, the political thinking is, we don't want any of our members to \nhave to be recorded on things that might affect the next election. So \nto hell with the country. What is more important is the next election.\n  What is happening in the Senate is a complete meltdown of the very \npurpose the Senate was created. The fact is, we had votes on four \nseparate budgets, and let me tell you, what is most astounding is that \nnobody voted for President Obama's budget. The President of the United \nStates submits a budget to the Congress, and nobody in the Senate \nagrees to vote for it. How disconnected could that budget be from the \nrealities of what our country's needs are if even the people of his own \nparty won't vote for it? I was inclined to vote for it just so we could \nhave a debate on his budget. But the fact is, we didn't have a debate \non any budget.\n  So as we sit here, we are borrowing $4.3 billion a day and running a \n$1.6 trillion deficit and mortgaging the very future of our children. \nThe very reason we work so hard and the reason we live is to nurture \nand support those who come after us, and to ignore that responsibility \nis absolutely uncalled for. Congress deserves every recognition from \nthe American people for being a farce. You can't have the kinds of \nproblems we have in front of us and not attempt to address them.\n  I want to spend a minute talking to every Medicare patient in the \ncountry. I have practiced medicine for 25 years. I have cared for \nthousands of Medicare patients. I understand, at 63 years of age, with \nthree pretty significant disease processes going on in my own body, \nabout worrying about one's health. I worry about the security around \nthat health. It is important enough to me to really take the medicines \nand to follow the diet my doctor is offering me now that I am 63. I \nprobably wouldn't have paid attention 20 years ago, but today I am \ndoing that.\n  The health care that is available to me is important to me, as I know \nit is to every Medicare recipient out there. But the facts are the \nfollowing: Politicians want to use Medicare as a tactic to scare people \ninto not doing what we as a nation are going to ultimately do anyway. \nWe will have to fix Medicare. And we can fix it in a way that assures \nevery senior who absolutely needs the help of Medicare and is dependent \non Medicare will have that health care. Anybody who says something \nother than that either cares a whole lot more about themselves and \ntheir political career or they are absolutely dishonest, because it is \nabsolutely impossible for us to raise the money to continue to run \nMedicare the way it is\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\ntoday. It will change in the next 4 or 5 years no matter what the \npoliticians say, no matter what the next election--it has to change. \nThe good news is we can give as good care or better with fewer dollars \nif we will make the right changes in Medicare.\n\n  What most Medicare patients don't understand is that $1 out of every \n$3 spent on Medicare is not going to help you get better and isn't \npreventing you from getting sicker. Those are facts. They are backed up \nby four studies now, four long-term studies. If $1 out of every $3 is \ngoing into Medicare and it is not effective in actually helping you \nwith health care, and that $1 out of every $3 we are borrowing from the \nChinese this year to keep Medicare afloat--and that is just the \nhospital system, that is Part A--why would we not want to make the hard \nchoices and fix it?\n  The reason you are not seeing that come forth is somebody sees an \nadvantage in an election to game Medicare. The fact is, it is not just \nMedicare that is broken. The whole entire health care system is broken \nbecause we do not allow markets to allocate it in an efficient way and \nwe do not hold physicians such as myself accountable to be very frugal \nwith the tests we order and the treatments we order.\n  As we continue to think about ourselves and say I do not want any \nchange--and that is the other point I want to make. As I get older, I \nfind I resist change more than anything. But the one absolute that is \ngoing to happen is that Medicare is going to change and it does not \nmatter what any politician from Washington tells you, it has to change. \nOtherwise we will be in an absolute depression. We will not be able to \naccomplish any of the things we are accomplishing now under Medicare. \nIt will change.\n  If it is going to change, why don't we change it in a way that \ncontinues to guarantee the promise of Medicare and puts more of a \nburden on those who have more dollars with which to do that and takes \ncare of the sickest and poorest the best and puts a greater load on \nthose who have less of a need for Medicare?\n  Some would say that is not fair. Let me tell you what is not fair. \nWhat is not fair is the average American puts $138,000 into Medicare \nover their working career and takes $450,000 out. That is what is not \nfair. What is not fair is for a 5-year-old to complain about something \nnot being fair. To quote P.J. O'Rourke: ``You were born in America. \nThat's not fair.'' Life is not fair.\n  The fact is, we have a system that is getting ready to crash and we \nhave a political dynamic that people are actually saying we do not care \nbecause we want to win the next election more than we want to fix the \nproblem. That does not apply to everybody, but people who are gaming \nthis issue, people who are scaring people who are on Medicare, lack the \nintegrity and courage to talk about what the real problems are in this \ncountry.\n  The real problems are we have made promises without creating the \nrevenues to pay for it. We can tax 100 percent of all the income of \neverybody above $100,000 in income in this country and you will not fix \nthe deficit this year--if you took 100 percent of everything everybody \nearned over $100,000--that is how great the problem is. We have a $14.3 \ntrillion debt that, if in fact the debt limit is extended, will be past \n$15 trillion by December. When is it going to stop? When are we going \nto start thinking about the future of our country and the security of \nour country instead of the next election and how we can look good as \nthe media plays the game on politics?\n  It is amazing; today most of the stories in the newspaper were about \nMedicare and the effect of an election up in New York, a congressional \nelection. I don't think that matters a twit on what is going on in this \ncountry. What was not said in the papers is that nobody voted for the \nPresident's budget. That was not the headline anywhere. It was not the \nheadline that the Congress does not have a budget. The House has passed \na budget. You don't have to agree with it but at least they passed one. \nBut you have all this criticism of a proposed plan that came through \nthe House that actually will solve the problem, make sure everybody on \nMedicare actually gets the care they want and actually will take $1 of \nthose $3 that we are wasting, one out of every three, and put it into \nactually taking care of patients. But the people who are critical of \nthat plan have no plan themselves. And, if you have a plan, the plan is \nthe following--it is the plan that passed, what we know as ObamaCare, \nbut what is the health care bill that was passed in the last Congress. \nHere is the plan, just so we understand.\n  According to the President's speech at Washington University, the \nplan is that if we have to, we have two mechanisms. He mentioned one of \nthem. He didn't mention the other. We have the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board. Under the Affordable Care Act, the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board is mandated to control the growth of Medicare. Here is \nhow it does it. It makes a recommendation on the cutting of payments \nfor Medicare. That recommendation comes before Congress and we either \nhave to accept that or do something similar to that, in terms of the \ntotal dollar amounts, to cut back on the payments for Medicare.\n  What is the No. 1 problem a new Medicare recipient has today? The No. \n1 problem new Medicare recipients have today is finding a doctor who \nwill care for them, who will take their Medicare. That is their No. 1 \nproblem. If you think we can take this tremendous unfunded liability \nand continue to cut--I am not against, as a physician, physicians \ntaking a 5-percent or 6-percent pay cut under Medicare today. I am not \nagainst that. But if you think we can continue to do the savings we are \ngoing to have to get out of Medicare by doing that, you will not have \nanybody taking care of Medicare patients because they will not be able \nto afford to. Those payments to the physicians are less than 30 percent \nof the total payments of Medicare.\n  Then they transfer over to the hospitals, so we are going to cut what \nwe pay to the hospitals. Some hospitals can afford that, some cannot. \nWhat happens when the hospitals that cannot afford that close? Where do \nyou get your hospital care? Prescription drugs--we are going to cut the \nprice of prescription drugs. Consequently, no new drugs are coming on \nline because of the rate of return for the billion dollar cost that it \nis for any new drug just to get it through the FDA. All of a sudden the \nthings you count on are not there.\n  Let me mention the second way the President would have us control. \nThat is they have what is called an Innovation Council, under the \nAffordable Care Act. What is that purpose? The purpose of the \nInnovation Council is to decide whether Medicare can afford new \ninnovation in medicine to be offered to Medicare patients. That is the \nsame thing as saying: Here is a new drug, it will cure your breast \ncancer, but we don't think we can afford it so therefore it is not \navailable under Medicare. One is direct rationing; the other is \nindirect rationing. But the fact is we cannot fix Medicare by \nrationing. You will not fix it that way. What you will do is limit care \nand limit access--similar to what we have under Medicaid.\n  If you look at the trustees' report on Medicare, what they are saying \nwill have to happen is that the reimbursement rates under Medicare will \nend up being lower than the reimbursement rates under Medicaid. That is \nthe answer they have right now.\n  That is not a good answer. No American thinks that is a good answer. \nMy colleagues on both sides of the aisle do not think that is a good \nanswer. But that is where we are sitting.\n  I make the point if we do not address Medicare and if we do not \naddress Medicaid and if we do not fix Social Security--and it is true, \nif Congress had not stolen the $2.6 trillion from it and it was sitting \nin an account, we would be in pretty good shape. We would make it \nanother 30 years. But there is a problem in terms of paying back that \nmoney. Congress stole the money, spent it, and it is not there. So for \nus to get the $2.6 trillion to keep it going until 2036 we have to \nborrow more money. We have to borrow that $2.6 trillion. The problem is \nwe are at a debt limit now and we are getting very close to the time \nwhen people are going to quit loaning us money.\n  We can fix Social Security where it is for sure as available as it is \ntoday--actually we can make it better for the poorest Americans. We can \nactually make it better and we can assure that it is going to be \nworking forever. But\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nthat requires change. The political dynamic says don't, you can't touch \nSocial Security.\n  How fair is that? How fair is not fixing Medicare, not fixing \nMedicaid, and not fixing Social Security to those who follow us? I am \nthe grandfather of five great-grandkids, wonderful kids; I love them to \ndeath. I raised three daughters--actually my wife did most of that hard \nwork and that is why they turned out well. But the fact is, the \nrelationship with your children is a special relationship, but it does \nnot get close to comparing to the relationship to your grandkids. There \nis not anything I wouldn't do for my grandkids and they kind of know \nit. They have not taken advantage of it yet, but they know it.\n  What I would ask is, anybody who is on Medicare today who is \nlistening to this, here is what you need to know. No. 1 is there is \nnobody in Washington who does not want you to have a secure medical \nhealth care system. But the problems with it are so severe that it has \nto be fixed and it cannot wait. And that requires change. The problems \nof our country as a whole are so severe that we are not going to be \nable to borrow the money to pay back what we owe Social Security if we \ndo not fix Medicare and Medicaid because nobody is going to loan it. \nThey are going to say you haven't done what you need to do.\n  What has to happen is we have to think about our grandkids. I don't \nlike going through change very much but I will tell you there is one \ngroup of kids that I will go through change for, I will sacrifice for, \nI will give something up for me. What we are asking you to give up is \nthe comfort of what you know now, and move to the comfort of something \nthat is going to supply the same thing to you, just in a different way. \nAnybody who games that will not put forward a solution to the very \nproblems that are in front of us.\n  To the seniors out there who are on Medicare, nobody is proposing any \nimpact on you today for the next 10 years. Any proposal would be for \nthose people who are 55 and less and we are saying we have to change it \nso we can keep it. If we do not change it, nobody is going to have it. \nBy the way, we are going to have trouble surviving if we don't change \nit because we are not going to be able to manage this tremendous amount \nof debt which is over $55,000 per man, woman, and child in this country \ntoday.\n  We have to think about our grandkids. We have to quit listening to \nthe political shill who says somebody wants to hurt you. Everybody who \nhas put forward ideas on Medicare has a legitimate basis with which to \nbe critical of any other. But any politician in the Senate or the House \nwho has not put forth their solution to get us out of the problems you \nshould give no quarter to. You should not listen to the first word they \nsay because what they are thinking about is the next election. They are \nthinking how do I take advantage, how do I scare you over the next \nelection? Nobody wants to take away health care for our seniors. What \nwe want to do is ensure it is there in the future, and to put forward \nthe idea that the motivation there is to scare you into thinking that \nsomebody wants to disrupt your care, that is just not true.\n  There could be a great debate, and I started this talk on the fact \nthat there has not been any debate on the problems that are in front of \nus. There needs to be a great debate. People need to hear what the \noptions are. We need to put a budget on the floor and have the hard \ndebates on it, and take the hard votes, and then try to mix something \nwith the House; otherwise, here is what is going to happen come \nSeptember--which is not fair to any Federal employee. We are going to \nhave another continuing resolution. That is what is coming because we \nrefuse to have a budget that allows the people who work for you, \nthrough the Federal Government, to plan and efficiently carry out what \nthe Congress directs. We are just going to do a continuing resolution. \nIt is a highly inefficient way to run the Government. As a matter of \nfact, I will tell you that any family who does not run on a budget is \nset up for getting in trouble.\n  We are not running on a budget now. The bills are coming in and we \nhave a continuing resolution until September 30. But we do not have a \nbudget, we have no plan, we don't know what we need to do, what are the \nchanges we need to make. We are not listening to the people running the \nprogram. We are not listening to the American people as we do that.\n  We can fix health care in this country. The problem is the cost of \nhealth care. The reason it costs so much is that the vast majority of \nAmericans think somebody else is paying the bill.\n  I will end with this story. I see my colleague from Alabama is here. \nI have delivered thousands of babies, but there is a particular group I \nalways enjoyed delivering for because they are unique. They were the \nbest purchasers of health care I have ever encountered. They are from a \nlittle town called Inola and another called Chouteau, OK, and they are \nAmish. When they come to buy health care--they don't have health \ninsurance, by the way. Very few of them have a college education. They \nwork with their hands. They are into dairy or carpentry or farming or \nsomething, but they work with their hands. They have lots of good \ncommon sense.\n  I can tell my colleagues without a doubt that of the 500 Amish babies \nI delivered, they bought that service from the hospital, from me, from \nthe radiologist, and from the labs at 40 percent less than anybody else \nbought it. Why is that? It is because they were great consumers of \nhealth care and the money was coming out of their pockets. They didn't \nthink somebody else was paying for it. They knew they were paying for \nit, so therefore they asked for a discount. They said: I will pay you \ncash up front if you give me a discount. By the way, if you want to do \nthis other test, please explain in detail why I should fork out $100 \nfor another ultrasound. And does my wife absolutely have to have this \nultrasound?\n  When you get questioned that way the doctor says: Well, if you \nunderstand that we may miss something but basically everything looks \ngood, then I am fine with that as long as you are fine with that.\n  The average pregnancy today in the United States has four or five \nultrasounds. I was trained without doing any ultrasounds, and I had the \nsame outcomes.\n  So the point is that we can get better value if we reconnect the \npurchase of health care with some individual responsibility. If we \ndisconnect that--and that is what we do through private insurance and \nlow deductibles, and that is what we do through Medicare and low \ndeductibles and supplemental policies. We do the opposite of that. Once \nwe have met our deductible, there is no cost. So we are not prudent \nconsumers. As we age, we worry a lot about new symptoms, so we access \nthe health care system. Once you access, the costs just start ticking \nup.\n  So the point I make is there are a lot of things we can do better in \nhealth care if, in fact, we have market forces and transparency helping \nus do that. I would suggest we can have a Medicare Program that is \nefficient, that works, and that doesn't have $70 billion worth of fraud \nin it by the end of the year, by the way--$70 billion, well over 10 \npercent--and improper payments above 10 percent as well. So $70 billion \nin fraud and $70 billion in improper payments in Medicare. We could \nsolve the problem right there if Congress would do it. But we don't \nbecause we would rather have a political game and game people's fears \non health care and Medicare than fix the problem.\n  What I hope seniors will do over this next year, as they hear the \npoliticians make all these wild claims about people's motivations and \nthe damage to Medicare, is when you hear that, think about that in \nlight of your grandchildren. Think about yourself and what you want \nversus what you want your grandchildren to have because there is no \nquestion that the $14.2 trillion and under the President's budget the \n$23 trillion we are going to have at least in 9 more years is going to \nbe paid back by them, not you. What that really means is they are going \nto have a far lower standard of living than you do so you don't have to \nget out of your comfort zone.\n  I trust America a whole lot more than I trust the U.S. Congress. We \nhave a $1 trillion deficit of common sense in Washington, and we have \nan excess of common sense outside of Washington. If you will trust your \ncommon sense and look at what we are doing, what you will find is we \ncan solve our problems, we can come together as a nation, we can fix \nwhat ails us, and we\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\ncan do that without destroying the future of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with \nSenator Coburn, if he has a moment to stay, for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Coburn served on the debt \ncommission. Senator Coburn had no burden to run for reelection. I am so \nglad he did. He is one of the most valuable Members of this Senate.\n  I have an understanding that the Senator from Oklahoma came here to \ntry to do something about the debt this country faces. Is that fair to \nsay?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator believes this Congress has a responsibility \nto confront what Admiral Mullen calls the greatest threat to our \nnational security, which is our debt.\n  The Senator also has tremendous experience as a practicing physician. \nThe Senator practiced up until the very day he was elected. How many \nyears ago was that?\n  Mr. COBURN. Seven years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Seven years ago. He continued to practice even while in \nthe Senate until the bureaucrats made it impossible, I guess, to do so. \nSo the Senator from Oklahoma comes here with practical experience, a \nbrilliant mind, and a committed vision for America.\n  I appreciate the Senator sharing his frustration about what has \noccurred this week.\n  This is a quote that was in the Wall Street Journal by Democratic \nSenate strategists about this scheme and plan that was offered in four \nvotes yesterday--votes the majority had conceived in such a way that \nthey were guaranteed to fail and nothing was going to happen. It was a \nguaranteed plan to ensure nothing would happen. This is what the \njournal said about it:\n\n       As a political matter, Democratic strategists say there may \n     be little benefit in producing a budget that would inevitably \n     include unpopular items.\n\n  The Senator is famous for telling the truth. If he would, I would \nlike him to respond to that. What does that say about our Senate, that \nthe Democrats say there would be little political benefit in producing \na budget that might include unpopular items? Doesn't a tough budget \nthat gets us on the right path have to have some things in it that some \npeople might not like?\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, to my colleague, through the Chair, I would answer, \nWhat is our obligation? Is our obligation to win the next election or \nis our obligation to solve the problems in front of our country? It is \nnot even a matter of having votes. We can't even get bills on the floor \nfor the Members that actually would save some money right now.\n  Let me give an example. We had the small business bill up--the only \nthing we have done of significance since we have been back in this \nsession. It took 2 weeks to get a bipartisan amendment that would save \n$5 billion out of the duplication that was reported by the Government \nAccountability Office--hundreds of billions of dollars. It took 2 weeks \nto finally get a vote on that. My colleague from Virginia and I \ncosponsored that. It won. That is one of the reasons we didn't finish \nthe bill, is because they don't want to do that. They don't want to \nmake the hard choices. So it is an abrogation of our responsibility to \nnot do the hard part that comes with the job.\n\n  The job comes with a whole lot of rasping on your skin. You are going \nto get criticized. But the ultimate fatal criticism is to make a choice \nnot to get--put yourself in a position to be criticized. So what we are \nsaying is we are going to do nothing. We are not going to do what we \nare constitutionally supposed to do by April 15 every year; that is, \nhave a budget. We are not going to debate the issues. We are not going \nto cast our votes because somebody may affect somebody's election \noutcome. How big of cowards are we that we can't defend the vote we \nmake? I don't have any problem. You throw the hardest vote from the \nother side at me, and I will make a decision on it, whether I think it \nis right or wrong, and then I will defend it. But to not vote at all is \nan absolute abrogation of our oath, and that is the leadership we are \nexperiencing. It is not just Democratic leadership. We have some on our \nside who don't want to cast hard votes either.\n  The point is, the American people need us to be casting hard votes \nnow. Our problems are greater than at any time since World War II. The \nchallenge to our country is greater than World War II. The outcome of \nour Republic depends on us solving the very real and urgent and \ndifficult problems in front of us and doing so in a way that preserves \nthe future of this country and reestablishes and reforms us to where we \nget our mojo back so we can start believing in ourselves again. To not \ndo it and to not have the courage to sacrifice your own position for \nthe betterment of this country--that is what we ought to be about, and \nI don't see that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me ask the Senator. The Senator just won an \noverwhelming reelection. There is not a Senator here, I don't think \nanybody would dispute, who has been more frank in expressing the need \nthat all of us are going to have to rein in our spending and who shared \nthat directly with his constituents. When they have asked for things, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma has tried to help them, I know, but he is \nfrank with his constituents.\n  Would the Senator share with us what kind of percentage he got in the \nlast election?\n  Mr. COBURN. I got 71.8 percent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Seventy-one percent. Does my colleague think perhaps \nthat some of us here in Washington are overly afraid of being frank and \ntruthful with our constituents about the challenges America faces?\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, I would answer through the Chair that I think we \nare perplexed. We know intellectually that there is a big problem, and \nwe have this challenge: Do I go down this path and do the best thing \nfor the country or do I go down this path to do the best thing for me?\n  I look at politics differently than most of our colleagues. To the \nSenator from Alabama, I would say I don't really care whether I am \nhere; I care whether America is here. But the point ought to be, how do \nwe secure the vote and how do we establish trust with the American \npeople?\n  If my colleague will go with me--and I know he knows this--look at \nthe confidence in the Congress of the people in this country. Why is \nthere a lack of confidence? Why is it that 80 percent of the people of \nthe United States didn't have any confidence in Congress? I can tell my \ncolleague why. It is because we have milked trust and credibility from \nthose very people.\n  I get letters all the time from people who disagree with me. They \nwill write me, and I actually--I am involved in every answer to every \ninquiry that comes into my office. I actually read them because I want \nto know what the people from Oklahoma say. But even though they \ndisagree with me, they vote for me because they trust me because I am \nnot gaming them as they have seen with the gaming on Medicare.\n  Our problems are real. The solutions are difficult. But America can \novercome that if we come together. If we stay divided as we have seen \nhere with no budget votes, no hard votes, and we try to game it \npolitically, what we are doing is undermining our country's future. It \ndoesn't matter who wins the next election; what we need to do is save \nAmerica.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator has served on the debt \ncommission. I know there has been a concerted effort to blame and \nexaggerate and distort the House budget, particularly as it refers to \nMedicare.\n  Again, quoting Democratic Senate strategists, this is what the Wall \nStreet Journal said:\n\n       Many Democrats believe a recent House GOP proposal to \n     overhaul Medicare is proving to be unpopular and has given \n     Democrats a political advantage. They are loath to give that \n     up by proposing higher taxes.\n\n  Which they would prefer as a solution.\n\n       Senate Democrats plan to hold a vote on the Ryan plan . . .\n\n  Which they did yesterday--\n\n     . . . hoping to force GOP Senators to cast a vote on the \n     Medicare overhaul that could prove politically difficult.\n\n  I say to Senator Coburn, you served on the debt commission. This is \nwhat\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nyour commission chairman said in a written statement after Paul Ryan \nand the House Republicans produced their budget:\n\n       The budget released this morning by the House Budget \n     Committee Chairman Paul Ryan is a serious, honest, \n     straightforward approach to addressing our nation's enormous \n     fiscal challenges. We applaud him for his work in putting \n     forward a proposal which will reduce the country's deficit by \n     approximately the same amount as the plan of the President's \n     Fiscal Commission.\n\n  They also went on to say that if you criticize it, you have a \nresponsibility to offer an alternative.\n  I say to the Senator, you served with Mr. Bowles. He was a Democratic \nChief of Staff to President Clinton and was appointed by President \nObama to chair this commission. That does not sound like the things we \nheard yesterday, attacking the House Ryan budget, does it?\n  Mr. COBURN. It does not. But it is interesting to note that the \nPresident's deficit commission was set up by the President and had six \nof his nominees on it. It had six Republicans and six Democrats. Five \nof the six Presidential nominees he nominated agreed with the deficit \ncommission, three of the six Republicans agreed, and three of the \nDemocrats--a pretty good meeting in the middle. Yet the President did \nnot embrace the results of his own commission, did not embrace the \nresults of the people he appointed. So what was the purpose of that \nexercise? Was it to make political hay or was it to solve the problems?\n  The fact is, I have five colleagues in the Senate who have been \nworking hard on that over the past 5 months to try to build a \nbipartisan agreement out of the basis of that. That is what has to \nhappen--except politics.\n  I go back and just refer to my colleague, if you look at the history \nof republics, the track record is not very good. The average age of the \nworld's republics is 207 years. That is our average age. We are 27 \nyears past the average. The question is, Can we cheat history? Can we \nnot fall like the rest of the republics over the very same things? They \nall fell over fiscal issues. They let their spending get out of \ncontrol, they let their debt get out of control, and then they could \nnot afford the promises they made.\n  I will say to my colleague, this is not an issue of the budget \nchairman. This is an issue of the leadership of the Senate that does \nnot want a budget. We ought to be very clear that the American people \nknow that Congress is not doing its job--this body, for sure--because \nwe are not making the hard choices we were sent up here to make. What \nwe are doing is punting. We are going to come to a crisis, and the \ncrisis is going to be painful, and it is going to be much more painful \nthan had we made the hard choices today.\n  So I want to thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee for his \nleadership. We can solve any problem in front of us, Mr. Ranking \nMember, but we have to do it together, and we cannot deny that the \nproblems exist.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Coburn for his leadership. I have \nwatched him with admiration over the years with consistency and \nfidelity for the national interest to work to bring our spending under \ncontrol.\n  I see our colleague, Senator Alexander, in the Chamber, and I will \nyield the floor. I will just follow up, before I do that, with a quote \nfrom Erskine Bowles.\n  When the President announced his budget not long after the deficit \ncommission he called together had made some pretty good proposals about \nhow to improve fiscal matters in the United States, Mr. Bowles was, \nobviously, deeply disappointed with what the President submitted and \nsaid this plan goes ``nowhere near where they will have to go to \nresolve our [country's] fiscal nightmare.''\n  I think there is a consensus that we are facing a fiscal nightmare. \nWe are going to have to take some serious steps in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I think there are some other Members who have reserved \ntime. If there are no other Members here who have reserved time after \nSenator Alexander completes his remarks, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized at that time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will not object. I say to Senator \nSessions, I think Senator Hatch is expected to come down. That is the \nonly one I know of.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As I said, my consent would be that if anyone has \nreserved time, they would get it before I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Sessions and \nSenator Coburn for their principled remarks about the phenomenon of \nWashington spending. We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend. We cannot keep spending money we do not have. And we want to \nsave Medicare. So those two major difficult decisions are things that \nwe need to work on together--to stop spending money we do not have and \nsaving Medicare. We can do both if we put our minds to it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if you would let me know when 1 minute \nremains, I would appreciate it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3412-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3412-S3414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JOB PROTECTION ACT AND THE NLRB\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last month the Acting General Counsel \nof the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint against \nthe nation's largest exporter, the Boeing company--a company with \n170,000-some employees, 150,000 of which in the United States, who \nsells airplanes around the world and makes them in the United States. \nThe complaint basically said there was prima facie evidence of illegal \ndiscrimination because Boeing has decided to expand and build a \nproduction plant in South Carolina. Boeing's main operation is in \nWashington State, a State without a right-to-work law. In contrast, \nSouth Carolina is a State with a right-to-work law. This is \nnotwithstanding the fact that Boeing has already added 2,000 employees \nin Washington State since announcing its expansion. At the same time, \nit has nearly finished this new plant in South Carolina, spending $1 \nbillion, hiring 1,500 construction workers and over 500 employees to \nwork in the facility. Then, all of a sudden, here comes this complaint.\n  This is not just a South Carolina matter. It affects the entire \ncountry and many of us have spoken out about it. I want to review it \njust for a moment.\n  This complaint against Boeing is just one indication of the \nAdministration's anti-business, anti-growth, and anti-jobs agenda. That \nis why Senators Graham, DeMint, and I--actually there are 35 Senators \nwho are cosponsoring this bill--have introduced the Job Protection Act, \nto protect right-to-work states and employers from an independent \ngovernment body run amok.\n  Our bill preserves the Federal law's current protection of state \nright-to-work laws in the National Labor Relations Act and provides \nnecessary clarity to prevent the NLRB from moving forward in its case \nagainst Boeing or attempting a similar strategy against other \ncompanies.\n\n  Now it seems the NLRB wants to change the rules governing how and \nwhen a company can relocate from one State to another. According to a \nMay 10 internal memorandum from the NLRB General Counsel's Office, they \nwant to give unions power over major business decisions and require \ncompanies, such as Boeing, to collectively bargain if it wants to \nrelocate a facility.\n  As was explained by James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor \neconomics, and Hans A. Von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the \nHeritage Foundation, in a recent article in National Review Online:\n\n       NLRB wants to force companies to provide detailed economic \n     justifications (including underlying cost or benefit \n     considerations) for relocation decisions to allow unions to \n     bargain over them--or lose the right to make those decisions \n     without bargaining over them. . . . Either way, businesses \n     would have to negotiate their investment plans with union \n     bosses.\n\n  Sherk and von Spakovsky describe this as a ``heads I win, tails you \nlose'' scenario for unions. These decisions belong in the corporate \nboardroom, not at the collective bargaining table.\n  The goal of this NLRB is to place the interests of organized labor \nover those of business, shareholders, and economic growth. Their means \nis to change well-\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nestablished law governing business decisions under the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  The Supreme Court has reasoned that ``an employer must have some \ndegree of certainty beforehand as to when it may proceed to reach \ndecisions without fear of later evaluations labeling its conduct an \nunfair labor practice. Under the Dubuque Packing case and subsequent \nNLRB jurisprudence, a company may make a major business decision, such \nas relocation, outside of collective bargaining. Accordingly, the \nburden is initially on the NLRB's General Counsel to establish that an \nemployer's decision to relocate work is unaccompanied by a basic change \nin the nature of the employer's operation, such as being part of an \noverarching restructuring plan.\n  The Dubuque test was most recently applied by the NLRB in holding \nthat an employer, Embarq Corporation, did not violate the law by \nrefusing to provide information about or bargain over a planned \nrelocation of its Nevada call center to Florida. Both of those happen \nto be right-to-work States, as Tennessee is.\n  In a concurring opinion, NLRB Chairman Liebman expressed her desire \nto change the rules governing relocation decisions and collective \nbargaining. The Chairman noted her displeasure that, in her words, \n``the law does not compel the production of'' information fully \nexplaining the underlying cost or benefit considerations of a company's \nrelocation decision. The Chairman then suggested requiring employers to \nprovide unions with economic justification wherever there was a \n``reasonable likelihood'' that labor-cost concessions might affect an \nimpending decision to relocate.\n  In practice, the burden would shift to the employer, before making \nits relocation, to advise and explain to its union the basis for its \ndecision, supported by detailed economic justification. Then, if it \ndoes turn on labor costs, the employer would be required to provide the \nunion with information supporting the labor cost/savings underlying its \ndecision. If the employer failed to provide such information and labor \ncosts were a factor, it would be precluded from making those decisions \nwithout collective bargaining.\n  Following this decision against Embarq Corporation, the NLRB \nAssociate General Counsel issued an internal memorandum on May 10 \nsuggesting that Chairman Liebman's new test should now be examined and \nconsidered in all cases concerning relocations that come before the \nboard.\n  Now, I am all for requiring employers to provide advance notice to \ntheir labor organizations and offering the economic reasons for a \nproposed relocation, a shutdown, or a transfer of existing or future \nwork. Providing notice and reasoning is already required under existing \nlaw and jurisprudence. We included this in our Job Protection Act to \nmake sure the spirit of the law was maintained. But, what the NLRB and \nAssociate General Counsel are now proposing goes much further, changes \nunderstood law, and places an unreasonable burden on employers.\n  As was observed by Sherk and Spakovsky, this new test would raise the \ncosts to businesses by dragging on collective bargaining, by preventing \nthem from legally executing a decision that is in the best interests of \ntheir shareholders until bargaining hits an impasse, and by forcing \nthem to provide detailed economic justification and negotiate their \ninvestment plans with union bosses before having the right to execute a \nrelocation plan. Effectively, it would give a union a seat at the board \nof directors through the force of law and tip the scales of justice in \ntheir favor. If employers do not comply, then they will lose the right \nto later claim their relocation decision did not have to be \ncollectively bargained under the National Labor Relations Act.\n  So as with the NLRB Acting General Counsel's action against Boeing, \nthis potential new posture by the Office of the General Counsel \nrepresents a departure from well-established law. They do not like the \noutcome, so they want to change the rules and give unions greater \nleverage over their employers, who provide the jobs in the first place. \nThey are more concerned about producing outcomes that facilitate the \ncollective bargaining process, rather than those that foster economic \ngrowth, exports, and jobs.\n  Those decisions are best left to the owners, officers, shareholders, \nand directors of businesses, not organized labor or the Federal \nGovernment. This potential change in well-established law would be \nanother blow to manufacturing growth and expansion in the United States \nand further incentive for manufacturers to expand or open a new \nfacility in Mexico, in China, or in India to meet their growing need.\n  Republicans are not the only ones who are outraged by the direction \nthe NLRB seems to be headed. William Gould, who chaired the NLRB during \nthe Clinton administration, was recently quoted in Slate magazine \nexpressing his unease with the board's action. Specifically, he said, \n``The Boeing case is unprecedented,'' and he ``doesn't agree with what \nthe [Acting] General Counsel has done [by] . . . trying to equate an \nemployer's concern with strikes that disrupt production and make it \ndifficult to meet deadlines . . . with hostility toward trade \nunionism.'' That is the Clinton Administration's NLRB General Counsel.\n  Coming back to the Boeing issue, which is set to be heard by an \nadministrative judge on June 14, recent comments in the press from an \nNLRB spokeswoman shed further light on how the board's agenda flies in \nthe face of the very concept of capitalism.\n  On May 19, various press outlets quoted this spokeswoman suggesting \nthat the NLRB Acting General Counsel would drop his case against Boeing \nif the company agreed to build 10 planes in Washington, rather than 7. \nSpecifically she said:\n\n       We are not telling Boeing they can't build planes in South \n     Carolina. We are talking about one specific piece of work: \n     three planes a month. If they keep those three planes a month \n     in Washington, there is no problem.\n\n  So they can build planes in South Carolina, just not the three they \nhad planned. So now the Federal Government or the NLRB is sitting on \nBoeing's board and determining the means of production for American \nindustry while the economy continues to struggle. In Tennessee, we have \nhad 24 months of 9 percent unemployment.\n  Our job is to make it easier and cheaper for the private sector to \ncreate jobs. The NLRB is not acting in the best interests of American \nworkers through its continued attempts to depart from well-established \nlaw and dictate integral business decisions to companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a memorandum \nfrom the Associate General Counsel of NLRB, dated May 10, as well as an \narticle from National Review Online, dated May 16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Office of the General Counsel,\n\n\n                             Division of Operations-Management\n\n                                                     May 10, 2011.\n\n\n                          MEMORANDUM OM 11-58\n\n     To: All Regional Directors, Officers-in-Charge, and Resident \n         Officers.\n     From: Richard A. Siegel, Associate General Counsel.\n     Subject: Submission to Advice of Information Cases in \n         Relocation Situations.\n       In Embarq Corp., 356 NLRB No. 125 (2011), the Board held \n     that the Employer did not violate Section 8(a)(5) by refusing \n     to bargain with the Union over its decision to close a call \n     center in Nevada and relocate that work to its call center in \n     Florida. Applying Dubuque Packing Co., 303 NLRB 386 (1981), \n     enforced in pertinent part, 1 F.3d 24 (D.C. Cir. 1993), cert. \n     denied, 511 U.S. 1138 (1994), the Board found that, although \n     the decision did not involve a change in the scope or \n     direction of the enterprise, and labor costs were a factor, \n     the relocation was nevertheless not a mandatory subject of \n     bargaining because the Union could not have offered labor-\n     cost concessions sufficient to alter the Employer's decision. \n     The Board also dismissed an allegation that the Employer had \n     violated Section 8(a)(5) by refusing to provide information \n     relevant to its relocation decision; since the decision was \n     not a mandatory subject of bargaining, there was no \n     obligation to provide information about it.\n       In a concurring opinion, however, Chairman Liebman \n     suggested that she would consider modifying the Dubuque \n     Packing framework with regard to information requests if a \n     party were to ask the Board to revisit existing law in this \n     area. Specifically, she identified an anomaly in present law, \n     which provides somewhat inconsistently that: (1) an employer \n     would enhance its chances of establishing that labor-cost \n     concessions could not have altered the decision, under the \n     Dubuque Packing standard, ``by describing its reasons for \n     relocating to the union, fully explaining the underlying cost \n     or benefit considerations, and asking whether the union\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\n     could offer labor cost reductions that would enable the \n     employer to meet its profit objectives,'' 303 NLRB at 392, \n     and (2) a union is not entitled to such information if the \n     Board determines in hindsight that the union could not have \n     made sufficient concessions to change the decision and \n     therefore that the decision was not a mandatory subject of \n     bargaining. Chairman Liebman would consider modifying the \n     Dubuque Packing framework by requiring employers to provide \n     requested information about relocation decisions whenever \n     there is a reasonable likelihood that labor-cost concessions \n     might affect the decision. She posits that, if the employer \n     provided the information and the union failed to offer \n     concessions, the union would be precluded from arguing to the \n     Board that it could have made concessions. If, on the other \n     hand, the employer failed to provide such information where \n     labor costs were a factor, it would be precluded from arguing \n     that the union could not have made sufficient concessions.\n       The General Counsel wishes to examine the concerns raised \n     by Chairman Liebman in Embarq, and determine whether to \n     propose a new standard in cases involving these kinds of \n     information requests. That determination will be made based \n     upon a case-by-case review of submissions to the Division of \n     Advice. Therefore, Regions should submit to Advice all cases \n     presenting the question of whether an employer violated \n     Section 8(a)(5) by refusing to provide information related to \n     a relocation or other decision properly analyzed under \n     Dubuque Packing.\n           Signed,\n     R.A.S.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, May 16, 2011]\n\n               The New NLRB: Boeing Is Just the Beginning\n\n               (By Hans A. von Spakovsky and James Sherk)\n\n       The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) raised a lot of \n     eyebrows by filing a complaint against Boeing for opening a \n     new plant in a right-to-work state. But that action is just \n     the beginning of the board's aggressive new pro-union agenda. \n     An internal NLRB memorandum, dated May 10, shows that the \n     board wants to give unions much greater power over employers \n     and their investment and management decisions.\n       Under current NLRB rules, companies can make major business \n     decisions (like relocating a plant) without negotiating with \n     their union--as long as those changes are not primarily made \n     to reduce labor costs. For example, a business can \n     unilaterally merge several smaller operations into one larger \n     facility to achieve administrative efficiencies. Companies \n     only have to negotiate working conditions, not their business \n     plans.\n       The NLRB apparently intends to change that. In the internal \n     memorandum, the board's associate general counsel, Richard \n     Siegel, asks the NLRB's regional directors to flag such \n     business-relocation cases. Siegel explains that the Board is \n     considering ``whether to propose a new standard'' in these \n     situations because the chairman of the NLRB, Wilma Liebman, \n     has expressed her desire to ``revisit existing law in this \n     area'' by modifying the rule established in a case called \n     Dubuque Packing.\n       Apparently, Liebman did not like having to apply the \n     Dubuque Packing rules in a recent case involving the Embarq \n     Corporation and the AFL-CIO. The NLRB decided that under the \n     Dubuque Packing rules, Embarq did not violate the National \n     Labor Relations Act by refusing to bargain with the union \n     over its decision to close its call center in Las Vegas (a \n     right-to-work state) and relocate that work to its call \n     center in Florida (also a right-to-work state).\n       Specifically, the NLRB wants to force companies to provide \n     detailed economic justifications (including underlying cost \n     or benefit considerations) for relocation decisions to allow \n     unions to bargain over them--or lose the right to make those \n     decisions without bargaining over them. It is a ``heads I \n     win, tails you lose'' situation for unions. Either way, \n     businesses would have to negotiate their investment plans \n     with union bosses. In the concurrence that she wrote in the \n     Embarq decision Liebman expressed her displeasure that ``the \n     law does not compel the production of'' such information to \n     unions.\n       What Liebman envisions would raise business costs \n     enormously. Current labor law and the attitude of the pro-\n     union NLRB enables unions to drag negotiations on . . . and \n     on . . . and on. Until bargaining hits an ``impasse,'' \n     employers could not legally make any business changes opposed \n     by their union.\n       The NRLB's goal is not just to prevent companies from \n     investing in right-to-work states. The board apparently also \n     wants to force employers to make unions ``an equal partner in \n     the running of the business enterprise,'' something the \n     Supreme Court ruled in First National Maintenance Corp. v. \n     NLRB and is specifically not required by the NLRA. But the \n     board wants business decisions made to benefit unions, not \n     the shareholders, owners, and other employees of a business, \n     or the overall economy. The Boeing charges are evidently just \n     a first step toward that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3414-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, Senator Corker and I had the privilege \nof being in Chattanooga, Tennessee on Monday for the opening of \nVolkswagen's North American plant. It was a great day for our country. \nHere is a major global manufacturer making in the United States what it \nplans to sell in the United States. We salute Volkswagen. I salute \nChattanooga and Tennessee. One-third of the manufacturing jobs in our \nState are auto jobs. There was a new Volkswagen Passat that gets 43 \nmiles a gallon. That is good news for Americans who are paying $4 or \nmore a gallon for gasoline.\n  But as I was there at that celebration for these new fuel-efficient \ncars, and earlier this week at a hearing of the Energy Committee, I was \nthinking: What if I were to say to you or to anyone I might see, while \nyou are worrying about $4 gasoline: Did you know that we have enough \nunused fuel sitting over here, that is not oil, to power 40 percent of \nour light cars and trucks at a lower cost?\n  That is right. We have enough unused power every night to power 40 \npercent of our light cars and trucks. Every night. We can do that by \nsimply plugging them into the wall. I am talking about electric cars \nand light trucks that almost every major manufacturer is now beginning \nto make, and we do not have to build one new powerplant to do it.\n  Last week Senator Merkley and I appeared before the Energy Committee \nto talk about our legislation, the Promoting Electric Vehicles Act. I \nsaid to the Committee: The main differences between the bill this year \nand the one the Committee reported last year by a vote of 19 to 4, a \ngood bipartisan vote, is that the price of gasoline is higher than it \nwas last year and our bill costs less than it did last year.\n  Encouraging electric vehicles is an appropriate short-term role for \nthe Federal Government. Our legislation establishes short-term \nincentives for the wide adoption of vehicles in 8 to 15 pilot \ncommunities. Our legislation advances battery research. The $1 billion \nthat we save relative to last year's bill, we save by avoiding \nduplicating other research programs.\n  Finally, if you believe that the solution to $4 gasoline and high \nenergy prices is finding more American energy and using less of it, as \nI do, electric cars and trucks are the best way to use less.\n  Electrifying half our cars and trucks can reduce the use of our \nforeign oil by one-third, saving money on how we fuel our \ntransportation system and cutting into the billions of dollars we send \noverseas for foreign oil. So instead of making the speech for the rest \nof my time, let me tell a short story. It is a story of Ross Perot, the \nfamous Texan, and how he made his money.\n  Back in the sixties, he noticed that the big banks down in Dallas \nwere locking their doors at 5 o'clock, and the banks had all of these \nbig computers in the back room, and they were locking them up too. They \nwere not using them at night.\n  So Mr. Perot made a deal with the banks. He said: Sell me your unused \ncomputer time. And they did at cheap rates. Then he went to the States \nand talked to the Governors--this is before I was a Governor--and he \nmade a deal with the States to use that cheap computer time to manage \nMedicaid data. He made $1 billion.\n  In the same way, we have an enormous amount of unused electricity at \nnight. A conservative estimate is that we have an amount of energy that \nis unused at night that is equal to the output of 65 to 70 nuclear \npower plants between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. If we were to use that resource \nto plug in cars and trucks at night, we could electrify 43 percent of \nour cars and trucks without building one new powerplant. It is a very \nambitious goal, to imagine electrifying half our cars and trucks. It \nwould take a long time to do it, but it is the best way to reduce our \nuse of foreign oil.\n  I suspect that is the greatest unused resource in the United States. \nWhat if someone proposed building 60 or 65 nuclear powerplants. \nActually, I proposed\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nbuilding 100. But if we tried to build 60 or 65 more, it would take us \n30 or 40 years and cost us $\\1/2\\ trillion. That is if we could even do \nit.\n  Another reason I think this will work is because it is easy for \nconsumers, and I am one. For 2 years, I drove a Toyota Prius, and it \nhad an A123 battery in it. I increased my mileage to about 80 or 90 \nmiles a gallon. I just plugged it in at night at home. Very simple. I \nnow have a Nissan Leaf. It is all electric. I have an apartment nearby \nthe Capitol. I just plug it in at night. I don't even have a charger. I \njust plug it into the wall, and I can drive it about 2 hours every day \nand plug it in at night. I have not bought any gas since January, since \nI got my Leaf in Washington, DC.\n  I have had no problems, either with the modified Toyota Prius that I \ndrove for 2 years, or with the Nissan Leaf that I have driven now for \nabout half a year. Almost every car company is making electric cars \ntoday or will soon have them on the market.\n  So if the extra electricity is available--and electric vehicles are \neasy to use, and car companies are making them, then why do we need for \nthe government to be involved? That is a good question. For one thing, \nit is the urgency of the problem: $4 gasoline is killing our economy. \nIt is throwing a big wet blanket over it.\n  The only solution is find more, use less. This is the best way to use \nless. To my Republican colleagues, I have said before our Committee, \nand I would say today what we have been saying for 3 years in our \ncaucus: Find more and use less.\n  We have criticized Democrats for wanting to use less without really \nwanting to find more, and we are subject to the same criticism if we \nwant to find more--which I think we should--offshore, on Federal lands, \nand in Alaska, and then we do not have a credible way to use less. \nElectric cars and trucks are the best way to use less.\n  Another criticism is that our bill interferes with the marketplace. \nIt does, but in a short-term and limited way. Short-term incentives for \nnew technologies--to jump-start nuclear energy, to jump-start natural \ngas truck fleets, to jump-start electric cars and trucks in 4 to 5 \nyears--I think are appropriate, given the urgency of the problem. If I \nam here in 5 years, I will be the first to say this should be the end \nof it. If I am not, I will come back and argue for its repeal.\n  Finally, conservative groups across the country have said national \nsecurity demands that we do this. Gary Bauer, president of American \nValues, as well as Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious \nLiberty Commission, endorsed our bill last year, saying that national \nsecurity concerns overwhelm any opposition to it, and it is the best \nway to displace our use of oil. That was them talking.\n  Can we afford it? Well, our proposal is $1 billion cheaper, it is an \nauthorization bill, and we should be setting priorities.\n  There is some suggestion that this committee should also appropriate \nthe money. I would respectfully suggest that we are in a 2-year period \nwhere we have no earmarks because authorizers didn't like appropriators \nauthorizing. Well, let's be consistent and say to authorizers, ``You \nshouldn't be appropriating.'' Let's just do the job of authorizing. \nSenator Merkley and I have agreed that we will not try to pass this \nbill when it comes to the floor unless we can agree to do it in a way \nthat does not add to the debt.\n  So, in summary, I would say it is time to address $4 gasoline and \nhigh energy prices. To do that, we need to find more American energy--\noffshore, on Federal lands, and in Alaska--but we also need to use \nless. The single best way to use less is to jump-start the use of \nelectric cars and trucks. Electricity is just a delivery system. The \nfuel comes from a whole variety of things: natural gas, coal, and other \nthings.\n  So we jump-start the use of that huge resource that we have just \nsitting there unused every single night. Our committee approved this \nbill once before. The problem is worse today than it was when they \napproved it last year. The bill costs less than it did when they \napproved it last year. It is an appropriate role for the Federal \nGovernment. We will work to make sure if this body were to pass it that \nit does not increase the debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to report the bill to the floor and to consider \nencouraging electric cars and trucks as the single best way to use less \nenergy and reduce the use and reduce the cost of gasoline.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his courtesy and for listening \nto my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3415-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3415-S3416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADJOURNMENT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today the Senate declined to vote on \nwhether to recess. Someone said the Republicans blocked the Senate from \nrecessing. That is not correct. Republicans wrote a letter to the \nmajority leader and said we should not recess until we have plans set \nforth and begin to take action to deal with the budget that we have not \npassed that is required by law to be passed.\n  That is what was done. So when it comes down to the moment to move to \nrecess and vote to recess, as we are required to do to have a recess, a \nunanimous consent, or an actual vote, the majority leader chose not to \nvote. I guess he wanted to protect his members from having to actually \nbe recorded voting to recess this body when we have not done our work.\n  The Budget Act, in the United States Code, in the Code book, the \nBudget Act requires that the Senate commence markup hearings in the \nBudget Committee by April 1 and that a budget be produced by April 15. \nCongress does not go to jail if it is not passed, I will acknowledge. \nThere is no fine. Perhaps there should have been.\n  Congress writes laws. I guess they make sure that no consequences \noccur when they apply to them and they do not comply with their duties.\n  The majority leader decided to keep us in pro forma session through \nthe week but to do it in a way that guarantees we will take no action \non a budget. This is a sad thing. It is not a little bitty matter. Our \nCongress knows we are in a serious national crisis. I think we can't \ndeny it, and we have to figure out how to respond to it.\n  I hope this letter--and I will make it a part of the Record--to the \nmajority leader will have some impact on our colleagues and cause them \nto reconsider the actions that have been taken so far. This is what it \nsays:\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: Today marks the 757th day since \n     Congress last adopted a conference report on a budget \n     resolution. But while the Republican House has met its \n     obligations this year, the Democrat-led Senate remains in \n     open defiance of the law--last year the Senate did not even \n     call up a budget for a vote and this year the Senate Budget \n     Committee has not even marked up a resolution, as required \n     under Sec. 300 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       Despite this dubious distinction, the Senate plans to \n     adjourn for a week-long recess on Friday to coincide with \n     Memorial Day, a holiday that honors our men and women in \n     uniform. As our service members put their lives on the line \n     to defend this nation, surely the least Congress can do is \n     produce a plan to confront the debt that is placing the whole \n     country at risk. House Republicans put forward just such a \n     budget weeks ago--an honest plan for prosperity to overcome \n     this nation's dangerously rising debt, cut wasteful \n     Washington spending, and make our economy more competitive.\n       But, in this time of economic danger, the Senate continues \n     to stonewall any and all action on a FY2012 budget. For this \n     reason, we respectfully request that you delay any \n     adjournment of this body until you or members of your party \n     in the Senate bring forward a budget resolution and schedule \n     a meeting of the Budget Committee--a power which resides \n     solely with the majority--to work on that budget.\n       In an interview last week, you stated, ``There's no need to \n     have a Democratic budget in my opinion . . . It would be \n     foolish for us to do a budget at this stage.'' We find these \n     remarks shocking, especially given the state of our fiscal \n     affairs: the co-chairs of President Obama's own fiscal \n     commission recently warned that, if we do not take swift and \n     serious action to address our rising debt, the United States \n     faces ``the most predictable economic crisis in its \n     history.''\n       The House completed its work on the FY2012 budget \n     resolution on April 15th. But no budget can become binding \n     until the Senate acts. In our view it would be an astounding \n     abandonment of responsibility for the Senate to go on recess \n     without having taken any steps to produce a budget. We hope \n     that, as required by law and in your capacity as Majority \n     Leader, you change course and follow the example of the \n     Republican-led House and provide the American people with the \n     honest leadership and the honest budget they deserve.\n       Until a budget plan is made public, and until that plan is \n     scheduled for committee\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\n     action, on what basis can the Senate justify returning home \n     for a one-week vacation and recess while our spending and \n     debt continue to spiral dangerously out of control?\n       We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this request \n     and welcome any questions you might have.\n\n  We are out of sorts. The American people are not happy with this \nCongress. They say our polling numbers are the lowest they can get. In \nlast fall's election, there was a shellacking, particularly of the big \nspenders, the ones who want to have more government programs and create \nmore debt. There was an accounting and I guess there will be an \naccounting in the next election and we all better be sure we have tried \nto respond faithfully to the challenges America faces.\n  What has happened this week is a mockery, a sham, a joke. We had four \nvotes yesterday. Each one of them was carefully and sophisticatedly \nstructured to fail. The one that failed the biggest was President \nObama's budget. It was voted down unanimously by this body, with zero \nvotes. It was all designed to suggest it is impossible for the Senate \nto pass a budget. But the Senate doesn't even require a supermajority \nto pass a budget. Under the Budget Act that we have, it provides that \nit has a preference, has to be brought up properly, and can be passed \nwith a simple majority.\n  The Democratic majority, similar to Republican majorities in the \npast, have to choose will they seek to pass a budget that has the broad \nsupport of both parties or will they simply use their majority and pass \ntheir budget? You should do one or the other. A good, bipartisan budget \nis always preferable, but sometimes we have different opinions. So if \nyou have a different view from the other party and you can't reach an \nagreement, you have a majority, you can pass your budget. You know, \nwhen you do that, what happens. When you pass your budget, what \nhappens? You lay out for the American people what you believe. It is \none thing to criticize someone else, it is another thing to tell the \nworld what you believe. The House has told the world what they think \nwould be an effective budget for the future. What does the Senate say? \nNothing. We haven't even commenced a markup in the Budget Committee.\n  A budget sets forth your vision for the future. It tells how much you \nwant to cut taxes or raise taxes. It tells how much you want to raise \nspending or reduce spending. It says how much debt you expect to \naccumulate over the years to come or whether you would reach a surplus \nor a balanced budget. That is what a budget does. It holds you \naccountable. You have to defend it. You have to say what it is.\n  One thing I have been proud about is that the Republicans over in the \nHouse met their duty and produced a budget and they are prepared to \ndefend it. Congressman Ryan knows what he is talking about. He worked \non that budget and he is prepared to defend it. It has been terribly \nmisrepresented, but he is prepared to defend it, explain it, and talk \nto anybody about it.\n  But if our colleagues in the Senate fail to produce a budget--don't \nproduce one at all--it is kind of hard to hold them to account, isn't \nit? That is why it is pretty clear that Senator Reid said: Why, it is \nfoolish for us to have a budget. It is foolish for us to have a budget \nbecause we would then be in a position to be held accountable. Was he \ntalking about foolish for America to have a budget? Was he expressing a \nview that it is better for America that we have a budget? No. When he \nsaid it is foolish for us to produce a Democratic budget, he was \ntalking purely politically. He was saying we think it is smart politics \nfor us not to put our necks on the line to actually expose to the \nAmerican people what we believe in. We would rather be in a position to \ncriticize those people in the House who actually had the gumption--I \nguess he would say the foolish sense--to pass a budget and tell the \nAmerican people what they think.\n  I have to say that is not a good situation. We didn't have a budget \nlast year. We are not having one this year. Is there any wonder, then, \nour deficits continue to spiral out of control to a degree that we have \nnever, ever seen before?\n  Many criticized President Bush--and so did I--for the $450 billion \nbudget deficit he produced. I thought it was a stunning number. Since \nPresident Obama has been President, the budget deficits have been $1.2 \ntrillion, $1.3 trillion, and by September 30, it is projected to be \nabout $1.5 trillion. We will take in $2.2 trillion this year, we \nexpect, and we will spend $3.7 trillion. Forty cents-plus of every $1 \nwe spend is borrowed. We are not confronting that.\n  So we are taking a recess. When it came time to vote to recess, the \nmajority leader figured out a way to not have to actually vote to go \nhome because, I guess, his Members felt they would be embarrassed if \nthey had to vote to go home after being in violation of the United \nStates Code to produce a budget.\n  This is not going away. This issue is not going away. Every expert, \nincluding the chairman of the fiscal commission formed by President \nObama, the chairman of which he appointed Mr. Erskine Bowles, told us \nin a written statement, delivered by Mr. Bowles and Cochairman Simpson, \nthat this Nation has never faced a more predictable financial crisis. \nWe are heading toward that wall at warp speed. We can have a financial \ncrisis. In fact, Mr. Bowles was asked by our chairman, Senator Conrad: \nWhen do you think this crisis might occur? He said: Two years, maybe \nless. Alan Simpson said: I think maybe 1 year.\n  Surely, we have to get off the debt path we are on, spending so much \nmore than we take in, and 40 cents of every $1 we spend is borrowed and \nwe pay interest on it. The interest has the potential to damage our \neconomy in a very significant and substantial way. It could put us in \nanother recession. That is what Mr. Bowles was talking about--a debt \ncrisis, another recession. Maybe it could be perhaps worse than the one \nwe are in. Our projection for a fragile growth is not coming back as \nmuch as we would like it to. One reason, expert economists tell us, is \nthat we are carrying too much debt and that has the potential to pull \ndown our economy.\n  I think we are in a crisis. I think the economy is so naturally \nstrong, the American people have so many capabilities and such a good \nwork ethic that if we get the economy under control and our fiscal \nhouse in Washington under control, I believe the economy will come \nback. But we need to do it now, and every day we delay increases the \nrisk that we will have a crisis occur.\n  I thank the Chair. I saw my colleague, Senator Klobuchar. I know she \nwants to speak tonight. I will repeat that this matter is not over. We \nare in a long-term battle for the future of America. We are in a long-\nterm battle for the financial security of our Nation. Yes, it is about \nour grandchildren. But as Mr. Bowles told us and Alan Simpson told us \nand Alan Greenspan told us, we could have a debt crisis in just a few \nyears. Would that not be a disaster--because of our failure to respond \nto the extraordinary debt we are incurring, that we have a financial \ncrisis that could put us back into recession. I hope not. I don't think \nthat is going to happen this year, but I don't know. We have been \nwarned it might. It is scary.\n  So we are going to continue to talk about this. We are going to \ncontinue to use the rules of the Senate to try to force the Senate to \ncomply with the rules of the United States Code that says we should \nhave a budget. We have had 757 days without a budget. How many more \nwill it be before we have a budget? We will continue that battle. It is \ngoing to be a battle for the financial future of our country. \nHopefully, we will be successful and somehow, someway, as the pressure \nbuilds and the American people continue to have their voices heard, the \nWhite House, which today has been oblivious to these challenges, that \nthe Democratic Senate, which has been oblivious to these challenges, \nwill somehow get on board and seriously work with the House to confront \nthe challenges we face and put us on a sound path to financial security \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3416-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3416-S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRADLEY HAYES\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words on the \ndeparture of Bradley Hayes, a valued, longtime member of my Judiciary \nCommittee staff. Although I will feel the loss of his knowledge and \nenthusiasm, I am pleased that he is moving on to a new phase in his \ncareer.\n  Bradley had a wonderful upbringing in his home town of Mobile, AL, \nand a\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nstellar academic background. He graduated cum laude with a B.S. in \nbusiness from Birmingham Southern College. After managing a live music \nvenue in Birmingham for several years, Bradley entered law school at \nthe University of Alabama, where he served as managing editor of the \nJournal of the Legal Profession and was an active member of the moot \ncourt board. Immediately after being admitted to the Alabama bar, \nBradley joined my staff on the Judiciary Committee.\n  In the 6 years he was with me, Bradley served at various times as my \nlegislative counsel, senior counsel and deputy chief counsel on the \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Throughout \nthat time, he has worked to secure our borders, protect our country \nfrom the threat of international terrorism, secure the private property \nrights of artists and inventors in the information age, and eliminate \nwasteful spending and destructive litigation. Perhaps most importantly, \nhe showed both courage and unwavering leadership during the Senate's \ndebates on comprehensive immigration reform in 2006 and 2007. Bradley's \nhard work played an important role during the DREAM Act debate last \nyear. Bradley was an effective staffer during debates on the \nreauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2005 and 2006. He also \nparticipated in the constitutional advice and consent process for four \nSupreme Court confirmations and countless important executive branch \nnominations.\n  I would just conclude by thanking Bradley for his hard work and for \nhis loyalty. He was more than willing to invest the time and effort \nnecessary to handle a breadth of issues, and he did so with great \nskill, professionalism and integrity. He was with me during some of the \nmost critical times of my career in the Senate thus far, and his \ninsight will be missed. He has been an excellent public servant because \nhe loves his country and understands and defends its exceptional core \nvalues. In addition, he is fun to work with. I wish him the best in his \nnew endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3417-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LUIS TIGERA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate an extraordinary Illinoisan, Luis C. Tigera. After serving \nwith distinction for 26 years with the Illinois State Police, First \nDeputy Director Tigera is retiring as the highest ranking career member \nof the organization and the first Cuban American to hold such a \nposition in the agency.\n  Throughout his time with the Illinois State Police, First Deputy \nDirector Tigera has served in a variety of positions with the \norganization. He started his career in law enforcement by patrolling \nthe interstate system of the Chicago area suburbs. He worked his way up \nto overseeing the statewide guns, drugs, gangs and money laundering \nunit. Mr. Tigera also managed and regulated the operations of the \ngaming industry in Illinois. And he served as senior policy adviser to \nthe Illinois State police director.\n  In addition to his extensive experience in law enforcement, First \nDeputy Director Tigera was selected to attend the FBI National Academy \nin Quantico, VA, where he successfully completed executive management \ntraining. He also holds a masters degree in criminal justice \nadministration from Lewis University.\n  One of the reasons the Illinois State Police has grown and flourished \nunder First Deputy Director Tigera's leadership is his commitment to \ncommunity. He led an initiative to work collaboratively with community \ngroups and others within the public safety arena. He has always \nemphasized the importance of team-building and problem-solving as he \nserved as second-in-command of a full-service police agency of 3,500 \nemployees. In addition to his leadership in the Illinois State Police, \nFirst Deputy Director Tigera is a member of the Illinois Terrorism Task \nForce, the Governor's Interstate Gun Trafficking Task Force, and \npreviously served as the Chairman of the Board of the Chicago High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n  First Deputy Director Tigera has been married to Ana for 26 years and \nis the proud father of two sons, Luis, Jr., who has followed in his \nfather's footsteps by becoming an Illinois State Police trooper, and \nZachary.\n  I would like to congratulate First Deputy Director Tigera on his \nretirement and thank him for his service to the State of Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3417-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3417-S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the brave \nmen and women who have made the supreme sacrifice of their lives in \ndefense of our Nation. This Memorial Day, I join all Americans in \nhonoring those brave souls.\n  Over the past decade since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United \nStates, men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have been deployed to \nfight on our behalf in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Thousands of those courageous servicemen and women have lost \ntheir lives as part of these ongoing missions. More than 70 of these \nwarriors called Mississippi home, including 7 brave fighters who have \nbeen killed in Afghanistan since we last observed this national \nholiday. These are the sacrifices that we should keep in mind as we \ncommemorate Memorial Day 2011.\n  I am deeply grateful to the young Mississippians we have lost over \nthe past 12 months, and my heart goes out to the families and friends \nthey leave behind.\n  For the record, I now cite the names of these fallen heroes from \nMississippi:\n  1SG Robert N. Barton of Roxie, 35, who died June 7, 2010;\n  PFC Joshua S. Ose of Hernando, 19, who died September 20, 2010;\n  PFC William B. Dawson of Tunica, 20, who died September 24, 2010;\n  SGT Eric C. Newman of Waynesboro, 30, who died October 14, 2010;\n  1LT William J. Donnelly IV of Picayune, 27, who died November 25, \n2010;\n  SSG Jason A. Rogers of Brandon, 28, who died April 7, 2011; and\n  SSG David D. Self of Pearl, 29, who died May 16, 2011.\n  While their sacrifices will leave a deep void in many lives, I hope \ntheir families can find comfort in the fact that they served proudly \nand will be counted among the multitude of Mississippians who, over the \nlong history of our great Nation, have bravely served and courageously \ngiven their lives for their country.\n  Mississippians traditionally identify themselves with a strong \nsupport of our national defense and a willingness to serve in our Armed \nForces. We also hold fast to the memory of those lost in battle.\n  In fact, Columbus, MS, proudly claims to be the birthplace of \nMemorial Day, which was originally designated as Decoration Day to \ndecorate the graves of Civil War soldiers. This tradition evolved into \nMemorial Day, which was recognized as a Federal holiday in 1971.\n  As we again gather to commemorate Memorial Day, people across \nMississippi will stop to reflect on all those who have perished \nprotecting our Nation, whether in battles long ago or in the ongoing \nconflicts. We will also affirm our belief that Congress should ensure \nthat those who join our Armed Forces will be the best equipped and best \ntrained in the world.\n  As a veteran of the U.S. Navy, I am thankful for the bravery and \ndedication of those who have fought and died for our country in our \ndefense. They are true heroes, and we owe them our solemn gratitude for \ntheir service and sacrifice.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Ken Hermogino\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I rise to remember the life and \nheroic service of SGT Ken Hermogino, who died on May 10, 2011, in Herat \nProvince, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when his military vehicle \noverturned. Fort Carson cannot replace a leader like Sergeant \nHermogino. His passing represents a tragic loss for his hometown of \nHenderson, NV, and for our country.\n  Sergeant Hermogino's story is uniquely American. Within 2 months of \nthe horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that took the \nlives of nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children, Sergeant \nHermogino began a military career that would span 10 years and two \nbranches of the armed services. His exceptional character shone in the \nface of our shared adversity; he chose to serve when his country needed \nhim most.\n  In 1998, he graduated from Basic High School in Henderson, NV, where \nhe participated in the Marine Corps Junior\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\nROTC program. This experience allowed him to build up the skills and \ndiscipline that would become the foundation of his success in the \nservices. Outside of school, Sergeant Hermogino relaxed by \nskateboarding, BMX racing, and displaying his talent for fixing just \nabout anything.\n  Sergeant Hermogino enlisted in the Air Force in 2001, and he served \nfor 8 years as a medical administrator based in the U.S. and Manas, \nKyrgyzstan. While he assisted fellow servicemembers suffering from \nlife-threatening wounds, Sergeant Hermogino always felt compelled to \nexpand his contribution. His brother, Marvin Jeff, has said, ``He \nwanted to be more involved.''\n  In 2009, Sergeant Hermogino joined the Army and served in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom as a member of the 7th Squadron, 10th \nCavalry Regiment, based at Fort Carson, CO. Sergeant Hermogino's \nbravery and exemplary service did not escape the notice of his \ncommanders. He earned, among other decorations, the Air Force and Army \nCommendation Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, and the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nHermogino's service was in keeping with this sentiment by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  Today's tribute to the memory of Sergeant Hermogino must also honor \nhis profound love for family. In this spirit, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending our deepest respects and condolences to Norma, his \nmother, Renato, his father, and to his entire family.

For his bravery in Afghanistan and across the world, \nhe will forever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3418-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING OUR SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN THIS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of \nthose to whom we are forever indebted: the brave men and women of our \nArmed Forces, both past and present, who died in defense of freedom. It \nhas been and continues to be their duty, honor, and privilege to serve. \nWith Memorial Day 2011 approaching, it is our duty to pause and honor \nthose who have sacrificed.\n  Memorial Day has become the unofficial beginning of summer. Schools \nare beginning to break for summer vacation, community pools are opening \nfor the season, and friends and family are gathering this weekend for \nbarbecues. It is important that we not lose sight of the true nature of \nthis holiday and I encourage all of us to take time to pause and \nremember the meaning of Memorial Day.\n  Memorial Day, originally called Decoration Day, is a day of \nremembrance for those who have died in our Nation's service. Since \n1868, this time of year has been designated as a time to pause and \nhonor our war dead. It was officially designated a Federal holiday in \n1971. An often overlooked tradition is to have a moment of remembrance \nspecifically at 3 p.m. local time.\n  Throughout the Nation over this holiday weekend we will see many \nAmerican flags and flowers adorning the graves of those who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. I will remember in particular \nthe 104 Marylanders who have been killed in our most recent conflicts, \nand I will remind myself that our freedom isn't free. I will remind \nmyself of their ultimate sacrifice and I will remind myself of the \nongoing sacrifices their families continue to make each and every day.\n  I am immensely proud of the men and women--fewer than 1 percent of \nour population--who serve in our All-Volunteer Force. But there is a \ndrawback, of sorts, to having an All-Volunteer Force: the sacrifices of \nthe few are not felt by the many; therefore, they can be overlooked. We \nmustn't allow this to happen. This environment is much different than \nthe conflicts of the past where nearly everyone had a friend, neighbor, \nor loved one who wore the cloth of our Nation.\n  I call on my colleagues and all Americans to remember the true \nmeaning of Memorial Day and take the time to pause and remember those \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom and for \nthe continued success of this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3418-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3418-S3419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to adjourn for the \nMemorial Day recess, I had hoped that we would be allowed to proceed \nwith the consensus judicial nominees ready for confirmation and who are \nso needed to fill vacancies on Federal courts around the country. \nInstead, the Republican leadership's filibuster of the nomination of \nGoodwin Liu is being supplemented with delays of even those judicial \nnominations supported by Republican home State Senators and approved by \nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is too bad.\n  With judicial vacancies continuing at crisis levels, affecting the \nability of courts to provide justice to Americans around the country, I \nhave been urging the Senate to vote on the judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. The Senate is recessing with 19 judicial \nnominations awaiting final action. Of those, 16 are by anyone's \ndefinition consensus nominees. All 16 were unanimously approved by all \nRepublican and all Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee. Yet \nthey remain stalled without final Senate action.\n  We should have regular votes on President Obama's highly qualified \nnominees, instead of partisan filibusters and more delays. With \nvacancies still totaling 90 on Federal courts throughout the country \nwith nearly two dozen future vacancies on the horizon, there is no time \nto delay taking up these nominations. Had we taken positive action on \nthe consensus nominees, vacancies could have been reduced below 80 for \nthe first time in years.\n  All of the nominations reported by this committee and pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar have been through our Judiciary Committee's \nfair and thorough process. We review extensive background material on \neach nominee. All Senators on the Committee, Democratic and Republican, \nhave the opportunity to ask the nominees questions at a live hearing. \nSenators also have the opportunity to ask questions in writing \nfollowing the hearing and to meet with the nominees. All of these \nnominees which the Committee reported to the Senate have a strong \ncommitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the \nConstitution. All have the support of their home State Senators, both \nRepublican and Democratic. They should not be delayed for weeks and \nmonths needlessly after being so thoroughly and fairly considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  They include several nominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies, \nincluding Paul Engelmayer and William Kuntz of New York, Michael Simon \nof Oregon, Richard Brooke Jackson of Colorado, Kathleen Williams of \nFlorida, and Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, as well as Henry Floyd of \nSouth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Professor Liu \nbeing filibustered by Republican leadership is also to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy.\n  Those nominees who have the support of home State Republican Senators \ninclude Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Henry Floyd \nof South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Sara Lynn Darrow of Illinois, \nKathleen Williams of Florida, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, John \nAndrew Ross of Missouri, Timothy Cain of South Carolina, Nannette \nJolivette Brown of Louisiana, and Nancy Torresen of Maine. In spite of \nthat support, we are unable to secure consent from the Republican \nleadership to consider and confirm them.\n  Of the judicial nominations we have been able to get the Senate to \nconsider this year almost 70 percent were delayed from last year. We \nhave only been able to confirm eight judicial nominees that had \nhearings and were reported for the first time this year. So when some \nsay we are taking ``positive action'' on large percentages of nominees, \nwhat this shows is how many unobjectionable nominees were stalled last \nyear by objections from the minority.\n  We could have made significant progress helping Americans seeking \njustice in our Federal courts before\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nthis recess. Sadly, it is a missed opportunity for Senators across the \naisle to have joined together with us and worked with the President to \nprovide needed judicial resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3419-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S CALL TO GO TO THE MOON\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, May 25, 2011, marked the 50th \nanniversary of President John F. Kennedy's speech that set the original \ndream of American exploration with a goal of sending a human to the \nMoon and returning him safely by the end of the decade.\n  President Kennedy's speech was more than a call for a Moon shot. It \nwas 17 days after Alan Shepard became the second human in space, and \nthe Nation was still recovering from a recession and recovering from \nthe Cuban missile crisis. That year, President Kennedy took the unusual \nstep of coming to Congress in May to address urgent, ``extraordinary'' \nnational needs. During his speech, he said, ``In a very real sense, it \nwill not be one man going to the Moon . . . it will be an entire \nNation. For all of us must work to put him there.'' He sounded the \nstarting gun of the space race. In that race, the United States and its \nyoung President were determined to cross the finish line first.\n  America is no longer in a space race. We are in a race for our \neconomic future. We are not racing other countries. We are racing \nourselves. To win this economic race, we must do as President Obama has \nurged us. We must work together to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-\nbuild our competitors. That is why I fight so hard to invest in \nAmerica's exploration and discovery which creates jobs for today and \njobs for tomorrow.\n  As we were 50 years ago, our space program is embarking on a new \njourney. This year, after 30 years of great service NASA will retire \nthe Space Shuttle with honor and dignity. We will bid goodbye to this \nworkhorse that launched and fixed Hubble and built the International \nSpace Station.\n  Last year, Congress gave NASA a new path forward. My colleagues and I \nfought to pass a new authorization bill. It was not easy. There was \nconfusion and chaos about the path forward, and the austere budget \nenvironment required tough choices. The authorization law established a \nbalanced space program. It increased investments in Science and \nAeronautics so we can explore the universe, protect the planet, and \nmake air travel safer and more reliable. The bill provided for new \nSpace Technology research and development to make exploring space safer \nand more efficient. Finally, it gave us a sustainable human space \nflight program that extends the International Space Station lab to \n2020, opens low Earth orbit to commercial providers, for cargo first, \nthen crew, and broadens human reach beyond low Earth orbit.\n  NASA will begin building our next generation vehicles to go beyond \nlow Earth orbit, the heavy lift rocket and the Orion capsule. The \nprivate sector will build commercial cargo and crew vehicles, with NASA \nproviding the venture capital to get cargo and astronauts to the \nInternational Space Station while building a whole new industry.\n  The shuttle is retiring, but our missions in space will sail on. It \ndoesn't matter how we get there. We can't be defined by our Space \nTransportation System. Our future in space will be built on innovation \nand discovery from commercial rockets taking cargo and someday \nastronauts to the International Space Station; to the James Webb Space \nTelescope discovering new galaxies and new frontiers in science; to new \ntechnologies to grab and fix damaged satellites in space with robots.\n  New technologies don't just happen. They come from American ingenuity \nthat is built on discovery and innovation. They have made America great \nand they have made us a nation worth imitating.\n  As we look around the world, we see people who yearn to imitate the \ndemocracy we have, who brought down dictators and autocrats with \nAmerican innovations like Twitter. They believe representative, \nparliamentary bodies can give them an orderly way to move government \nforward and will give them better lives, helping them compete in the \nworld economy.\n  Already, emerging nations, like China, are imitating our investments \nin discovery and innovation. China is embarking on an ambitious space \nprogram that is reaching for the stars with satellites and astronauts. \nChina is increasing its science research budget 20 percent each year, \nseeking to replicate our National Science Foundation.\n  I don't worry about being in a race with China or other nations. \nChina can't beat us. We can only beat ourselves by losing our drive to \nreach for great goals and by failing to invest in the research and \ndevelopment that will help us achieve them. I will keep fighting to for \nthe innovation and discovery that makes America worth imitating.\n  I believe in the space program. I believe in space technology, in \ngreen science that helps us understand and protect the planet, and in \nheliophysics that studies the Sun so we know when solar storms could \nknock out the power grid. I believe in the men and women of the space \nprogram like the astronauts who risk their lives to extend our human \nreach in space, the astrophysicists who teach us about dark matter and \nthe origins of the universe, and the machinists who craft the precision \nrobots that explore the universe for us. The men and women of the space \nprogram are the best of the American economy, creating jobs for today \nand jobs for tomorrow.\n  President Kennedy knew we needed all of the Nation's talents to go \nsafely to the Moon. Fifty years later, we live in different, and more \nfrugal, times. We must not let our urgent, immediate needs keep us from \ninvesting in programs that see results well into the future. While \nlooking toward immediate national needs, President Kennedy also urged \ninvestments for the long haul. He wanted the United States to take \nrisks on science that changed the world, putting people on the Moon, \nand on a civilian weather satellite in space.\n  While America waits on our new crop of innovations to mature, we will \nkeep reaping the harvest of the discoveries and investments made long \nago that have become the Internet, medical imaging like MRIs, and \ncountless other products that help American companies invent new \nproducts and create new jobs.\n  In these frugal times, we should all work together to keep alive \nPresident Kennedy's spirit of exploration and discovery and win the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3419-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3419-S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, consistent with Senate Standing Orders and \nmy policy of publishing in the Congressional Record a statement \nwhenever I place a hold on legislation, I am announcing my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 968, the \nPROTECT IP Act.\n  In December of last year I placed a hold on similar legislation, \ncommonly called COICA, because I felt the costs of the legislation far \noutweighed the benefits. After careful analysis of the Protect IP Act, \nor PIPA, I am compelled to draw the same conclusion. I understand and \nagree with the goal of the legislation, to protect intellectual \nproperty and combat commerce in counterfeit goods, but I am not willing \nto muzzle speech and stifle innovation and economic growth to achieve \nthis objective. At the expense of legitimate commerce, PIPA's \nprescription takes an overreaching approach to policing the Internet \nwhen a more balanced and targeted approach would be more effective. The \ncollateral damage of this approach is speech, innovation and the very \nintegrity of the Internet.\n  The Internet represents the shipping lane of the 21st century. It is \nincreasingly in America's economic interest to ensure that the Internet \nis a viable means for American innovation, commerce, and the \nadvancement of our ideals that empower people all around the world. By \nceding control of the Internet to corporations through a private right \nof action, and to government agencies that do not sufficiently \nunderstand and value the Internet, PIPA represents a threat our \neconomic future and to our international objectives. Until the many \nissues that I and others have raised with this legislation are \naddressed, I will object to a unanimous consent request to proceed to \nthe legislation.\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3420-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              NRA POSITION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Over \n     the past three decades, we've fought successfully to block \n     unnecessary and intrusive compilation of firearms-related \n     records by several federal agencies, and will continue to \n     protect the privacy of our members and all American gun \n     owners.\n       While well-intentioned, the language of this amendment as \n     currently drafted raises potential problems for gun owners, \n     in that it encourages the government to use provisions in \n     current law that allow access to firearms records without \n     reasonable cause, warrant, or judicial oversight of any kind.\n       Based on these concerns and the fact that the NRA does not \n     ordinarily take positions on procedural votes, we have no \n     position on a motion to table amendment # 363.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris W.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues a milestone that has been reached by an important \ncultural exchange program administered by the State Department. In \n1986, the United States Information Agency, USIA, exercised its \nauthority under the Fulbright/ Hays Act to establish the Au Pair \nProgram on a pilot basis. This initiative was designed to provide \nopportunities for young Europeans to live with an American family, care \nfor children, and pursue their educational interests.\n  One of the leaders in developing the concept of the Au Pair Program \nwas the American Institute in Foreign Study, AIFS, located in my \nhometown of Stamford, CT. AIFS was one of the initial sponsors and \nworked in connection with the State Department to develop a \ncomprehensive framework that supports American families and foreign \nnationals.\n  Over the past 25 years, the Au Pair Program has grown dramatically. \nCongress assisted in that growth by passing legislation, signed into \nlaw by President Clinton in 1997, which gave the Au Pair Program \npermanent authority under the J-1 visa program. This initiative has \nproven to be a remarkable success. In fact, over 180,000 au pairs from \nover 60 countries have lived with an American family for a year since \nthe program's inception.\n  I can personally attest to the strength and value of the Au Pair \nProgram. When our youngest daughter was growing up, Hadassah and I had \nseveral au pairs. They became part of our extended family and we still \nkeep in touch with them today. The exchange experience enriched the \nlives of our au pair and my family through the sharing of culture, \nlanguage, and religion.\n  I am pleased the U.S. State Department is holding a reception on June \n9, 2011, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Au Pair Program. I \ncommend all those who have made this program so successful, and in \nparticular AIFS, for its vision and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3420-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT JOSE PEQUENO\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a real American \nHero, SSG Jose Pequeno of my home State of New Hampshire, and his \nsteadfast family. After leaving the U.S. Marines, Jose became one of \nthe youngest police chiefs in the State of New Hampshire. After 9/11, \nhe joined the U.S. Army, and heroically volunteered to go to Iraq. \nFollowing an IED explosion, Jose was almost mortally wounded, but \nfought to live. Now, with the help of his mother and family he \ncontinues that battle. This coming Memorial Day weekend, I ask all of \nus to remember the many servicemen and women and their families who \nhave sacrificed so much for us.

May 28, 2011 \nwill mark the 40th anniversary of this race which is an institution in \nmy home State of Colorado.\n  This year's race has attracted some 2,500 racers from 44 States and 5 \ncountries and 3,500 riders participating in all of the weekend's many \ncycling related events.\n  This race is the third oldest continuously sanctioned bike race in \nthe United States and probably the most grueling of them all. The Iron \nHorse Classic is a 50-mile race that takes riders over two beautiful \nmountain passes in Colorado's awe inspiring San Juan Mountains. The \nrace course tops out at 10,860 feet and has a vertical climb of some \n6,600 feet for every racer.\n  The race is one that many professional bike racers compete in at some \npoint in their career with many Olympians, National and World Champions \nriding in the race over the decades.\n  Organized for decades by cycling legend Ed Zink of Durango, the Iron \nHorse Classic is a tremendous asset to all of southwest Colorado. The \nrace's economic impact on our economy is around $2 million each year \nand it has donated around $500,000 to local causes over the years.\n  As I am sure you can imagine, this is a grueling event for which all \nriders put in many long months of training.\n  I am proud to recognize all the riders, staff, volunteers and \ncommunity members from southwest Colorado who have made the Iron Horse \nClassic into a premier Colorado cycling event on this its 40th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3421-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING F.T. HOGAN H'DOUBLER, JR., M.D.\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as the Memorial holiday approaches, \nand the Nation remembers our brave soldiers who have served and are \nserving in our military, I ask the Senate to join me in remembering a \ndecorated war hero and a fellow Missourian, F.T. ``Hogan'' H'Doubler, \nJr., M.D., who passed away on November 24, 2010.\n  Dr. H'Doubler was born in Springfield, MO, on June 18, 1925. In \nDecember 1942, at the age of 17, he graduated from high school a \nsemester early to enlist in the Navy. He was assigned to the V-12 \ntraining program at Miami University in Oxford, OH. He earned his \nmedical degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n  After the conclusion of World War II, F.T. ``Hogan'' H'Doubler, Jr., \nM.D. reentered the Navy as a lieutenant junior grade in the Medical \nCorps. During the Korean war, he volunteered with the Fleet Marines, \nand while treating a wounded marine, he received multiple gunshot \nwounds and was evacuated from Korea. Because of these injuries, he \nreceived a Purple Heart with the Oak Leaf Cluster and a Bronze Star.\n  Dr. H'Doubler became a Shriner in 1956 and served as Potentate in \n1968. He later became the Imperial Potentate of the Shrine of North \nAmerica from 1980 1981. He was an Emeritus Trustee of Shriners \nHospitals for Children, and served as chairman of both the Medical \nResearch Planning Committee and the Budget Committee. He was also a \nmember of the Finance Committee and an Emeritus Representative of the \nShriners International. He is credited with starting the Stop Burn \nInjury Program, which is still active today.\n  Dr. H'Doubler belonged to many professional organizations, including \nthe American Medical Association, Missouri State Medical Society, \nGreene County Medical Society, American Thyroid Association, and the \nAmerican Academy of Alternative Medicine, of which he served as \npresident in 1985.\n  He is survived by his wife Marie, and his four children: daughters \nJulie Thomas and Sarah Muegge, and sons Kurt and Charles, and six \ngrandchildren.\n  I would like to pay tribute to this wonderful man who served his \nNation and his community with distinction and achieved the Shriners \ngoal of free orthopedic and burn care for all children. Dr. H'Doubler \nwas always a trusted resource on medical issues on whom I could rely at \nany time. His insight, his compassion, and his willingness to lead on \nimportant issues made him a sought after expert. I always enjoyed \nspending time with Dr. H'Doubler, and he often took time to mentor me \non medical and political topics. He was a remarkable man with a full, \nrich life, and I was glad to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3421-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3421-S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING GENERAL MATTHEW BUNKER RIDGWAY\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, when GEN Matthew Bunker Ridgway \npassed away on July 26, 1993, he was one of the most decorated soldiers \nin the U.S. Armed Forces. Members of his family, including some of my \nconstituents from Columbia, MO, gather each year. This year, they will \nhonor General Ridgway's leadership, character, and courage as they \ncelebrate the 60th anniversary of his command as Supreme Commander of \nthe United Nations forces in Korea and Supreme Commander of the U.S. \nFar East Command during the Korean war.\n  General Ridgway was born on March 3, 1895, in Fort Monroe, VA, to COL \nThomas Ridgway and Mrs. Ruth Ridgway. He went to high school in Boston, \nMA, and afterward planned to follow in his father's footsteps at West \nPoint. Young Matthew failed the math portion of his entrance exam but \nwas not deterred. He studied harder for his second attempt, passed, and \ngraduated from West Point. In 1917 he was commissioned as second \nlieutenant. After the disappointment of not being sent into combat \nduring World War I, Lieutenant Ridgway said, ``The soldier who has had \nno share in this last great victory of good over evil would be \nruined.'' After serving on various generals' staffs and commanding the \n15th Infantry in Tientsin, China, General Ridgway would get his chance \nto fight.\n  In August 1942, General Ridgway succeeded Omar Bradley when he was \ngiven command of the 82nd Airborne Division. The 82nd was chosen as one \nof the Army's five new airborne divisions. The conversion of an entire \ninfantry division to airborne status was an unprecedented and daunting \ntask which Ridgway successfully accomplished. In 1944, General Ridgway \nhelped plan the airborne operations of Operation Overlord, the Allied \ninvasion of Europe. In Normandy, he courageously jumped with his \ntroops, who fought bravely for 33 days in advancing to Saint-Sauveur-\nle-Vicomte near Cherbourg, France.\n  In 1950, as the Korean war raged, General Ridgway was given command \nof the 8th Army. When Ridgway assumed command the 8th Army was in \ntactical retreat and suffering from low morale. After a successful \nreorganization of command structure and service at the front lines, \nGeneral Ridgway had repaired morale among his soldiers. Ridgway shifted \ntactics and, relying heavily on coordinated artillery, went on the \noffensive, helping slow and later stop the Chinese at the battles of \nChipyong-ni and Wonju. When General MacArthur was relieved of command \nin 1951, General Ridgway took the helm as Supreme Commander of U.N. \nforces in Korea and Supreme Commander of the U.S. Far East Command. \nOver the next year, Ridgway was responsible for conduct of the Korean \nwar. He also followed General MacArthur as military governor of Japan, \nwhere he oversaw the restoration of Japan's Independence and \nsovereignty. In 1952, he replaced GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower as the \nSupreme Allied Commander for the North Atlantic Trade Organization, \nwhere he was credited for improvements through command structure, \nforces, facilities, and training. For his last assignment, General \nRidgway served as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army from 1953 until his \nretirement in 1955.\n  In retirement, General Ridgway would serve on boards, write, speak to \ngroups, and advise other leaders, including President Lyndon B. \nJohnson. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded General Ridgway the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom.\n  GEN Matthew Bunker Ridgway passed away at his home outside Pittsburgh \nat the age of 98, on July 26, 1993. He was buried at Arlington National \nCemetery, and during his eulogy Colin Powell said: ``No soldier ever \nupheld his honor better than this man. No soldier ever loved his \ncountry more than\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nthis man did. Every American soldier owes a debt to this great \nman.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3422-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO BERNARD ``C.B.'' KIMMONS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I honor Bernard ``C.B.'' \nKimmons for his life of service and courageous commitment to preventing \ngang and drug violence at all costs.\n  C.B. was born in Atlantic City, NJ, on February 13, 1944. Though he \noriginally hails from the Garden State, he came to spend much of his \nlife within the city of Philadelphia, graduating from three \nPhiladelphia area schools: Cardinal Dougherty High School, Saint \nJoseph's University, and Temple University Graduate School.\n  After earning his teaching degree, he further solidified his \ncommitment to Philadelphia by spending 16 years teaching in Ogontz, at \nGeneral Louis Wagner Junior High. During his tenure at Wagner, he was \ndisheartened to see that many of his students fell victim to social \npressures that led to them join gangs. C.B. quickly became an \neyewitness to gang-related violence. He knew that his students needed \nguidance before they became lost within the harsh realities of gang \nlife. As a leader and a role model within the community, he took it \nupon himself to fulfill this need. He began to educate his students \nabout the dangers of joining gangs with a simple message of respecting \nlaw enforcement, parents, clergy, teachers, adults, and fellow young \npeople. His message quickly caught on, and many of his students still \nremember his influential teaching style.\n  It was this innovative approach that caught the attention of the \nPhiladelphia school district, under Superintendent Dr. Constance \nClayton. C.B. eventually began teaching in different schools across the \ndistrict under a special antidrug, antiviolence curriculum, many times \nteaching in up to 15 different schools a week. His message against \nbullying, guns, drugs, and violence spread across the city and \ncontinues to affect countless lives today.\n  It was during this time that Bernard was given the nickname of ``Cool \nBernie'' or C.B. within some of the rougher neighborhoods he worked. \nThis nickname has grown to illustrate the close nature of his \nrelationships with his students as well as his acceptance as a role \nmodel and community figurehead. He goes by that name to this day.\n  In addition to his work in the public schools, C.B. was also an \nactive volunteer through numerous activities within Philadelphia. In \n1967, he served as a citywide gang control worker under the guidance of \nZachary Clayton. He then met Dr. Herman Wrice who became his mentor \nwhen he joined Mantua Against Drugs. C.B. and Dr. Wrice traveled around \nPhiladelphia trying to clear the streets of gangs and drug dealers to \nensure that young adults had a safe haven from violence and drugs in \ntroubled neighborhoods. C.B.'s commitment to Mantua Against Drugs \ncontinues today; he currently serves as the organization's executive \ndirector. From his first taste of volunteerism, C.B. knew he found his \npassion. He wanted to change the world.\n  In addition to these efforts, C.B. has personally made himself \navailable to children within the city of Philadelphia through numerous \nactivities. He provides free drug counseling and recently started a \nmultitiered program offering computer skills, document framing, photo-\njournalism, entrepreneur training, and newsletter creation as an \nalternative to violent gang behavior. He also leads vigils for young \nadults who were killed as a direct result of gang related violence.\n  While C.B.'s efforts to lessen the impact of drug dealers have \nreceived considerable praise, they have also attracted the attention of \nthose that would prefer the status quo remain unchanged. On more than \none occasion C.B. has had threats against his own life and has been \nforced to seek police protection. Despite these efforts to undermine \nhis work, C.B. persevered and still today continues to aggressively \npursue change within our community.\n  C.B. has been honored for his work by countless organizations and \nagencies across the city of Philadelphia and the country. These honors \ninclude Time Magazine Local Philadelphia Hero; recognition by the \nMartin Luther King Center in Atlanta, GA; a 2010 Drum Major Award for \nPeace given by the Council of Black Clergy of Philadelphia; University \nof Pennsylvania's Martin Luther King Award for Community Service and \nOutreach; winner of University of Pennsylvania's Crystal Stair Award; \nthe Hero of Peace Award given by Veterans Against Drugs; and the \nHumanitarian Award given by the Four Chaplains at the U.S. Naval Base. \nHe has also been featured on CNN for his school-based role model \nprogram.\n  Throughout all of his work, C.B.'s efforts have focused on ensuring \nthat children have a chance to succeed despite the challenges and \nobstacles they face on a daily basis. C.B. has saved numerous lives and \ncontinues to protect children of all ages from the ravages he first saw \nin his early teaching days. As a result of C.B. Kimmons' hard work, \nchildren across Philadelphia are given a chance to succeed and reach \ntheir potential.\n  It is my pleasure to stand today before my colleagues to recognize \nBernard ``C.B.'' Kimmons'' sacrifices, achievements, and ongoing \ncommitment toward bettering the lives of our youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3422-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO BERNARD ``C.B.''

Mr. President, today I wish recognize the \nachievements of Tine Valencic, a 13-year-old seventh grade student at \nColleyville Middle School in Colleyville, TX. Tine recently competed in \nand won the 2011 National Geographic Bee, held here in Washington, DC. \nEach year thousands of schools and millions of students in the United \nStates participate in the National Geographic Bee using materials \nprepared by the National Geographic Society. The contest is designed to \nencourage teachers to include geography in their classrooms, spark \nstudent interest in the subject, and increase public awareness about \ngeography. Schools with students in grades four through eight are \neligible for this entertaining and challenging test of geographic \nknowledge.\n  Out of a field of 54 contestants, one from each of the 50 States and \nTerritories, Tine won the competition and was the only contestant to \ncorrectly answer every question in the final round. In recognition of \nhis success, National Geographic will award Tine a college scholarship \nworth $25,000, a lifetime membership in the National Geographic \nSociety, and a trip to the Galapagos Islands with his parents.\n  The winning question was: ``Which South American country is home to \nthe volcano, Tungurahua?'' The answer, ``Ecuador,'' was given correctly \nby Tine after the runner-up contestant failed to match Tine for a \nfourth question in a row. Tine is the second Texan to be named national \nchampion in the competition's 23-year history.\n  Young Texans, like Tine Valencic, prove that persistence and a thirst \nfor knowledge are the keys to unlocking opportunities for success. I \ncongratulate Tine on this important accomplishment and look forward to \nseeing his continued achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3422-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3422-S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.

Fitzmaurice who will be retiring at \nthe end of the month after 24 years of service at the Sioux Falls, SD, \nVA Medical Center.\n  Michael entered into service with the U.S. Army in October 1969. \nAfter completing his basic training at Fort Lewis, WA, and advanced \nindividual training at Fort Knox, KY, he was deployed to Vietnam with \nthe D-Troop 17th Calvary, 101st Airborne Division. Michael served with \ngreat distinction in Vietnam eventually earning our nation's highest \naward for valor, the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his heroic \nactions at Khe Sanh, Vietnam.\n  Michael received an honorable discharge from the Army on April 7, \n1972. In addition to the Medal of Honor, which he was awarded by \nPresident Nixon in November 1973, Michael received several other \ndecorations for his uncommonly brave service to our Nation; including \nthe Vietnam Service Medal with Bronze Star, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and \nthe Purple Heart, among others. In recognition of his service, the \nSouth Dakota State Veterans Home in Hot Springs was renamed the Michael \nJ. Fitzmaurice State Veterans Home in October 1998.\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\n  Following his return from Vietnam, Michael met Patty Dolan, whom he \nmarried in July 1973. Michael and Patty would raise two sons, Michael \nJr. and Brian. Eager to continue his service to our country after \nreturning home, Michael joined the South Dakota Army National Guard \n153rd Engineering Battalion in Huron, SD, in April 1973. Michael \ncontinued his service with the South Dakota Army National Guard until \nhis discharge in April 1990. He joined the South Dakota Air National \nGuard in May 1990 and retired from military service in May 1992 after \n23 dedicated years of service to his country.\n  In addition to serving his country for 23 years in the military, \nMichael has dedicated his life to the service of his fellow veterans in \nSouth Dakota. He is retiring after 24 years of service as a plumber at \nthe Sioux Falls VA Medical Center. He is a lifelong member of the \nCongressional Medal of Honor Society, Disabled American Veterans, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, American Vets, and the 101st Airborne \nAssociation.\n  Michael is a humble man. He is never one to flaunt his heroic \nactions, nor bring attention to his decorated military service. He \nwould likely rather blend in the crowd with his fellow veterans than be \nsingled out; however, on the occasion of his retirement from the Sioux \nFalls VA Medical Center, it is appropriate that he be publicly \nrecognized. I commend Michael J. Fitzmaurice for his many years of \ndedicated service to the State of South Dakota and our nation. Michael, \na grateful nation thanks you for your service.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the career of a dedicated public servant. Peter P. Henry is \nretiring as director of the Black Hills VA Health Care System in early \nJuly, concluding a career in Federal service that spans 41 years in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Peter has spent two lengthy stints at \nthe helm of the Black Hills VA, totaling 16 years of service.\n  I commend Peter for his dedication, professionalism and steadfast \ncommitment to veterans and their families. I have always appreciated \nthe efforts of the men and women who work in the Black Hills VA Health \nCare System and exemplify the VA's ``Veterans Come First'' mission. \nPatient satisfaction numbers have remained high during Peter's \nleadership at the Black Hills VA, a testimony to the dedicated work of \nthe staff and administrators at the Hot Springs and Fort Meade \nfacilities.\n  Over his career, Peter has witnessed a number of changes in the VA \nsystem and has deftly guided and implemented these changes within the \nBlack Hills VA. He worked to merge the Hot Springs VA and Fort Meade VA \nsystems into one collective organization, the Black Hills VA health \ncare system. This action provided a number of challenges including \ncondensing dual missions at two campuses into one mission spanning two \nfacilities.\n  During his many years of service in the Black Hills, Peter has worked \ndiligently to provide VA services to South Dakota veterans who would \notherwise not receive such important care. The number of community \nbased outreach clinics, CBOCs, in the Black Hills VA system has \nincreased during Peter's tenure. Veterans living in rural and \nreservation areas of South Dakota have much better access to VA health \ncare and specialty services through the CBOCs. The needs of rural and \nreservation veterans must continue to be addressed so that access to \nquality VA care is preserved and maintained.\n  In 1995, Peter provided key leadership with the opening of the Rapid \nCity Community Based Outreach Clinic, CBOC, at a small facility on the \nSouth Dakota National Guard's Camp Rapid campus. In a joint agreement \nbetween the Guard and the VA, veterans in Rapid City were able to save \non mileage and receive routine levels of care. It wasn't long before VA \nofficials realized that the facility was too small to meet the growing \ndemands of veterans in the Rapid City area. A larger facility was \nopened near private community-based medical facilities. As Peter's \ncareer comes to a close, he continues to work to improve the Rapid City \nCBOC.\n  Like many agencies, the VA has been asked to do more with less over \nthe years. The Black Hills VA continues to face challenges as it works \nto meet the complex needs of our ever growing veterans population, \nincluding women veterans, younger veterans, veterans with traumatic \nbrain injuries, post traumatic stress disorder and other illnesses.

JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, with great honor, \ntoday I congratulate the Watertown Benedictine Sisters of the Mother of \nGod Monastery in their celebration of providing 50 years of faith-based \nservice.\n  Founded in 1961, the Watertown Benedictine Sisters have served in \nhospitals, schools, prisons, parishes, reservations, and nursing homes \nin communities throughout South Dakota. Originally the Watertown \nBenedictine Sisters focused on serving in elementary and secondary \nCatholic schools in North Dakota and South Dakota. Many of the children \nthat the sisters have helped can still recount their fond memories of \nthe important and caring deeds that the Sisters preformed.\n  Today the Sisters work for parish ministries, schools, pastoral care, \nhospitals, and care facilities. The Sisters, through their 50 years of \nservice, have developed strong ties with the Watertown community and \nhave always offered a hand to those in need.\n  In honor of this momentous occasion the Sisters plan to host an \ninterfaith discussion of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and to \ncreate a book detailing the rich history of the Watertown Benedictine \nSisters of the Mother of God Monastery.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the Watertown \nBenedictine Sisters of the Mother of God Monastery for their \noutstanding service. It is an honor for me to share with my colleagues \nthe strong commitment the Sisters have for relentlessly caring for \nthose in need. I strongly commend their years of hard work and \ndedication, and I am very pleased that their substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3423-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3423-S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         YANKTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe 150th anniversary of the founding of one of South Dakota's great \ncities, Yankton. Located along the Missouri River, Yankton serves as \nthe county seat of Yankton County and is a source of great history.\n  Yankton, founded in 1861 and incorporated on May 8, 1862, was the \noriginal capital of Dakota Territory. The founders of Yankton derived \nthe city's name from the Sioux expression E-hank-ton-wan, which means \n``people of the end village.'' Yankton College, founded in 1881, was \nthe first liberal arts college in Dakota Territory, providing the \ncommunity with rich opportunities through higher education, continued \ntoday through Mount Marty College.\n  Riverboat Days and the Summer Arts Festival are held every August in \nYankton and bring visitors from all over the state to enjoy the scenic \nbeauty and relaxing atmosphere the city has to offer. Yankton is an \noutdoor enthusiast's dream, offering access to hunting, fishing, \ngolfing, parks, hiking trails, kayaking and canoeing, and other water \nrecreation sports. The Gavins Point Dam makes the city's water \nrecreation possible along with providing hydroelectric power. Yankton \nis home to the Dakota Territorial museum, which provides a glimpse of \nthe rich history of the Dakota Territory and the events that shaped the \nMidwest itself. Yankton is also the hometown of perhaps South Dakota's \nmost famous resident, Tom Brokaw, former anchor of the NBC\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nNightly News, a graduate from Yankton High School.\n  Yankton is celebrating its sesquicentennial with a variety of artists \nplaying a diverse selection of music. This three day concert event will \nhonor the people that have made Yankton their home, from the first \nrugged settlers to the children of today.\n  Yankton continues to be a vibrant community and a great asset to \nSouth Dakota. Yankton boasts a thriving economy, various tourist \ndestinations, and tremendous opportunities for outdoor recreation. I am \npleased to recognize the achievements of Yankton, and to offer my \ncongratulations to the residents of the city on this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RANDY SCHOEN\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the work of \nMedford Chief of Police Randy Schoen, and all the officers, citizens, \ndispatchers, and volunteers being recognized at the Medford Police \nAwards Banquet.\n  The Medford Police Department is doing its community a great service \nin holding the annual Medford Police Awards Banquet, acknowledging and \nencouraging the kind of work that keeps our citizens safe and makes our \ncommunities great.\n  Chief Schoen has contributed much to his department and to the city \nof Medford, OR. He developed the department's first K9, SWAT, and drug \nand gang enforcement units. He has used technology to make the \ndepartment more effective and responsive. He has rolled out programs \nthat have increased the Medford Police Department's efficiency, \ncommunity involvement, and clearance rates. Chief Schoen is a terrific \nexample of what it means to be a public servant. He is now retiring \nafter 25 years of meritorious service. His hard work will be missed.\n  Also worthy of praise are the many other individuals being honored at \nthe Medford Police Awards Banquet. These citizens and officers are \nreceiving awards for Outstanding Achievement, Meritorious Lifesaving, \nand Citizen Recognition. Many of these individuals have risked personal \nharm to save the life of another, or ensure that justice is done. I \nthank the Medford Police Department for honoring them.\n  I join the Medford Police Department and the people of Medford in \ncommemorating the great work of Chief Schoen and all those receiving \nawards at this banquet. These individuals represent the ideals of civil \nservice, personal heroism, and a just society. I thank them for their \nservice and wish them all the best in their endeavors to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3424-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LINDA CANNON\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I honor Linda Cannon, deputy \ndirector of intergovernmental relations for the city of Seattle, who is \nretiring after serving over 35 years with the city.\n  Ms. Cannon's legacy can be seen throughout the city. She has served \nfor many years as the city's primary contact with the U.S. military as \nit relates to the base realignment and closure process. The most \nsignificant of these projects was her work on the ongoing redevelopment \nof Sand Point, a former Naval Air Station and later Support Activity \nCenter for the Navy, closed in 1991. Linda served as the key staff \nperson coordinating with the Navy, community members, Native American \ntribes, and a host of interest groups over the redevelopment of this \nsignificant resource. Linda worked to balance all these interests while \nensuring that the values of the community were also upheld. The crown \njewel of this redevelopment is Warren G. Magnuson Park which honors \nWashington State's late great Senator Magnuson. Her leadership \nthroughout this process has been critical to its success.\n  Ms. Cannon also served as a mentor and trusted colleague to hundreds \nof city staff through the years. She is known for her grace under \npressure, her clearheaded approach to problems, and keeping everything \nin perspective. Her attitude and work ethic always served as a model \nfor those around her.\n  Ms. Cannon represents the best of public service in this country. Her \nprofessionalism, integrity, institutional knowledge, and understanding \nof the role of public employees in serving the people have been a huge \nasset to the city and will be sorely missed. There are hundreds of \nthousands of public servants around the country like Ms. Cannon who are \nquietly serving their communities every day. We all should be grateful \nfor their dedication and service. I would like to wish Ms. Cannon the \nbest in her retirement and a heartfelt thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3424-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING BIOVATION, LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, for 25 years, the Smaller Business \nAssociation of New England, SBANE, has been recognizing the \naccomplishments and innovations of small businesses throughout the \nNortheast with its innovation awards. The Rising Star category is \nreserved for those small businesses that will have a significant impact \nin their industry or sector in the near future.\n  Today I rise to recognize Biovation LLC, a small manufacturing firm \nin the coastal Maine town of Boothbay that creates antimicrobial \nchemical and nonwoven fiber products for both food packaging and wound \ncare. Biovation beat out nearly 200 nominees and 20 finalists to win \nthe coveted Rising Star category of the SBANE's Innovation Awards, a \ntruly worthy and aptly named recognition for this up-and-coming firm.\n  The company was nominated for the SBANE award by the Maine \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, with which it has worked to \nincrease efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. Rosemary Presnar \nof the Maine MEP has noted that Biovation possesses ``a rare \ncombination of engineering capability and entrepreneurial zeal; and \nthey're visionary in applying their technology to develop new products \nand create new market opportunities.'' This commitment to improvement \nis a source of inspiration, and is an example of the blossoming \ntechnological and R sector that is transforming Maine. Biovation \nreceived the award at SBANE's annual gala dinner on May 11 in \nMassachusetts, joining Maine companies such as Tom's of Maine and \nWright Express, which have been recognized in previous years.\n  Biovation aspires to become a worldwide leader in the product safety \nand wound care sectors within the next decade, and the company is off \nto a resounding start. Biovation has developed a process where textile \nfibers are infused with antimicrobial chemical formulations; these \nfibers can be used for bandages and dressings to prevent the spread of \ndisease by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi. Clearly, this \nis a perfect tool for use in hospitals and medical facilities worldwide \nin efforts to eradicate the transmission of infections between \npatients.\n  In April of this year, Biovation shipped out its first orders of food \nsafety products, and by this time next year, it expects to complete \ncontract negotiations with a medical company for its wound care \nproducts. Additionally, the U.S. Marines have expressed interest in \nacquiring absorbent liners to keep soldier's boots dry. Because \ncountries like Iraq and Afghanistan lack the proper infrastructure, it \nis difficult to use electric dryers for such tasks. Biovation's unique \nproducts can provide an affordable, lightweight pad to help our troops \nstay comfortable during their critical missions in extreme temperatures \nand conditions.\n  It will take America's nearly 30 million small businesses working to \nout-innovate and out-produce the rest of the world to provide for a \nlasting economic recovery. With companies like Biovation leading the \nway, I am confident that we are well-poised to move our economy \nforward. I thank everyone at Biovation for their dedication and \nforward-thinking, and congratulate them on their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3424-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM McAVOY\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I recognize a \nnative Puebloan, sometimes critic, and staple of Colorado's political \njournalism, Tom McAvoy.\n  Tom McAvoy has been with the Pueblo Chieftain newspaper in Colorado \nfor over three decades, including 21 years of covering the Colorado \nstatehouse. For the past 7 years, he has served as the Chieftain's \neditorial research director and a member of its editorial board. He \nwill retire at the end of May, but I hear he will continue to make an \noccasional appearance in the editorial section.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  Tom graduated from Pueblo's Central High School in 1964 and from the \nSouthern Colorado State College in 1968, before going on to earn a \nmaster's degree in journalism from Ohio State University. He served in \nthe National Guard after college and went on to work for the Associated \nPress, joining the Chieftain in 1977.\n  Coloradans have truly benefited from Tom's canny political analysis \nover the years. He set the standard for reporters covering State \ngovernment and politics for regional papers, keeping in mind the big \npicture for the State even as he paid special attention to what was \nimportant from the local angles.\n  In particular, he has been a faithful fighter for shedding light and \nstimulating public discourse about the lifeblood of the West: water. In \nnumerous articles and editorials, he has outlined for his readers the \nissues surrounding and complicating water use in the agricultural \nheartland that is southern Colorado and served as a megaphone for their \ninterests to legislators.\n  Tom wrote in an editorial last year, ``Our obligation is to the \npublic, not the office-holder.'' To recognize his committed coverage of \nthe Colorado statehouse, the Colorado Press Association awarded Tom its \ninaugural Shining Star in 1995 for being the best all-around reporter.\n  Many reporters who cut their teeth on Colorado politics will tell you \nthat Tom's example and mentorship helped them become better eyes and \nears for their own communities.\n  He also proved that showing up is half the story: there is a legend \nthat the only time Tom ever took a leave of absence is when he came \ndown with the West Nile virus. That dedication to his work speaks of a \ndeep love and sense of responsibility for his hometown community, and \nit earned him the respect of his peers and his subjects alike.\n  Southern Colorado will miss Tom McAvoy's voice on the issues that \nmatter to the region, but I have a feeling his wife Sue and their three \nchildren will have to share him in retirement with his continued \nservice to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3425-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OIT WOMEN'S SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Oregon Institute of Technology in \nKlamath Falls has long been a leader in America's effort to develop \ngeothermal energy, and it's also a power in men's basketball, winning \nnational titles in 2004 and 2008.\n  Now, it is the national champion in women's softball. It is the first \nwomen's team to win a national championship at OIT, but I am sure it \nwon't be the last.\n  The Hustlin' Owls entered the national tournament ranked 18th in the \nNation. They came out 1st in the Nation. They were led by a stellar \nperformance from their pitcher and MVP, Jackie Imhof. In the final \ngame, she pitched a shutout, allowing only four hits and striking out \nseven. Through the tournament, Imhof was 6-1 with an amazing earned run \naverage 0f 0.59. Imhof and two other teammates, catcher Kayde Schaefer \nand shortstop Shauna Collins, made the all tournament team.\n  Congratulations to coach Greg Stewart and the Hustlin' Owls of OIT. \nClearly, they are doing something right at Oregon Institute of \nTechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3425-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3425-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3425-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1216.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to define next generation \nbiofuel, and to allow States the option of not participating in the \ncorn ethanol portions of the renewable fuel standard due to conflicts \nwith agricultural, economic, energy, and environmental goals; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have introduced a bill, S. 1085. I have \nsome cosponsors, including Senator Snowe from Maine. The bill addresses \nsomething that has become very controversial. It is certainly not \npartisan in any way. It is more geographical; that is, I have been one \nwho has been opposed to the corn ethanol mandates ever since they first \ncame out. I opposed the 2007 Energy bill because it doubled the corn-\nbased ethanol mandates, despite the mounting questions surrounding \nethanol's compatibility with existing engines, its environmental \nsustainment, as well as transportational infrastructure needs. I can \nremember back when they first did it, all the environmentalists were \nsaying corn ethanol will be the answer. They were all for it, but they \nare against it now. They all recognize that corn ethanol is bad for the \nenvironment.\n  Now, the three areas I personally have a problem with are, No. 1, the \nenvironment; No. 2, you have a compatibility situation. You talk to any \nof the farmers, any of the marine people, they will tell you it is very \ndestructive to the small engines. Thirdly, everyone is concerned with \nthe high price of fuel, with the fact that corn ethanol is not good for \nyour mileage. Kris Kiser of the Outdoor Power Equipment Manufacturers \ntestified before the Environment and Public Works Committee on \nethanol's compatibility or lack of compatibility with more than 200 \nmillion legacy engines across America which are not designed to run on \ncertain blends of ethanol. I will quote her testimony before our \ncommittee. She said:\n\n       In the marine industry, if your machine fails or your \n     engine fails and you are 30 miles offshore, this is a serious \n     problem. If you are in a snow machine and it fails in the \n     wilderness this is a serious problem.\n\n  Consumers complain about the decreasing fuel efficiency around corn \nethanol, containing 67 percent of the Btu of gasoline. We call it clear \ngas. This is a good time to say we are not talking about biomass. We \nare only talking about corn ethanol. Another problem I have in my State \nof Oklahoma is we are a big cattle State and that has driven up the \ncost of feedstock to a level that is not acceptable. According to the \nEPA, vehicles operating on E85 ethanol experience a 20-percent to 30-\npercent drop in miles per gallon due to ethanol's lower energy content. \nConsumer reports found that E85 resulted in a 27-percent drop in fuel.\n  As a result, you drive around Oklahoma--first of all, we are in \nWashington. It is my understanding there is no choice in Washington or \nVirginia or in Maryland and those areas. In my State of Oklahoma, we \nstill have a choice, and the choice is very clear. The problem is the \nway this is set up, we will run into a barrier where they will no \nlonger have clear gas available under the current formulas. For that \nreason, we have people who--at almost every station you see, the \nmajority of the stations you see in Oklahoma, you have signs such as \nthis: Ethanol free. 100 percent gasoline. This is all over the State of \nOklahoma.\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\n  There is a solution to this problem, and it is one I have introduced \nin this bill. Before describing that, I think the most pressing issue \nof this so-called blend wall is that EISA mandated 15 billion gallons \nof corn-based ethanol by 2015, but today it is readily apparent that \nthe country cannot physically absorb this much corn ethanol. It is too \nmuch, too fast. In Oklahoma, ethanol's blend wall has nearly eliminated \nconsumer choice. The fuel blenders and gas station owners have little \noption but to sell ethanol-blended gasoline, despite strong consumer \ndemand for clear gas. There is the consumer demand all over the State \nof Oklahoma.\n  What is the solution? I introduced a very simple, five-page bill. The \nbill would allow individual States to opt out of the mandate. It would \nrequire their State legislature wants this and they pass a resolution, \nit is signed by the governor, and they would be able to opt out. The \nState would pass a bill. It is signed by the Governor, stating its \nelection to exercise this option. The Administrator of the EPA would \nthen reduce the amount of the national corn ethanol mandate by the \npercentage amount of the gasoline consumed by this State.\n  This option nonparticipation would only apply to the corn portion of \nthe RFS and would not affect any of the volumetric requirements of \nadvanced biofuels. We are big in advanced biofuels in my State of \nOklahoma, the various foundations, Oklahoma State University. We have \nswitchgrass we are working on, and it is something we are all for. The \nbill actually redefines cellulosic biofuels as next generation biofuel. \nThe previously defined cellulosic biofuel carveout is expanded to \ninclude algae and any nonethanol renewable fuel derived from renewable \nbiomass. So this is something that is not going to be incompatible. It \nis going to be very compatible with our interest here. So for those \npeople who say: We demand to have corn-based ethanol, you can have it. \nAll this is is choice, and if we and the people of my State of Oklahoma \nwant a choice of clear gas or corn ethanol, they should be able to do \nit. I honestly don't think there is a legitimate argument against that. \nI plan to try to get some cosponsors. I think my good friend from \nFlorida might be interested in cosponsoring something such as this \nbecause this gives choice to the people of his State as well as my \nState.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Blunt):\n  S. 1086. A bill to reauthorize the Special Olympics Sport and \nEmpowerment Act of 2004, to provide assistance to Best Buddies to \nsupport the expansion and development of mentoring programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor, today, to \nintroduce the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Act. I am very pleased that \nSenator Blunt has joined me in introducing this legislation; he and I \nare both long-time supporters of the Special Olympics and Best Buddies \nprograms authorized in this legislation. Equally importantly, we are \ncontinuing the bipartisan support that this legislation has \nhistorically enjoyed.\n  The Special Olympics program is respected around the world as a model \nand leader in using sport to end the isolation and stigmatization of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. For more than 40 years, \nSpecial Olympics has encouraged skill development, sharing, courage and \nconfidence through year-round sports training and athletic competition \nfor children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Through their \nprograms, Special Olympics has helped to ensure that millions of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities are assured of equal \nopportunities for community participation, access to appropriate health \ncare, and inclusive education, and to experience life in a \nnondiscriminatory manner. Special Olympics gives athletes with \nintellectual disabilities the tools they need to be included in \nsociety, and it gives society the understanding and tools it needs to \ninclude them.\n  I can speak first-hand about what a rewarding experience it is for \nall of us who have been involved in Special Olympics. In 2006, my state \nof Iowa hosted the first USA National Summer Games. Thousands of \nathletes, volunteers, coaches, and families attended our Games, in \naddition to 30,000 fans and spectators. Ames, IA, was transformed into \nan Olympic Village, and it was thrilling to experience.\n  Similarly, the Best Buddies program is dedicated to ending the social \nisolation of people with intellectual disabilities by promoting peer \nsupport and friendships with their peers without disabilities. The aim \nis to increase the self-esteem, confidence and abilities of people with \nand without intellectual disabilities. Equally important, the Best \nBuddies program has provided opportunities for integrated employment \nfor individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n  Research shows that participation in activities involving both people \nwith intellectual disabilities and people without disabilities results \nin more positive support for inclusion in society, including in \nschools.\n  This bill is named in honor of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who devoted \nher life to improving the lives of people with intellectual \ndisabilities around the world. Mrs. Shriver founded and fostered the \ndevelopment of Special Olympics and Best Buddies, both of which \ncelebrate the possibilities of a world where all people, including \nthose with disabilities, have meaningful opportunities for \nparticipation and inclusion.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the former Special Olympics Sports and \nEmpowerment Act and providing an authorization for the Best Buddies \nprogram, this bill will also allow the Department of Education to award \ncompetitive grants to support increased opportunities for inclusive \nparticipation by individuals with intellectual disabilities in sports \nand recreation programs.\n  I am pleased to be the chief sponsor of this legislation, which will \ncontinue our support for these important programs that promote the \nextraordinary gifts and contributions of people with intellectual \ndisabilities as well as broader community inclusion.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join with me and Senator Blunt in \nsupporting this very worthy bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. \n        Cardin):\n  S. 1088. A bill to provide increased funding for the reinsurance for \nearly program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Retiree Health \nCoverage Protection Act to provide an additional $5 billion for the \nEarly Retiree Reinsurance Program, EERP, to allow more employers to \nparticipate in the program. It will also further reduce the cost of \nretiree coverage.\n  I worked with Sen. Stabenow to include the EERP program in the \nAffordable Care Act due to the erosion of employer-sponsored retiree \ncoverage across the country. The percentage of large firms providing \nworkers with retiree health coverage dropped from 66 percent in 1988 to \n29 percent in 2009.\n  The ERRP helps to control health care costs and preserve coverage for \nearly retirees and their families and has been remarkably successful in \nmaking retiree health insurance coverage more stable and affordable.\n  Employers who participate in the program can receive a reinsurance \nreimbursement of up to 80 percent of catastrophic medical claims \nbetween $15,000 and $90,000 for their early retiree enrollees. The \nreimbursement is used to reduce the employer's health care costs and to \nlower premiums to retirees and their families. A study from Hewitt \nAssociates estimates that the program will reduce the cost of retiree \ncoverage from 25 to 35 percent, anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 per \nretiree, per year.\n  The program has garnered robust participation among a wide range of \nretiree health plan sponsors from all major sectors of our economy. \nEarlier this month, it was announced that 5,515 plan sponsors have been \napproved to participate in the program and nearly $2.5 billion \nreinsurance reimbursements have been paid to 1,728 participating \nretiree plans.\n  The ERRP has been so successful that the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, announced it could no longer accept \napplications for the program after May 6 because the overwhelming \nresponse would exhaust the $5 billion in appropriated program\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nfunding. Until additional insurance market reforms are enacted in 2014, \nwe should build on the demonstrated success of ERRP.\n  Senator Stabenow, Senator Blumenthal, and I are working together to \npreserve insurance coverage for millions of retirees who rely on on \nhealth coverage through their former employers before they become \neligible for Medicare. That is why we are introducing legislation, the \nRetiree Health Coverage Protection Act, to provide an additional $5 \nbillion in ERRP funding. This additional funding could be used to allow \nmore employers to participate in the program and to further reduce the \ncost of retiree coverage.\n  Over 180 employers who offer retiree health benefits in Massachusetts \nhave taken advantage of this program. These public and private sector \nemployers in the Commonwealth represent various entities, including: \ncity governments, hospitals, colleges, and financial service \ninstitutions.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Retiree Health Coverage Protection \nAct and who have endorsed our legislation today, including the American \nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, AFL-CIO, \nthe Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of State, \nCounty, and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, Families USA, the \nInternational Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural \nImplement Workers of America, UAW, and the National Education \nAssociation, NEA.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to protect \nand stabilize retiree health coverage by ensuring the ERRP has adequate \nfunding. I ask my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1089. A bill to provide for the introduction of pay-for-\nperformance compensation mechanisms into contracts of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs with community-based outpatient clinics for the \nprovision of health care services, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2011.\n  As we all know, the Department of Veterans Affairs strives to provide \nthe best possible health care for our nation's heroes. However, it has \ncome to my attention that the quality of care provided to our nation's \nveterans remains inconsistent among community-based outpatient clinics. \nSome of these clinics are operated by private health care providers \nunder VA contracts. These VA-contracted health care providers are \ncompensated for their work at community-based outpatient clinics on a \ncapitated basis, which means they are essentially paid based on how \nmany new veterans they see during a pay period. These firms are \ntherefore rewarded for the number of veterans they sign up, not for the \nquality of treatment provided to our veterans. While I am not opposed \nto capitation per se, I am concerned current VA policy provides \ncontractors with the wrong incentives. Contracted health care providers \nshould have incentives to provide the best possible care for veterans, \nnot simply get as many veterans as possible through their doors.\n  As a result of the capitated system, it has been reported that too \nmany of our nation's heroes have faced difficulties at these clinics in \nscheduling appointments, have suffered from neglect or have received \nsubstandard health care. This occurred under the last administration \nand I am concerned it may be continuing in the current one.\n  As such, I am reintroducing the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act, \nwhich attempts to fix the way VA-contracted health care providers are \ncompensated at clinics. This bill would require the VA to begin to \nintroduce a pay-for-performance compensation plan for contractors, \nthereby gradually incentivizing a higher quality of care for veterans \nseen at privately-administered community-based outpatient clinics.\n  This bill gives the VA the flexibility to begin to implement such a \nsystem through a pilot program and leaves the VA the discretion as to \nhow to adopt and best implement the pay-for-performance standards. In \nthis respect, the bill defers to the VA on how best to execute these \nchanges. It is my hope that my colleagues will support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care \n     Improvement Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans of the Armed Forces have made tremendous \n     sacrifices in the defense of freedom and liberty.\n       (2) Congress recognizes these great sacrifices and \n     reaffirms America's strong commitment to its veterans.\n       (3) As part of the on-going congressional effort to \n     recognize the sacrifices made by America's veterans, Congress \n     has dramatically increased funding for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs for veterans health care in the years since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (4) Part of the funding for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for veterans health care is allocated toward \n     community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (5) Many CBOCs are administered by private contractors.\n       (6) CBOCs administered by private contractors operate on a \n     capitated basis.\n       (7) Some current contracts for CBOCs may create an \n     incentive for contractors to sign up as many veterans as \n     possible, without ensuring timely access to high quality \n     health care for such veterans.\n       (8) The top priorities for CBOCs should be to provide \n     quality health care and patient satisfaction for America's \n     veterans.\n       (9) The Department of Veterans Affairs currently tracks the \n     quality of patient care through its Computerized Patient \n     Record System. However, fees paid to contractors are not \n     currently adjusted automatically to reflect the quality of \n     care provided to patients.\n       (10) A pay-for-performance payment model offers a promising \n     approach to health care delivery by aligning the payment of \n     fees to contractors with the achievement of better health \n     outcomes for patients.\n       (11) The Department of Veterans Affairs should begin to \n     emphasize pay-for-performance in its contracts with CBOCs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS CONTRACTS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED \n                   OUTPATIENT HEALTH CARE CLINICS.\n\n       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit to Congress a plan to introduce pay-for-\n     performance measures into contracts which compensate \n     contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of health care services through community-based \n     outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (b) Elements.--The plan required by subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) Measures to ensure that contracts of the Department for \n     the provision of health care services through CBOCs begin to \n     utilize pay-for-performance compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors for the provision of such services \n     through such clinics, including mechanisms as follows:\n       (A) To provide incentives for clinics that provide high-\n     quality health care.\n       (B) To provide incentives to better assure patient \n     satisfaction.\n       (C) To impose penalties (including termination of contract) \n     for clinics that provide substandard care.\n       (2) Mechanisms to collect and evaluate data on the outcomes \n     of the services generally provided by CBOCs in order to \n     provide for an assessment of the quality of health care \n     provided by such clinics.\n       (3) Mechanisms to eliminate abuses in the provision of \n     health care services by CBOCs under contracts that continue \n     to utilize capitated-basis compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors.\n       (4) Mechanisms to ensure that veterans are not denied care \n     or face undue delays in receiving care.\n       (c) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence the \n     implementation of the plan required by subsection (a) unless \n     Congress enacts an Act, not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the submittal of the plan, prohibiting or modifying \n     implementation of the plan. In implementing the plan, the \n     Secretary may initially carry out one or more pilot programs \n     to assess the feasability and advisability of mechanisms \n     under the plan.\n       (d) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and every 180 days thereafter, the \n     Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     recommendations of the Secretary as to the feasability and \n     advisability of utilizing pay-for-performance compensation \n     mechanisms in the provision of health care services by the \n     Department by means in addition to CBOCs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1093. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat solar energy property need not be located on the property with \nrespect to\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nwhich it is generating electricity in order to qualify for the \nresidential energy efficient property credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill \nthat is born from the forward-thinking ideas of my constituents, a bill \nthat will help spur our Nation's new energy economy and create jobs: \nthe Solar Uniting Neighborhoods Act, or SUN Act.\n  Over the last three years, I have been travelling across Colorado as \npart of a work force tour to talk directly to Coloradans and hear their \ninnovative policy ideas to create jobs. The SUN Act comes directly from \nvisiting with Coloradans.\n  This bill will help bring commonsense to our tax code, get government \nout of the way of developing solar energy, and spur job growth in every \ncommunity across the United States.\n  I installed solar panels on my own home several years ago to take \nadvantage of the strong Colorado sun. However, I understand this option \nis not available for all American families who want to receive their \nhome's energy needs from solar power. There can be difficulties \nattaching solar panels to your home, which is why more and more \nneighborhoods and towns are creating so called ``community solar'' \nprojects.\n  Instead of affixing solar panels to every roof on the block, an \nincreasing number of Americans have decided to place those same solar \npanels all together in one open and unobstructed sunny area near their \nhomes. By grouping solar panels together, it reduces the cost by up to \n30 percent compared to installing each panel on every roof separately. \nWhether used by neighbors living at the end of a cul-de-sac or \ndeveloped by our rural energy cooperatives, creating these group solar \nprojects to share energy is a great way to lower the cost of developing \nsolar energy.\n  But there is a problem: our tax code is getting in the way. It \ndiscourages neighborhood solar projects by requiring that solar panels \nmust actually be on your property instead of allowing neighbors and \nothers to partner on community solar projects. This discourages \ninnovation and slows the growth of solar power as an alternate energy \nsource.\n  The SUN Act would make a small change to the tax code that would no \nlonger constrain this innovative solar energy development. By \neliminating the requirement that solar panels be on one individual's \nproperty, it allows Americans to work together on community projects \nwhere each individual can claim a tax credit. This simple solution \nmakes it easier to adopt and use clean, renewable energy.\n  What excites me about this bill is that it will create jobs for \nAmericans in every neighborhood where these community solar projects \nare developed.

A bill to include geriatrics and gerontology in the \ndefinition of ``primary health services'' under the\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\nNational Health Service Corps program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we recognize Older Americans Month this \nMay it is important that we commit to meeting the needs of older \nAmericans to live longer and healthier lives.\n  Our aging population is expected to almost double in number, from 37 \nmillion people in 2009 to about 72 million by 2030. We must start now \nif we are going to adequately train the health care workforce to meet \nthe needs of an aging America. If we fail to prepare, our Nation will \nface a crisis in providing care to these older Americans.\n  Health care providers with the necessary training to give older \nAmericans the best care are in critically short supply. In its landmark \nreport, Retooling for an Aging America, the Institute of Medicine \nconcluded that action must be taken immediately to address the severe \nworkforce shortages in the care of older adults.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, in 2009 only about 7,100 U.S. \nphysicians were certified geriatricians; 36,000 are needed by 2030. In \naddition, just 4 percent of social workers and only 3 percent of \nadvanced practice nurses specialized in geriatrics in 2009. Recruitment \nand retention of direct care workers is also a looming crisis due to \nlow wages and few benefits, lack of career advancement, and inadequate \ntraining.\n  Preparing our workforce for the job of caring for older Americans is \nan essential part of ensuring the future health of our nation. Right \nnow, there is a critical shortage of health care providers with the \nnecessary training and skills to provide our seniors with the best \npossible care. This is a tremendously important issue for American \nfamilies who are concerned about quality of care and quality of life \nfor their older relatives and friends.\n  It is clear that there is a need for federal action to address these \nissues, and that is why I am joined today by Senators Collins, Kohl and \nSanders in reintroducing the Caring for an Aging America Act. This \nlegislation would help attract and retain trained health care \nprofessionals and direct care workers dedicated to providing quality \ncare to the growing population of older Americans by providing them \nwith loan forgiveness and career advancement opportunities through the \nNational Health Service Corps.\n  Specifically, for health professionals with training in geriatrics or \ngerontology--including physicians, physician assistants, advance \npractice nurses, social workers, and psychologists--the legislation \nwould link educational loan repayment to a commitment to serve in areas \nwith a shortage of these important health professionals.\n  Ensuring we have a well-trained health care workforce with the skills \nto care for our aging population is a critical investment in America's \nfuture. This legislation offers a modest but important step toward \ncreating the future health care workforce that our Nation so urgently \nneeds.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we meet \nour obligations to the seniors of our Nation to improve their care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Cardin, and Mr. Wicker):\n  S. 1096. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to, and utilization of, bone mass measurement benefits \nunder the Medicare part B program by extending the minimum payment \namount for bone mass measurement under such program through 2013; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Stabenow \nof Michigan to introduce The Preservation of Access to Osteoporosis \nTesting for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2011. The companion bill in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives is being introduced by Representative \nMichael Burgess with Representative Shelley Berkley.\n  Since 1997, Congress has recognized the necessity of osteoporosis \nprevention by standardizing coverage for bone mass measurement under \nthe Medicare program. At that time, I actively pursued inclusion of the \nlanguage in the Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Standardization bill as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Later, with the passage of \nhealth care reform legislation, Congress enacted a temporary solution \nto the problem caused by Medicare cuts in reimbursement rates for \nosteoporosis screening tests through bone mass measurements. The \nosteoporosis screening provision in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act returned the Medicare reimbursement level to 70 \npercent of the 2006 Medicare reimbursement rate.\n  Regrettably, this provision will expire at the end of the calendar \nyear. For Medicare beneficiaries, this sunset means that access to \nosteoporosis diagnosis, prevention, and treatment will once again be in \njeopardy as Medicare reimbursement rates for osteoporosis screening \nwill plummet by about 50 percent on January 1, 2012. Moreover, without \nadequate Medicare reimbursement rates, we most certainly risk losing \nthe battle for improving access to bone density testing as well as \npreventing debilitating and costly bone fractures--an outcome we can \nill afford.\n  A disease of reduced bone mass that ultimately results in bones \nbecoming brittle and fracturing more easily, osteoporosis constitutes a \nmajor public health threat, affecting 44 million Americans who either \nhave the disease or are at risk for developing it due to low bone \ndensity. Osteoporosis is especially prevalent among women, who \nrepresent an incredible 71 percent of all cases. In fact, in their \nlifetime, one in two women and as many as one in four men over the age \nof 50 will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis. Amazingly, a woman's \nrisk of an osteoporotic fracture is greater than her annual combined \nincidence of breast cancer, heart attack, and stroke, making access and \naffordability absolutely imperative.\n  I want to stress to my colleagues that while there is no cure for \nosteoporosis, it is largely preventable and thousands of fractures \ncould be avoided through early detection and treatment of low bone \nmass. New drug therapies have been proven to reduce fractures and to \nrebuild bone mass. At the same time, a bone mass measurement is \nnecessary prior to initiating any form of osteoporosis therapy or \nprophylaxis.\n  Bone mass measurements can be used to determine the status of a \nperson's bone health and to predict the risk of future fractures. These \ntests are safe, painless, accurate, and quick. DXA, dual energy x-ray \nabsorptiometry, is recognized by the World Health Organization, the \nU.S. Surgeon General, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices as the ``gold standard'' for diagnosing osteoporosis.\n  A technique called vertebral fracture assessment or VFA can identify \nspinal fractures and show abnormally shaped vertebra. Bone density \nscreenings have been shown to result in 37 percent reduction in hip \nfracture rates according to a 2008 study by Kaiser in Southern \nCalifornia. Reimbursement under the Medicare program for DXA screening \nis scheduled to be reduced by 62 percent by 2013 and VFA will be \nreduced by 30 percent by 2013. The reduction in Medicare reimbursement \nwill almost certainly discourage physicians from continuing to provide \nconvenient access to DXA screening or VFA in their offices.\n\n  Since \\2/3\\ of all DXA scans are performed in non-facility settings, \nsuch as physician offices, patient access to bone mass measurement will \ncontinue to be severely compromised if DXA scans are not readily \navailable to all patients. Our bill would renew the current Medicare \nlevels for reimbursement relief to preserve access to DXA screenings, \nimprove patient care, and prevent unnecessary costs to the Medicare \nprogram through reduced expenditures on fractures.\n  Osteoporosis, which is responsible for more than two million \nfractures annually, is a silent disease that often goes undetected \nuntil a fall or an injury results in a broken bone. Our senior \npopulation is at greatest risk, with 89 percent of fracture costs \nattributed to individuals who are 65 years of age or older. Perhaps the \nmost tragic consequences occur with elderly individuals who fall and \nsuffer osteoporotic hip fractures.\n  Of those senior citizens suffering hip fractures, 12-13 percent will \ndie within 6 months following the injury and 20 percent will require \nnursing home care . . . often for the rest of their lives. Moreover, \nthe Medicaid budget bears the cost of nursing home admissions\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nfor hip fractures for low-income Americans. In general, osteoporotic \nfractures result in an estimated annual cost of $19 billion to our \nhealth care system.\n  I remain hopeful that one day researchers will discover a cure for \nthis silent and debilitating disease. In the meantime, early detection \ncontinues to be our best weapon against osteoporosis, because it is \nthrough early detection that we can best thwart the progress of \nosteoporosis by initiating preventive measures to combat bone loss.\n  Continuing our current Medicare reimbursement rate for osteoporosis \nscreening tests satisfies the triple aim of better care, improved \nhealth, and lower costs. I hope that our colleagues will join Senator \nStabenow and me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Portman, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Johnson \n        of Wisconsin, Mr. Moran, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Burr, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Barrasso, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Coats, Ms. Ayotte, and \n        Mr. Blunt)\n  S. 1100. A bill to amend title 41, United States Code, to prohibit \ninserting politics into the Federal acquisition process by prohibiting \nthe submission of political contribution information as a condition of \nreceiving a Federal contract; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Keeping \nPolitics Out of Federal Contracting Act of 2011. This bill would \nprohibit Federal agencies from collecting or using information about \npolitical contributions made by businesses or individuals that seek to \ndo business with the Federal Government. My bill would keep politics \nout of Federal contracting.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Minority Leader Mitch \nMcConnell, Republican Whip Jon Kyl, Rules Committee Ranking Member \nLamar Alexander, Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight Ranking Member \nRob Portman, as well as our colleagues Senators Scott Brown, Ron \nJohnson, Jerry Moran, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi, John \nCornyn, Richard Burr, Johnny Isakson, David Vitter, John Thune, John \nBarrasso, Roger Wicker, Mike Johanns, Dan Coats, Roy Blunt, and Kelly \nAyotte.\n  We learned in April that the Obama administration was seriously \nconsidering requiring Federal agencies to collect information about \ncampaign contributions by companies, some of their employees, and even \ntheir directors as a condition of competing for Federal contracts. This \nis simply shocking. It amounts to intentionally injecting political \nconsiderations into the Federal contracting process. What possible good \ncan come from linking political information to a process which must be \ngrounded solely and unequivocally on providing the very best value to \nAmerican taxpayers?\n  The trust of the American people in the integrity of our Federal \ncontract award process depends on ensuring that the government's ``best \nvalue'' determination is free from political bias. It is unfathomable \nthat this administration would even consider a move that would inject \npolitics into the process, or create a perception that politics is \nsomething to be considered in selecting the winners and losers among \nbusinesses vying for Federal contracts.\n  In addition to threatening the integrity of the procurement process, \nthe draft Executive Order would also chill the First Amendment rights \nof individuals to contribute to the political causes or candidates they \nchoose.\n  Were the President to issue such an order, undoubtedly we would see a \nchilling effect on political activity. Many contractors would fear that \nthe success or viability of their business could be threatened if they \nsupport the causes or candidates opposed by the administration.\n  If the collection of such data were required, American businesses \nwould be forced to think twice before contributing to political \ncandidates or causes.\n  In true Orwellian fashion, the draft executive order suggests that \nthe only way to keep politics out of the contracting process is to \ninclude political information with every contract offer. If the White \nHouse gets its way, Federal agencies would have to collect information \nabout the campaign contributions and other political expenditures of \npotential contractors before any contract could be awarded.\n  This EO would be far reaching and would apply not only to \ncontributions made by the contracting company but also to those made by \nits directors, officers, and affiliates.\n  These requirements would also apply retroactively to contributions \nmade two years before the submission of an offer. Just think about--\npolitical donations made years before a contract is even contemplated \nwould have to be shared with government officials.\n  By contrast, my bill reaffirms the fundamental principle that federal \ncontracts should be awarded free from political considerations and be \nbased on the best value to the taxpayers. Specifically, the bill would \nprohibit a Federal agency from collecting the political information of \ncontractors and their employees as part of any type of request for \nproposal in anticipation of any type of contract.\n  It would prohibit the agency from using political information \nreceived from any source as a factor in the source selection decision \nprocess for new contracts, or in making decisions related to \nmodifications or extensions of existing contracts; and prohibit \ndatabases designed to be used by contracting officers to determine the \nresponsibility of bidders from including political information, except \nfor information on contractors' violations already permitted by law.\n  Whether or not a prospective contractor agrees with the political \nviews of this or any other administration should be completely \nirrelevant.\n  Businesses that have supported conservative causes or whose directors \nhave contributed to Republican candidates should not have to fear that \nbidding for Federal work would be a waste of their effort.\n  Similarly, in the next Republican administration, contributors to \nDemocratic causes and candidates should not be intimidated from \ncompeting for contracts. The result of such considerations would be \nless competition for Federal contracts and thus higher prices for goods \nand services procured by the Federal Government.\n  The President and the Federal contracting system must not discourage \nbusinesses from competing for government contracts. At a time when the \nbudget is under severe constraints, the administration should be \nseeking to expand the pool of bidders, not shrink it.\n  In April, 27 Senators wrote to the President to express our \nopposition to this ill-conceived proposal. We pointed out that \n``political activity would obviously be chilled if prospective \ncontractors have to fear that their livelihood could be threatened if \nthe causes they support are disfavored by the Administration. No White \nHouse should be able to review your political party affiliation or the \ncauses you support before deciding if you are worthy of a government \ncontract. And no American should have to worry about whether his or her \npolitical activities or support will affect the ability to get or keep \na federal contract * * *''\n  I also joined three other colleagues in a bipartisan letter to the \nPresident in May stressing the Executive Order's impact on the Federal \ncontracting process and the already stretched-thin Federal acquisition \nworkforce.\n  I have not received a response to either letter.\n  It simply doesn't pass the straight face test for this administration \nto suggest that this dramatic change in federal contracting is needed \nto remove politics from the contracting process. In fact, even the \nadministration's chief procurement official recently admitted at a \nHouse hearing that there was no evidence of any problem of political \ncorruption in the contracting process that would warrant correction \nwith this type of new Executive Order.\n  The reality is just the opposite: requiring disclosure of one's \npolitical activities and leanings as part of that process would likely \nensure that politics would play a role in the award of federal \ncontracts.\n  If more transparency is truly the goal, why don't these requirements \nalso apply to organizations receiving Federal grants?\n  In fact, campaign contributions to candidates and political \ncommittees already are required to be reported to the\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nFederal Election Commission, and with a click of a mouse, can be viewed \non FEC.gov.\n  Americans should get the best value in the marketplace and not a \npartisan policy that stifles First Amendment rights, politicizes the \ncontracting process, and reduces competition in Federal contracting. I \nam pleased to note that my colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentatives Darrell Issa, Tom Cole, and Sam Graves agree. Today \nthey have introduced an identical measure in that chamber. And last \nnight, the House adopted an amendment to the defense authorization bill \nthat would prohibit Federal agencies from requiring contractors to \nreveal contributions to political campaigns.\n  Keep politics out of Federal contracting. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1101. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto approve waives under the Medicaid Program under title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act that are related to State provider taxes that \nexempt certain retirement communities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that \ncertain Continuing Care Retirement Communities and Life Care \nCommunities are required to pay a provider tax despite the fact that \nthey provide no beds and no services that are certified under the \nMedicaid program. Thus, these facilities are paying a tax and receiving \nno benefit. The Department of Health and Human Services currently \nprovides a waiver for this fee, but the approval for the waiver is not \na foregone conclusion. This is costly to those communities who provide \nfor themselves and who do not depend on government programs at all. For \nthese reasons, Senator Mark Pryor and I are introducing this \nlegislation requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \napprove waivers sought by states in relation to Continuing Care \nRetirement Communities and Life Care Communities which have no beds \nthat are certified to provide medical assistance under title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act or that do not provide services for which payment \nmay be made under title XIX of the Social Security Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Provider Tax Administrative \n     Simplification Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROVIDER TAX RULE EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN CONTINUING \n                   CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES.\n\n       In the case of a State that has a provider tax that does \n     not apply to continuing care retirement communities or life \n     care communities (as such terms are used for purposes of \n     section 1917(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396p(g)) that have no beds that are certified to provide \n     medical assistance (as such term is defined under section \n     1905(a) of such Act) under title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act or that do not provide services for which payment may be \n     made under title XIX of the Social Security Act, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall approve a waiver \n     under section 433.68(e)(2)(iii) of title 42 of the Code of \n     Federal Regulations regardless of whether the Secretary \n     determines that the State satisfies the requirements of \n     section 433.68(e)(2)(iii)(B) of such title.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Franken, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1102. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, with respect \nto certain exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the past year, students in Illinois \nhave told me their stories of leaving some for-profit colleges with \nmountains of student loan debt and no job prospects. The students who \nfind themselves in this terrible situation often end up defaulting on \ntheir loans. One quarter of students who took out Federal loans to \nattend for-profit colleges defaulted within three years of starting \nrepayment. Compare that to 11 percent at public colleges and 8 percent \nat private nonprofit colleges.\n  The situation for students who take out private student loans to \nattend for-profit schools can be even worse. A study by the College \nBoard found that students at for-profit schools, unable to get enough \ngovernment aid to pay their tuition turn to private loans much more \nthan students at traditional schools.\n  Many large for-profit colleges have begun making loans directly to \ntheir students. This private lending can be a boon for the schools. It \nkeeps students in school. It helps the college meet its ``90/10'' \nrequirement, which keeps the student aid flowing.\n  Disturbingly, some of the for-profit colleges making these loans do \nnot expect to collect them easily. Corinthian Colleges Executive Vice \nPresident and Chief Financial Officer Ken Ord stated in the February \n2010 investor call that they anticipate a 56 percent to 58 percent \ndefault rate on an estimated $150 million in internal student lending. \nJust last month, Ken Ord stated that Corinthian Colleges will seek to \nnearly double this loan volume.\n  For-profit colleges like Corinthian are making private loans to \nstudents knowing that a majority of the students will struggle to make \npayments. These companies make significant profits from federal \nfinancial aid programs and are able to write off these loans.\n  This is a disaster for students. These are private student loans with \ninterest rates and fees that can be as onerous as credit cards. There \nare reports of private loans with variable interest rates reaching 18 \npercent. Unlike Federal student loans, there are few consumer \nprotections available for private student loans. Some students who take \nout private loans find themselves trapped under an enormous amount of \ndebt that they cannot escape. Because of a 2005 change to the \nbankruptcy law, they are stuck with this debt for the rest of their \nlives.\n  Today, along with Senator Franken and Senator Whitehouse, I am \nintroducing a bill that will restore fairness for these students and \nothers who find themselves buried in private student loan debt. Our \nbill, the Fairness for Struggling Students Act, will allow borrowers of \nprivate student loans to discharge those loans in bankruptcy, just as \nother types of private debt can be discharged. Representatives Cohen \nand Davis are introducing a similar bill in the House.\n  Before 2005, private student loans issued by for-profit lenders were \nappropriately treated like credit card debt and other similar types of \nunsecured consumer debt in bankruptcy. In 2005, a provision was added \nto law to protect the investments of private lenders that extend \nprivate credit to students. The industry has boomed over the past \ndecade. Private student loan volume last year was $8.5 billion.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce a bill that will give students who \nfind themselves in dire financial straits a chance at a new beginning. \nMy bill restores the bankruptcy law, as it pertains to private student \nloans, to the statute in place before the law was amended in 2005. \nUnder this legislation, privately issued student loans will once again \nbe dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  The bankruptcy law was designed to give debtors in severe financial \ndistress a chance for meaningful relief. The current bankruptcy law \nunjustly punishes men and women who have tried to improve their lives \nby pursuing a higher education and all too often became victims of \npredatory private student lenders or predatory for-profit colleges. It \nis time to restore fairness for student borrowers. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Struggling \n     Students Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCHARGE.\n\n       Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``dependents, for'' and all that follows \n     through the end of subparagraph (B) and inserting \n     ``dependents, for an educational benefit overpayment or loan \n     made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit or made \n     under any program\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\n     funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or an \n     obligation to repay funds received from a governmental unit \n     as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Chambliss):\n  S. 1103. A bill to extend the term of the incumbent Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month, the President requested \nthat Congress provide a limited exception to the statutory limit on the \nservice of the FBI Director in order to allow Robert Mueller to \ncontinue his service for up to two additional years, until September \n2013. I spoke with the President about his request, and understand his \ndesire for continuity and stability in our national security leadership \nteam at a time of great challenge and heightened threat concerns.\n  On May 12, the President explained in a statement: ``Given the \nongoing threats facing the United States, as well as the leadership \ntransitions at other agencies like the Defense Department and Central \nIntelligence Agency, I believe continuity and stability at the FBI is \ncritical at this time.'' It is for that reason, along with his \nconfidence in Director Mueller, that the President has made this \nrequest of us. The President has asked us ``to join together in \nextending that leadership for the sake of our nation's safety and \nsecurity.''\n  Since the attack on September 11, 2001, I have spoken often of the \nneed for us all to join together. When I spoke to the Senate about the \nsuccessful operation against Osama bin Laden, I urged all Americans to \nsupport our President in his continuing efforts to protect our Nation \nand keep Americans safe. I reiterated my hope that Americans would \nstand shoulder-to-shoulder, as we did in the weeks and months \nimmediately following the September 11 attacks, unified in our resolve \nto keep our Nation secure. And I urged Congress to join together for \nthe good of the country and all Americans. This is one of those times \nthat we must join together.\n  We face a time of heightened threats, particularly when experts are \nso concerned about possible reprisal attacks by al Qaeda. Indeed, most \nAmericans share a concern that al Qaeda will try to strike back. So now \nis not a time for obstruction or delay in considering the President's \nrequest to maintain continuity and stability in his national security \nteam.\n  We have an opportunity now to set aside partisanship and come \ntogether to work with our President to keep America safe. While the \nthreat from al Qaeda continues, and as the President makes necessary \nshifts in his national security team, I appreciate why President Obama \nhas proposed that we continue the service of President Bush's appointee \nto the important leadership position of Director of the FBI. I \nappreciate Director Mueller's willingness to continue in service to the \nNation. This was not Bob Mueller's idea or request. This is the \nPresident's request and, as a patriotic American, Director Mueller is \nwilling to give another two years in service to a grateful Nation.\n  The Bureau has seen significant transformation since September 11, \n2001. Director Mueller has handled this evolution with professionalism \nand focus. The FBI plays a critical role in our efforts to protect \nnational security. Attorney General Holder said recently: ``The United \nStates faces ongoing threats from terrorist intent on attacking us both \nat home and abroad, and it is crucial that the FBI have sustained, \nstrong leadership to confront that threat.'' He is right.\n  I was encouraged to see the reports that Senator McConnell, the \nSenate Republican leader, supports the President's request. I \nappreciate the comments by Chairman Lamar Smith of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, supporting the President's decision, and stating his \nagreement that ``it is important to maintain continuity for our \nintelligence community during this transition period.''\n  I am pleased that Senator Grassley, our ranking Republican on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, has joined as a cosponsor of a bill to \nextend the service of Director Mueller, who Senator Grassley said has \n``proven his ability to run the FBI'' in these ``extraordinary times.'' \nI am also pleased that Senators Feinstein and Chambliss, the Chairman \nand Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, are joining as \ncosponsors of the bill. We recognize the extraordinary circumstances \nconfronting the President, and support his request for a short \nextension of Director Mueller's service. But we also all agree that \nthis needs to be a one-time exception and this measure we join together \nto introduce today is intended to be a one-time exception and not a \npermanent extension.\n  I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee in the summer of 2001 when \nPresident Bush nominated Bob Mueller. The President nominated him on \nJuly 18; the Judiciary Committee received his paperwork on July 24; and \nwe held two days of hearings on July 30 and July 31. The Judiciary \nCommittee voted on his nomination on August 2 and the Senate confirmed \nhim that same day. It is already as long from the day that President \nObama made his request for the short extension of his term of service \nas it took us in 2001 to hold hearings and for the Senate to confirm \nBob Mueller to a 10-year term as FBI Director. We must not delay action \nany longer.\n  Bob Mueller served for three years in the United States Marine Corps; \nled a rifle platoon in Vietnam; and earned a Bronze Star, two Navy \nCommendation Medals, the Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry. This is a man who served as the United States Attorney in \nboth Massachusetts and Northern California, as the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division at the Justice Department, and the \nacting Deputy Attorney General at the beginning of the George W. Bush \nadministration. This is a man who left a lucrative position in private \npractice to return to law enforcement after he had served in higher \npositions, by joining the U.S. Attorney's office in the District of \nColumbia as a line prosecutor in the homicide section.\n  The President could have nominated the next director of the FBI, \nsomeone who could serve for the next 10 years, until 2021. That is \nsomeone who would serve through the presidential elections in 2012, \n2016 and 2020, and into the period long after his own presidency. \nInstead, he has chosen to ask Congress to extend the term of service of \na proven leader for a brief period, given the extenuating circumstances \nfacing our country.\n  I emphasize that this is not Bob Mueller's request, it is the \nPresident's. Bob Mueller has served tirelessly and selflessly for 10 \nyears, and is undoubtedly ready to begin the next phase of his life. \nBut Bob has characteristically answered duty's call and indicated his \nwillingness to continue his service. We should fulfill our duty, as \nwell, and join together without delay to secure the continuity and \nstability that is demanded at this time, and that is needed to keep our \ncountry safe. It is time for us to join together and act on the \nPresident's request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF THE INCUMBENT DIRECTOR OF \n                   THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.\n\n       Section 1101 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n     Act of 1968 (28 U.S.C. 532 note) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(c) With respect to the individual who is the incumbent \n     in the office of the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation on the date of enactment of this subsection--\n       ``(1) subsection (b) shall be applied --\n       ``(A) in the first sentence, by substituting `12 years' for \n     `ten years'; and\n       ``(B) in the second sentence, by substituting `12-year \n     term' for `10-year' term; and\n       ``(2) the third sentence of subsection (b) shall not \n     apply.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is \non the front line in defending our country from terrorists, spies, and \ncriminals. The FBI has a long history dating back over 100 years. The \nFBI started as an agency formed during President Theodore Roosevelt's \nadministration when seven Secret Service agents were sent to the \nJustice Department to create a new investigative bureau. Since that \nstart, the FBI has developed into a\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\ncadre of talented agents who have pioneered new investigative tools \nadvancing law enforcement across the country.\n  For example, the Bureau agents developed advancements in forensic \nscience, such as fingerprint technology and DNA analysis, now utilized \nto build investigations from the smallest of clues obtained at crime \nscenes. Such advancements have allowed the FBI to combat organized \ncrime and international terrorists across the country and around the \nglobe.\n  Despite these successes, the FBI has also had its share of failures. \nThese include maintaining secret files on elected officials, the \ninvestigation of civil rights leaders, the tragedies at Ruby Ridge and \nWaco, missing internal spy Robert Hanssen, the corruption and misuse of \nmob informants in the Boston field office, and the failure to connect \nthe dots leading up to the 9/11 attacks. The FBI has also had problems \nin failing to manage high-profile projects, such as the procurement of \ninformation technology upgrades. They have failed to address personnel \nproblems, such as the double standard for discipline that the Justice \nDepartment inspector general found agents believe exists. And there \nwere the serious issues that required reform at the FBI crime lab. \nThese are black marks on the history of the FBI.\n  I have been an outspoken critic of the FBI's culture for many years \nbecause of its unwillingness to own up to mistakes. Too often, \nofficials sought to protect the agency's reputation at the expense of \nthe truth. My concerns are magnified by the way the FBI treats internal \nwhistleblowers who come forward and report fraud and abuse. All too \noften, instead of owning up to problems and fixing them, they circle \nthe wagons and shoot the messenger. The FBI is all too often the exact \nopposite of an agency that can accept constructive criticism, from both \nthose inside and out.\n  That said, I must give credit to the FBI when it is due. Following \nthe tragedy of 9/11, the FBI has worked to fix the problems that have \noccurred. There has been a top-to-bottom transformation at the FBI \nmoving it from a pure law enforcement agency to a national security \nagency. Chief among those lending this transformation has been FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller. Sworn in as Director just 1 week prior to 9/\n11, Director Mueller has led the charge to ensure that the FBI is \nupdated into a modern national security agency. This transformation \nincludes upgrading the workforce from an agent-driven model to one that \nincludes an ever-increasing number of intelligence analysts. Director \nMueller has taken the transformation head-on and has done an admirable \njob. I applaud the hard work that has been done, but more work remains. \nThat is why we are here today introducing legislation that will extend \nthe term of FBI Director Mueller for 2 additional years. I join my \ncolleagues from the Judiciary and Select Intelligence Committees in \nintroducing a one-time statutory exemption that will extend the term of \nFBI Director Mueller's term by 2 years. I do this recognizing the good \nwork of Director Mueller and against a backdrop of heightened alert to \nterrorist attack following the death of Osama bin Laden. However, I do \nthis with a heavy heart because I believe the 10-year term is a good \nthing for both the FBI and the country.\n  Currently, the law requires that the FBI Director be limited to one \nsingle 10-year term. This limitation was put in place in 1976 following \na 1968 change in the law making the Director a Presidential \nappointment. Congress included this term for two main reasons: one, to \nensure that the Director was insulated from political influence of the \nPresident; two, to ensure that no one individual serves as FBI Director \nfor such a long period of time to amass too much power. The inclusion \nof a term was part of a series of reforms to government agencies \nfollowing the Watergate scandal and following the death of former \nDirector J. Edgar Hoover, who had served a 48-year term.\n  The current term limit has been in place for 35 years. In that time, \nno Director of the FBI has ever served an entire 10-year term and no \nPresident has ever suggested the term limit should be extended. \nHowever, on September 4, 2011, FBI Director Mueller would be the first \nto reach the 10-year mark. President Obama has indicated it is his \ndesire to have Director Mueller stay on for an additional 2 years and \nhas asked us to extend the term.\n  While I join my colleagues in introducing this extension, I have also \nasked that we have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee to \naddress this extension. There are significant constitutional concerns \nthat must be addressed, such as whether Congress has the authority to \nextend the term of a sitting appointee. A concern of this magnitude \nneeds to be discussed in a formal hearing. Additionally, this would be \nthe first time the Congress will be extending the term of the Director \nin over 35 years and nearly 37 years since a hearing was held on the \nterm of the Director in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Director Mueller has done an admirable job of reforming an agency \nunder difficult circumstances. While I have my concerns with the \nprecedent that this will set for future Directors--namely, that the \nterm can be extended--I do think that making a one-time exception is \nwarranted in this limited case and with the current existing threats. \nBut I do not want this to become a regular occurrence. This legislation \nis narrowly tailored to ensure that the intent of Congress is to create \nonly a one-time exception. Further, we will be holding a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing in the near future to address this important, \nlimited, one-time extension. Against that backdrop, I support this \nextension and look forward to an open debate and discussion surrounding \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1106. A bill to authorize Department of Defense support for \nprograms on pro bono legal assistance for members of the Armed Forces; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Graham to \nintroduce the Justice for Troops Act. This legislation offers a simple \nsolution to a serious problem that affects the well-being of our troops \nand their families. Today, when service men and women face civil legal \nproblems they often have no access to legal assistance. When these \ntroops face such problems, like child custody issues, complications \nwith leases, mortgage payments or credit card debt that should be \nprotected under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or disputes over a \nbank account, they often have no access to legal assistance.\n  Without representation, troops run the risk of losing custody of \ntheir children, being evicted from their home, or facing financial \nruin. This is unjust, especially when there are many lawyers willing to \nvolunteer their services for free. The Justice for Troops Act would \nsolve this problem by connecting service men and women with pro bono \nlawyers. It would do so by authorizing the Department of Defense, DoD, \nto use up to $500,000 of funds already appropriated for operation and \nmaintenance to support programs that make these connections and ensure \nthat our troops have access to the legal representation they need.\n  All branches of the military provide our service men and women with \nbasic legal services on-base through legal assistance officers, Judge \nAdvocate Generals, JAGs, but they generally cannot represent service \nmembers in court or provide legal assistance in other parts of the \ncountry. When troops encounter legal problems that JAGs are not able to \nhandle, they are left on their own to find a lawyer. This burden can \narise if a service member is stationed in one state, but his or her \nhome, family, or bank accounts are located in another. On-base JAG \nofficers are unable to help with bankruptcy, child support issues, and \nother legal challenges that arise in a different state. As the number \nof deployed troops has increased since 2001, the gap between their \nlegal needs and the offerings of JAG offices has widened. In some \ncases, JAG officers have referred troops who cannot afford a lawyer to \nprograms that connect them with pro bono lawyers. Other cases have been \nleft unresolved, to the detriment of our troops, their families, and \nthe readiness of our armed forces.\n  Today, there are limited services available to help troops with legal \nproblems that cannot be handled by JAGs, but they are unable to fully \nmeet the growing need. Some law\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nschool clinics, state bar associations, and the American Bar \nAssociation's Military Pro Bono Project connect active-duty military \npersonnel and their families to free legal assistance beyond what \nmilitary legal offices can offer. They maintain lists of attorneys who \nare willing to provide their services free of charge to service members \nand, in conjunction with the DoD, reach out to on-base JAG offices to \nencourage them to refer troops to their programs.\n  Unfortunately, these programs have a long way to go to meet the \nincreasing demand for their pro bono legal services, and too many \ntroops still go without legal help. Furthermore, existing programs are \nlimited in their ability to connect troops with pro bono lawyers \nbecause funding to support them is scarce. With access to only \n$500,000, pro bono projects would be able to build more connections, \nensure that every JAG office knows how to refer service members to the \nprograms, and grow their databases of pro bono lawyers. This small \ninvestment would be leveraged into providing free legal assistance to \ncountless men and women who serve our country. We will no doubt enhance \nour military readiness by eliminating the stress and anxiety caused by \nlegal problems.\n  The Justice for Troops Act is supported by the Department of Defense, \nthe Military Officers Association of America, the Southern Wisconsin \nChapter of the Military Officers Association of America, the National \nMilitary Family Association, the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, the Wisconsin National Guard Association, the \nAssociation of the US Army, the Air Force Association, and the Gold \nStar Wives of America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Troops Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to permit agencies to \ncount certain contracts toward contracting goals; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business \nFairness Act. I want to first thank my colleague Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania for cosponsoring this important legislation with me. \nPromoting small business is not a Republican or a Democrat issue; it is \nan economic issue that is of even more importance as we consider ways \nto help improve our Nation's job situation. This bill is just one of \nmany efforts that I hope Congress can consider this year that will help \npromote the needs of our small businesses on Main Street.\n  This particular issue involves a rule currently in place that \nprevents agencies from counting their government procurement contracts \ntoward their statutory obligations if a small business is a member of a \ncooperative or association of other small businesses. While the rule \nwas well intended when it was written, it likely never anticipated the \ngrowth of small businesses that pool their resources into teaming \nagreements to compete for large government contracts.\n  This bill, the Small Business Fairness Act, helps address this issue. \nThe Internet and other resources in recent years have helped small \nbusinesses identify and partner with other businesses to make \ncompetitive bids for government contracts. Not every small business can \nmeet the contracting needs of federal agencies, however, as a group \nthey can often offer competitive bids for some of the largest \ngovernment contracts being offered. We know that the Federal Government \nis one of the largest consumers of products and it is only right to \nmake sure our small businesses can group with other small businesses \nfor their own mutual benefit. The bill is specifically designed to \nensure that agencies can do business through teaming agreements with \nsmall businesses that qualify through the Small Business Administration \nas socially or economically disadvantaged firms. This includes \nbusinesses owned by service-disabled veterans, women-owned small \nbusinesses and firms located in qualified HUBZones. Without this bill, \nan agency can do business with a small entity through a teaming \nagreement but cannot count that business towards its statutory \nobligations for small business set-asides.\n  As a former small business owner and a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I am a firm believer that small businesses should be able to \naccess government contracts. These contracts help businesses diversify \nand offer new opportunities for their products. That is why for over 9 \nyears I have helped to host a Procurement Conference in Wyoming where \ncontactors can meet with our State's small businesses to ensure the \nFederal Government gets the goods and services they need.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction to help our small \nbusinesses and I look forward to opportunities to discuss this and \nother efforts that help our small businesses succeed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio):\n  S. 1117. A bill to amend section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to improve the health coverage tax credit, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when Congress passed the Trade Act of \n2002, we made a promise to American workers that the potential loss of \njobs due to trade policy will not equal the loss of health care \ncoverage. The health coverage tax credit, HCTC, was designed to help \nAmerican workers retain health insurance coverage when their jobs are \ndisplaced by outsourcing--and it has been a lifeline for these middle-\nclass families who simply cannot afford coverage on their own. In 2010, \nan Internal Revenue Service survey found that 90 percent of HCTC \nparticipants are very satisfied with the program.\n  However, despite the high satisfaction rate among participants, far \ntoo many trade-displaced workers are not able to take advantage of this \nimportant program. Historically, fewer than 30,000 of the hundreds of \nthousands of potentially eligible individuals each year have \nparticipated in the HCTC. These hundreds of thousands of laid-off \nworkers and retirees have been left uninsured because the program still \nhas several barriers to enrollment, and despite the 65 percent subsidy \nprovided by the program, the premiums are prohibitively high for some \nworkers.\n  I have heard from steel retirees and widows in my state about how \nunaffordable the TAA health care tax credit is. I have been very \nfrustrated, just as I was when this bill passed, that we have not been \nable to make the credit as affordable and accessible as possible for \npeople who need it the most--laid-off workers and retirees who have \nvery limited income.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, and several consumer \nadvocacy groups and research organizations have cited affordability as \nthe primary reason for low participation in the HCTC program. The \nbottom line is that a 65 percent subsidy is simply not enough for many \nto afford the high cost of health insurance premiums. The American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which reauthorized the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act, made several temporary changes to expand \neligibility for and benefits of the HCTC program. These changes \nincluded an increase in the tax credit's subsidy rate from 65 percent \nto 80 percent of the health insurance premium, and expanded TAA \neligibility to additional workers. The GAO released a report\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\nlast year on the credit and found that HCTC participation increased \nafter these key Recovery Act changes took effect. As a result of the \nRecovery Act, many more people eligible for the program felt they could \nafford a qualified health plan and afford to pay their share of monthly \npremiums. However, 33 percent still could not afford their share of \nmonthly premiums, even with the credit and these expanded provisions \nexpired on February 13, 2011.\n  As our economy continues its recovery, it is critical to build on \nthis program to help more Americans secure health coverage. The TAA \nHealth Coverage Improvement Act would extend the Recovery Act's \ntemporary provisions, and it would also address the issues of \naffordability by increasing the subsidy amount from 65 percent to 95 \npercent, retroactive to the date the Recovery Act expired.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of affordability by placing \nlimits on the use of the individual market, as Congress intended under \nthe original law. The Trade Act of 2002 specified that the health \ninsurance credit could not be used for the purchase of health insurance \ncoverage in the individual market except for HCTC-eligible workers who \npreviously had a private, non-group coverage policy 30 days prior to \nseparation from employment. However, states have been allowed by prior \nAdministrations to create state-based coverage options in the \nindividual market for any HCTC beneficiaries, including those who did \nnot have individual market coverage one month prior to separation from \nemployment. As a result, there are people who had employer-based \ncoverage prior to separation from employment who are now being covered \nin the individual market. This was not the intent of the law. To make \nmatters worse, this interpretation undermines the consumer protections \nset forth in the law because individual market plans are allowed to \nvary premiums based on age and medical status. In one state GAO \nreviewed for its report, because of medical underwriting, HCTC \nrecipients in less-than-perfect health were charged almost six times \nthe premiums charged to recipients rated in the healthiest category. \nThe legislation I am introducing today addresses this problem by \nclarifying that states can only designate individual market coverage \nwithin guidelines of 30-day restriction and by requiring individual \nmarket plans to be community-rated.\n  Second, this legislation guarantees that eligible workers will have \naccess to comprehensive group health coverage. Group coverage is what \npeople know. The vast majority of laid-off workers and PBGC retirees \nhad employer-sponsored group coverage prior to losing their jobs or \npension benefits. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act designates \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, FEHBP, as a qualified group \noption in every State, so that displaced workers nationwide will have \naccess to the same type of affordable, comprehensive coverage they were \nused to when they were employed.\n  Third, the TAA Health Coverage Act clarifies the three month \ncontinuous coverage requirement. Under the original TAA statute, \ndisplaced workers are required to maintain three months of continuous \nhealth insurance coverage in order to qualify for certain consumer \nprotections. Those protections are guaranteed issue, no preexisting \ncondition exclusion, comparable premiums, and comparable benefits. \nCongress intended this three month period to be counted as the three \nmonths prior to separation from employment. However, the Administration \nhas interpreted the three month requirement as three months of health \ninsurance coverage prior to enrollment in the new health plan, which \nusually is after separation from employment and after certification of \nTAA eligibility. Many laid-off workers and PBGC recipients cannot \nafford to maintain health coverage in the months between losing their \njobs and TAA certification and, therefore, lose eligibility for the \nstatutorily-provided consumer protections. This legislation corrects \nthis problem by clarifying that three months of continuous coverage \nmeans three months prior to separation from employment.\n  Fourth, this bill allows spouses and dependents to maintain \neligibility for the health coverage tax credit if the worker or retiree \nbecomes eligible for Medicare. Younger spouses and dependents of \nMedicare-eligible individuals have not been able to receive the subsidy \nbecause eligibility runs through the worker or retiree. This \ntechnicality is unfair to individuals who rely on health coverage \nthrough their spouses or parents.\n  Finally, this legislation streamlines the HCTC enrollment process and \nmakes it easier for trade-displaced workers to access health insurance \ncoverage. According to GAO, two of the factors contributing to low \nparticipation include a complicated and fragmented enrollment process \nand the inability of workers to pay 100 percent of the premium during \nthe 3 to 6 months they are waiting to enroll in advance payment. This \nlegislation includes a presumptive eligibility provision that allows \ndisplaced workers to enroll in a qualified health plan and receive the \nHCTC immediately upon application to the Department of Labor for \ncertification. There is also a provision which directs the Treasury \nSecretary to pay 100 percent of the cost of premiums directly to the \nhealth plans during the months TAA-eligible workers are waiting for \nadvance payment to begin. This legislation allows workers to be \neligible for the HCTC even if they are not receiving training, an \nimportant provision that was included in the Recovery Act. The current \ntraining requirement subjects families to a loss of health coverage \nwhen transportation, relocation, or childcare issues interfere with an \nindividual's ability to participate in training.\n  As a former Governor, I know how important Trade Adjustment \nAssistance is to individuals who have lost their jobs due to trade. In \nWest Virginia, thousands of workers have lost their jobs as a result of \ntrade policy. While adjusting to the loss of employment, these \nindividuals still have to pay mortgages, put food on the table, and \ncare for their families. Finding affordable health care adds a \nsignificant burden to their worries. The TAA health coverage tax credit \nis designed to help American workers retain health insurance coverage \nduring this very difficult transition.\n  Since 2002, the HCTC program has been a lifeline for tens of \nthousands of participants. But for many others who face barriers to \nparticipation, the HCTC program is not living up to its potential. The \nGAO has given us a very specific diagnosis of the problems, and the \nRecovery Act has shown us that the situation can improve for trade-\ndisplaced workers. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act builds upon \nthe Trade Act of 2002 and the lessons we have learned since in order to \nmake the health coverage tax credit workable for eligible individuals \nand their families. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \npass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Begich, Ms. \n        Snowe, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1119. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Marine Debris \nResearch, Prevention, and Reduction Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Trash Free \nSeas Act of 2011, a bill to reauthorize and strengthen the Marine \nDebris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act, MDRPRA. This act, of \nwhich I am proud to have been the original sponsor, was first passed in \n2006 to address the pervasive issue of marine debris which is found in \nmyriad forms throughout our oceans. It created programs in both the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the U.S. \nCoast Guard that research, track, and work to mitigate and remove \nmarine debris and its associated impacts. The Trash Free Seas Act would \nupdate these programs to incorporate advances in our understanding of \nthe issue and allow for greater regional and international coordination \nin our mitigation efforts.\n  Marine debris is a catch-all term that encompasses everything from \nfloating refuse to lost fishing nets and pieces of micro-plastic. In \nall its forms, however, it is something that was once manufactured and \nhas since been lost at sea through accident, intent, or act of nature. \nOnce at sea, the impacts of marine debris may reach unintended shores \nas it drifts on ocean currents\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nand harms our ecosystems and economies. This harm may come from direct \ninteractions such as physical damage to a coral reef or fishing vessel; \nthrough indirect impacts such as the concentration of harmful chemicals \nin floating plastics; or from a reduction in tourism due to the \nunsightliness of a littered beach. In every case we should be \nresponding by working to reduce the overall problem on a global scale \nand by striving to mitigate specific impacts.\n  As an island State, Hawaii is particularly susceptible to the impacts \nof marine debris and, all the more so, because we are located near the \ncenter of a great network of ocean currents in the Pacific that tend to \nconcentrate debris into a wide region known as the ``garbage patch''. \nFor this reason, our State has long been at the forefront in dealing \nwith this issue and in fact we have recently become the first State to \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive marine debris action plan. This \nPlan, along with the programs at NOAA and the Coast Guard, are likely \nto be even more valuable to us in the coming years as recent research \nsuggests that the tragic Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami that \nstruck in March, resulted in a tremendous amount of lost infrastructure \nthat may reach our shores as debris in as little as 1 to 2 years.\n  The Trash Free Seas Act of 2011 would strengthen our ability to \nrespond to the pervasive problem of marine debris by incorporating \nmarine debris removal as an explicit purpose of the programs; \nclarifying research and assessment and reduction, prevention, and \nremoval as two distinct components of the NOAA program; and including \ntool development, regional coordination, and promoting international \naction as explicit program functions.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Blunt, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1120. A bill to encourage greater use of propane as a \ntransportation fuel, to create jobs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Propane \nGreen Autogas Solutions Act of 2011. I am pleased to note that the \njunior Senators from Missouri, Mr. Blunt, and Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, \nare original cosponsors of this measure. Our bill extends for five \nyears Federal Alternative Fuel Tax Credits for Propane Used as a Motor \nFuel, Propane Vehicles, and Propane Refueling Infrastructure.\n  Propane ``autogas'' is a reliable, domestically produced alternative \nfuel with lower greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions than gasoline. Sixty \npercent of propane, also known as liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, derived \nfrom natural gas processing and 40 percent is a byproduct of crude oil \nrefining. Since LPG is derived from fossil fuels, burning it releases \ncarbon dioxide, CO2. The advantage is that LPG releases less \nCO2 per unit of energy than oil and burns cleanly with \nregard to particulates.\n  At present, one propane-powered light-duty vehicle, LDV, and several \nheavy-duty vehicle, HDV, propane engines and fueling systems are \navailable from U.S. original equipment manufacturers, OEM. Because \nother countries offer more OEM options in propane vehicles, thorough \ntesting to compare emissions with reformulated gasoline has been \nconducted on these vehicles and engines in Europe. Two of these tests \nwere combined and the results are promising with respect to lower \nparticulate matter, PM, nitrogen oxides, NOX, carbon \nmonoxide, CO, and total hydrocarbon, THC, emissions, as the chart below \ndetails:\n  To augment LPG's generally cleaner combustion properties, propane \nengines can be calibrated to choose between pollutants, making the \nengine additionally useful in achieving regional or local pollution-\nreduction targets. A rich calibration reduces nitrogen oxides, \nNOX, at the expense of increasing CO and non-methane \nhydrocarbons and a lean calibration does just the opposite.\n  Propane is in surplus worldwide with 93 percent of U.S. propane \nproduced domestically when combined with supply from Canada. A national \ninfrastructure of pipelines, processing facilities, and storage, i.e., \n59 million barrel capacity in Texas alone, already exists for the \nefficient distribution of propane and there are roughly 3,200 propane \ndispensing stations across the U.S. Propane supply is expected to \nincrease over the next several decades, which means more consumer \navailability and price stability.\n  Commercial fleets are the propane autogas vehicle target market. The \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) and the 2005 Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, \nSAFETEA-LU, transportation reauthorization established significant tax \nincentives for propane autogas to stimulate its use in motor vehicles \nto reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and reduce environmental \nimpacts associated with gasoline and diesel fuel use. The 2005 \nlegislation provided the following alternative fuel tax credits that \nbenefit propane autogas, all of which would be extended under the \nlegislation Senators Blunt and Stabenow and I are introducing today.\n  Propane Fuel Credits--SAFETEA-LU included a 50 cent per gallon credit \nfor propane sold for use in motor vehicles. This credit expires at the \nend of 2011.\n  Propane Vehicle Credits--EPACT 2005 included a tax credit to \nconsumers who purchase OEM propane vehicles or convert gasoline or \ndiesel engines. The amount of credit the consumer receives varies \ndepending on vehicle weight and emissions. This credit is currently \nexpired.\n  Propane Infrastructure Credits--EPACT 2005 provided a tax credit \namounting to 30 percent of the cost of a fueling station, not to exceed \n$30,000 per station. This credit expires at the end of 2011.\n  The Propane Act would extend these three tax credits for 5 years. For \nthe credits to have a meaningful effect in firmly establishing a robust \npropane autogas market, they should be in place for a defined period of \ntime, not extended from year-to-year in a haphazard fashion. Congress \nshould not wait to act until the credits are about to expire because \nmarket uncertainty regarding the credits undermines the effectiveness \nof the incentives and discourages the kind of investment that Congress \nwants the private sector to make in alternative fuels. The Propane \nGreen Autogas Solutions Act, if enacted, would offer the long-term \npolicy commitment necessary to continue building essential alternative \nfuel infrastructure and bolster a burgeoning autogas market. Private \ninvestment is much more likely to occur when the availability of the \ntax credits is assured in the long-term so the propane industry can \ncreate the economies of scale necessary to make propane autogas a \nviable and competitive alternative fuel.\n  There is no score for the bill yet. The National Propane Gas \nAssociation, NPGA, has retained an economic research firm to perform a \ncomprehensive economic review that will look at costs and offsetting \nbenefits, job creation, economic growth, etc.; foreign petroleum \ngallons displaced; and the positive environmental impact of extending \nthe tax credits. The study will be available shortly and will share it \nwith my colleagues when it becomes available.\n  Recent rapid price increases for gasoline and diesel fuel have hurt \nAmericans families and businesses. This weekend is Memorial Day \nweekend, the unofficial beginning of the summer and the summer driving \nseason. Our Nation needs to come to grips with a few fundamental facts. \nWe have 2-3 percent of the world's oil reserves. We account for about 5 \npercent of the world's population. We currently produce 11 percent of \nthe world's oil, up 11 percent over the last 2 years, in large part \nbecause we have more drilling rigs in operation right now than the rest \nof the world combined--by 50 percent. We account for 25 percent of the \nworld's oil consumption. ``Drill here, drill now, pay less'' is a \ncatchy slogan, but it's not a solution to our energy woes. As T. Boone \nPickens himself has said, we cannot drill our way of this problem. The \nbest way for the United States to put downward pressure on gasoline and \ndiesel prices is through demand reduction since we are the world's \nbiggest consumers of petroleum products by far. The Propane Green \nAutogas Solutions Act offers one way to reduce our demand--by \nsubstituting propane for gasoline or diesel fuel. Propane is a domestic \ntransportation fuel. It is less\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nexpensive than gasoline and diesel fuel. It burns more cleanly. These \nare all good things. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to insure loans for financing \nof renewable energy systems leased for residential use, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nRenewable Energy Access through Leasing Act of 2011 or the REAL Act of \n2011. I'd like to thank Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Mark Udall \nfor joining in this bipartisan effort.\n  Many homeowners would like to install solar panels or other renewable \nenergy systems, but face the daunting challenge of paying the upfront \ncost for the technology. To purchase and install a new solar energy \nsystem, for example, can cost between $20,000 and $30,000. This is a \nsignificant and often prohibitive cost, even when more than justified \nby long-term savings.\n  A promising option to promote residential use of renewable energy is \nleasing. Here is how it works: A company pays to purchase and install \nthe system and the homeowner pays a fixed monthly fee to lease the \nrenewable energy system from the company. It is easy for the homeowner, \noften requires no upfront cost, and can even save them money on \nelectricity bills. Leasing has been successfully used for everything \nfrom satellite TV dishes to car. Why not solar panels too?\n  One of the problems has been that renewable energy system leasing \ndoes not have a well-established financial market. Investors are \nreluctant to pursue these opportunities, in large part because of the \nuncertain lifespan of the renewable energy systems. The REAL Act would \naddress that problem by having the Department of Energy insure the \nvalue of the lease. This would help create a secondary market for \nrenewable energy system leases to residential customers, freeing up \nadditional capital to invest in these programs.\n  The benefits of renewable energy are manifold and well-documented. \nRenewable energy creates jobs. From the engineers who design the \nsystems to the technicians who install them, this industry has the \npotential to support thousands of new jobs.\n  Renewable energy promotes energy independence. Oil still accounts for \napproximately 40 percent of our total energy needs, and seventy percent \nof this oil is imported from foreign countries, many of whom, to put it \nmildly, are not committed to our best interests. We are sending $1 \nbillion per day overseas to fund this addiction.\n  Renewable energy reduces harmful pollution. Many of our current dirty \nsources of energy are significant contributors to air pollution, \nleading to increased cases of asthma, respiratory diseases, and birth \ndefects. Moreover, these energy sources are significant contributors to \nglobal climate change, harming our communities through sea level rise \nand increased extreme weather. Rapidly rising greenhouse gas \nconcentrations are also putting severe strain on our oceans through \nacidification and temperature change, creating conditions not seen for \nmillions of years. In my home state of Rhode Island, the Narragansett \nBay has witnessed a 4 degree increase in average annual temperature, \ncausing what amounts to a full ecosystem shift.\n  It is hard to disagree that renewable energy offers solutions to many \nof the problems facing our country. But there is often disagreement \nabout the best way forward to promote renewable energy. Some are \nconcerned about the budget impact of promoting renewable energy, some \nare concerned about government mandates, and some are concerned about \ngovernment subsidies. While we may disagree on other means to promote \nrenewable energy, I am hoping that we can all agree on this bipartisan \nproposal.\n  The REAL Act would not add a dime to the budget deficit. The \nCongressional Budget Office scored similar legislation last Congress as \nhaving no budget impact. It achieves this goal because the insurance \nprogram is paid for entirely through premiums. The bill also protects \nthe taxpayer in the case of a default because the government has the \nright to collect revenues directly from the renewable energy system.\n  The REAL Act is not a subsidy and requires no appropriation. It \nrelies on the value of the renewable energy system itself to provide \nthe basis for the insurance.\n  The REAL Act is also not a mandate. It has no requirement to use the \nleasing mechanism, but merely facilitates the expansion of renewable \nenergy leasing to homeowners.\n  While this bill is only one piece of the puzzle to solving our \noverall energy problem, I hope that it is a piece we can all agree on. \nProviding additional options to lease renewable energy systems is a win \nfor our homeowners, our economy, and our environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strengthen the United States trade laws and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nStrengthening America's Trade Laws Act, legislation that will protect \nAmerican businesses and workers by ensuring that they can compete on a \nlevel playing field with foreign companies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today should be viewed as a \nplaceholder for a more comprehensive updated bill that I plan on \nintroducing after the recess. Given the potential for legislative \naction at any time on Trade Adjustment Assistance, the three pending \nFree Trade Agreements, and the continuing harm caused by illegally \ndumped foreign goods, I thought it was imperative that I introduce this \nbill today and move the discussion of our country's trade policy \nforward.\n  The Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act allows the government to \nlive up to its commitment to protect American businesses by allowing \nthe businesses being harmed by unfairly subsidized imports to have a \nseat at the table in trade dispute proceedings. It also strengthens \ncountervailing duty laws that are used to impose tariffs on goods from \ncountries like China that are being unfairly subsidized.\n  Importantly, my bill would prevent the World Trade Organization, WTO, \nfrom dictating American policy by mandating that Congress must approve \nof any regulatory change to American law that is meant to conform with \nan adverse WTO decision.\n  This bill goes after countries that use currency manipulation to keep \ntheir prices artificially low by allowing the American government to \ntreat this manipulation as an unfair subsidy that can be responded to \nwith countervailing duties.\n  My bill also allows a panel of judicial experts to review recent \nadverse WTO decisions to ensure that they were made correctly and that \nobligations are not being imposed on the United States that our \ngovernment has not previously agreed to.\n  These steps are important because businesses like those in my home \nstate of West Virginia face a constant threat from foreign made goods \nthat are being sold at prices well below cost in an effort to drive \nAmerican businesses out of the marketplace altogether. In West \nVirginia, we know all too well the impact these unfair practices can \nhave, as numerous manufacturing businesses have closed in recent years \nin response to these challenges.\n  I have worked through the system to try to protect our employers, \ntestifying numerous times before the International Trade Commission on \nbehalf of West Virginia businesses, including our steel industry, in an \neffort to get the government to counter unfair subsidies and give \nAmerican manufacturers a fighting chance in the global marketplace. It \nhas become clear to me through the years though that the current \nprotections are not strong enough and that more must be done to allow \nour businesses to compete. That is what I hope to accomplish with this \nbill. I am not asking for any unfair advantages for American \nbusinesses. I just want to allow them the opportunity to succeed on the \nmerits of their ideas and their hard work.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation and thank the chair for allowing me to speak on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Blunt, \n        Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Portman, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1133. A bill to prevent the evasion of antidumping and \ncountervailing duty orders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, President, I rise today to introduce the \nEnforcing Orders and Reducing Circumvention and Evasion Act, or the \nENFORCE Act, of 2011.\n  For almost a century, Democratic and Republican Administrations have \npromoted and protected America's anti-dumping and countervailing duty \nlaws. These laws recognize the reality that foreign competitors don't \nalways play by the rules. Some employ unfair and unscrupulous trade \npractices that put American businesses at a serious disadvantage. So, \nwhen it comes to ensuring that American businesses and workers have a \nlevel playing field to compete, anti-dumping and countervailing duty \nlaws are the first line of defense.\n  But it is not enough to just pass these laws; they need to be \nenforced. Duties don't work unless they are assessed and collected. But \njust like some people cheat their way out of taxes, the same is true \nfor foreign supplies and dishonest importers who evade and flout the \nanti-dumping and countervailing duties that protect American business \nand workers from grievous economic harm.\n  These suppliers and importers are what I call trade cheats.\n  You see, under U.S. trade laws, when a certain import is found to be \nunfairly traded, that is, it benefits from government subsidies or is \nsold below market prices, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes \nadditional duties on these imports. These duties, we call them anti-\ndumping and countervailing duties, or AD/CVD, ensure that American \nproducers are only asked to compete on a playing field that is level.\n  But we have these trade cheats out there. They cheat American \ntaxpayers out of the revenue that is supposed to be collected on \nimports, and which is needed to reduce the budget deficit, and they \ncheat American producers out of business that may otherwise be theirs. \nIn short, the trade cheats steal American jobs and America's treasure.\n  The trade cheats are increasingly, and brazenly, employing a variety \nof schemes to evade AD/CVD orders. Sometimes, they hustle their \nmerchandise through foreign ports to claim that it originates from \nsomewhere it doesn't. Other times, the trade cheats will provide \nfraudulent information' to government authorities at American ports of \nentry, or they engage in schemes to mislabel and misrepresent imports.\n  In recognizing this problem, I convened a hearing in the subcommittee \non international trade, customs and global competitiveness entitled \n``Enforcing America's Trade Laws in the Face of Customs Fraud and Duty \nEvasion'' in May of this year. At this hearing we heard from Senators \nof both political parties and companies from across this nation about \ntheir concerns regarding this lack of enforcement. Others launched \ntheir own investigation into the matter.\n  My own staff on the Finance Subcommittee on Trade, Customs and \nCompetitiveness learned that if often takes Customs and Border \nProtection, CBP, nearly a year to ask its sister agencies for \ninvestigatory help when it is needed and when CBP does refer a case to \nan outside agency they don't follow-up to ensure that it gets handled. \nIt generally takes several years for the government to conclude an \ninvestigation into evasion and reassess the appropriate duties that \nshould have been collected.\n\n  Customs and Border Protection, is the nation's frontline defense \nagainst unfair trade and is responsible for enforcing U.S. trade remedy \nlaws and collecting AD/CV duties. Yet, if you listen to the concerns of \ndomestic producers, like those who testified at my hearing, timely and \neffective enforcement of AD/CVD orders remains problematic and AD/CV \nduty evasion continues, seemingly unabated.\n  While Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and CBP are \ndragging their feet to enforce our trade laws, this country's domestic \nmanufacturers are being hammered by foreign trade cheats. It is not \nlike the cheaters wait around to get caught and pay their fines, they \ndisappear long before the so called government watchdogs arrive. ICE \nand CBP are the two principal American government agencies that are \nsupposed to police this beat. In my view, one of them, CBP, treats \nallegations of duty evasion like junk mail. The other, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, has been more visible on the issue of alleged \nillegal movie downloads than taking steps to protect tens of thousands \nof manufacturing jobs that are threatened by unfair trade.\n  Such lollygagging is not only hurting our domestic producer, it is \nhurting our country's treasury. U.S. industry sources estimate that \napproximately\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n$91 million in AD/CV duties that were supposed to be applied to just \nfour steel products went uncollected as a result of evasion in 2009. \nThis is an amount equal to 30 percent of all AD/CV duties CBP collected \nthat year. With 300 current AD/CVD orders in place on countless \nproducts from over 40 countries, the potential for AD/CV duty evasion \nis vast, and hundreds of millions of AD/CV duties may be unaccounted \nfor. Every penny counts and we have an obligation to the American \nbusinesses, and the workers they rely on, to do a better job.\n  The bill I am introducing today, with Senators Snowe, McCaskill, \nBlunt, Brown from Ohio, Portman, and Schumer, will go a long way toward \nempowering the federal government to do a better job to combat the \ntrade cheats and enforce U.S. trade laws. I would like to highlight \njust a few of the main provisions.\n  First, the ENFORCE Act would formalize a process by which allegations \nof evasion are acted on. Because CBP primarily relies on the private \nsector to identify evasion of AD/CVD, the ENFORCE Act would formalize \nthat process by allowing stakeholders to file a petition alleging \nevasion and require CBP to initiate an investigation pursuant to the \npetition within 10 days.\n  Second, our bill would establish a rapid-response timeline by which \nCBP would investigate allegations of evasion. The ENFORCE Act would \ngive the CBP 90 days, after an investigation of evasion begins, to make \na preliminary determination into whether there is a reason to believe \nan importer is evading an AD/CVD order. So if an affirmative \npreliminary determination is made, AD/CV duties would be required to be \ncollected in cash until the investigation is concluded and any entries \nof subject merchandise would not be liquidated by CBP in order to \nensure that the correct amount of duties owed can be collected. CBP \nwould also be required to make a final determination as to whether \nmerchandise subject to an investigation under the bill entered into the \nU.S. through an evasion scheme within 120 days after CBP has issued a \npreliminary determination. Flexibilities are added to these timelines \nfor cases that are complex. All of this would put an end to the \nlollygagging that our domestic producers would desperately like to see \nended.\n  Third, the ENFORCE Act would help facilitate information sharing. Our \nbill would establish clear instruction and guidelines to promote \nappropriate information sharing among the various agencies to better \ncombat evasion and protect consumers from unsafe goods. Everyone knows \nthat the more information law enforcement agencies have, the better \nthey are able to do their jobs.\n  Last and certainly not least, our bill would establish \naccountability. CBP's broad mandate to facilitate trade, enforce trade \nremedy laws, and protect national security often leads to inconsistent \nefforts to combat evasion of the trade remedy laws. The ENFORCE Act \nwould require CBP to provide annual reports to us here in Congress \nabout the effectiveness of its enforcement efforts and the job it is \nrequired to do to protect American producers from the harm of unfairly \ntraded imports.\n  As you can see, this bill presents a common-sense strategy to combat \ntrade cheating and the evasion of antidumping and countervailing duty \ncollection. Enforcing U.S. trade laws and combating unfair trade \npractices must be a central pillar of an economic and trade policy that \nis designed to promote economic growth and job expansion, especially as \nwe continue to recover from a recession.\n  I want to take a moment to recognize and thank some terrific \ncolleagues of mine in the Senate that are joining me in introducing \nthis legislation. I thank you, and your staff, for your help and for \nyour efforts. I would also like to thank the Retail Industry Leaders \nAssociation, the Committee to Support U.S. Trade Laws, and the \nCoalition to Enforce Antidumping & Countervailing Duty Orders for their \nvaluable input. I look forward to more of their input going forward.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with \nmy friends in the House of Representatives to build support for this \ninitiative and to take action on behalf of American producers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1133\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for restoration of the coastal areas of \nthe Gulf of Mexico affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation previously sponsored by a Member of the Commerce Science \nand Transportation Committee in the 111th Congress that would direct \nfunds from the administrative, civil, and criminal penalties stemming \nfrom the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to fund coastal and marine \nrestoration, research and education, as well as promote tourism and \neconomic development in the coastal Gulf states. The bill that I \nintroduce today, the Gulf Coast Restoration Act, is identical to the \nbill by the same name introduced in the 111th Congress and referred to \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\n  To remind my colleagues, under Senate Rule XXV(f), the Commerce \nCommittee possesses broad jurisdiction, including over ``Coast Guard . \n. . coastal zone management . . . interstate commerce . . . marine and \nocean navigation, safety and transportation, including navigational \naspects of deepwater ports . . . marine fisheries . . . merchant marine \nand navigation . . . oceans . . . regulation of consumer products and \nservices including testing related to toxic substances . . . science, \nengineering, and technology research and development and policy . . . \ntransportation, and the transportation and commerce aspects of Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands.'' As Chairman of the Committee I am well aware \nthat individual Members of my Committee have strong views on all of \nthese issues.\n  In the coming weeks, the Commerce Committee will be reviewing and \nconsidering a legislative package in a renewed effort to respond the \nGulf oil spill. My introduction of the bill today is intended to \nclearly establish that the Commerce Committee continues to hold strong \nviews about how to direct funding from the assessed penalties back to \nrestoring the Gulf economy and environment. It is also intended to \nassert the Commerce Committee will conduct its oversight over the \npromotion of commerce, as well as over ocean and coastal programs, and \nreserve its rights to review and consider the authorization of programs \nneeded to support the economic recovery of the Gulf, and the long term \nrestoration of Gulf ecosystems. Finally, introduction of this bill is \nintended to provide Commerce Committee Members with the opportunity to \nensure that needed baseline science is put in place, along with \nemergency response technology and programs, to support improved \noffshore energy decisions in the future. I look forward to revising \nthis bill following introduction to reflect the views of the Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1141. A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nfrom the numerical limitations on immigrant visas and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nthat would remove the obstacles preventing Filipino veterans of World \nWar II from being united with their children, a situation whose roots \nreach back almost eight decades.\n  The Philippine Independence Act of 1934 established the Philippines, \na U.S. possession since 1898, as a commonwealth with certain powers \nover its internal affairs but with sovereign power retained by the \nUnited States. The Act also established a ten-year timetable for the \ncommonwealth to achieve independence from the United States.\n  In early 1941, in the face of Japan's military aggression in Asia, \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked his authority, based on the \nretention of U.S. sovereign power over the Philippines to ``call and \norder into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States all of \nthe organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of \nthe Philippines.''\n  In January of 1942, a month after it attacked Pearl Harbor, Japan \ninvaded the Philippines and occupied the commonwealth until August \n1945.\n  Two months later, in March of 1942, Congress and President Roosevelt \nenacted the Second War Powers Act, which included the Nationality Act \nof 1940 that authorized the naturalization of all aliens serving in the \nU.S. armed forces.\n  The 200,000 Filipinos that served in the U.S. armed forces were \ncritical to the Philippine resistance and to the island's liberation in \nAugust 1945. Approximately 7,000 Filipinos who served outside the \nPhilippines were naturalized pursuant to the Nationality Act of 1940 \nwhile another 4,000 who served inside the Philippines were naturalized \nbetween the liberation of the Philippines in August 1945 and the \nexpiration of the Act on December 31, 1946.\n  In 1990, my distinguished colleague Senator Daniel K. Inouye was \ninstrumental in enacting the Immigration Act of 1990. This law offered \nFilipino veterans who had not been naturalized pursuant to the \nNationality Act of 1940, the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship.\n  Of the Filipino veterans who were naturalized for their service in \nthe U.S. armed forces, many chose to become U.S. residents. Because the \noffer of naturalization did not extend to their children, these men \nfiled permanent resident status petitions for their children who \nremained in the Philippines. Sadly, those children, now adults, have \nlanguished on the visa waiting list for decades because of backlogs and \nvisa limits.\n  My bill, the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act of 2011, \nwould exempt the children in question from the numerical limitation on \nvisas. Family unification has been the centerpiece of U.S. Immigration \npolicy for more than a half century, and my bill would reunite the \nFilipino veterans, now in their 80s and 90s, with their children at \nlong last.\n  The Filipino veterans and their children have been kept apart for far \ntoo long, and I urge my colleagues to join me in making their long-\nawaited reunion possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, I rise along with my colleagues, \nSenators Feinstein, McCain and Durbin, to introduce renewal of \nsanctions against the military junta in Burma.\n  The casual observer could be excused for thinking that things have \nchanged for the better in Burma over the past year. After all, \nelections were held last fall, a ``new'' regime took office earlier \nthis year, Aung San Suu Kyi was freed and the lead Burmese general Than \nShwe seemed to retire from political life. However, in Burma as is so \noften the case, things are not what they seem. And that is certainly \nthe case here.\n  First, the elections that were held in November took place without \nthe benefit of international election monitors. All reputable observers \ntermed the elections not to be free or fair. This was in large part \nbecause the National League for Democracy, NLD, Suu Kyi's party and the \noverwhelming winner of the last free elections in the country in 1990, \nwas effectively banned by the junta and could not participate in the \nelection. There were restrictions placed on how other political parties \ncould form and campaign. No criticism of the junta could be voiced. And \nthe results were unsurprising: the regime's handpicked candidates won \nbig and the democratic opposition was largely sidelined.\n  Second, the new regime is essentially the junta with only the \nthinnest democratic veneer pulled over it. The Constitution, which \nplaces great power in the military as it is, cannot be amended without \nthe blessing of the armed forces. Those in parliament are limited in \nhow they can criticize the regime. Moreover, sitting atop these new \ninstitutions is rumored to be a shadowy panel known as the State \nSupreme Council, which is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution, and \nwhich is led by, you guessed it, the military.\n  The only legitimately good news of late was the freeing of Suu Kyi. I \nwas fortunate enough to be able to speak with her for the first time \nearlier this year. Yet, the extent of her freedom remains open to \nquestion. She was, of course, freed only following the sham election. \nShe and her party have also been publicly threatened by the regime; \nthus, the extent to which she can move about the country or travel \noverseas remains unclear. Further, more than 2,000 other political \nprisoners remain behind bars in Burma; they are no better off than \nbefore. Neither are the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced \npersons who are without a home due to the repressive policies of the \njunta.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that there are growing national security \nfactors that cause one to be even more reluctant than ever to remove \nsanctions and reward bad behavior. The junta's increasingly close \nbilateral military relationship with North Korea is a source of much \nconcern in this vein.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe the sanctions that are in place \nshould remain until true democratic reform has been instituted. That is \nthe position of Suu Kyi herself and of the NLD. It is also the position \nof the Obama administration. In a State Department letter dated April \n27, the State Department states that ``in the absence of meaningful \nreforms, the U.S. government should maintain its sanctions on Burma.'' \nAs Suu Kyi herself recently stated, ``[s]o far'' there hasn't been \n``any meaningful change'' since the November elections.\n  We should not be fooled by the transparent efforts of the regime. It \nis merely trying to get out from under the international cloud of \nsanctions, without making true changes in how it governs itself, treats \nits people and interacts with the rest of the world.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will once again renew this \nbipartisan measure that in 2010 enjoyed the support of 68 Senate \ncosponsors and was adopted 99-1. The bill is identical to last year's \nin that it does the following: continues the ban on imports from Burma \ninto the U.S., including products containing rubies and jadeite; \nauthorizes the freezing of assets against a number of Burmese leaders; \nprevents the U.S. from supporting loans for Burma in international \nfinancial institutions; prohibits the issuance of visas to junta \nofficials; and limits the use of correspondent accounts that may \nfacilitate services for the regime's leaders. These measures would \nremain in place until the regime undertakes meaningful steps toward \ndemocratization and reconciliation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution and a letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 17\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) and section 3A(b)(1) and (c)(1) of the \n     Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2011.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your letter of March \n     29 regarding sanctions and the nomination of a Special \n     Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma.\n       On April 14, President Obama nominated Derek Mitchell as \n     the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. \n     Currently serving as the Defense Department's Principal \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Asian and Pacific \n     Security Affairs, Derek Mitchell has both the regional \n     expertise and diplomatic acumen to successfully enhance our \n     coordination of Burma policy. We will be submitting his \n     nomination shortly for your advice and consent.\n       As you note, Burma's elections were neither free nor fair \n     and the regime continues its repressive policies and human \n     rights abuses. We agree with you and the National League for \n     Democracy's conclusions that, in the absence of meaningful \n     reforms, the U.S. government should maintain its sanctions on \n     Burma. We look forward to soon having Mr. Mitchell as the \n     Special Representative in place to coordinate multilateral \n     sanctions as called for by Section 7 of the Tom Lantos Block \n     JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act.\n       We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact us if we can be of further assistance on this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Joseph E. Macmanus,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise again today with my friend and \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to submit the joint \nresolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year.\n  We are proud to be joined in this effort by two champions for \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Burma, Senators McCain \nand Durbin, and we look forward to swift action by the Congress and the \nPresident on this important matter.\n  Congressman Joseph Crowley and Congressman Peter King are introducing \nthis resolution in the House and I appreciate their leadership and \nsupport.\n  Since we last debated the import ban on the Senate floor, we have \nreceived one bit of good news, but also, sadly, more confirmation on \nthe urgent need to keep the pressure on the ruling military regime.\n  On November 13, 2010, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the \ndemocratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, was released from house \narrest.\n  While her latest detention lasted more than 7\\1/2\\ years, she had \nspent the better part of the past 20 years in prison or under house \narrest.\n  Her release was wonderful news for those of us who have been inspired \nby her courage, her dedication to peace and her tireless efforts for \nfreedom and democracy for the people of Burma.\n  Yet our joy was tempered by the fact that her release came just days \nafter fraudulent and illegitimate elections for a new parliament based \non a sham constitution.\n  The regime's intent was clear: keep the voice of the true leader of \nBurma silent long enough until they could solidify their grip on power \nusing the false veneer of a democratic process.\n  Neither I, the people of Burma, nor the international community were \nfooled.\n  We all know that the last truly free parliamentary elections were \noverwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy in \n1990 but annulled by the military junta.\n  This new constitution was drafted in secret and without the input of \nthe democratic opposition led by Suu Kyi and her National League for \nDemocracy.\n  It set aside 25 percent of the seats in the new 440 seat House of \nRepresentatives for the military.\n  This would be in addition to the seats won by the ``Union Solidarity \nand Development Party'' founded by the military junta's Prime Minister \nThein Sein and 22 of his fellow cabinet members who resigned from the \narmy to form the ``civilian'' political party.\n  It barred Suu Kyi from running in the parliamentary elections.\n  And it forced the National League for Democracy to shut its doors \nbecause it would not kick Suu Kyi out of the party.\n  It should come as no surprise that the military backed party won \nnearly 80 percent of the seats in the new parliament.\n  In addition to preventing Suu Kyi and the National League for \nDemocracy from competing in the elections, the regime ensured that no \ninternational monitors would oversee the elections and journalists \nwould be prohibited from covering the election from inside Burma.\n  President Obama correctly stated that the elections ``were neither \nfree nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted \nstandards associated with legitimate elections.''\n  The National League for Democracy described the elections and the \nformation of a new government as reducing ``democratization in Burma to \na parody.''\n  Indeed, the new parliament elected Thein Sein, the last prime \nminister of the junta's State Peace and Development Council, as Burma's \nnew president.\n  He is reported to be heavily influenced by Burma's senior military \nleader and former head of state, General Than Shwe.\n  So, the names change--the State Law and Order Restoration Council, \nthe State Peace and Development Council, the Union Solidarity and \nDevelopment Party--but the faces, and the lack of democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law, remain the same.\n  So, while we celebrate the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, we recognize \nthat Burma is not yet free and the regime has failed to take the \nnecessary actions which allow for the import ban to be lifted.\n  As called for in the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we \nmust stand by the people of Burma and keep the pressure on the military \nregime to end violations of internationally recognized human rights; \nrelease all political prisoners; allow freedom of speech and press; \nallow freedom of association; permit the peaceful exercise of religion; \nand bring to a conclusion an agreement between the military regime and \nthe National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic minorities on the \nrestoration of a democratic government.\n  Until the regime changes its behavior and embraces positive, \ndemocratic change, we have no choice but to press on with the import \nban as a part of a strong sanctions regime.\n  This also includes tough banking sanctions.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to once again urge the \nadministration to put additional pressure on the ruling military junta \nby exercising the authority for additional banking sanctions on its \nleaders and followers as mandated by section 5 of the Tom Lantos Block \nBurmese Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts Act.\n  Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the effectiveness of the \nimport ban and other sanctions on Burma and the impact on the people of \nBurma.\n  I understand their concerns. I am disappointed that we have not seen \nmore progress towards freedom and democracy in Burma.\n  But let us listen to the voice of the democratic opposition in Burma \nabout the sanctions policy of the United States and the international \ncommunity.\n  A paper released by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for \nDemocracy argues that these sanctions are not targeted at the general \npopulation and are not to blame for the economic ills of the country.\n  Rather, the economy suffers due to mismanagement, cronyism, \ncorruption and the lack of the rule of law.\n  The best way for the Burmese government to get the sanctions lifted, \nthe paper argues, is to make progress on democracy, human rights, and \nthe rule of law.\n  It concludes:\n\n       Now more than ever there is an urgent need to call for an \n     all inclusive political process. The participation of a broad \n     spectrum of political forces is essential to the achievement \n     of national reconciliation in Burma. Progress in the \n     democratization process, firmly grounded in national \n     reconciliation, and the release of political prisoners should \n     be central to any consideration of changes in sanctions \n     policies.\n\n  I agree.\n  So, let us once again do our part and stand in solidarity with Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and the people of Burma.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3451-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 200--RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DESIGNATION \n      OF THE MONTH OF MAY AS ASIAN/PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, and \nMr. Reid of Nevada) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 200\n\n       Whereas each May, the people of the United States join \n     together to pay tribute to the contributions of the \n     generations of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders who have \n     enriched the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the history of Asian-Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the \n     history of the United States;\n       Whereas as of 2011, according to the United States Census \n     Bureau, the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community is \n     1 of the fastest growing and most diverse populations in the \n     United States and is comprised of more than 45 distinct \n     ethnicities and more than 28 language groups;\n       Whereas the 2010 United States Census estimates that there \n     are--\n       (1) 17,300,000 United States residents who identify \n     themselves as Asian alone or in combination with 1 or more \n     other races; and\n       (2) 1,200,000 United States residents who identify \n     themselves as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander \n     alone or in combination with 1 or more other races;\n       Whereas the United States Census Bureau projects that by \n     the year 2050--\n       (1) there will be 40,600,000 United States residents \n     identifying themselves as Asian alone or in combination with \n     1 or more other races, comprising 9 percent of the total \n     population of the United States; and\n       (2) there will be 2,600,000 United States residents \n     identifying themselves as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific \n     Islander alone or as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific \n     Islander in combination with 1 or more other races, \n     comprising 0.6 percent of the total population of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific \n     American Heritage Month due to the facts that on May 7, 1843, \n     the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, \n     and on May 10, 1869, the first transcontinental railroad was \n     completed, with substantial contributions from Chinese \n     immigrants;\n       Whereas Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have faced \n     injustices throughout the history of the United States, \n     including the Act of May 5, 1892 (27 Stat. 25, chapter 60) \n     (commonly known as the ``Geary Act'' or the ``Chinese \n     Exclusion Act''), the internment of Japanese-Americans during \n     World War II, unpunished hate crimes, such as the murder of \n     Vincent Chin, and other events;\n       Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, \n     officially designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage \n     Month and requests the President to issue an annual \n     proclamation calling on the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities;\n       Whereas Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as Yuri \n     Kochiyama, a civil rights activist, Herbert Pililaau, \n     recipient of the Medal of Honor, Dalip Singh Saund, the first \n     Asian-American Congressman, Patsy T. Mink, the first Asian-\n     American Congresswoman, and Norman Y. Mineta, the first \n     Asian-American member of a presidential cabinet, have made \n     significant strides in the political and military realms;\n       Whereas the Presidential Cabinet of the Obama \n     Administration includes a record 3 Asian-Americans, including \n     Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, Secretary of Commerce Gary \n     Locke, and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki;\n       Whereas in 2011, the Congressional Asian Pacific American \n     Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating \n     on behalf of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, includes \n     30 Members of Congress;\n       Whereas Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have made \n     history by assuming office in a number of new and \n     historically significant positions, including Nikki Haley, \n     the first Asian-American and first female Governor of the \n     State of South Carolina, Edwin M. Lee, the first Asian-\n     American Mayor of San Francisco, California, and Jean Quan, \n     the first Asian-American and first woman to serve as Mayor of \n     Oakland, California;\n       Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, \n     Asian-American and Pacific Islander leaders are serving in \n     State legislatures across the United States in record \n     numbers, including in the States of Alaska, Arizona, \n     California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, \n     Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, \n     Virginia, Utah, and Washington;\n       Whereas Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have risen to \n     some of the highest staff levels in the Obama Administration, \n     including Pete Rouse, who is the first Asian-American to \n     serve as White House Chief of Staff, Tina Tchen, Chief of \n     Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama, Chris Lu, White House \n     Cabinet Secretary, Neal Katyal, Acting Solicitor General of \n     the United States, Rajiv Shah, Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, L. Tammy \n     Duckworth, Assistant Secretary for Public and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, Anthony M. Babauta, Assistant Secretary for Insular \n     Areas of the Department of Interior, and many others;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to judicial \n     diversity has been demonstrated through the nomination of \n     high caliber Asian-Americans and other minority jurists at \n     all levels of the Federal bench;\n       Whereas significant outreach efforts to the Asian-American \n     and Pacific Islander community have been made through the \n     reestablishment of the White House Initiative on Asian-\n     Americans and Pacific Islanders to coordinate multiagency \n     efforts to ensure more accurate data collection and access to \n     services for the community;\n       Whereas even with the exceptional milestones achieved by \n     the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, there \n     remains much to be done to ensure that linguistically and \n     culturally isolated Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders \n     have access to resources, a voice in the Federal Government, \n     and continue to advance in the political landscape of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month \n     provides the people of the United States with an opportunity \n     to recognize the achievements, contributions, and history of \n     Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders and to appreciate the \n     challenges faced by Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the designation of the \n     month of May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month;\n       (2) encourages the celebration during Asian/Pacific \n     American Heritage Month of the significant contributions \n     Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have made to the United \n     States; and\n       (3) recognizes that the Asian-American and Pacific Islander \n     community strengthens and enhances the rich diversity of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3451-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3451-S3453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 201--EXPRESSING THE REGRET OF THE SENATE FOR THE \n    PASSAGE OF DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AGAINST THE CHINESE IN AMERICA, \n                  INCLUDING THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Akaka) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas many Chinese came to the United States in the 19th \n     and 20th centuries, as did people from other countries, in \n     search of the opportunity to create a better life for \n     themselves and their families;\n       Whereas the contributions of persons of Chinese descent in \n     the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, \n     fishing, and canning industries were critical to establishing \n     the foundations for economic growth in the Nation, \n     particularly in the western United States;\n       Whereas United States industrialists recruited thousands of \n     Chinese workers to assist in the construction of the Nation's \n     first major national transportation infrastructure, the \n     Transcontinental Railroad;\n       Whereas Chinese laborers, who made up the majority of the \n     western portion of the railroad workforce, faced grueling \n     hours and extremely harsh conditions in order to lay hundreds \n     of miles of track and were paid substandard wages;\n       Whereas without the tremendous efforts and technical \n     contributions of these Chinese immigrants, the completion of \n     this vital national infrastructure would have been seriously \n     impeded;\n       Whereas from the middle of the 19th century through the \n     early 20th century, Chinese immigrants faced racial ostracism \n     and violent assaults, including--\n       (1) the 1887 Snake River Massacre in Oregon, at which 31 \n     Chinese miners were killed; and\n       (2) numerous other incidents, including attacks on Chinese \n     immigrants in Rock Springs, San Francisco, Tacoma, and Los \n     Angeles;\n       Whereas the United States instigated the negotiation of the \n     Burlingame Treaty, ratified by the Senate on October 19, \n     1868, which permitted the free movement of the Chinese people \n     to, from, and within the United States and accorded to China \n     the status of ``most favored nation'';\n       Whereas before consenting to the ratification of the \n     Burlingame Treaty, the Senate required that the Treaty would \n     not permit Chinese immigrants in the United States to be \n     naturalized United States citizens;\n       Whereas on July 14, 1870, Congress approved An Act to Amend \n     the Naturalization Laws and to Punish Crimes against the \n     Same, and for other Purposes, and during consideration of \n     such Act, the Senate expressly rejected an amendment to allow \n     Chinese immigrants to naturalize;\n       Whereas Chinese immigrants were subject to the overzealous \n     implementation of the Page Act of 1875 (18 Stat. 477), \n     which--\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n       (1) ostensibly barred the importation of women from \n     ``China, Japan, or any Oriental country'' for purposes of \n     prostitution;\n       (2) was disproportionately enforced against Chinese women, \n     effectively preventing the formation of Chinese families in \n     the United States and limiting the number of native-born \n     Chinese citizens;\n       Whereas, on February 15, 1879, the Senate passed ``the \n     Fifteen Passenger Bill,'' which would have limited the number \n     of Chinese passengers permitted on any ship coming to the \n     United States to 15, with proponents of the bill expressing \n     that the Chinese were ``an indigestible element in our midst \n     . . . without any adaptability to become citizens'';\n       Whereas, on March 1, 1879, President Hayes vetoed the \n     Fifteen Passenger Bill as being incompatible with the \n     Burlingame Treaty, which declared that ``Chinese subjects \n     visiting or residing in the United States, shall enjoy the \n     same privileges . . . in respect to travel or residence, as \n     may there be enjoyed by the citizens and subjects of the most \n     favored nation'';\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the veto of the Fifteen \n     Passenger Bill, President Hayes initiated the renegotiation \n     of the Burlingame Treaty, requesting that the Chinese \n     government consent to restrictions on the immigration of \n     Chinese persons to the United States;\n       Whereas these negotiations culminated in the Angell Treaty, \n     ratified by the Senate on May 9, 1881, which--\n       (1) allowed the United States to suspend, but not to \n     prohibit, the immigration of Chinese laborers;\n       (2) declared that ``Chinese laborers who are now in the \n     United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own \n     free will''; and\n       (3) reaffirmed that Chinese persons possessed ``all the \n     rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are \n     accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored \n     nation'';\n       Whereas, on March 9, 1882, the Senate passed the first \n     Chinese Exclusion Act, which purported to implement the \n     Angell Treaty but instead excluded for 20 years both skilled \n     and unskilled Chinese laborers, rejected an amendment that \n     would have permitted the naturalization of Chinese persons, \n     and instead expressly denied Chinese persons the right to be \n     naturalized as American citizens;\n       Whereas, on April 4, 1882, President Chester A. Arthur \n     vetoed the first Chinese Exclusion Act as being incompatible \n     with the terms and spirit of the Angell Treaty;\n       Whereas, on May 6, 1882, Congress passed the second Chinese \n     Exclusion Act, which--\n       (1) prohibited skilled and unskilled Chinese laborers from \n     entering the United States for 10 years;\n       (2) was the first Federal law that excluded a single group \n     of people on the basis of race; and\n       (3) required certain Chinese laborers already legally \n     present in the United States who later wished to reenter to \n     obtain ``certificates of return'', an unprecedented \n     requirement that applied only to Chinese residents;\n       Whereas, in response to reports that courts were bestowing \n     United States citizenship on persons of Chinese descent, the \n     Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 explicitly prohibited all State \n     and Federal courts from naturalizing Chinese persons;\n       Whereas the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 underscored the \n     belief of some Senators at that time that--\n       (1) the Chinese people were unfit to be naturalized;\n       (2) the social characteristics of the Chinese were \n     ``revolting'';\n       (3) Chinese immigrants were ``like parasites''; and\n       (4) the United States ``is under God a country of \n     Caucasians, a country of white men, a country to be governed \n     by white men'';\n       Whereas, on July 3, 1884, notwithstanding United States \n     treaty obligations with China and other nations, Congress \n     broadened the scope of the Chinese Exclusion Act--\n       (1) to apply to all persons of Chinese descent, ``whether \n     subjects of China or any other foreign power''; and\n       (2) to provide more stringent requirements restricting \n     Chinese immigration;\n       Whereas, on October 1, 1888, the Scott Act was enacted into \n     law, which--\n       (1) prohibited all Chinese laborers who would choose or had \n     chosen to leave the United States from reentering;\n       (2) cancelled all previously-issued ``certificates of \n     return,'' which prevented approximately 20,000 Chinese \n     laborers abroad, including 600 individuals who were en route \n     to the United States, from returning to their families or \n     their homes; and\n       (3) was later determined by the Supreme Court to have \n     abrogated the Angell Treaty;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 1892, the Geary Act was enacted into \n     law, which--\n       (1) extended the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years;\n       (2) required all Chinese persons in the United States, but \n     no other race of people, to register with the Federal \n     Government in order to obtain ``certificates of residence''; \n     and\n       (3) denied Chinese immigrants the right to be released on \n     bail upon application for a writ of habeas corpus;\n       Whereas, on an explicitly racial basis, the Geary Act \n     deemed the testimony of Chinese persons, including American \n     citizens of Chinese descent, per se insufficient to establish \n     the residency of a Chinese person subject to deportation, \n     mandating that such residence be established through the \n     testimony of ``at least one credible white witness'';\n       Whereas, in the 1894 Gresham-Yang Treaty, the Chinese \n     government consented to a prohibition of Chinese immigration \n     and the enforcement of the Geary Act in exchange for the \n     readmission of previous Chinese residents;\n       Whereas in 1898, the United States--\n       (1) annexed Hawaii;\n       (2) took control of the Philippines; and\n       (3) excluded thousands of racially Chinese residents of \n     Hawaii and of the Philippines from entering the United States \n     mainland;\n       Whereas on April 29, 1902, Congress--\n       (1) indefinitely extended all laws regulating and \n     restricting Chinese immigration and residence; and\n       (2) expressly applied such laws to United States insular \n     territories, including the Philippines;\n       Whereas in 1904, after the Chinese government exercised its \n     unilateral right to withdraw from the Gresham-Yang Treaty, \n     Congress permanently extended, ``without modification, \n     limitation, or condition'', all restrictions on Chinese \n     immigration and naturalization, making the Chinese the only \n     racial group explicitly singled out for immigration exclusion \n     and permanently ineligible for American citizenship;\n       Whereas between 1910 and 1940, the Angel Island Immigration \n     Station implemented the Chinese exclusion laws by--\n       (1) confining Chinese persons for up to nearly 2 years;\n       (2) interrogating Chinese persons; and\n       (3) providing a model for similar immigration stations at \n     other locations on the Pacific coast and in Hawaii;\n       Whereas each of the congressional debates concerning issues \n     of Chinese civil rights, naturalization, and immigration \n     involved intensely racial rhetoric, with many Members of \n     Congress claiming that all persons of Chinese descent were--\n       (1) unworthy of American citizenship;\n       (2) incapable of assimilation into American society; and\n       (3) dangerous to the political and social integrity of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the express discrimination in these Federal \n     statutes politically and racially stigmatized Chinese \n     immigration into the United States, enshrining in law the \n     exclusion of the Chinese from the political process and the \n     promise of American freedom;\n       Whereas wartime enemy forces used the anti-Chinese \n     legislation passed in Congress as evidence of American racism \n     against the Chinese, attempting to undermine the Chinese-\n     American alliance and allied military efforts;\n       Whereas, in 1943, at the urging of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt, and over 60 years after the enactment of the first \n     discriminatory laws against Chinese immigrants, Congress--\n       (1) repealed previously-enacted anti-Chinese legislation; \n     and\n       (2) permitted Chinese immigrants to become naturalized \n     United States citizens;\n       Whereas, despite facing decades of systematic, pervasive, \n     and sustained discrimination, Chinese immigrants and Chinese-\n     Americans persevered and have continued to play a significant \n     role in the growth and success of the United States;\n       Whereas 6 decades of Federal legislation deliberately \n     targeting Chinese by race--\n       (1) restricted the capacity of generations of individuals \n     and families to openly pursue the American dream without \n     fear; and\n       (2) fostered an atmosphere of racial discrimination that \n     deeply prejudiced the civil rights of Chinese immigrants;\n       Whereas diversity is one of our Nation's greatest \n     strengths, and, while this Nation was founded on the \n     principle that all persons are created equal, the laws \n     enacted by Congress in the late 19th and early 20th centuries \n     that restricted the political and civil rights of persons of \n     Chinese descent violated that principle;\n       Whereas although an acknowledgment of the Senate's actions \n     that contributed to discrimination against persons of Chinese \n     descent will not erase the past, such an expression will \n     acknowledge and illuminate the injustices in our national \n     experience and help to build a better and stronger Nation;\n       Whereas the Senate recognizes the importance of addressing \n     this unique framework of discriminatory laws in order to \n     educate the public and future generations regarding the \n     impact of these laws on Chinese and other Asian persons and \n     their implications to all Americans; and\n       Whereas the Senate deeply regrets the enactment of the \n     Chinese Exclusion Act and related discriminatory laws that--\n       (1) resulted in the persecution and political alienation of \n     persons of Chinese descent;\n       (2) unfairly limited their civil rights;\n       (3) legitimized racial discrimination; and\n       (4) induced trauma that persists within the Chinese \n     community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that this framework of anti-Chinese \n     legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, is \n     incompatible with the basic founding principles recognized in \n     the Declaration of Independence that all persons are created \n     equal;\n       (2) acknowledges that this pattern of anti-Chinese \n     legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, is \n     incompatible with the spirit of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       (3) deeply regrets passing 6 decades of legislation \n     directly targeting the Chinese people for physical and \n     political exclusion and the wrongs committed against Chinese \n     and American citizens of Chinese descent who\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\n     suffered under these discriminatory laws; and\n       (4) reaffirms its commitment to preserving the same civil \n     rights and constitutional protections for people of Chinese \n     or other Asian descent in the United States accorded to all \n     others, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Scott Brown, in submitting a resolution that expresses the \nregret of the U.S. Senate for the passage of discriminatory laws \nagainst Chinese immigrants. These laws are no longer in effect today. \nHowever, I believe it is important for Congress to express regret for \nthe many injustices that were experienced by Chinese immigrants as a \nresult of these policies, and for all of us as Americans to learn from \nthis difficult chapter in our Nation's past.\n  Let me begin by offering a brief history of the Chinese Exclusion \nAct. In the 1870s, an economic downturn created political pressure to \nslow the growing population of Chinese immigrants who were coming to \nthe United States to pursue a better way of life. In California, State \nlaws and local ordinances were enacted that denied the Chinese basic \nrights and privileges such as the right to own land and the ability to \naccess public schools.\n  At the urging of some California lawmakers, the U.S. Congress \nsubsequently passed laws that further denied the rights of Chinese \nimmigrants. The harshest of those measures was the Chinese Exclusion \nAct of 1882 that explicitly prohibited all State and Federal courts \nfrom naturalizing Chinese persons. This legislation was the first \nfederal law ever enacted to exclude a group of immigrants solely on the \nbasis of race or nationality.\n  The Chinese Exclusion Act was followed by the passage of the Geary \nAct in 1892, which extended the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years and \nrequired all Chinese persons in the United States to register with the \nFederal Government to obtain certificates of residence to prove their \nright to be in the U.S.\n  In order to fully understand this Nation's deep-rooted hostility \ntoward the Chinese during this time period, it is important to contrast \nthe U.S. Government's vastly different treatment of European immigrants \nwho entered the United States through Ellis Island. European immigrants \nwere not subjected to the same burdensome and humiliating screening \nrequirements as the Chinese.\n  Most are familiar with the stories of those coming to Ellis Island \nand seeing the Statute of Liberty in New York Harbor. However, often \nforgotten are the experiences of Chinese immigrants who made it to \nAmerica by way of Angel Island in California.\n  In 1910, the U.S. Government opened the Angel Island Immigration \nStation as a way to isolate Chinese immigrants from the city of San \nFrancisco and the remainder of the bay area in northern California. \nThese immigrants were brought to Angel Island Station where they were \nseparated from family members, subjected to embarrassing medical \nexaminations and grueling interrogations, and detained for months or \nsometimes years.\n  Despite these hardships, Chinese immigrants persevered, and they \ncontinue to make invaluable contributions to the development and \nsuccess of our Nation.

Res. 202\n\n       Whereas the brave men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces, who proudly serve the United States, risk their lives \n     to protect the freedom of the United States and deserve the \n     investment of every reasonable resource to ensure their \n     lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-being;\n       Whereas 2.4 percent of servicemembers returning from \n     deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom are clinically diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \n     disorder (referred to in this preamble as ``PTSD'') and up to \n     17 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom veterans exposed to sustained ground combat report \n     PTSD symptoms;\n       Whereas up to 10 percent of Operation Desert Storm \n     veterans, 30 percent of Vietnam veterans, and 8 percent of \n     the general population of the United States suffer or have \n     suffered from PTSD;\n       Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that \n     more than 438,000 veterans were treated for PTSD in 2010 \n     alone;\n       Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, \n     and untreated due to a lack of awareness about PTSD and the \n     persistent stigma associated with mental health issues;\n       Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of \n     depression, suicide, and drug- and alcohol-related disorders \n     and deaths, especially if left untreated;\n       Whereas the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs \n     have made significant advances in the prevention, diagnosis, \n     and treatment of PTSD and the symptoms of PTSD, but many \n     challenges remain; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a National Post-Traumatic \n     Stress Disorder Awareness Day will raise public awareness \n     about issues related to PTSD and help ensure that those \n     suffering from the invisible wounds of war receive proper \n     treatment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 27, 2011, as ``National Post-Traumatic \n     Stress Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) urges the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the \n     Secretary of Defense to continue working to educate \n     servicemembers, veterans, the families of servicemembers and \n     veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and \n     treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing for the second year \nin a row a Senate resolution to designate June 27 as National Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day. That date was inspired by the \nbirthday of North Dakota National Guard Staff Sergeant Joe Biel. Staff \nSergeant Biel served two tours of duty in Iraq as a Trailblazer, part \nof a unit responsible for route clearance operations. Each day, Joe's \nmission was to go out with his unit to find and remove Improvised \nExplosive Devices and other dangers from heavily traveled roads to make \nit safe for coalition forces and Iraqi civilians to travel. As a result \nof those experiences, Joe suffered from PTSD and, tragically, took his \nown life in April 2007. There is absolutely no doubt that Joe Biel is a \nhero who gave his life for our country.\n  I learned of Joe's story because friends from his platoon, the 4th \nPlatoon, A Company, of the North Dakota National Guard's 164th Combat \nEngineer Battalion, have organized an annual motorcycle ride across the \nstate of North Dakota in his memory. The Joe Biel Memorial Ride serves \nas a reunion for the 164th, a memorial for a lost friend, and a beacon \nto those suffering from PTSD and other mental issues across the region. \nThe key point made to me by the event's organizer, Staff Sergeant Matt \nLeaf, is that we have to raise awareness of this disease so that the \nlives of servicemembers, veterans, and other PTSD sufferers can be \nsaved by greater awareness of and treatment for this disorder.\n  For many, the war does not end when the warrior comes home. All too \nmany servicemembers and veterans face PTSD symptoms like anxiety, \nanger, and depression as they try to adjust to life after war. We \ncannot sweep these problems under the rug. PTSD is real. The Department \nof Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have made significant \nadvances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and its \nsymptoms, but many challenges remain. More must be done to inform and \neducate veterans, families and communities on the facts about this \nillness and the resources and treatments available.\n  That is why SSG Leaf and his fellow Trailblazers started the Joe Biel \nMemorial Bike Ride. That is why I began the effort to create a National \nPTSD Awareness Day last year. It is why I am introducing this \nResolution once again. Actions like this may not seem that important to \nsome, but they are. They garner attention, raise awareness, and help to \neliminate the stigma\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nsurrounding mental health issues. These efforts are about letting our \ntroops, past and present, know it is okay to come forward and say they \nneed help. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to seek assistance. \nIt is my hope that this message will be heard. In the words of SSG \nLeaf, ``maybe if we all take a minute to listen, we can stop one more \ntragedy from ever happening again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 203--RECOGNIZING ``NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH'' AS AN \nOPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF CHILDREN IN THE \n  FOSTER CARE SYSTEM, AND ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO IMPLEMENT POLICY TO \n        IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Begich, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 56, H.R. 754.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 754) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2011 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will \nbe passing the fiscal year 2011 intelligence authorization bill today.\n  This is now the second year in a row that we have been able to pass \nan authorization bill, after 6 years without doing so.\n  The bill authorizes funding for fiscal year 2011 for the 16 different \nagencies across the U.S. Government that make up the intelligence \ncommunity. Unlike the fiscal year 2010 bill, which was enacted last \nOctober, this bill also contains a classified annex, which is the main \nmechanism the Intelligence Committee has to set the level of \nintelligence spending and direct how it is used.\n  The bill adds hundreds of millions of dollars above the President's \nrequest for intelligence activities for fiscal year 2011. However, in \nanticipation of tighter future budgets, the bill also takes some \ninitial steps to prepare the intelligence community for likely smaller \nbudgets and personnel decreases in the coming years.\n  The bill includes a number of legislative provisions, including:\n  A section requiring the intelligence community to prevent another \nsecurity disaster, such as the recent leaks of classified information \nto Wikileaks, through the implementation of automated information \ntechnology threat detection programs that must be fully operational by \nthe end of 2013;\n  A provision improving the ability of government agencies to detail \npersonnel to needed areas of the intelligence community;\n  A commendation of intelligence community personnel for their role in \nbringing Osama bin Laden to justice and reaffirming the commitment of \nthe Congress to use the capabilities of the intelligence community to \ndisrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and affiliated organizations.\n  With the passage of this legislation, I believe we have restored the \ncommittee's ability to do oversight, and we are now on track to pass \nintelligence authorization bills each year.\n  I very much appreciate the close collaboration of Senator Chambliss, \nthe vice chairman of the committee, in this effort. We have worked \nclosely together to craft this legislation, and to secure its passage.\n  I also thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Ruppersberger for \ntheir efforts on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \nWe worked well together on the fiscal year 2011 legislation to bring \nforward coordinated bills to the House and the Senate, and I look \nforward to continue to work together to enact the fiscal year 2012 \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 754) was passed.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table and that any statements relating \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the Senate for unanimously \npassing the Faster FOIA Act of 2011. This important bill will establish \na bipartisan commission to examine the root causes of agency delays in \nprocessing Freedom of Information Act--FOIA--requests, and to recommend \nto the Congress and the President steps to help eliminate FOIA \nbacklogs.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005, because we \nwere concerned about the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays \nwithin our Federal agencies. During the intervening years, the problem \nof excessive FOIA delays did not go away. That is why in 2010, we \nreintroduced this bill and the Senate unanimously passed it last year. \nAfter the Judiciary Committee's hearing in March on FOIA, we \nreintroduced this bill yet again--with the hope that the Congress will \nfinally enact this good government legislation. Today, the Senate is \ndoing its part to achieve that goal.\n  While the Obama administration has made significant progress in \nimproving the FOIA process, large backlogs remain a major roadblock to \npublic access to information. A recent report released by the National \nSecurity Archive found that only about half of the Federal agencies \nsurveyed have taken concrete steps to update their FOIA policies in \nlight of these reforms. These delays are simply unacceptable. The \nbipartisan FOIA commission established by this bill will help to \nreverse this trend.\n  The commission created by the Faster FOIA Act will make key \nrecommendations to Congress and the President for reducing impediments \nto the efficient processing of FOIA requests. The commission will also \nstudy why Federal agencies are more and more relying on FOIA exemptions \nto withhold information from the public. In addition, the commission \nwill examine whether the current system for charging fees and granting \nfee waivers under FOIA should be modified. The commission will also be \nmade up of government and non-governmental representatives with a broad \nrange of experience related to handling FOIA requests.\n  I have said many times over the years that open government is neither \na Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American \nvalue and virtue that we all must uphold. I thank Senator Cornyn for \nhis work on this bill and for his leadership on this issue. I also \nthank Senator Whitehouse who has cosponsored this bill.\n  In addition, I thank the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, \nSenator Grassley, for working with me on this bill and his help in \nsecuring its passage in the Senate. I commend and thank the many open \ngovernment and FOIA advocacy groups that have supported this bill, \nincluding OpenTheGovernment.org, the Project on Government Oversight \nand the Sunshine in Government Initiative.\n  I hope that the House of Representatives will promptly pass this good \ngovernment legislation, so that the Commission on Freedom of \nInformation Act Processing Delays can begin its work.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported amendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. Con. Res. 4 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) expressing the sense of \n     Congress that an appropriate site on Chaplains Hill in \n     Arlington National Cemetery should be provided for a memorial \n     marker to honor the memory of the Jewish chaplains who died \n     while on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak on \nthe passage of S. Con. Res. 4, as amended, which would allow for the \nestablishment of a Jewish Chaplains Memorial on Chaplains Hill in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Since their inclusion in the Chaplain Corps in 1862, Jewish Chaplains \nhave played a vital role in supporting members of the Armed Forces. In \nArlington National Cemetery, Chaplains Hill serves as a memorial for \nmilitary chaplains who have died in service to their country.\n  Chaplains play a critical role in the lives of our Nation's soldiers, \nproviding spiritual guidance and emotional support in their times of \nneed. In addition to their spiritual role, chaplains still remain a \npart of the military and give their lives in the line of duty.\n  Mr. President, in particular, one story poignantly tells of the \nservice and sacrifice that chaplains make on behalf of their fellow \nservicemembers. On January 23, 1943, the USAT Dorchester was attacked \nby an enemy submarine while off the coast of Newfoundland. Four Army \nchaplains remained on the sinking vessel ensuring that surviving crew \nmembers would be able to reach the lifeboats, even surrendering their \nown lifejackets to crewmembers in need. As the ship began to sink, the \nchaplains banded together to pray for the safety of the crew. In honor \nof that selfless act, Congress created the Chaplain's Medal of Honor, \nalso known as the Four Chaplains Medal. One of the chaplains was Rabbi \nAlexander D. Goode, a lieutenant in the Army, who is one of the 13 \nJewish Chaplains who would be honored by the memorial that this \nResolution would establish.\n  I would like to thank the many groups and individuals involved in \nthis project. Specifically, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of \nRabbi Harold Robinson, RADM CHC USN Retired, Kenneth Kraetzer, Mr. Sol \nMoglen and Ms. Shelley Rood. Without the work of these dedicated \nindividuals, the sacrifice Jewish Chaplains have made on behalf of this \nNation would remain unmemorialized in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the Murray amendment,\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nwhich is at the desk, be agreed to, the concurrent resolution, as \namended, be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 388) was agreed to as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on the establishment of an \n  advisory commission on memorials at Arlington National Cemetery and \nfacilitate evaluation and approval of future monuments and memorials at \n                             the cemetery)\n\n       In the resolving clause, insert before the period at the \n     end the following: ``and that, in order to preserve, protect, \n     and maintain the limited amount of space available at \n     Arlington National Cemetery and ensure that future proposals \n     for commemorative works are appropriately designed, \n     constructed, and located and reflect a consensus of the \n     lasting national significance of the subjects involved, the \n     President of the United States, as Commander in Chief, should \n     establish an Arlington National Cemetery Memorial Advisory \n     Commission and procedures for the evaluation and approval of \n     new monuments and memorials comparable to those in chapter 89 \n     of title 40, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     `Commemorative Works Act')''.\n\n  The concurrent resolution (S.

Res. 172\n\n       Whereas in 2011, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States, with 1,500,000 \n     Americans expected to be diagnosed with cancer and more than \n     500,000 expected to die from the disease;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent the leading cause of \n     death for Americans under age 85, and the second leading \n     cause of death for Americans overall;\n       Whereas the national investment in cancer research has \n     yielded substantial returns in research advances and lives \n     saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1 percent decline \n     in cancer mortality saves the United States economy \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas advancements in the understanding of the causes, \n     mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer \n     have led to cures for many types of cancers and have \n     converted other types of cancers into manageable chronic \n     conditions;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for all cancers has \n     improved during the 30 years prior to the date of approval of \n     this resolution to more than 65 percent, and as of 2011, \n     there are more than 12,000,000 cancer survivors living in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the \n     general public, survivors and patient advocates, \n     philanthropic organizations, industry, and Federal, State, \n     and local governments have led to advanced breakthroughs, \n     early detection tools that have increased survival rates, and \n     a better quality of life for cancer survivors; and\n       Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant \n     implications for the treatment of other costly diseases such \n     as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, \n     and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the \n     invaluable contributions of the researchers in the United \n     States and worldwide and who are dedicated to reversing the \n     cancer epidemic;\n       (2) designates May 2011 as ``National Cancer Research \n     Month''; and\n       (3) supports efforts to make cancer research a national and \n     international priority so that one day the more than 200 \n     diseases known as cancer are eliminated.\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3462-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Res. 203\n\n       Whereas ``National Foster Care Month'' was established more \n     than 20 years ago to bring foster care issues to the \n     forefront, to highlight the importance of permanency for \n     every child, and to recognize the essential role that foster \n     parents, social workers, and advocates have in the lives of \n     children in foster care throughout the United States;\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to \n     ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to \n     provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child;\n       Whereas there are approximately 420,000 children living in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas there are 115,000 children in foster care awaiting \n     adoption;\n       Whereas 57,000 children are adopted out of foster care each \n     year;\n       Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the \n     foster care system for longer periods of time and are less \n     likely to be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas the number of available foster homes is declining, \n     and there are only 2.8 foster homes for every 10 children in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in \n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines, and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas more than 29,000 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     without a legal permanent connection to an adult or family;\n       Whereas the number of youth who ``age out'' of foster care \n     has steadily increased for the past decade;\n       Whereas children who ``age out'' of foster care lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child \n     protective services remain vacant;\n       Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the \n     average tenure for a worker in child protection services is \n     just 3 years;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and post-permanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing \n     Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-351; 122 Stat. 3949) \n     provides for new investments and services to improve the \n     outcomes of children and families in the foster care system; \n     and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes ``National Foster Care Month'' as an \n     opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that \n     children in the foster care system face;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (3) supports the designation of May as ``National Foster \n     Care Month'';\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (5) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster care system; and\n       (6) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) \n     and other programs designed to help children in the foster \n     care system reunite with their biological parents or, if the \n     children cannot be reunited with their biological parents, \n     find permanent, safe, and loving homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/26/senate-section/article/S3462-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3462-S3463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.
