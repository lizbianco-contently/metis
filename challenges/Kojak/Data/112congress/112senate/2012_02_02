Mr. President, over the last several months, I put my \nstaff on a little mission. I asked them to identify manufacturing \ncompanies in my home State of Illinois that have not only weathered \nthis recession but are doing well and are hiring. I wanted to meet with \nthese companies and find out why the recession has treated them \ndifferently, particularly when it comes to manufacturing jobs. I have \nbeen pleasantly surprised at how many businesses I have found to be in \nthat condition in my State. Not to understate our unemployment rate or \nthe impact of the recession on many businesses, the fact is there are \nsome that have not only weathered the storm but are doing quite well, \nand they represent a variety of different goods that they manufacture.\n  The heartening and encouraging news is that we are hearing more often \nthat companies have decided to resource their jobs back to the United \nStates. In his State of the Union Address, the President spoke of one \nsuch company, Master Lock, located in Milwaukee, WI, which he noted has \nnow announced that they think America is the best place to make \nproducts and do business. That is a good trend we want to encourage.\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\n  We know we have lost a goodly share of manufacturing jobs over the \nlast several years. In the year 2000, more than 17 million Americans \nwere employed in manufacturing. Ten years later, the number had fallen \nto 11.5 million--from 17 million to 11.5 million. More than 300 of \nthose jobs were lost in my home State of Illinois in that decade, from \n2000 to 2010.\n  But American manufacturing is growing again. One of the real good \nnews stories is Chrysler. I am sure the Presiding Officer remembers the \ncontroversy when General Motors and Chrysler faced bankruptcy and the \npossibility of literally going out of business. In my lifetime, other \ncar manufacturers have gone out of business. The President decided--and \nrightly so--that we could not afford to lose those jobs. So we \nengineered a loan with General Motors and Chrysler, premised on their \nchanging the way they did business.\n  Many critics said that was the wrong thing to do, the capitalist \npurists who were saying: No, no, these things happen. Companies go \naway, and new companies emerge; General Motors and Chrysler should be \nallowed to go gently into the night.\n  President Obama disagreed. Many of us disagreed. And he put a \ndownpayment on the future of the American automobile industry which has \npaid off handsomely. Just this last week, the major auto \nmanufacturers--Ford, Chrysler--announced recordbreaking profits. They \nhave restructured. They are selling a better product, they are doing it \nin a better way, and they are now competitive. The American people are \nbuying their products. General Motors has come back strong.\n  Just by way of comparison, I recently read that if you look at the \ntotal number of employees in certain companies, it gives you an idea of \nwhy some have more value overall to the economy than others. We all \nknow Facebook. We hear about it all the time. When somebody asks to \ntake my picture, I laughingly say: Do you promise you will put it on \nFacebook? And they laugh out loud because that is exactly what they are \ngoing to do, instantaneously. Facebook has about 3,000 employees in \nAmerica. We all know Google. We use it every day--I do--to find \ninformation and to access different sites. Google has about 30,000 \nemployees in the United States. How many employees are there in General \nMotors' direct employment? A hundred thousand.\n  When the President said that we need to invest in the automobile \nindustry, it was a decision based on the need for good-paying jobs \nright here in America. Well, I can tell you, when it comes to Chrysler, \nit was an investment that paid off for my home State of Illinois. This \nweek, Chrysler is announcing that it will be adding 1,600 manufacturing \njobs at its plant in Belvidere, IL. I was encouraged when I met with \nthe CEO of Chrysler and he said it is one of the most efficient and \ncost-productive plants in all of Chrysler Corporation, and it should be \nexpanded.\n  In November, Caterpillar, the largest exporter in my State, the \nlargest manufacturer, announced a $600 million investment in its plants \nin Decatur and Peoria, IL, and they are going to bring back hundreds of \njobs to our area.\n  American companies are beginning to realize that manufacturing \nproducts right here in the United States can be profitable again. That \nis good news for Illinois and good news for America. Manufacturing was \nthe backbone of the American economy for decades. We may never see it \nreturn to its heyday, but we should take steps to strengthen it.\n  In the State of the Union Address, President Obama laid out a number \nof key steps to boost manufacturing and ensure that more products have \nthese three key words: ``Made in America.''\n  The President's proposal builds on legislation that I introduced \npersonally in 2010 to reduce the tax benefits that companies can claim \nwhen they close factories here in the United States. Hard as it may be \nto believe, the Tax Code rewards and compensates those companies that \ndecide to close down manufacturing in the United States and move it \noverseas. The Tax Code currently allows companies moving operations \noverseas to the deduct their moving expenses and reduce their taxes in \nthe United States as a result. It is a direct subsidy to move a job \noverseas. It is just common sense that taxpayers should not be helping \ncompanies cover the cost of outsourcing jobs.\n  The President is also taking important steps to encourage \ninsourcing--when companies close operations overseas and move jobs back \nto the United States. Specifically, the President is calling for a 20-\npercent income tax credit for the expenses of moving operations back \ninto the United States to help companies bring jobs home.\n  He also proposed a new credit for investments that help finance \nprojects in communities that have suffered a major job loss event, and \nevery one of our States has one. It might be the steel mill in \nHennepin, IL, the tool manufacturers in Sterling-Rock Falls, the \nappliance factory in Galesburg, or the farm equipment factory in \nCanton, IL. Too many communities have suffered dramatic layoffs when \nplants have shut down over the last several decades. We have all seen \nthe stories. We have all met the people who have seen their lives \nchanged dramatically because of those decisions. Without new \ninvestment, many of these communities will continue to struggle.\n  The tide is starting to turn for American manufacturing, but we can \ndo more to make growth in that sector stronger and faster. We may never \nreturn to the forties and fifties, but there are some things we can do. \nOne of the things I found interesting as I visited these plants that \nwere trying to hire people in manufacturing was the obstacles they were \nrunning into.\n  We have a State with a lot of unemployment, over 8 percent. In some \nparts of the State, it is over 10 percent. You wonder how in the world \nwith so many people out of work there would be good-paying jobs \nunfilled. It turns out, I found, as I traveled around the State, those \nin manufacturing who want to hire new employees run into three \nobstacles.\n  The first obstacle is that people applying for a job don't have the \nskills necessary to work in manufacturing today. Those who have not \nseen it personally may not know what manufacturing looks like today. It \nis much different than the image of 30, 40 years ago. The plants \nthemselves are much cleaner operations, and most of them are computer \ndriven. Unlike the old days of steam and dirt in every direction, those \naren't the manufacturing plants of today, in many instances, across \nAmerica.\n  What they are looking for in applicants for industrial maintenance, \nfor example, which is a major area of need as baby boomers age out and \nretire--industrial maintenance requires that the applicant have more \nthan a passing knowledge of mathematics and computers. If they don't, \nfrankly, they are walking into an environment where they cannot be of \nmuch help.\n  In some areas--in Danville, for example--a local manufacturer is \nteaming up with the Danville Community College to take those who don't \npossess the right math and computer skills and train them at the \nexpense of the company so they can go to work. The same is true in my \nState over and over again. The community college links up with the \nmanufacturing concern and starts training employees so they will be \nready to fill the jobs, at the expense of the company.\n  The second obstacle is a psychological one which I hadn't thought \nabout. It turns out that many parents, when the son says they are \nhiring at such-and-such a business, will say: Wait a minute. I didn't \nwant you to grow up working in a factory like your dad. I wanted you to \nhave a job where you wear a coat and tie. Didn't you go to community \ncollege? You ought to do better than that. It turns out there is a \nprejudice against working in factories, even though, as I said, they \nare much different and the compensation is much better than some other \nalternatives. They are having open houses at many factories in Illinois \nso families and high school counselors can see what they look like and \nsee that they are not the image they might have in their mind.\n  The third obstacle is one that is very practical. Before an employer \nwould put an employee in charge of a multimillion-dollar, computer-\ndriven manufacturing process, they would want to make sure the employee \nis not only skilled but sober. That means drug tests. Many of these \nwould-be applicants for manufacturing jobs fail drug tests time and \nagain. Why? They have\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\ngrown up in a generation that says marijuana doesn't count, and they \nare wrong. Or they are engaged in other drugs. They just cannot expect \nto be taken seriously as a job applicant if they cannot pass a drug \ntest. They will not get through the front door.\n  Those three things--basic skill and training, attitudes of families \ntoward jobs in manufacturing, and the drug tests--have turned out to be \nthe three obstacles that have been raised time and again all across \nIllinois. But we can overcome each one of them, and we should. We can \nfill these jobs, good American jobs, with skilled set people who can \nproduce for this country for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S285-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S285-S286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITIZENS UNITED\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this year's political campaigns are \ndifferent than just 2 years ago. There is a dramatic infusion of money \nfrom so-called super PACs. Now we are starting to learn the identity of \nthose who were behind it. Just yesterday there were disclosures about \nsome of the contributors. Many of the names are familiar--the same very \nwealthy people who have, time and again, been engaged in our political \nprocess. The new approach, of course, is that there is no limitation in \nwhat they can spend. In addition, there is little disclosure on a \ntimely basis.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that. One of them is the Supreme Court \ndecision in Citizens United. It may be as flawed a decision as that \nCourt has ever made: to equate corporations and special interest groups \nwith average Americans when it comes to our political process and say \nspeech is money, money is speech, and say, basically, there are no \nrules or limits in terms of what a special interest group or a \ncorporation can spend in our political process.\n  I cannot think of a more corrupting influence. We know politics and \ncampaigns have become more expensive in this country every year. Those \nof us who are engaged in this business have, over our political \nlifetimes, seen a dramatic evolution in terms of how money is raised \nand spent. I can recall, in my first race in 1982 for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, raising and spending what was then almost a record \namount in a House race against an incumbent Congressman of $800,000. It \nwas a huge amount of money then, as I said, one of the most expensive \ncongressional races to date. I waited anxiously for a $25,000 check \nfrom the Democratic National Campaign Committee they had promised, but \nit never showed up. But $25,000 was a big deal.\n  Look where we are today. It is not unusual for candidates for \nCongress and the Senate to spend millions of dollars routinely in \nelecting and reelecting Members of the House of Representatives. On our \nside of the Rotunda just dramatically increase those numbers, and you \nwill see the basic political field we play on in political campaigns.\n  The Citizens United decision was a step in the wrong direction. It \nwasn't that long ago when two of our own--a Republican, John McCain, \nand a Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin--teamed up to end soft money \nin politics and to try to bring down the infusion of money from outside \ninterests. They took years to reach their goal. Finally, when they did, \nafter being challenged in court, they were picked away at over the \nyears, and now with Citizens United, they have been toppled completely. \nNow the field is wide open.\n  Whether we are talking about the need to reduce the deficit, reform \nthe Tax Code, create jobs, most everybody knows different parties have \ndifferent ideas. What many people don't know is that there are special \ninterest groups that have their own agenda and ideas on these and so \nmany other issues. It is just hard for Presidential candidates and \nMembers of Congress to navigate through or around the special interests \nthat have now become such an integral part of campaigns. The major \ndonors in the Citizen United decision are a major force in American \npolitics.\n  I believe the overwhelming majority of people serving in the House \nand Senate in both parties are honest and hard-working people. I \nbelieve they are guided by good intentions. We are nonetheless stuck in \na terrible, corrupting campaign financing system. That decision by the \nSupreme Court 2 years ago made our system so much worse that I think \nthe only thing that can save it--literally save it so our democracy is \nprotected--is a dramatic change.\n  After Citizens United, corporations and unions can spend as much \nmoney as they want to influence the Presidential race, as well as \ncongressional elections, and the Federal and State and local elections \nas well. In 2010, for the first time ever, spending on House and Senate \nraces exceeded $1.6 billion. Outside groups spent 335 percent more on \ncongressional campaigns than just 4 years earlier. Those numbers are \nstill like a drop in the bucket compared to this year, this election \ncycle. The super PAC money is being used, as we have seen in the \nRepublican Presidential primary, to fund negative, deceptive ads in \nsupport of candidates who are loosely, albeit not officially or \nformally, connected to those running super PACs.\n  I think of the situation with former Speaker of the House Gingrich. \nOne man and his wife have literally financed Gingrich's campaign in two \nStates, with $5 million contributions in each of those States, as I \nunderstand it. That, to me, is a corruption of the process. You can bet \nthat big business isn't going to be shy about engaging in the Citizens \nUnited strategy of spending money to influence the outcome of \nelections, and you can bet it will impact those of us who serve in the \nSenate and House. We know every single day as we vote, there is the \npotential for some special interest group out there deciding that is \nthe breaking point; that from that point forward they will do \neverything in their power to defeat us, and they can spend as much as \nthey want to get the job done. It is a humbling, sobering reality from \nthe Citizens United decision.\n  Well, there is an alternative. One is a resolution that has been \noffered by the Presiding Officer, which I am cosponsoring. That is a \nconstitutional amendment that would reverse Citizens United. We all \nknow how uphill that struggle will be, but at least we have staked out \na position to say we have to overturn this decision; we have to go back \nto the days of accountability and manageability when it comes to \nfinancing campaigns. I applaud the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, for his leadership on that issue.\n  There is another issue too, one that I think we should continue to \nbring up and discuss. It is called Fair Elections Now. The Fair \nElections Now Act is a bill that I have introduced in many Congresses. \nIt would dramatically change the way congressional campaigns are \nfunded. It would make super PACs irrelevant. The bill would allow \ncandidates to focus on the needs of the people they represent \nregardless of whether those people are wealthy or whether they donate \nto a super PAC, attend a fundraiser, or try to find special access to a \ncandidate.\n  Candidates in the fair election system would not need a penny from \nspecial interest lobbyists or corporations to run their campaigns. \nUnder this system, qualified candidates for Congress--and to qualify, \nthey would need to raise small contributions in volume in the State \nthey are running in--those qualified candidates would receive grants, \nmatching funds, and television broadcasting vouchers from the fair \nelections fund to help them run competitive campaigns. In return, \ncandidates who voluntarily participate in the fair election system \nwould agree to only accept campaign donations from small-dollar donors \nin their States.\n  We pay for the fund by asking businesses that earn more than $10 \nmillion a year in Federal contracts to pay a fee of one-half of 1 \npercent, with a maximum amount of $500,000 per year. That would fund \nit, and it would make certain that under the fair election system we \nwould have public financing and we would put it into this money chase \nthat I believe is not only corrupting our campaign system but could \nsomeday corrupt the very government we are proud of and represent as \nelected officials.\n  It is time to reform our system. I am afraid, as I said in one \ngathering recently, if you are a student of history, it takes a massive \nscandal or crisis to create a massive reform. I hope that doesn't \nhappen. I hope we have the good sense to move toward reform\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nwithout that happening. In the meantime, what is happening to our \npolitical system is not in the best interest of democracy.\n  If the average person who is not wealthy cannot even consider the \npossibility of being a candidate for Congress without the backing of \nhuge special interest groups or without their own personal wealth, then \nwe have lost something. A lot of us who got engaged in public life many \nyears ago might never have considered it under today's rules because it \nis so expensive and overwhelming. Any person who now steps up and says \nthey are ready to run for Congress or the Senate is introduced quickly \nto what is known as the ``Power Hour''--dialing for dollars. We sit \nthem down in a chair and they get on the phone and call this list and \nbeg every person they can reach for at least $2,300, $2,500. And they \nkeep calling until the Sun goes down, and they start again the next \nday.\n  There was a time when many of these candidates would not be sitting \ntalking to the wealthiest givers in America but would be out in their \nStates and districts talking to the people whose needs they ought to \nappreciate. That time has changed. We can change it back. We need to \nhave the support of the American public and the political will in both \npolitical parties to achieve it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It \nis hard to imagine why George Washington and Martha Washington would \never want to leave the place.\n  Touring the rooms, we could imagine what life must have been like \nthen. There are many things that impress any of us when we visit there.\n  One thing that especially impressed me was the fact that, despite the \nbeauty of the place and Washington's love for farming, he was gone from \nMount Vernon for 8\\1/2\\ years during the Revolutionary War. He never \nwent home; he was always in the war. Even when he was President of the \nUnited States for 8 years, he was only at Mount Vernon 10 times during \nthose 8 years; and after the Presidency, of course, he soon died. So he \ngave up quite a bit to be President of the United States.\n  There were other things that impressed me about our visit to Mount \nVernon. One was the reminder that our Revolution was a revolution \nagainst a King. George Washington, as commander in chief of the \nContinental Army, led a fight for independence from a King whom the \nsigners of the Declaration of Independence stated, had a ``History of \nrepeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the \nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.''\n  Those were our Revolutionary Founders talking. As President of the \nPhiladelphia Convention, George Washington presided over the writing of \nthe U.S. Constitution which emphasizes, if it emphasizes any one word, \nthe idea of ``liberty'' in creating the system of government we enjoy \ntoday.\n  Then there was another aspect to George Washington of which we were \nreminded which would be good for us to think about today and that was \nhis modesty and restraint.\n  George Washington must have had remarkable presence. He never had to \nsay very much, apparently, to command the attention and respect of his \ncountrymen. He likely could have been general of the Army as long as he \nwished and President of the United States as long as he wished, but he \nchose not to do that.\n  It was he who first asked to be called simply Mr. President, rather \nthan some grand title. It was Washington who gave up his commission \nwhen the war was over, and it was Washington who stepped down after two \nterms and went home to Mount Vernon. In fact, that aspect of his \ncharacter was imprinted upon the American character, that modesty and \nrestraint on the part of the executive branch and a recognition that \nour system depends absolutely on checks and balances.\n  I am struck by that attitude and the different attitude I see in the \nadministration of President Obama, which has shown disregard for those \nchecks and balances and the limits on Presidential power that our \nFounders and George Washington felt were so important.\n  This administration, over 3 years, has been arrogating more power to \nthe executive branch of government and upsetting the delicate balance, \nwhich the Founders created for the purpose of--what? For the purpose of \nguaranteeing to each of us as individuals the maximum amount of \nliberty.\n  I remember Senator Byrd saying time and time again that the purpose \nof the Senate, more than anything else, was a restraint upon the \ntyranny of the executive branch of government. That is our purpose as a \nSenate.\n  This President's Executive excesses were first illustrated by the \ncreation of more czars than the Romanovs had.\n  We have always had some so-called czars in the White House--the drug \nczar, for example. But now we have approximately three dozen of them. \nThese czars duplicate and dilute the responsibilities of Cabinet \nmembers; they make it harder for the Congress, us, to have a \nsupervisory role over exactly what they are doing. It is not only \nantidemocratic, it is a poor way to manage the government.\n  Equally disturbing to me has been this administration's use of \nregulation and litigation to bypass the Congress and the will of the \npeople when the Congress has a different point of view.\n  For example, this was the case with the National Labor Relations \nBoard and their decision in the Boeing case; which has now been \napparently resolved but which was an enormous--an enormous abuse of \npower, in my opinion.\n  Then the President is taking to blaming almost everyone for the \nproblems we see in our lives today: First, it was President Bush, then \nit was the banks, then it was business, then it was the insurance \ncompanies, then it was Wall Street, then it was 1 percent of us, and \nnow it is the Congress, which of course is in a government that is \nprimarily run by the President's own political party.\n  The President has taken to saying in his campaign speeches and his \nState of the Union Address the other day, ``If Congress won't act, I \nwill,'' and he has begun to show that is no idle threat.\n  Because now, on top of these other abuses, with his recent \nappointments to the National Labor Relations Board and the Director of \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to head a new and \nunaccountable agency, the president has undermined the checks and \nbalances that were placed in our Constitution and that George \nWashington so respected.\n  This Senate has always been the place--whether it was a Democratic \nSenate arguing about the appropriateness of President Bush using war \npowers, this Senate has always been the place that has insisted upon \nchecks and balances and the liberty of the people as guaranteed by \nthose checks and balances.\n  The President's recent actions have shown disregard for possibly the \nbest known and possibly most important role of the Senate and that is \nits power of advice and consent of executive and judicial nominations \nas outlined in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n  These actions, four appointments during a period of time when the \nSenate, in my opinion, was in session, fly in the face of the principle \nof separation of powers and the concepts of checks and balances against \nan imperial President.\n  Let's look for a moment at the history and precedents of recess \nappointments. The exact length required for a\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nrecess is not defined in the Constitution, but according to the \nCongressional Research Service ``it appears that no President, at least \nin the modern era, has made an intra-session recess appointment during \na recess of less than 10 days.''\n  Both parties have relied upon the adjournment clause in Article I of \nthe Constitution to argue that the absolute minimum recess period would \nconceivably be 3 days.\n  We can also look at the number of recess appointments made by recent \nPresidents. As of January 23 of this year, President Obama had made 32 \nrecess appointments, all to full-time positions. At the same point in \ntime in his first term, President Clinton had made nine recess \nappointments to full-time positions. President Bush, at about the same \ntime, had made 35.\n\n  So they all made recess appointments--appointments while the Senate \nwas in recess. That is provided for specifically in the Constitution as \nsomething the President could do. But President Clinton never did it \nwhen Congress was in session for less than 10 days. President Bush \nnever did it when Congress was in recess for shorter than 11 days. Now, \nunfortunately, President Obama has broken that precedent and made 4 \nappointments when we were in a period of less than 3 days.\n  Why is that important? In 2007, the current majority leader of the \nSenate, Harry Reid, decided the Senate did not want President Bush \nmaking recess appointments; that is, making appointments while the \nSenate wasn't in session. So the Senate refused at that time to enter \ninto prolonged recesses. They invented the idea of pro forma recesses \nevery 3 days. President Bush strenuously objected to that, but he \nrespected that. He respected the constitutional authority of the Senate \nunder article I, section 5 to determine when the Senate is in session.\n  On November 16, 2007, Senator Reid said: ``With the Thanksgiving \nbreak looming, the administration has informed me that they would make \nseveral recess appointments.''\n  Senator Reid didn't like the idea of recess appointments any more \nthan we do. So he said: ``As a result, I am keeping the Senate in pro \nforma to prevent recess appointments until we get back on track.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair and ask to be notified when I have \nconsumed 3 minutes more.\n  On November 16, 2007, Senator Reid said:\n\n       As a result, I am keeping the Senate in pro forma to \n     prevent recess appointments until we get this process back on \n     track.''\n\n  And on July, 28, 2008 he said: ``We don't need a vote to recess. We \nwill just be in pro forma session. We will tell the House to do the \nsame thing.''\n  The President is restricted, as Senator Reid indicated, by article I \nsection 5 of the Constitution, which states that ``neither House, \nduring the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the \nother, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than \nthat in which the two Houses shall be sitting.''\n  Last December when the House and Senate agreed to adjourn, the \nSpeaker--a Republican--and the majority leader here--a Democrat--agreed \nthe two Chambers would hold pro forma sessions for the express purpose \nof not going into recess. Yet the President went ahead and made his \nappointments. This is a dangerous trend. It is a dangerous trend.\n  The major issue before our country is the Obama economy. That is what \nwe will be talking about more than anything else in an election year. \nBut liberty is the defining aspect of our American character. If the \nPresident's current actions were to stand as a precedent, the Senate \nmay very well find that when it takes a break for lunch, when it comes \nback, the country has a new Supreme Court Justice.\n  Because we believe in the importance of that constitutional system, \nall of us on the Republican side insist on a full and complete debate \non this issue. We intend to take this issue to the American people. We \nwill file amicus curiae briefs in all of the appropriate courts and we \nwill take this issue to the most important court in the land and that \nis the court of the American people on election day.\n  I do not suggest that the President will find, or even should find, \nhis relationship with Congress to be easy or simple. George Washington \ndid not. President Washington once came up here to discuss a treaty \nwith Senators and became so angry that he said, and this is \nWashington's word, he'd be ``damned'' if he ever went there again.\n  The separation of powers does not mean an easy distribution of powers \nbut it is essential to the American character. We should remember that. \nA short trip to Mount Vernon would remind us of that. The President's \nrecess appointments not only show disregard for the Constitution, they \nshow disregard for every individual American who chooses liberty over \ntyranny, President over King.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S287-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S287-S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REPEAL THE CLASS ACT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to laud the \nactions of the House of Representatives which voted to repeal the CLASS \nlong-term care entitlement program that was created by the health care \nlaw. The vote yesterday in the House of Representatives was 267 in \nfavor of repeal. It was a bipartisan vote. It was a clear, I think, \nmessage that this is a piece of legislation that needs to be taken off \nthe books.\n  It was a disaster in the making from the very beginning. Many of us \ntried to predict that ultimately this program was destined to fail. The \nvote in the House of Representatives yesterday to repeal this insolvent \nprogram I hope will pave the way for the Senate to follow suit. My fear \nhas been all along that if we do not get this program off the books, at \nsome point there will be an attempt to resurrect it. That would be the \nabsolute worst outcome and worst scenario for the American taxpayer \nbecause this is a program that, even before it was voted on and added \nto the health care bill, was predicted would fail.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said it would run deficits in the \noutyears. The Actuary at the Health and Human Services Department \npredicted that this was a program that actuarially was unsound, could \nnot be viable in the long run. It was here in the last few months that \nfinally the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, \ncame out and said, ``I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS \nimplementation.''\n  That was a statement she made back in the middle of October. So even \nthe person who was tasked with implementing this program has now said \nthere is no viable path forward for CLASS.\n  We ought to get this off the books. It was, in fact, a pay-for in the \nhealth care bill. It was designed to help understate the cost of the \nhealth care bill. It front-end-loaded premiums, got revenue in the door \nearly, knowing full well that when the demands for payments came later \non that it was going to be upside down, and it was clearly a program \nthat I think, by any account, all who observed this process closely \nknew just flat out this would not work. But what was done--it obscured \nthe cost of the health care bill and helped it to sort of balance out \nbecause it was front-end loaded, saw revenues come in in the early \nyears before payments would have to go out in the outyears.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will take the action that was taken by the \nHouse of Representatives and end this once and for all. We have people \non both sides of the aisle who have come to that conclusion. There was \na lot of debate, even in the runup, the lead-up to the health care \nbill, about how this would not work. I offered an amendment during the \nhealth care debate to strip it. We had 10 Democrats at the time who \nvoted with me on that amendment. Many of them made statements regarding \nthis legislation and the implications if it were to pass. In fact, the \nSenator from North Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nsaid at the time that this is ``a Ponzi scheme of the first order, the \nkind of thing that Bernie Madoff would have been proud of.''\n  He vowed to block its inclusion in the Senate bill. It ended up in \nthe Senate bill and ended up in the overall bill, so to this day it is \nstill a part of the health care legislation but a part that needs to be \nstripped out if we are going to do what is in the best interests of\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nthe American taxpayer and not put yet another unfunded liability on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren.\n  We have a lot of bipartisan support for repealing it. There are a lot \nof people who have weighed in against this, who know it will not work. \nWe have an awful lot of outside interests as well who have observed, \nnow, that this is not something that is sustainable over time. In fact, \na lot of editorial pages around the country, newspapers have weighed in \non this. The Washington Post:\n\n     . . . a new gimmick that has been designed to pretend the \n     health reform is fully paid for.\n\n  That is something they said back when this was being debated.\n  The Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Known by the acronym CLASS, the long-term care insurance \n     program for nursing homes and the like was grafted onto the \n     health-care bill mostly to hide that bill's true costs.\n\n  It has been described as ``a budgetary time bomb.''\n  It seems to make perfect sense to me, and I hope to many of my \ncolleagues, that we take the steps necessary to get this program off \nthe books once and for all. In trying to justify this, there are people \nwho say we ought to keep it on the books in case we figure out a way to \ngo forward with it, to implement it. It does not work. It cannot work. \nThat has been known from the very outset.\n\n  I want to mention something else the Actuary, Rick Foster, said prior \nto it being voted on. He said:\n\n       Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe \n     that this program would collapse in short order and require \n     significant federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  I want to repeat that. This is from the person who studies the trends \nand makes sure, or tries to make sure, these programs are actuarially \nsound.\n\n       Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe \n     that this program would collapse in short order and require \n     significant federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  That was the warning that was issued way before the vote ever \noccurred on the CLASS Act.\n  He described it as `` . . . a classic `assessment spiral' or \n`insurance death spiral.' '' Those are words he used to describe this.\n\n       The program is intended to be ``actuarially'' sound but at \n     first glance this goal may be impossible.\n\n  These were all statements made by the Actuary.\n  Those of us who were here at the time and were concerned about this \nbeing included in the health care bill came to the floor and, as I \nsaid, I offered an amendment to strip it. It came close to getting the \nnecessary votes but unfortunately came short. It had broad bipartisan \nsupport but we recognized at the time this thing was destined to fail. \nNow we have all this, the studies that have been done since, that \nvalidate that by the objective third-party validators, if you will, by \nthe HHS Actuary.\n  It seems to me at least that the American taxpayers, the American \npeople deserve to know where their elected officials stand on the CLASS \nAct. Are they for keeping this unviable, insolvent, actuarially unsound \nprovision in the health care bill, which now even those who are tasked \nwith implementing it--the Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen \nSebelius--have said there is no viable path forward for its \nimplementation? Are we going to continue to keep this around? Or are we \ngoing to have a vote here in the Senate to put an end to this once and \nfor all?\n  I hope the majority leader, Senator Reid, will allow us to get this \nup for a vote. It has been passed in the House of Representatives. It \nis very clear based on not only all the actuarial evidence but all \nthose who have looked at it who are tasked with trying to put it into \npractice that it is not going to work. I hope before this goes any \nfurther we will get a vote here in the Senate that will echo what \nhappened in the House of Representatives and that we will do the right \nthing by the American taxpayer and get rid of a program that, if it \never is resurrected, if it ever is reincarnated in some form, would be \na terrible drain on American taxpayers, not only today but well into \nthe future, and represent yet another unfunded liability that we will \nput on the backs of our children and grandchildren. It is time to end \nthe CLASS Act once and for all.\n  I am going to continue to press for a vote on this and I hope \nMajority Leader Reid will allow us to get a vote on repeal of the CLASS \nAct so the American people do know exactly where their elected \nofficials stand and whether they are going to stand on the side of the \ntaxpayer, stand on the side of common sense, or stand on the side of \nusing this budgetary gimmick to understate the cost of the health care \nbill and perhaps at some point in the future put a plan in place that \nliterally is not going to work, is only going to continue to lead us on \nthe pathway to bankruptcy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think it is pretty clear at this \npoint that there is broad bipartisan support for legislation that \nprovides greater transparency in Congress. The more important question \nat this point is whether the executive branch is willing to play by the \nsame rules. I mean, I think a lot of people out there want to know why \na venture capitalist who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for \nthe President, only to end up overseeing the administration's green \nenergy loan program, should not be held to the same high standard as \nothers. Shouldn't the President's Chief of Staff be held to the same \nstandard as a legislative director to a freshman Senator?\n  Let's be honest, people are equally, if not more, concerned about the \nkind of cronyism they keep reading about over at the White House and \nwithin the executive branch agencies such as the Department of Energy \nthat it controls. There is no question that Congress should be held to \na high standard, but if we are going to pass new standards here, the \nsame standards should apply to the White House and to the executive \nagencies that spend hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money \nat the President's direction.\n  That leads to a larger point, which is this: As long as the White \nHouse and the agencies it controls continue to play favorites, this \neconomy will never fully recover and the playing field won't ever be \nlevel. As long as Washington has this much say over the direction of \nthe economy, people won't ever feel they are getting a fair shake. So, \nyes, let's hold Congress to a high standard, but the White House must \nbe held to the very same standard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the topic I wish to address is the CLASS \nAct repeal being taken up by the House. I understand the HHS Secretary \nhas indicated that from her point of view the CLASS Act will not work, \nand this is music to my ears.\n  During the Obama health care debate, one of the revenue raisers was \nthe CLASS Act wherein the Federal Government would be in the long-term \nhealth care insurance business and, supposedly, would collect premiums \nover a decade that would allow something like $80 billion in revenue \nthat\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nwould help pay for Obama health care. However, eventually we would have \nto honor the payments due to the people on the program.\n  Senator Conrad from North Dakota called the CLASS Act a Ponzi scheme \nof the first order because what we would be doing under the program is \ncollecting premiums for an insurance product and using the money to \nhelp pay for Obama health care. So when people are ready to get the \nservices they have paid for, there would be no money in the program to \npay them because it was used to offset Obama health care costs. It is \njust not a practical idea. The costs would explode over time. There \nwould be adverse selection. So it was an ill-conceived idea.\n\n  The House is going to repeal it. The HHS Secretary said they would \nnot implement the program. I hope the Senate will allow repeal so we \ncan take it off the table and it is a reason for the Congress to \nrevisit the Affordable Health Care Act, Obama health care, because one \nof the components of the legislation relied upon the revenue to be \ncollected by the CLASS Act to offset the cost of Obama health care, \ntrying to make it deficit neutral. That is no longer a viable option. \nThe money to be collected by the CLASS Act is never going to happen. So \nthat money cannot be used to make the legislation deficit neutral.\n  This is a chance for the Senate, working with the House, to repeal \nthe program. I think it would be wise for us all to sit down and try to \nreevaluate what does this mean in terms of the viability of the \nAffordable Health Care Act because the assumptions made by the CLASS \nAct are never going to come true.\n  I have been working with Senator Thune for a very long time to keep \nthis program from coming about. I would like to say this is a \nbipartisan moment, where we have stopped a program that would have a \ndevastating effect long term on the country's finances and would do \nvery little to improve health care.\n  I wish to, one, congratulate the HHS Secretary for understanding this \nprogram is unsound. I would like to make sure it is repealed, and I \nthink Congress should be the body to do that. But this is good news for \nthe taxpayer. It is good news for the country as a whole that we are \nnot going to allow a program to be created that is unsustainable, that \nis going to add to the debt and do very little to take care of our \nhealth care needs. It was a Ponzi scheme. It is a Ponzi scheme that \nneeds to be buried politically, as soon as possible.\n  I look forward to taking up the House-passed legislation. I hope we \ncan get bipartisan support in the Senate to make sure what HHS \nSecretary Sebelius said never happens, that the CLASS Act never becomes \nreality because it is an unsound, unwise, poorly constructed program, \nand this is a chance for the Senate to come together and do something \nabout it with our House colleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of tens of \nthousands of Delawareans affected by domestic violence each year, as \nwell as their families, their friends, and their allies across our \nState and our country.\n  Just a few minutes ago, my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee took up the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct. It has earned strong bipartisan support through the nearly two \ndecades since its original passage, and it was voted out earlier today.\n  Law enforcement agencies across this country are counting on us to \nmove forward with the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, \ndepending on the training and the resources to advocate for victims and \nto provide critical and lifesaving interventions that it funds.\n  As I asked for input from Delawareans in the last few weeks, one of \nthe hundreds who took the time to write or call my office in strong \nsupport of the reauthorization of VAWA was a former New Castle County \npolice officer. He e-mailed me to tell me he had seen firsthand that \ndedicated resources and innovative policing methods made possible by \nVAWA made a real difference in combating these types of crimes and \nimproving the lives of victims.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been extraordinarily effective, \nwith the annual incidence of domestic violence falling by more than 50 \npercent since it was first passed. Yet we still have so far to go.\n  Just this week, I heard from hundreds of constituents in Delaware for \nwhom this legislation has a deep and resounding importance. From young \nwomen in their twenties to senior citizens, Delawareans from all walks \nof life have reached out to ask us, as Members of the Senate, to take \naction without delay, to work with our colleagues in the House, and to \nreauthorize this most important bill.\n  Paul from Yorklyn, DE, wrote to say that as a father of two young \ndaughters, he worries that if the Violence Against Women Act is not \nreauthorized, then victims of sexual assault will once again be subject \nto two traumas--first, horrific attacks and, second, trying to pursue \njustice against their attackers.\n  Linda from New Castle, DE, had the courage to write me personally and \nsay:\n\n       First of all, I am a victim and I am not ashamed to say \n     that [today].\n\n  Linda's willingness to lift the cloud of fear and shame that for so \nlong enveloped victims of domestic and dating violence is brave and \nimportant in that she was able and willing to do that, but she also \nhighlights the ongoing challenges we face. She described her hesitation \nto discuss abuse out loud and stressed the importance of talking about \nthese crimes in the open in order to break what she called the \ngenerational curse.\n  As a son, as a husband, as a father, I too am deeply concerned about \nthis curse that has moved from generation to generation and has \naffected families all throughout this country's history.\n  Evils such as domestic violence thrive in darkness. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act is a spotlight, and it deserves to be strengthened \nand sustained by this Senate today and this year.\n  The Violence Against Women Act requires reauthorization every 5 \nyears. This signifies a belief that protecting victims of domestic and \ndating violence is so important that we must revisit it to make sure we \nare getting it right.\n\n  Each time we go through the process of reauthorizing this bill, we \nlearn more about what is needed. This time around, that process, I \nbelieve, has resulted in several critical enhancements; first, by \nbolstering the tools available to law enforcement. Along with my friend \nand colleague Senator Blunt, I cochair the Senate Law Enforcement \nCaucus. I am determined to ensure local agencies have the tools they \nneed to support victims and to prosecute abusers. This reauthorization \nwill do just that.\n  Second, our review made clear that perpetrators find their victims \nthroughout our society without regard for sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. So the reauthorization that was passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee just earlier today addresses that challenge by making this \nthe very first Federal grant program to explicitly state that grant \nrecipients cannot discriminate on the basis of a victim's status. \nWhether they are or are not a member of the LGBT community should be \nirrelevant to whether they are able to access the vital services funded \nby the VAWA.\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n  Finally, this reauthorization recognizes our current difficult fiscal \nsituation as a country and promotes accountability to make sure these \ndollars are well spent. It reduces authorization levels while \nprotecting the programs which have been most successful. This VAWA \nreauthorization merges 13 existing programs into 4 streamlined and \nconsolidated programs. This will prevent wasted time and effort and \nmake the application and administrative processes more efficient.\n  I am honored to be joined today by an old and dear friend, a former \ncountywide-elected official, Paulette Moore, now vice president of \npublic policy for the National Network to End Domestic Violence. I am \ngrateful to my dear friend Carol Post, who leads the Delaware Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence, and my friend Amy Barasch, a tireless \nadvocate in the ongoing efforts to bring to light the challenges of \ndomestic violence in the State of New York.\n  There are folks all across this country who turn to this task week in \nand week out. It is long and tiring and difficult work, but it is \nuplifting because it is part of making this a more just, more safe, and \nmore secure nation.\n  It is important for me to note that, unfortunately, some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle see the enhancements I just \nreferred to in this reauthorization as a reason to abandon their long-\nterm support for it, even though they have been strong backers of VAWA \nin the past. In fact, the vote we just took in the Judiciary Committee \nwas 10 to 8. It only narrowly passed. I hope our friends on the other \nside of the aisle will review the details of these changes one more \ntime and see their way clear to join us in this effort to strengthen \nand sustain the Violence Against Women Act. It is and should remain a \nbipartisan bill and a bipartisan effort.\n  My predecessor in this seat, our great Vice President, Joe Biden of \nDelaware, took an absolutely central leadership role in writing and \npassing the first Violence Against Women Act in one of the most \nenduring legacies of his 36-year Senate career, representing Delaware \nand advocating for women all over this country.\n  His efforts broke barriers and laid the groundwork for this current \nbill. But it is up to all of us to keep pushing tirelessly for Federal, \nState, and local governments to do more to save lives and to serve \nvictims.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together and promptly pass the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Thank you to the men \nand women of this country who work so hard to end this terrible scourge \nof domestic violence in our country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank \nSenator Collins, Senator Brown of Massachusetts, Senator Gillibrand, \nand a lot of others, who have worked to get us to this point where we \ncan do two things. Most important to those of us who have worked on the \nSTOCK Act is that we are now in a position this afternoon of adopting a \nclear statement that Members of Congress and our staffs are covered by \nanti-insider trading rules and that we can also provide for fuller \ndisclosure by Members, making it accessible to the public online.\n  Instead of coming to a point where the system broke down again and \nSenator Reid being forced to file a cloture motion, we worked out an \nagreement here, people were reasonable, and there will be votes on a \nnumber of germane amendments--and some that are not, but we have agreed \nto a 60-vote threshold.\n  This is the way I think the Senate is supposed to work. Some of these \nvotes will be controversial, some difficult. But that is why we are \nhere. I thank everybody who was part of getting to this point.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Brown, and \nI yield to him.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I also stand and commend \nthe majority leader for allowing this process to unfold in a thoughtful \nand fair manner, the way it should. We are starting the new year off \ncorrectly and allowing everybody to feel as if they are participating \nin the democratic process, not moving for cloture, shutting off debate, \nand filling the tree, but allowing us to stay late and work together in \na bipartisan manner to work through the amendments, allowing me and \nSenator Collins, and on their side, Senators Lieberman and Gillibrand, \nto call individual Members and say: You have four amendments up; which \nones do you want? Is there a modification or can we combine them with \nother similar amendments? That is how it should work.\n  This is what I have been saying for the last 2 years and why I have \ncontinuously moved to work across the aisle: to allow that democratic \nprocess to work.\n  I am thankful we are here. These are some tough votes, but we are the \nSenate. We should be taking tough votes. That is why the people sent us \nhere. I am thankful that we can send the message to the American people \nthat we are trying to reestablish that trust that seems to have been \nlost with them by moving on the STOCK Act.\n  There are other issues we are taking up. I hope they are just as \nthoughtful and methodical and respectful. I hope we are going to do the \npostal bill next. It is something Senators Lieberman, Collins, Carper, \nand I have spearheaded. It is a solid bill and a good framework. If we \nallow it to move forward and everybody has their say and their day in \nthe Sun, and we do as we have done today, we will have another good \ndeed and, who knows, maybe we will be in double figures in terms of the \napproval rating pretty soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today to speak against the Toomey \namendment that would impose a permanent ban on congressional \ninitiatives or earmarks.\n  The Constitution grants to the Congress the power of the purse. There \nis no authority more vital to the separation of powers than the one \nthat prevents the executive branch from directly spending the tax \ndollars collected from its citizens. Depriving the Congress of the \nability to direct money to specific projects does not save money or \nreduce the deficit; it simply gives additional power to the President \nand weakens the legislative branch.\n  As I stated when I announced the initial moratorium on appropriations \nearmarks last February, I continue to support the constitutional right \nof Members of Congress to direct investments to their States and \ndistricts under the fiscally responsible and transparent earmarking \nprocess we have established.\n  Hawaii is a long way from the Capital City. It is simply not possible \nfor a bureaucrat here in Washington to understand the needs of my home \nState as well as I do. And I believe such is the case with all 50 \nStates. Each one is unique, each one has individual challenges, and \neach one has issues that cannot be fully understood by civil servants \nlocated thousands of miles away.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with lowering the deficit. Let me \nstate that again. Eliminating earmarks will not save a single penny in \nspending. It will simply take decisions that were rightfully made by \nCongress and delegate them to the executive branch.\n  In truth, this is a political amendment meant to give cover to those \nwho seek to mislead the American people into thinking earmarks are \nresponsible for our current deficit, and that simply is not the case. \nOur deficit is driven by entitlement spending that is rising at a rate \nthree times that of inflation, not by discretionary spending that is \nnow capped at less than the rate of inflation. Our deficit is driven by \nthe fact that revenues are at their lowest level in 50 years. A \npermanent ban on earmarks addresses neither of these matters.\n  Madam President, finally, I note for my colleagues that the voluntary \nmoratorium in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2012 was 100 percent \nsuccessful, and the committee will continue the moratorium for fiscal \nyear 2013. Prior to the moratorium taking effect, the Appropriations \nCommittee had to put into place a series of reforms that ensured \nopenness and transparency for earmark requests. Every earmark request \nwas posted online. Every earmark that was approved was listed along \nwith the sponsor's name in committee reports and posted online. There \nwere no secrets and no backroom deals.\n  The reality is that without congressional earmarks, we find ourselves \nat the mercy of the bureaucrats to ensure that our local needs are \nfulfilled. If we approve this amendment, from now on earmarks will be \nat the sole discretion of the executive branch. Local needs will either \ngo unmet or will be included through deals made between our elected \nofficials and the White House or unelected bureaucrats. No longer will \nwe show the American people what earmarks we are funding and why. \nInstead, they will be part of a tradeoff between Members and \nbureaucrats--a bridge in return for support of a trade agreement.\n  By permanently banning earmarks, the spending decisions will move \nfrom the transparent process to discussions that are hidden from the \npublic. So we face a choice between an open and transparent method for \nallocating targeted funding or one that will be done with phone calls, \nconversations, winks,\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\nand nods. One method allows for accountability and another leaves us \nall at the whim of unelected bureaucrats.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Toomey amendment. This \namendment will serve to deprive the Congress of essential congressional \nprerogatives. It has no impact on the debt, and it is simply designed \nto give political cover to those who refuse to address the core drivers \nof our fiscal imbalance--lack of revenues and ever-increasing \nentitlement spending.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, on behalf of the Leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that any time spent in quorum calls be equally divided between \nthe two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending Toomey \namendment, an amendment that we will be voting on here after a little \nbit, amendment No. 1472, known as the Earmark Elimination Act.\n  I thank Senators Toomey and McCaskill for continuing this important \ndiscussion and commend them as well as numerous other Senators, \nincluding my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and Senators \nCoburn and DeMint, who have championed reforms to Washington's earmark \nculture. The concern, as noted by Senators Toomey and McCaskill, is \nthat the earmark process lacks transparency and scrutiny. I support \ntheir efforts to reform the process in a manner that reflects the \nprinciples of our Founders and the trust the American people instill in \nus to represent them.\n  I wish to confirm, however, that this effort does not restrict \nCongress's ability to protect the American taxpayer from unnecessary \nexpenses and significant legal exposure. In certain situations, the \nUnited States is required to fulfill legal obligations. For example, \nthe United States must resolve water rights claims that American Indian \ntribes assert against the United States and other water users within an \naffected State. In those instances, as is common in other litigation, \nit is in the interest of the United States and the American taxpayer to \nlimit ongoing legal exposure by settling the tribe's water rights \nclaims. Effectuating the terms of such a settlement requires \ncongressional review and approval. Congress will undoubtedly employ the \nsearching scrutiny required to understand whether the settlement is in \nthe best interests of the American people. Such settlements, however, \nare not amenable to a formula-driven or competitive award process. \nRather, the settlements must be addressed and negotiated if and when \nthe claims are asserted against the United States.\n  Congressionally enacted Indian water rights settlements have not \npreviously fallen within the earmark moratorium. In that vein, I want \nto confirm with my colleague from Pennsylvania that the Earmark \nElimination Act does not restrict Congress's authority to protect \ntaxpayers by limiting the exposure of the United States to similar \nlegal challenges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely \ncorrect. The Earmark Elimination Act is not intended to preclude \nCongress from effectuating legal settlements, such as Indian water \nrights settlements, that resolve claims against the United States. This \nbody must maintain its ability to avoid costly litigation and to limit \nthe legal exposure of the United States in a manner that ultimately \nbenefits American taxpayers.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I concur with my \ncolleague in expressing a commitment to ensuring that these positive \nefforts to reform the earmark process do not result in an unintended \nconsequence whereby Congress's efforts to settle legal claims against \nthe United States are subject to a point of order.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his efforts, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for as much \ntime as I consume and that at the conclusion of my remarks, the Senator \nfrom Ohio be recognized for such time as he consumes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1500\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we are going to have a number of votes \non amendments this afternoon. I think it is important that we look at \nthis in historic perspective. I am referring to the amendments and the \nmeaning of the Toomey amendment, which I think is very significant.\n  As most people think about earmarks, yes, we want to do away with \nthis. I am the first to admit that there has been a lot of abuse in the \nearmark process. I don't want to take sides between authorizers and \nappropriators, but I can remember several times here on the floor when \nappropriations bills are coming through, when people are legislating on \nappropriations bills, when they are swapping out deals. That is the \nkind of thing we want to stop. I think we have an opportunity to do \nthat today.\n  I have an amendment. It is my understanding, the way the amendments \nare stacked up, there is going to be a vote on the Toomey amendment and \nthen a vote on my amendment. Let me talk a little bit about how long we \nhave been working on this issue.\n  Way back in 2007, I gave a talk to the Grover Norquist group. It was \non July 25, 2007. I gave the Senate history of the 200-year fight \nbetween appropriators and authorizers.\n  In 1816 responsibilities between authorizing versus appropriating had \nbeen debated. In that year the Senate created the first 11 permanent \nstanding committees.\n  I think most people understand that we in the Senate, each one of us \nis on at least two standing committees. Many of these are authorizing \ncommittees or appropriating committees. Mine happened to be authorizing \ncommittees. My two major committees I have been on since serving in the \nSenate are the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. Both are authorizing committees.\n  What is significant about this is that there has always been a fight. \nThis is not a new fight. People think this is just going on today. This \nhas been going on literally since 1816.\n  In 1867 the Senate created the Appropriations Committee. The purpose \nof that was to have the tax writing put in the Finance Committee and \nthen have the appropriating committee as a separate committee--keeping \nthose functions divided. Here it is now a couple of hundred years later \nand we are still trying to do the same thing. Today may be the day we \ncan do it, and my amendment actually would do that.\n  In 1921--I am reading notes from the speech I made in 2007 at the \nGrover Norquist event--in 1921 the Senate passed the Budget and \nAccounting Act of 1921. The Senate tried to ensure that authorizing had \nto take place in a separate committee.\n  There we go. That is what we are talking about today. My amendment \nactually resolves the problem because it defines an earmark as an \nappropriation that hasn't been authorized. In a minute, I am going to \ntalk about that because there is a lot of support for that currently \nthat should be considered.\n  Let me use my committees as an example. If we were to do away with \nall earmarks as they are described in the House bill, the earmarks \nwould actually be defined as any appropriation or\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\nauthorization. That gets into the huge question we will talk about in a \nminute--what our Constitution says. It says we, the House and the \nSenate, should do the spending or the appropriating. This has been this \nway for a long time.\n  I am hoping Members will go back and read Joseph Story and some of \nthe great people in the past who have talked about why it is necessary \nfor all the authorizing and the spending to take place in this body, in \nthe Senate and in the House. If that does not happen, we are going to \nbe in a position where we are giving our function to the President. We \nare ceding our constitutional obligation to the President--in this \ncase, President Obama.\n  Back in the time I was making this speech initially, I talked about \nsuch things. I mentioned this on the floor yesterday. A lot of people \ndo not understand. The budget that comes to us is a budget from the \nPresident. It is not from Congress, not from the House, not from the \nSenate, not from the Democrats, not from the Republicans, it is from \nthe President. The President is the guy who sends the budget down. I am \nso critical of this President because every one of these budgets now--\nwe have just gotten the fourth budget--has a deficit of over $1 \ntrillion. Unheard of. I can remember back in the days--1996 was the \nfirst $1.5 trillion budget. That was during the Clinton administration. \nI remember coming down to the floor and saying: We cannot sustain this \nlevel of spending. That was $1.5 trillion to run the entire United \nStates of America. What President Obama has sent down is $1 trillion to \n$1.5 trillion in each of his budgets, just deficit alone. We can't \ncontinue to do that.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee. It is an authorizing committee. \nIt is a committee staffed with experts in every area--missile defense, \nstrike fighters--all of that having to do with defending America. Of \ncourse, when the budget comes down, historically--I am talking about \nhistorically from 100 years ago--we have taken that budget and analyzed \nthat budget. The Chair is fully aware of this because she sits on that \ncommittee. We determine what is the best way to spend the given number \nof dollars that come down in the budget to best defend America.\n\n  The example I used yesterday was in one of the first budgets that \ncame down. I think it was the first budget from President Obama. It had \none item that was a $330 million item that was for a launching system \nthat was referred to as a box of rockets--a good system, I might add, \nbut with the scarce dollars we made a determination in the Armed \nServices Committee that we could take that same $300 million and \ninstead of spending it on a launching system, spend it on six new F-18 \nstrike fighter aircraft. And we did that. That is what we should be \nable to do. But if you have an earmark ban, then you would not be able \nto do that. It depends on how it is going to be interpreted, but the \nway I interpret it, it would mean we cannot change what the President \nsends down because that would be called a congressional earmark. Some \nmight argue and say: No, it is that only if it happens to be in your \ndistrict or something like that. That is not what it says, though. The \nway it is defined is anything that would be an authorization or an \nappropriation.\n  So we had the example there in the Armed Services Committee, and one \nof the unintended consequences would be--I will just use this as an \nexample. I can remember back in the days, I am old enough to remember \nback when Reagan was President and nobody believed we would ever have a \nproblem with people sending over a missile with some type of a weapon \non it that would be very destructive to America, nor did they believe \nit would be possible, if a missile were coming in, that we could knock \ndown that missile. Well, we have now settled that. Everyone knows you \ncan hit a bullet with a bullet. We have done it before. We are doing a \ngood job.\n  We also know after having gone through 9/11 that we should have at \nthe very top of our concern as representatives of this country to \ndefend America and to have an enhanced system. So we had a policy that \nwe wanted to have a redundancy in all three phases of missile defense. \nIn missile defense, you have three phases--a boost phase, a midcourse \nphase, and a terminal phase--and we want to have that. So when we are \naddressing that, if the President comes in with something that doesn't \nfollow that redundancy, we could be in a position where we would not be \nable to do what is in the best interests of the country.\n  I am not the only one who believes that when we say we want an \noutright ban on all spending--and that is what we are saying, an \noutright ban on all spending--there is an article that I took out of \nthe Hill Magazine--that would have been about 3 or 4 years ago--saying \n``Lobbyists Hitting Up Agencies As Earmark Rate Drops.'' In other \nwords, as we quit spending here, it does not save a cent. That money \ngoes back into the bureaucracy, and they are spending it at that point. \nSo that puts us in the position of, admittedly, what they are talking \nabout--they are actually lobbying the bureaucrats as opposed to Members \nbecause that is where all the power is. In other words, we have ceded \nthat power.\n  I can see a lot of the Democrats wanting to pass an all-out ban on \ncongressional earmarks because they are supporting Obama. Obama wants \nto do the spending. They want him to do that. I understand that, and I \nheard from some of the Democrats who do not agree with that, and I \nappreciate their making that statement on the floor.\n  But I think as we address this and go back to things that we did on \nthe floor a year and a half ago--this was November 2010--we talked \nabout the Constitution and how it restricts spending only to the \nlegislative branch and specifically denies that honor to the President.\n\n       We take an oath of office--\n\n  I am reading now from a statement I made on the floor a year and a \nhalf ago.\n\n       We take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution of the \n     United States. That means that we take an oath of office to \n     uphold article I section 9 of the Constitution.\n\n  What does that say? That says that the spending in our government \nshould be confined to the legislative branch. That is us. If you go and \nlook in the Federalist Papers, it talks about this. Over and over, \njudges without exception have reinforced this as the constitutional \nobligation we have.\n  Sometimes I miss Senator Bob Byrd more than other times, and this is \none of the times I do. I can hear him standing on the floor saying: Why \nis it we are giving up our constitutional right? Remember he used to \ncarry around the Constitution? He would hold it up. I wish he were here \ntoday so he could talk about article I, section 9 of the Constitution \nand how we are ceding that authority to the President.\n  I mentioned yesterday that one of the problems I have with a \npermanent moratorium without a definition of what an earmark is--one of \nthe problems we have in giving the President, ceding our authority to \nhim--and there is no better example--a lot of us got quite upset in \nthis body when the President had his $800 billion-or-so stimulus plan. \nRemember the stimulus plan that didn't stimulate and he spent all this \nmoney? And when he signed it, he was talking about how this was going \nto stimulate. As it turned out, only 3 percent went into roads, \nhighways, and so forth, and only 3 percent into defending America. When \nhe signed it, President Obama said: What I am signing then is a \nbalanced law with a mix of tax cuts and investments. It has been put \ntogether without earmarks or the usual porkbarrel spending. So, anyway, \nwe had such examples of earmarks.\n\n  In fact, I remember on Sean Hannity's program, he had the 102 most \negregious earmarks. In those earmarks was $219,000 to study the hookup \nand behavior of female college co-eds in New York; $1 million to do \nfossil research; $1.2 million to build an underpass for deer crossing \nin Wyoming. There were 102 egregious earmarks and not one of them was a \ncongressional earmark. They are all bureaucratic earmarks. We ceded \nthat so the President, through our action, was able to do all those \nthings he could not otherwise do.\n  I have a longer list that I ask to be made a part of the Record at \nthis point in my presentation, which includes about 10 or 15 other \negregious earmarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n  Fifteen Earmarks From Hannity's List of 102 Most Egregious Earmarks\n\n       1. $219,000 to a university to study the hookup behavior of \n     female college coeds in New York.\n       2. $8,408 to a university to study whether mice become \n     disoriented when they consume alcohol.\n       3. $712,883 to develop ``machine generated humor'' in \n     Illinois.\n       4. $325,394 to study the mating decisions of Cactus bugs in \n     Florida.\n       5. $500,000 to Ohio to purchase recycling bins with \n     microchips embedded inside of them.\n       6. $800,000 to a company in Arizona to install motion \n     sensor light switches.\n       7. $25,000 for socially conscious puppet shows in \n     Minnesota.\n       8. $1 million to research fossils in Argentina.\n       9. $500,000 to study the impact of global warming on wild \n     flowers in a Colorado ghost town.\n       10. $150,000 to develop the next generation football globes \n     in Pennsylvania.\n       11. $1.2 million to build a deer underpass in Wyoming.\n       12. $50,000 to resurface a tennis court in Montana.\n       13. $15,000 for a storytelling festival in Utah.\n       14. $14,675 for doormats at the Department of the Army in \n     Texas.\n       15. $10,000 for the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. As it turned out, the President was the one who did the \nearmarks of the $800 billion stimulus program.\n  Again, getting back to article I, section 9:\n\n       No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\n\n  The law, that is us. We are the legislative branch of government. \nThat is what we are supposed to do. I think everyone understands that. \nIt is unintended, and I know a lot of people out there would say, well, \nwe want to kill all earmarks, without stopping to think that that is \nall spending and that is our constitutional duty.\n  I would say if we continue on making permanent and current \nmoratoriums on congressional earmarks, then we are limiting our ability \nto govern with the President. If all we are doing is handing the \nPresident pots of money and requiring that he have competitive grants \nto disburse the funds, then we are washing our hands of the outcome. \nThere is no light or transparency inherent to the Federal grant-making \nprocess. So what we are doing is giving up our constitutional \nresponsibility in ceding that to the President.\n  It could be that things are going to be refined, with further \ndefinitions, and I have no objection to that. But I am saying we have \none very simple solution to it. When the votes come up today, I will \nannounce right now, if we don't have a definition of earmark, then I \nwould vote against a permanent moratorium on earmarks because that is \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  My amendment is a little bit different, because what I do is define \nwhat an earmark is, and an earmark is defined as an appropriation that \nhas not been authorized. I was very proud--2 days ago Senator Toomey \nsaid that some earmarks ought to be funded, but they ought to be funded \nin a transparent and honest way subject to evaluation by an authorizing \ncommittee. That is exactly what my amendment does. I talked to Senator \nToomey, and I appreciate the fact that he is very open about this. I \nwill repeat that: Some things ought to be funded, but they should be \nfunded in a transparent and honest way subject to evaluation by an \nauthorization committee. That is my amendment. A definition of an \nearmark is spending or appropriating without authorizing.\n  Last year Senator Coburn said: ``It is not wrong to go through an \nauthorization process where your colleagues can actually see it. It is \nwrong to hide something in a bill . . . .'' Amen. I agree with that. I \nsaid earlier, and I said yesterday, I can remember Democrats and \nRepublicans on consideration of appropriations bills sitting on the \nfloor, swapping out deals, making deals back and forth. That is what we \nwant to do something about, and this is not a partisan thing. This is \nsomething that has been going on, and we have a way now of doing it.\n  Senator McCain was kind enough to endorse a freestanding bill I had \nthat does the very thing of defining an earmark as an appropriation \nthat has not been authorized. Senator McCain said: Some earmarks are \nworthy. If they are worthy, then they should be authorized. Authorized, \nthere is the key, and Senator McCain is exactly right. If you authorize \nit, then that is the process we want. When an earmark is considered by \nan authorization committee before it is appropriated, real transparency \nis brought to the process.\n  In fact, I remember it was Senator Coburn who said on the floor--and \nthis is about a year and a half ago--he agreed with me and said one \ngood thing about requiring an authorization before an appropriation is \nthat then if it is a bad one, we have two chances to kill it. Senator \nCoburn is right. We can kill it in the authorization phase or we can \nkill it in the appropriations phase.\n  The example I use is a good example in terms of what we and the Armed \nServices Committee should be doing and are not doing. But I would say \nto you that this afternoon when we have these votes--it is my \nunderstanding we are going to have around 20 votes. A lot of these will \nbe voice voted, I am sure. But the two votes I am concerned about are, \nNo. 1, the vote on the Toomey bill, which I support, but I support it \nif you can define it and make real transparency set in by having the \nauthorization process in place.\n  I would only say that we go back to the Constitution. As I mentioned, \nlet's go back to the statements that were made by Senator Toomey, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Coburn, that we want transparency and we \ndon't want to cede the power of our constitutional duty as Members of \nthe Senate to the executive branch. I know some in here would probably \nwant to do that. Some are stronger supporters of Obama than I am. I am \nvery critical of what Obama has done in terms of the deficits, which we \nhave already talked about, in terms of what he is doing to the \nmilitary. Some trillion dollars over a period of 10 years would be \ntaken out of our military. When you add his budget to the \nsequestration, that is something that should not happen.\n  With energy, right now the President is going around talking about \nhow he is for developing energy in this country, and yet he is the \nobstacle to the development. He is the one who has in his budget the \nvarious things that make it very difficult, if not impossible, to get \nour resources that we have out there in oil and gas.\n  In fact, it is kind of humorous and very clever of the President. \nLast week during his State of the Union message the President was \ntalking about wanting to exploit all of our natural gas when he slipped \nin a little phrase that hardly anyone heard. I know Senator Boxer heard \nit because she was next to me, and we disagree on this whole issue. He \nsaid: We want to go after this type of formation, all the shale that is \nout there, but we don't want to poison the ground at the same time. \nWell, what he is talking about there is hydraulic fracturing. If you \ntake away hydraulic fracturing, as he is trying to do, and put that in \nthe hands of the Federal Government, then you might as well say goodbye \nto all these types of formations, oil and gas. We would not be able to \ndo it. So I am critical of him in that respect.\n\n  In the fourth area, in addition to what he is doing to the military, \nthe deficit spending, and energy in this country is regulations. I am \nthe ranking member of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, \nwith all of these MACT programs--that is MACT, maximum achievable \ncontrol technology. He is trying to do away with emission requirements \nwhere there is no technology to get into that type of requirement. So \nit is very expensive.\n  The other thing he is trying to do--and I know this is the most \ncontroversial issue among liberals and conservatives--and that is we \nwere able to successfully stop this whole global warming cap-and-trade \nlegislation that has been out there ever since we refused to ratify \nKyoto. It was made very clear that there is one thing nobody argues \nwith--we know it is true--if you were to have legislation for cap and \ntrade, the cost would be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. \nWe know that is true. That has come from the MIT, it has come from the \nCRA, and it has come from the Wharton School. That is the range they \ntalk about. However, now this President is trying to do by regulation \nwhat we have voted down in legislation.\n  Right now in this body of 100 Senators, there are at the very most 25\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nMembers of the Senate who would vote for cap and trade, and yet he is \ntrying to do that through regulation. I have to say that would be the \nlargest amount of money in terms--that would probably exceed the \nobligations we have to pay back even the deficits he has had. We will \ntalk more about that later, but the issue right now is the two votes \nthat are coming up.\n  I would encourage us to vote for my amendment, which would define an \nearmark as an appropriation that has not been authorized. I have read \nto you quotes from virtually everyone in here who would agree with \nthat, except for those individuals who want to cede this power to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I understand under unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Ohio would be the next speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, at the conclusion of my remarks, \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank Senator Inhofe for the sensible nature of \nhis words in terms of the difference between a Presidential and a \ncongressional earmark. I think the Senator brought good sense to this, \nand I appreciate his words.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1481\n\n  Madam President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1481, cosponsored \nby Senator Merkley, our amendment to the STOCK Act. I thank Senator \nGillibrand for her good work on managing this legislation.\n  USA Today had an editorial from Tuesday that said:\n\n       If lawmakers were really concerned with ethics, they'd put \n     their equity holdings in blind trusts, so they wouldn't have \n     the obvious conflict of interest that comes from setting the \n     rules for the companies they own.\n       Banking committee members wouldn't invest in financial \n     institutions, Armed Services Committee members wouldn't \n     invest in defense contracts, and energy committee members \n     wouldn't invest in oil companies.\n\n  How simple is that? How straightforward is that? How right is that? \nThese stories simply don't reflect well on the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Most of us think these investments don't affect our \ndecisions here, and they probably don't, but isn't it time we held \nourselves to a higher standard?\n  Senator Merkley and I are proposing the Putting the People's \nInterests First Act as an amendment to the STOCK Act. It would require \nSenators and their senior staff who are subject to financial \ndisclosure--no more than two or three or four of our staff people in \neach office; the most well paid, those in the highest ranking decision-\nmaking position--to sell individual stocks that create conflicts or to \nput their investments in blind trusts or to invest in only widely held \nmutual funds.\n  No one is required to avoid equities. We could still invest in broad-\nbased mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. You can keep your \nownership interest in your family farm or small business. I will repeat \nthat: In no way does this affect your ownership in your family farm or \nsmall business. If you are setting up a blind trust, you can instruct \nthe trustee to hold onto your stock in your family company. This rule \nwould be similar to steps that have already been taken to address \nfinancial conflicts of interest or at least the appearance of financial \nconflicts.\n  Senate Ethics rule 37.7 requires committee staff making more than \n$25,000 per year--way more strict than our amendment in that way--``to \ndivest himself [or herself] of any substantial holdings which may be \ndirectly affected by the actions of the committee for which he works.''\n  The Armed Services Committee requires staff and spouses and \ndependents to divest themselves of stock in companies doing business \nwith the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. The \ncommittee does permit the use of blind trusts.\n  When asked about a requirement to divest, former Defense Secretary \nWilliam Perry said:\n\n       That was very painful, but I do not disagree with the \n     importance of doing this. The potential of corruption is very \n     high. It keeps our government clean.\n\n  In the executive branch, Federal rules and Federal criminal law \ngenerally prohibit employees, their spouses, and their children from \nowning stock in companies they regulate. All Senator Merkley and I are \nsaying is that Members of the Senate should hold themselves to the same \nstandard we already require of much of our committee staff and \nexecutive branch employees. Our staff's requirements are more severe \nthan ours, and we are the ones whose names are on the ballot, we are \nthe ones who are sworn in to do the bidding of the American people. We \nare the 100 people in this so-called exclusive club and yet we are \ngoing to have different rules for us than we do for a $30,000-a-year \nstaff person? That hardly seems right.\n  Some argue that selling all of our stock will make us lose touch with \nthe rest of society. That kind of thinking falls on deaf ears for most \nAmericans. The ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee \ndoesn't invest in stocks. Instead he invests in State and local bonds \nwith a small amount directed into mutual funds. When asked, Congressman \nFrank of Massachusetts said: ``I get a steady 4.5 percent, and I help \nmy state in the process. I'm a patriot, and I'm making money too.''\n  Why should Members of the Senate who own stock in oil companies vote \non issues that affect the oil industry? Why should Members of the \nSenate who might own stock in a pharmaceutical company vote on issues \nthat affect health care, on a generic drug bill or on a biologics bill \nor on Medicare or Medicaid? Appearances matter. Right now the American \npeople don't trust that we are acting in the Nation's best interest far \ntoo many times. Investing in broadly held funds or a blind trust will \nkeep us in touch with society. It is not a retreat from the U.S. \neconomy. Instead it will keep us from picking winners and losers. It \nwill show the public that our focus is on policies that will help grow \nthe economy. Again, I am not accusing any of my colleagues, if they own \nan oil stock, of voting for more tax breaks for the oil industry. I am \nnot saying they do that; I am saying there is the appearance that some \nof them might do it.\n\n  We need to remember that public service is a privilege. Folks around \nWashington are already paid well in these jobs. There is no reason they \nneed to be buying and selling stocks in small or multimillion-dollar \nportfolios.\n  When asked about the fact that Senate Armed Services Committee \nconflict-of-interest rules apply only to staff and Department of \nDefense appointees--but not to Senators--again, when asked about the \nfact that the Senate Armed Services Committee conflict-of-interest \nrules apply to staff people--and, again, not necessarily highly paid \nstaff--and Department of Defense appointees, President Bush's Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, Gordon England, said: ``I think Congress should \nabide by the same rules we impose on other people.''\n  No kidding. Really.\n  In a State of the Union Message, the President said: ``Let's limit \nany elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.''\n  As we cast votes, we all--the 100 Members of the Senate--have an \nimpact on all kinds of industries every day, on all our economies.\n  I agree with Under Secretary England. I agree with President Obama. I \nagree with Senator Merkley as we offer this amendment. It is simple and \ndirect. The public should expect nothing less from us.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1493 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I speak on the amendment, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside to call up my amendment \nNo. 1493 and make that the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1493.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Wall Street Journal recently \nreported that political intelligence is an approximately $100 million \nindustry. The article also says that expert networks employ over 2,000 \npeople to do political intelligence in Washington, DC.\n  We have to say approximately because no one truly knows how many \npeople work in this industry. We don't know from whom they seek \ninformation, what happens to that information, and how much they get \npaid. This is a problem if one believes in transparency in government \nand if one believes in the purposes behind this legislation, as I do--\nthe underlying legislation--that Members of the Senate and Congress \nshould not benefit from insider trading information.\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\n  So we have people in this city or people who come into this city to \nget information on what Congress might do or what their regulators \nmight do that might affect the stock in some company or something, and \nthis political intelligence information is gathered and given to people \nwho presumably profit from it or I guess these people wouldn't be \nemployed in the first place. So there is a growing unregulated industry \nwith no transparency. If a lobbyist has to register in order to \nadvocate for a school or a church or a private corporation, shouldn't \nthe same lobbyist have to register if he or she is seeking and getting \ninside information that ends up in making people a profit? This is \nespecially true if that information would make millions for a hedge \nfund or a private equity firm.\n  We have current law. Under current law, this is not the case. We have \nno registration of these people and we don't know who they are. So we \ngo back to amendment No. 1493. My amendment merely brings sunlight to \nthis unregulated area. It defines what a political intelligence \nlobbyist is and requires that person or firm to register. In other \nwords, it requires them to do what, under the 1995 law, every lobbyist \nhas to do.\n  I understand some would say there have not been hearings on this \nsubject and that it should be studied first. But there isn't much that \nis complicated about this amendment. It is pretty simple. If a person \nseeks information from Congress in order to make money, the American \npeople have a right to know the name of that person and who that person \nis selling that information to. That is just pretty basic good \ngovernment, isn't it? It is the same as if a person is a lobbyist for a \npiece of legislation under laws going back to 1946 and amended since \nthen, they have to register. The public has a right to know who the \nlobbyist is, whom they are working for, and what they are lobbying for \nor against.\n  This amendment isn't just helpful to the American people, though. It \nisn't just helpful to make people responsible, because the more \ntransparency we have the more accountability there is and the more \nopenness we have in government the better off we are. So I make a case \nto help the American people, yes. But it is also going to help Members \nof Congress and our staff who are trying to decipher their duties under \nthis proposed legislation.\n  Senators have raised the question: How will we know if the people we \nspeak to trade on what we say? So to answer that question, we require \nthe people doing it to be responsible. So we achieve more transparency \nin government, and we even help Members of Congress and our staff \nbecause these political intelligence people are pretty smart. They know \nwhere to get the information because they come to us and ask questions, \nbut we might not know why they are asking the questions. So it is going \nto help Members of Congress and our staff as well. By requiring \nlobbyists who sell information to stock traders to register, Members \nand staff then have an easy way to track who these people are and to \nwhom they would sell their information. This strengthens the bill, from \nmy point of view, and helps Members and staff comply with its \nrequirements.\n  So I hope we can pass this amendment soon and bring light and \ntransparency to this growing industry and, when we are talking to \nsomeone, know who they are, what they seek, whom they are working for, \net cetera.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1491\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise again today to speak on behalf of \nfairness. We have heard quite a bit from the President on the campaign \ntrail about fairness. But it appears there is no interest in fairness \nwhen it comes to transparency for the executive branch.\n  The bill we are currently debating in the Senate will subject \nCongress to additional reporting requirements for certain financial \ntransactions. The goal is to ensure that Members of Congress and \ncongressional staff are not using their unique access to confidential \ninformation for personal gain. That goal is worthy.\n  I believe this is an appropriate goal, and one I fully support. I do \nnot understand, however, why the additional reporting requirements do \nnot extend to members of the executive branch who arguably have even \ngreater access to such confidential information than Members of \nCongress and their staffs do.\n  It only seems fair that executive branch officials, who are already \nrequired to file annual financial reports, as we are, also be directed \nto meet the same additional reporting requirements being imposed on the \nlegislative branch.\n  I have yet to hear a compelling argument against equity between the \nbranches. Some people have argued that the executive branch has other \nways to deal with insider trading. Think about it. But none of those \nwill subject executive branch employees to the same public scrutiny as \nthis legislation would. I believe what is good for the goose, it seems \nto me, should be good for the gander. We have heard that all of our \nlife.\n  I understand there is a willingness on the other side to expand the \nreporting requirements, but it would fall far short of parity.\n  Some have said here it would cost too much. But if we are willing to \nexpand the population of executive branch officials required to report \npublicly, then any further expansion will only present marginal \nadditional costs.\n  Currently, less than 1 percent of the executive branch workforce is \nrequired to file financial disclosure statements. The other 99 percent \nare not. My parity amendment will not expand that universe. It will \nonly require them to meet the same reporting standards that will apply \nto the Congress itself.\n  As I understand it, the Democratic alternative to my amendment would \nproduce some bizarre results. For example, a Senate office \nadministrator who meets the reporting threshold would be required to \nreport publicly as directed in this bill, but the head of enforcement \nat the Securities and Exchange Commission would not. That is bizarre. A \nSenate scheduler may have to make additional public disclosures, but \nthe General Counsel of the Federal Reserve would not. This is not fair, \nand I believe it is unacceptable.\n  My amendment simply says if you are an executive branch or \nindependent agency official and you currently file financial disclosure \nreports, you will have to comply with the same public reporting \nrequirements contained in this bill that we plan to impose on the \nCongress.\n  My amendment also contains the same military personnel exemption that \nthe Democratic alternative does, as well as the same 2-year \nimplementation provision.\n  My amendment is simple, fair, and deserves the support of every \nMember of this body. If my friends on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve in fairness, this would be a very good way to show it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we here in the Senate are so close \nto doing something so basic, so common sense to begin restoring the \nfaith and trust the American people have with this institution. I am \nencouraged that we have found more to agree on today than that which we \ndisagree on, so we can bring this bill on the floor to a vote.\n  I thank Leader Reid for his extraordinary perseverance and leadership \non this issue. I also thank Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member \nCollins for their vision and their hard work in bringing this strong \npiece of legislation to the floor. I also thank Senator Scott Brown and \nour other cosponsors who have worked so hard to do what is right for \nthe American people. And, of course, I thank my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have worked with us in good faith to bring this \nlegislation to fruition.\n  We have tried to focus on the specific task at hand, and that is \nclosing loopholes to ensure that Members of Congress play by the exact \nsame rules as every other American. While there are some amendments \ntoday that will not meet that test, there are others that will make \nthis bill stronger, and I believe the final product will have teeth.\n  This sorely needed bill would establish for the first time a clear \nfiduciary responsibility to the people we serve--removing any doubt \nthat both the SEC and the CFTC are empowered to investigate and \nprosecute cases involving insider trading of securities from nonpublic \ninformation that we have access to when we do our jobs.\n  We are entrusted with a profound responsibility to the American \npeople: to look out for their best interests, not to do what is in our \nfinancial interest. Let's show the people who have sent us here that we \nas a body can come together and do the right thing.\n  Today, we are taking a step forward to show them we are worthy of \ntheir trust. I encourage all of my colleagues to take this step with us \ntoday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, in 6 or 7 minutes the Senate will \nbegin a series of votes on the matter before us, the STOCK Act. I want \nto take a few moments to restate the underlying\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nmain purpose of the legislation, which is to respond to the public \nconcern, informed by testimony before our committee from experts on \nsecurities law, that it is not totally clear that Members of Congress \nand our staffs are covered by anti-insider trading laws enforced by the \nSEC. The No. 1 accomplishment of this proposal will be to make that \ncrystal clear.\n  We are not exempt from that law; we should not be exempt. I presume \nmost Members of Congress have assumed we have never been exempt. But \nthis will make it clear if anybody crosses the line, they cannot defend \nthemselves by saying that Members of Congress are not covered by the \nlaw.\n  We have also added in committee a couple of provisions which embrace \nthe old but still important notion that sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant in government by requiring that the annual financial \ndisclosure reports we file will now be filed electronically and will \ntherefore be available on the Internet. Right now, these are public \ndocuments. When they are filed in the Office of the Secretary of the \nSenate, people have to go there and make copies of them to see them. As \nSenator Begich, our colleague from Alaska, said: That is not easy if \nyou are an Alaskan. This will bring that system up to date.\n  The third part--which I know is controversial for some, but I think \nit is sensible--is to require that within 30 days of any stock trades, \ndisclosure forms must be filed with the Senate and also online. I can \ntell you that the Securities and Exchange Commission has made clear in \ntestimony before the House committee and in discussions with our staff \nthat that kind of periodic requirement for disclosure of trades in \nstock and securities will help them do the job we want them to do to \nmake sure that insider trading laws are not being violated and, of \ncourse, will keep the public, our constituents, informed of what we are \nabout.\n  A number of amendments are up. As Senator Reid said, I hope we don't \nhave rollcall votes on all of them. I think a number of them will \nreceive unanimous support on both sides. I hope we can adopt them by \nvoice.\n  There is one amendment, Senator Shelby's amendment No. 1491, to \nwhich, as part of the agreement, I filed a side-by-side, as it were. I \nsupport the goal that Senator Shelby has of holding the executive \nbranch accountable in ways similar to the way we are; that is, the \namendment, generally speaking, would extend the 30-day reporting \nrequirement, disclosure requirement, to a very large number of \nexecutive branch employees. That, to me, is the problem. It is too \nbroad. It would create a cost and an unnecessary reporting system for \nmany executive branch employees.\n  I want to point out here that when it comes to avoiding and \npreventing conflicts of interest, the executive branch is probably well \nahead of the legislative branch. The ethics rules requirement and \nguidance put forward over the years by the Office of Government Ethics \nat the agencies are extensive and address a wide range of potential \nconflicts of interest and/or improprieties. They have teeth, criminal \nsanctions.\n  For instance, high-level executive branch employees already file \nfinancial disclosure forms that face a very extensive system of agency \nreview. These agency officials and career civil servants are often \nforced to divest themselves of their stock holdings if they seem to be \nin conflict with their responsibilities or to recuse themselves, not to \nbe involved in matters in order to minimize potential conflicts of \ninterest. That is a much different standard than we impose on \nourselves, which is the standard of disclosure.\n  I have introduced a version of Senator Shelby's amendment, which I \nthink achieves his goal in a significant way but not so broadly. Rather \nthan the tens of thousands of people encompassed in the Shelby \namendment, mine is targeted at policymakers most equivalent to those of \nus in Congress and those who work with us; that is, positions in our \ngovernment that are Senate-confirmed and also certain high-level White \nHouse and agency staff who might not be Senate-confirmed but are \npolicymakers. These individuals are public officials with visible high-\nprofile roles, and the extra scrutiny that comes with increased \nreporting requirements seems to be more appropriate for this group--\nincluding the President, Vice President, appointees in the White House, \nthe so-called policy czars, special assistants to the President, as \nwell as members of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  I hope we can take this significant step to achieve what Senator \nShelby had in mind, but not, if I can put it this way, overdo it in a \nway that will actually, according to comments we have had from people \nin the executive branch, get in the way of the existing very tough \nethics rules they live under now.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, let me commend the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Lieberman. As always, it has been a great \npleasure to work with him to produce this bill. I also wish to commend \nthe author of the bill, Senator Scott Brown, who was the first to \nintroduce this legislation in the Senate, and also praise the work of \nthe Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, for her contributions.\n  The STOCK Act is intended to affirm that Members of Congress are not \nexempt from our laws prohibiting insider trading. There are disputes \namong the experts about whether this legislation is necessary, but we \nfeel we should send a very strong message to the American public that \nwe understand Members of Congress are not exempt from insider trading \nlaws, and that is exactly what this bill does.\n  We need to reassure a skeptical public that we understand elective \noffice is a place for public service, not for private gain. \nUnderscoring that important message is clearly the purpose of this \nbill, and that is why I support it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 1478, 1477, 1474, 1476, 1490, 1492, and 1503 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the following \namendments are withdrawn:\n  Amendment No. 1478, amendment No. 1477, amendment No. 1474, amendment \nNo. 1476, amendment No. 1490, amendment No. 1492, and amendment No. \n1503.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1482\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 1482, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this is a highly technical amendment. \nIt simply says the GAO report, required by the underlying bill on the \nquestion of political intelligence, be sent not only to the Committee \non Government Oversight in the House but also to the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  If there is no objection, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I \ndon't believe there is any opposition and, therefore, no need for a \nrollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1482.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1484\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Paul amendment, No. \n1484. There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, on this amendment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. This \namendment would strike the underlying bill and would replace it with an \naffirmation that we are not exempt from insider trading and that each \nSenator would sign a statement each year affirming they did not \nparticipate in insider trading.\n  I think this is the way to go. I think the American people want to be \nsure we are not exempt. I think this is a good way to do it without \ncreating a bureaucracy and a nightmare that may well have many \nunintended consequences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I respectfully oppose the amendment. It \nwould, as the Senator from Kentucky, with his characteristic directness \nsaid, strike the entire bill. The affirmation by Members they have not \nviolated insider trading laws is, in my opinion, not enough. In the \nopinion of the SEC, it is not enough because it doesn't establish the \nduty of trust this underlying bill does that is required to guarantee \ncharges against a Member of Congress or staff on insider trading\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nwill not be successfully defended against on the argument that Members \nare not covered.\n  I yield the rest of my time to my friend from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I too am opposed to the amendment offered \nby Senator Paul. I do think the idea of a certification is a good one, \nbut, unfortunately, Senator Paul's amendment would strike the \nprovisions of the bill that affirm the duty we have to the American \npeople and that scholars who testified before the committee said was \nnecessary.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1487\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n1487, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul. This amendment is \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment would say that those in the \nexecutive branch who decide loans and grants, if they have a self-\ninterest in the company or if their family has a self-interest in the \ncompany, they should not be making decisions awarding grants and \nawarding loans. I think the idea that you should not make money off of \ngovernment is an important one, but it is not just Congress that this \nshould apply to; this should apply to the executive branch. We should \nnot have hundreds of millions of dollars in loans--even billions of \ndollars in loans--dispensed by people who used to work for that company \nor whose family still works for the company.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This is one of a series of amendments in which our \ncolleagues are applying ethics rules to the executive branch although \nthe bill, of course, is focused on Members of Congress. In this case, \nthis applies probably the harshest penalty that has ever been applied \nto members of the executive branch. The fact is, executive branch \nemployees are already subject to an effective, in some ways broader \nethics regime than we face now. It is backed up by criminal sanctions. \nAs an example, executive branch employees file financial disclosure \nforms. Agency ethics officials who examine them can compel divestiture \nof holdings. They can require the individual to recuse himself from \ncertain matters and, if recusal is not sufficient, the agency can \nreassign the individual.\n  In this case, Senator Paul would say that an executive branch \nemployee is forbidden from holding a position in which they or their \nfamily have any financial interest of $5,000 or more, so I oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

Mr. President, this is a side-by-side with an \namendment offered by my friend from Alabama. The question is, How many \nemployees of the executive branch of government should be required to \nelectronically file their disclosure statements? I believe, \nrespectfully, Senator Shelby's amendment requires maybe more than \n300,000 Federal employees, including many who filed confidential \ndisclosure statements.\n  This amendment would include people in the Federal executive branch \nwho hold positions equivalent to those of us in Congress who are \npolicymakers, and that includes the President, the Vice President, \nappointees in the White House, members of the Federal Reserve Board, \nand Senior Executive Service. It is the difference between applying \nthis requirement to 2,000 executive employees or more than 300,000 \nFederal employees.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). There is no time remaining.\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, the Lieberman amendment is a side-by-\nside with the Shelby amendment. This Lieberman amendment would create \nloopholes, disparity, and it undermines the true transparency. I \nencourage my colleagues to oppose it.\n  On the other hand, my amendment would be a side-by-side, and it \ncreates parity, fairness, and true transparency. Without transparency \nthe American people will be left in the dark. Also, the Senator from \nConnecticut is talking about who would have to file these. It will be \nthe same people who have to file disclosures now. Why should they be \nexempt? My amendment would make it a level playing field. It makes a \nlot of sense. It is fair, it is honest, and the executive branch should \nnot be excluded for any reason I can think of.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1491, as modified, offered by the Senator from Alabama, \nMr. Shelby.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, I wish to commend Senator Paul \nand Senator Shelby for raising the issue of extending these \nrequirements to the executive branch. I agree with them. I supported \nthe amendment offered by Senator Lieberman, but I also encourage my \ncolleagues to support the amendment offered by Senator Shelby. It would \ntake in the independent regulatory agencies, and it goes a little bit \ndeeper into the executive branch. So I think both principles are \ncorrect--that the kind of disclosures we are going to be required to \nmake should also apply to high-level executive branch employees.\n  I thank both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Alabama \nfor their leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Maine. She is urging people to vote yea on the Shelby amendment. I \nappreciate that. It is a good amendment, and I will do the same thing: \nVote yea.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I respectfully ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  As I indicated in support of the side-by-side I offered, executive \nbranch employees are now under very tough ethics regulations requiring, \nin many cases, divestiture or recusal, and this adds a good requirement \nwhich is for some of them to file electronically the disclosure \nstatements they have to make. But the amendment we just passed--mine--\nwould add that requirement to 2,000 of the top-level policymakers in \nour Federal Government. Senator Shelby's amendment would extend that to \nmore than 300,000 Federal employees, including some, by our count in \nthe Office of Government Ethics, drivers and secretaries.\n  In addition to the burden it would place on them unduly, we are \nasking agencies to stretch personnel and resources to fulfill a totally \nnew requirement when, in fact, we want them to save money and not \nfigure out ways to spend more money.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Shelby \namendment No. 1491, as modified.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Enzi amendment No. 1510.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this is a very good amendment that \nSenator Enzi has offered. It recognizes the fact that we do not control \ntrades that happen within mutual funds. Thus, there is not a need for \nreporting every 30 days; rather, we should keep the annual reporting \nrequirement.\n  It has been cleared by both sides. I do not believe it requires a \nrollcall vote. I would suggest that we vitiate any rollcall vote that \nwas suggested and adopt it by a voice vote, with the concurrence of the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this is a good amendment. I support \nit.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Enzi, I call up \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TRANSACTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The transaction reporting requirements established by \n     section 101(j) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as \n     added by section 6 of this Act, shall not be construed to \n     apply to a widely held investment fund (whether such fund is \n     a mutual fund, regulated investment company, pension or \n     deferred compensation plan, or other investment fund), if--\n       (1)(A) the fund is publicly traded; or\n       (B) the assets of the fund are widely diversified; and\n       (2) the reporting individual neither exercises control over \n     nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial \n     interests held by the fund.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1498\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Blumenthal amendment No. 1498.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I would like to take a \nmoment to commend Senator Blumenthal and Senator Kirk. As you all know, \nSenator Kirk is battling to come back with us. As a gesture and also \nbecause it is a good-government measure, this particular amendment, No. \n1498, extends the number and types of felonies for which Members of \nCongress and executive branch employees or an elected State or local \ngovernment official can lose his or her pension. This is a good-\ngovernment amendment and an appropriate way to honor our colleague, \nSenator Kirk, whom we wish a speedy recovery.\n  I ask to have the yeas and nays by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to join in acknowledging \nSenator Kirk's contribution to this amendment. The reason I have \noffered it is very simply to send a message and have the effect that no \ncorrupt elected official, no official convicted of a felony in \nconnection with his official duties as a Member of Congress should \nreceive one dime of taxpayer money. And that breach of law should have \nconsequences.\n  I join in asking for a voice vote.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nto vitiate the 60-vote threshold on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I move to reconsider the \nvote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to lay that motion upon the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Toomey amendment No. 1472.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise in support of my amendment. I \nwish to thank Senator McCaskill for cosponsoring this amendment and for \nher support on this ban on earmarks.\n  What this amendment does is it would codify the current moratorium \nthat is in place. I commend the majority Senators for extending that \nmoratorium, but let's just codify this now, put this in place, and end \nthis process that lacks any transparency. This is a surgical point of \norder that would not be held against the entire bill but, rather, just \nthe specific earmark.\n  Unlike the next amendment, which would allow earmarks on \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nbills and would permit, for instance, earmarking of the ``bridge to \nnowhere'' and would only forbid earmarks on appropriations bills, this \nwould be a ban on earmarks of all kinds.\n  Some suggest that we would be ceding our constitutional control of \nthe purse strings. This is clearly not true. Most of all government \nspending is not earmarked. Most discretionary spending is not \nearmarked. That doesn't mean we have ceded our authority to the \nexecutive branch. The fact is, we define the terms and the rules under \nwhich the spending can occur. That is appropriate, but it ought to \nhappen under scrutiny and should be subject to full review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this amendment does not save any money. \nIt does not reduce the deficit. It simply gives additional power to the \nPresident and thereby weakens the legislative branch.\n  The reality is that without these earmarks, we find ourselves at the \nmercy of bureaucrats to ensure that our local needs are fulfilled. No \none in this Chamber believes that a bureaucrat here in Washington knows \nbetter or understands the needs of their home State as well as they do.\n  So I say again, Madam President, the voluntary moratorium is now 100 \npercent successful. It will continue in fiscal year 2013.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Toomey amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of Senator Toomey's amendment to permanently ban the use of \nearmarks in Congress. The underlying bill, the STOCK Act, was designed \nto end a corrupt practice in Congress. I fully support that goal. But \nif we are serious about ending corruption in Congress, then we must \nbegin by permanently banning earmarks. It is my belief that these two \nissues go hand and hand.\n  One of the most blatant examples of the corruption that stems from \nearmarking is the case of former U.S. Representative Randy Cunningham \nwho now sits in a Federal penitentiary today for selling earmarks. \nAmong the $2.4 million in bribes Cunningham admitted receiving were the \nsale of his house at an inflated price, the free use of a yacht, a used \nRolls-Royce, antique furniture, Persian rugs, jewelry, and a $2,000 \ncontribution for his daughter's college graduation party. In return, he \nearmarked untold millions of dollars and pressured the Department of \nDefense to award contracts to his co-conspirators.\n  Year after year I have been coming to the Senate floor to speak out \nagainst the corrupt practice of Congressional earmarking and I have \nbeen joined by many of my colleagues such as Senators Coburn and \nMcCaskill. Even President Obama called for a ban on earmarks in last \nyear's State of the Union speech. The time has come to end this \npractice once and for all, permanently.\n  Let me be clear, both Republicans and Democrats have been guilty of \nwasting valuable taxpayer dollars on these pet projects. And as the \nmoratorium on earmarking expires at the end of this year, we must move \nforward with a permanent ban to protect the American taxpayer.\n  Let me remind my colleagues about our current fiscal situation. Our \nNational debt now stands at over $15 trillion and our deficit stands at \n$1.3 trillion. In fact, this is the fourth year in a row with deficits \nover a trillion dollars. Unemployment in our country stands at 8.5 \npercent and according to CBO, unemployment is expected to remain above \n8 percent until 2015. Given these dismal economic numbers, are we \nprepared to tell the American people that we want to go back to the \ncorrupt practice of earmarking and spend their hard-earned tax dollars \non pork barrel projects that have little purpose other than to improve \nthe re-election prospects of their authors?\n  Some of my colleagues are ``happy'' with their earmarking pasts and \nhave justified carrying on the practice by saying that they only \naccount for a small percentage of our annual budget. That may be the \ncase--but is that really reason enough to continue a practice that \nbreeds corruption? I am very aware that earmarks consume a very small \npercentage of a budget measured in the trillions. But given the serious \nproblems confronting American families, many of whom wake up every \nmorning wondering if they will lose their job or their house, it is \nappalling that Congress will not stir itself to relinquish any of its \nself-serving prerogatives in solidarity with the people we serve, who \nhave had to tighten their own budgets, change their spending habits and \nrestrain their ambitions. It is all the more offensive given that we \nhave had in recent times all the evidence we should require to \nunderstand that earmarks are so closely tied to acts of official \ncorruption.\n  In a report titled ``Why Earmarks Matter'' The Heritage Foundation \nwrote:\n\n       They Invite Corruption: Congress does have a proper role in \n     determining the rules, eligibility and benefit criteria for \n     federal grant programs. However, allowing lawmakers to select \n     exactly who receives government grants invites corruption. \n     Instead of entering a competitive application process within \n     a federal agency, grant-seekers now often have to hire a \n     lobbyist to win the earmark auction. Encouraged by lobbyists \n     who saw a growth industry in the making, local governments \n     have become hooked on the earmark process for funding \n     improvement projects.\n       They Encourage Spending: While there may not be a causal \n     relationship between the two, the number of earmarks approved \n     each year tracks closely with growth in Federal spending.\n       They Distort Priorities: Many earmarks do not add new \n     spending by themselves, but instead redirect funds already \n     slated to be spent through competitive grant programs or by \n     states into specific projects favored by an individual \n     member. So, for example, if a member of the Nevada delegation \n     succeeded in getting a $2 million earmark to build a bicycle \n     trail in Elko in 2005, then that $2 million would be taken \n     out of the $254 million allocated to the Nevada Department of \n     Transportation (DOT) for that year. So if Nevada had wanted \n     to spend that money fixing a highway in rapidly expanding Las \n     Vegas, thanks to the earmark, they would now be out of luck.\n\n  If we want to show the American public that we are really serious \nabout preventing corruption in Congress than we owe it to the American \npeople to completely ban all earmarks in Congress. Senator Toomey's \namendment proposes to do just that and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport his amendment.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wanted to inquire, is there any time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object. I withdraw that \nreservation.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, if the \nSenator will grant 1 minute on his amendment, then I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, I appreciate the \nopportunity to be heard.\n  I agree with what the author, Senator Toomey, is trying to do in \nterms of what most people think of as an earmark. The problem is this: \nYou can vote for this if you are voting for and are against all \nearmarks as it is defined. It depends on how you do it. In the House, \nit is defined, under their rules, and it has been defined here as any \ntype of appropriation or authorization. I would suggest to you, if you \nget the Constitution and look up article I, section 9, it says that is \nwhat we are supposed to be doing here.\n  So if I knew that my next amendment would pass, which defines an \nearmark as an appropriation that has not been authorized, which I know \nSenator Toomey and several others agree would be a good idea, then I \nwould be wholeheartedly in support of this. So obviously we should have \nhad that vote first. So I would vote against this even though I agree \nwith what they are trying to do. But my next amendment is going to be \nthe one that is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided, with 1 minute controlled by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Toomey, on amendment No. 1500, offered \nby the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe. This amendment is also \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have the utmost respect for Senator \nToomey and what he is trying to do. To me, this amendment is compatible \nwith what he is trying to do. It merely defines an earmark as an \nappropriation that has not been authorized.\n  My junior Senator said on the Senate floor a year ago that, in a way \nthat is good, because if a bad earmark comes up, we have two shots at \nit--one on authorization and one on appropriation. Senator Toomey, \nSenator McCain, and others have been supportive of the idea that we \nshould go back to authorizing.\n  We have been fighting this battle since 1816, and it is time we end \nit. This is a way of doing it, merely defining it as an earmark that \nhasn't been authorized. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I point out that the Constitution \ndoesn't make a distinction between an authorizing committee and an \nappropriating committee. I don't think we ought to be having the \ndiscussion and argument over who gets the earmark and who doesn't. It \nis the process that is flawed. It is the process that doesn't have the \nkind of scrutiny and the transparency and is not subject to competition \nthe way it ought to be before taxpayer dollars are spent. So my \nobjection is to this process wherever this occurs in the Senate or the \nHouse.\n  While I respect the intentions of my colleague from Oklahoma, I \ndisagree with him. I suggest a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I further say that after the stimulus \nbill, all of the 102 most egregious votes last year--or earmarks, not \none was a congressional earmark. They were all bureaucratic earmarks. \nIf we don't do our constitutional job under article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution, the President will be doing our job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, am I correct that amendment No. 1483, the \nLeahy-Cornyn amendment, is next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n                          Sections 205 and 211\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and Senator Cornyn have \nintroduced a rather substantial amendment to the STOCK Act that would \nstrengthen the tools that prosecutors and investigators use to detect \nand prosecute corruption by public officials. I would like to ask my \ncolleagues a few clarifying questions about how their amendment \nachieves this laudable goal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We would be happy to answer the Senator's questions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My first question refers to section 205 of your amendment, \ncovering bribery and graft. What is the purpose of including the phrase \n``former public official''? How is it possible to bribe a former public \nofficial?\n  Mr. LEAHY. You cannot bribe a former public official, at least not \nunder the terms of this amendment. Section 205 does ensure that when a \npublic official accepts a bribe in return for taking an official act, \nthe official cannot escape liability by leaving public service before \nthe bribe is received or discovered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under section 205, an ``official act'' can refer to any \nmatter which may ``at any time be pending.'' What prevents this \ndefinition from being overbroad and covering matters that a former \npublic official, for example, never anticipated would be pending?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The former public official must accept the bribe or \ngratuity ``for or because of'' the official act. If the public official \ndoes not know that a matter is pending, the public official cannot \naccept a bribe ``for or because'' of it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 205 also refers to an official's ``place of trust \nand profit.'' What is a ``place of trust and profit''?\n  Mr. LEAHY. This phrase is in the current bribery and gratuities \nstatute and has been part of the law for decades. Our amendment does \nnot change its definition or the scope of its use. It appears in \nsection 205 because of the way that the amendment is drafted, and it is \ninterpreted consistent with the extensive body of case law on \ncorruption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague. Turning to section 211 of your \namendment, the ``Prohibition on Undisclosed Self-Dealing By Public \nOfficials,'' what is purpose of codifying this prohibition?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Without this codification, there is no Federal law \nprohibiting certain public officials from acting in their own financial \ninterest, at the expense of the public, and in violation of existing \nState and local law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why is it necessary to make it a Federal crime for a local \nofficial to engage in undisclosed self-dealing?\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is an area where there is a particular Federal \ninterest because if the corrupt official is in State or local law \nenforcement, there may be no other way to ferret out the corruption. In \nfact, in Skilling v. United States, the Supreme Court invited Congress \nto criminalize undisclosed self-dealing in the specific and narrowly \ntailored way we do today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does this amendment create the potential for arbitrary or \npolitically motivated prosecutions of local officials?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, it does not. Criminal liability only attaches when the \npublic official acts with fraudulent intent and does so in knowing \nviolation of existing rules and regulations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why isn't there a magnitude requirement for the financial \ninterest underlying undisclosed self-dealing? If one just reads this \nsection, it appears as though even a trivial, attenuated financial \nbenefit could lead to a violation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. A trivial, attenuated financial benefit could not lead to \nthis violation because the public official must still act knowingly and \nwith fraudulent intent to receive the benefit, and they must do so in \nviolation of existing law. For example, if State ethics rules do not \nrequire disclosure of financial interests below a certain threshold, \nthen undisclosed self-dealing--even with fraudulent intent--below that \nthreshold could not be charged under this statute. Moreover, the \namendment requires the public official to act for the purpose of \nbenefiting a financial interest.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Suppose a local official has not disclosed, as required by \na local ordinance, that he owns a home in a targeted improvement \ndistrict in his county. Then this official votes to install street \nlights in his town, which lowers crime, improves commerce, and \nconsequently increases the value of his and other homes. Has he \ncommitted a Federal offense?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, the local official has not committed a Federal offense \nin the hypothetical you describe. Criminal liability under Federal law \nonly exists if the official knowingly fails to disclose the interest \nand further intentionally acts to benefit that financial interest and \ndoes so with the fraudulent intent required of the mail and wire fraud \nstatute. In the hypothetical you describe, there is no fraud and \ntherefore no criminal activity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague for his helpful explanation. There is \none more issue I would like to discuss. Section 211 of your amendment \nincludes a definition of ``material information.'' I want to be \nabsolutely clear that this definition is specific to section 211 and is \nin no way intended to provide any meaning to the phrase ``material \ninformation'' as used elsewhere in the STOCK Act or anywhere else in \nlaw.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator Cornyn and I worked hard to ensure that our \namendment addresses the issue of undisclosed self-dealing in a narrow \nand precise manner. To make sure there are no ambiguities in the \nupdated honest services statute our amendment creates, we carefully \ndefined the term ``material information'' and made sure we did so in \nsuch a way that our definition would apply only to the precise section \nof the Criminal Code where the new undisclosed self-dealing provision \nwill appear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One question that has arisen is whether the definition of \n``material information'' in the new Criminal Code section your \namendment creates is intended to or could affect other parts of the \nSTOCK Act since the same term also appears in a very different context \nin other parts of the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Our definition will have no effect on the term ``material \ninformation'' as it appears in other parts of the STOCK Act because it \nis drafted to apply only to the new Criminal Code provision and not to \nother criminal laws or the Federal securities laws. On page 12, line 11 \nof amendment 1483, it says ``definitions--as used in this section:'' \nand then provides a set of definitions which includes ``material \ninformation.'' That provision very clearly applies the definition only \nto that new Criminal Code section, not to the rest of title 18, to the \nremainder of the STOCK Act, or to Federal securities law. In fact, this \nlanguage was drawn from S. 401, the Leahy-Cornyn Public Corruption \nProsecutions Improvement Act, and it is the legislative history of that \nbill and not that of the STOCK Act, that will apply when our amendment \nis interpreted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that clarification. In addition to \nthe precise wording of amendment 1483 and clear congressional intent \nthat the phrase used in the new Criminal Code section not be imported \nto Federal securities law, the definition actually used in your \namendment has no applicability or relevance to the materiality \nconsiderations that arise in insider trading cases.\n  I ask Senator Cornyn, does he agree with Senator Leahy regarding our \ndiscussion of the amendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank both of my colleagues for working with me to \naddress my questions about the Leahy-Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about \namendment No. 1483 to the STOCK Act. While we all oppose public \ncorruption and recognize the need for tough laws in this area, I \nbelieve this amendment may blur the line between innocent behavior and \ncriminal public corruption offenses. This amendment expands the Federal \ncriminal gratuities statute to cover the gift of anything of value, \nover $1,000, that is given to a public official simply because of their \nstatus as a public official. A unanimous Supreme Court in United States \nv. Sun-Diamond Growers of California interpreted the honest services \nlaw to require the government to actually prove a link between the \nthing of value given and the specific act. The Court said the thing of \nvalue must be given ``for or because\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nof'' an official act. I am concerned that expanding the crime to \ninclude items given merely on the basis of the public official's status \ngoes too far and criminalizes some legitimate conduct.\n  However, my primary concern with this amendment is the section that \ngives the Federal Government the authority to interpret, prosecute, and \nenforce State and local laws. I believe this provision violates the \nbasic principles of federalism embodied in our Constitution. Amendment \nNo. 1483 expands the definition of ``scheme or artifice to defraud'' in \nFederal criminal law to include the ``undisclosed self-dealing'' of an \n``officer, employee, or elected or appointed representative, or person \nacting for or on behalf of the United States, a State, or a subdivision \nof a State, or any department, agency or branch of government.'' The \namendment defines ``undisclosed self-dealing'' as an official act that \nfurthers or benefits a financial interest of the official or certain \nfamily members and associates of the official. Undisclosed self-dealing \nalso occurs when the official knowingly falsifies, conceals, or covers \nup material information that is required to be disclosed by any \nFederal, State, or local statute, rule, regulation, or charter or the \nknowing failure to disclose material information in a manner that is \nrequired by a Federal, State, or local statute, rule, regulation, or \ncharter. Thus, this provision makes it a Federal crime for a State or \nlocal official to fail to comply with a State or local law, including \nthe mere filing requirements of State or locality. This provision gives \nthe Federal Government the power to enforce State and local laws.\n  I do not believe our Founders intended for Federal prosecutors to be \nable to bring Federal criminal cases against State or local officials \nbased on that official allegedly breaking or failing to comply with a \nState or local law, and the Founders did not intend for Federal judges \nand Federal courts to be interpreting the State or local laws, expect \nin limited circumstances. Corruption of State and local officials is a \nserious problem, but it is not the Federal Government's problem to \nsolve. For these other reasons, I oppose this amendment in its current \nform.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Leahy-Cornyn amendment is drawn from \nour Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act. Our bill has been \nsupported by the United States Department of Justice in a March 2009 \nletter, and this amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers \nUnion, the FBI Agents Association, the National Association of \nAssistant United States Attorneys, the nonpartisan Campaign Legal \nCenter, the League of Women Voters, Citizens for Responsibility and \nEthics in Washington, Common Cause, and Democracy 21. I am working with \nSenator Cornyn, the lead Republican cosponsor of our bill and this \namendment. We thank Senators Casey and Kirk for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  This amendment will provide investigators and prosecutors with the \ntools they need to hold officials at all levels of government \naccountable when they act corruptly by closing legal loopholes. This \namendment, which reflects a bipartisan, bicameral agreement, will \nstrengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal law and help \ninvestigators and prosecutors attack public corruption nationwide. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee has now reported this bill with bipartisan \nsupport in three successive Congresses. The House Judiciary Committee \nrecently reported a companion bill unanimously. It is time for Congress \nto act to pass serious anti-corruption legislation.\n  Importantly, the amendment includes a fix to reverse a major step \nbackward in the fight against fraud and corruption. In Skilling v. \nUnited States, the Supreme Court sided with a former executive from \nEnron and greatly narrowed the honest services fraud statute, a law \nthat has been used for decades as a crucial weapon to combat public \ncorruption and self-dealing. The Court's decision leaves corrupt \nconduct unchecked. Most notably, the Court's decision would leave open \nthe opportunity for state and Federal public officials to secretly act \nin their own financial self-interest, rather than in the interest of \nthe public. This amendment closes this gaping hole in our anti-\ncorruption laws.\n  The amendment includes several other provisions designed to tighten \nexisting law. It fixes the gratuities statute to make clear that public \nofficials must not be bought. It reaffirms that public officials may \nnot accept anything worth more than $1,000, other than what is \npermitted by existing rules and regulations, given to them because of \ntheir official position. It strengthens key sentences and gives \nprosecutors and investigators time to make complex and difficult cases.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I am sensitive to the dangers of \ncreating too many Federal crimes. In the area of public corruption, \nhowever, sometimes it is only the Federal government that can \neffectively pursue complex corruption matters. Conflicts and \nrelationships can make it difficult for State and local law \nenforcement, and these matters can require extensive resources that \ncannot be diverted from hard-pressed local budgets. This Federal law \nstands as a backstop to help ensure against public corruption.\n  I also know how important it is that our criminal laws be fair and \nprecise, giving sufficient notice to those who may break the law. It is \nin that spirit that Senator Cornyn and I, working with Congressmen \nSensenbrenner and Quigley, have refined this legislation. We have made \nit careful and precise and built in important safeguards. This \namendment will only target corrupt conduct.\n  Right now, a mayor who takes a $1,000 payment to award a contract to \na specific company can be prosecuted for corruption, but a mayor who \nconceals his interest in a company, awards a contract, and secretly \nmakes $1 million out of the deal likely cannot be prosecuted. A \ncontracting officer who accepts thousands of dollars in gifts from a \nfrequent bidder hoping for favorable treatment on some unspecified \nfuture contract likely cannot be prosecuted. The Department of Justice \nhas been dismissing counts and cases because of these gaps in the law. \nIt is time to fix them.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nthat we have witnessed in recent years in high-profile public \ncorruption cases, Congress should enact meaningful legislation to give \ninvestigators and prosecutors the tools they need to enforce our laws. \nPublic corruption erodes the faith the American people have in those \nwho are given the privilege of public service. This amendment will help \nus to take real steps to restore confidence in government by rooting \nout criminal corruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will support this \namendment that Senator Leahy and I have worked on. This is an expansion \nof our Public Corruption and Prosecution Improvements Act which passed \nthe Judiciary Committee last year.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to co-sponsor this important amendment with \nSenator Patrick Leahy, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Our amendment is drawn from bipartisan, bicameral legislation--\nincluding our Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act, which \npassed the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  Public corruption is not a Republican or Democratic problem. It is a \nWashington, DC, problem. And it is a problem in statehouses and city \nhalls across this country. Our citizens deserve to be governed by the \nrule of law, not the rule of man. Unfortunately, human nature being \nwhat it is, a few rotten apples have a tendency to spoil the bunch.\n  The amendment we will vote on today will strengthen the enforcement \nof U.S. Federal laws aimed at combating betrayals of public dollars and \nthe public trust. Our amendment does this by making clarifications to \npublic corruption laws and by giving prosecutors precise tools to use \nin their battle against corrupt officials.\n  Our amendment increases the maximum punishments on several offenses, \nincluding theft and embezzlement of federal funds, bribery, and a \nnumber of corrupt campaign contribution practices. For example, it \ncracks down on theft or bribery related to entities that receive \nFederal funds, by increasing the maximum sentence for a conviction from \n10 to 15 years and lowering the threshold that prosecutors must prove, \nfrom $5,000 to $1,000.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n  It also clarifies the law in response to several court decisions \nnarrowly interpreting the public corruption statutes. For example, the \nbill revises the definitions of ``illegal gratuities'' and ``official \nacts,'' clarifying that an entire ``course of conduct'' can be the \nresult of bribery.\n  Federal investigators who seek to root out corrupt officials will \nbenefit from new tools provided in this legislation. The bill would \nextend the statute of limitations on certain serious public corruption \noffenses, giving prosecutors more time to investigate and build a case.\n  And it expands the criminal venue provisions, allowing prosecutors to \nbring the case against corrupt officials in any district where some \npart of the corruption occurred. The bill similarly expands the venue \nfor perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  I would like to take a minute or two to address concerns that I have \nheard, including from some on my side of the aisle.\n  One criticism I have heard is that this legislation ignores \nfederalism principles.\n  This concern is directed at a portion of the amendment clarifying \nthat the mail and wire fraud statute applies to any public official who \nuses the interstate mails or wires to advance a fraudulent scheme \ninvolving illegally undisclosed self-dealing.\n  The Supreme Court has interpreted the mail and wire fraud statutes \nmore narrowly--asking that Congress clarify the definition of illegally \nundisclosed self-dealing.\n  Under this amendment, the Federal government would only be able to \nprosecute State officials where they can show, beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, that the State official in question had knowingly or \nintentionally violated relevant State laws concerning the disclosure of \nmaterial financial interests.\n  In other words, this legislation expressly defers to the States to \ndetermine what financial disclosures their public officials should be \nrequired to make.\n  Additionally, this provision would require the Federal government to \nshow that the State official in question had engaged in an official act \nfor the material purpose of benefitting the illegally concealed \nfinancial interest that they knowingly or intentionally failed to \ndisclose.\n  Finally, the Federal government would have to show that the course of \nconduct included a constitutionally-sufficient federal nexus via use of \nthe interstate mails or wires to perpetrate the fraud.\n  As for federalism principles generally, it is important to note that, \nunder current law, the Federal government still has the authority to \nprosecute corrupt State officials for bribery and kickback schemes \nunder the mail and wire fraud statutes.\n  This amendment simply updates and clarifies the honest services fraud \nstatute to reach corrupt conduct--i.e., undisclosed self-dealing--that \nCongress intended to be part of the criminal law.\n  Some opponents of this amendment believe that we should repeal \nportions of current law so that the Federal government has no role \nwhatsoever in rooting out public corruption at the State and local \nlevel. I fundamentally disagree.\n  Consider the all-too-common case of a corrupt State governor or State \njudge that local prosecutors are loathe to indict--or even \ninvestigate--for fear of reprisal.\n  Finally, I have heard some ask: Would this legislation criminalize \nthe giving of baseball caps, jerseys, or other ceremonial gifts to \nMembers of Congress?\n  The answer is very simple: No, it would not.\n  First, the amendment would only apply to status gratuities worth more \nthan $1,000. Second, the amendment would also require prosecutors to \nprove that the government official in question knowingly accepted the \nillegal gratuity in violation of the relevant ethics rules or \nregulations governing their conduct.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I look forward to \nengaging with any of my colleagues who have concerns or questions.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership on this and other \nlegislation we have crafted together. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly thank the Senators \nfrom Vermont and Texas for this amendment. It strengthens the bill, as \ndoes the preceding amendment offered by Senator McCain, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1483) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Coburn amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a simple, bipartisan amendment, and we have voted \non an identical amendment before, 63 yeas, 33 nays. My colleague, the \nSenator from Colorado, has been gracious enough to support this \namendment. This is straightforward. We just need to know what we are \ndoing when we do it. It requires the CRS to show us if we have \nduplicated anything before a bill comes before the Senate.\n  I yield to my colleague from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment \nNo. 1473. Senator Coburn and I have introduced this critical amendment \nto curb Congressional temptations to create more programs, laws and \nregulations, without first analyzing what already exists. Senator Hatch \nand I have also introduced legislation to create an official \n``Unauthorizing Committee'' that would reinstitute a committee in \nCongress to rid our government of outdated and ineffective laws.\n  In the next few weeks, the GAO will release a report showing the \nextent of the wasteful and duplicative programs in the federal \ngovernment. It shows that too often Congress focuses on creating new \nprograms and regulations while neglecting our important role of \noverseeing and reforming existing laws. Our amendment would require \nthat any new bill that is reported from committee contain an analysis \nfrom the Congressional Research Service determining if the bill creates \nany new federal program, office, or initiative that would overlap \nexisting programs. Opponents worry that this amendment will slow the \nlegislative process, but I believe that we must first pursue informed \nlegislating and efficient government.\n  Senator Coburn and I don't always agree on the reach of government \nand the investments we ought to make, but we agree that our government \nought to be smart, it ought to be efficient, and we shouldn't have \nduplication. This amendment would see us to that goal. Sixty-three of \nus voted for this amendment last year. Let's get 63 votes and more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I respectfully oppose the amendment put \nin by my two friends. This would amend the Senate rules to make it out \nof order for the Senate to proceed to any bill or joint resolution \nunless the committee of jurisdiction has posted on its Web site a CRS \nanalysis of whether the bill would create a new program, office, or \ninitiative that duplicates or overlaps an existing one. So it sounds \npretty good on the surface, but there are two problems. One is that CRS \ntells us it would be hard-pressed to carry out this responsibility, \ncertainly in a timely manner. The second results from the first, which \nis that this would be another way to slow legislation because it did \nnot yet have the CRS analysis.\n  A final point is this: The committees of jurisdiction ought to be \nmaking their own judgment and probably know better than CRS whether \nthey are creating a new program that duplicates or overlaps an existing \none.\n  So, respectfully, I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have the greatest respect for my chairman on homeland \nsecurity. I love him dearly.\n  GAO has already told us we are not doing our job. The first study of \nthe Federal Government showed $100 billion worth of duplication. The \nsecond\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nstudy is coming. CRS will have this easy because GAO will have already \nshown them where all the duplication is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN.

This amendment is subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the actions of a \nfew make it necessary for us to create more rules for the many honest \npeople who serve in Congress, but we must reassure Americans that we \nare here to serve them and not ourselves. Congressmen and Senators have \nlots of power and we know that power corrupts. The longer we stay in \noffice the more power we have. Unfortunately, we have seen that power, \nover a period of time, creates more opportunity and temptation for us \nto benefit ourselves rather than our constituents.\n  All of the cases of corruption and bribery I have seen unfortunately \ncome from more senior Members. No offense to my senior Members, please. \nBut this is one of many reasons why we should have term limits in \nCongress.\n  My amendment is not a statute. It is a sense of the Senate that says \nwe should have some form of constitutional limit on our terms in \noffice. We are not specific in the number of years, the number of \nterms. It is a sense of the Senate that we should have some limit on \nthe amount of time we serve. I encourage my colleagues to at least \nsupport this and get the debate started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for some Members of Congress, 2 years in \noffice is too long. For some Members of Congress, 20 years in office is \nnot long enough. Who should make that decision? The Constitution in its \nwisdom says the voters of America make that decision. Let's stand by \nthat Constitution and its language and defeat this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN.

This amendment is subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is a good government amendment. Similar to the \nunderlying piece of legislation, it is a good government amendment. The \nmanager is going to tell you it ought to be studied a little bit \nlonger. We have gone for far too long not having enough transparency in \ngovernment. What my amendment does is it takes these people whom you \ncall political intelligence professionals and has them register just \nlike every lobbyist registers, so it is totally transparent when these \npeople come around to get information from you that they sell to hedge \nfunds. You will know who they are. You don't know that now, and \ntransparency in government is very important if you want \naccountability.\n  For the Senators and their staffs who have to abide by these laws, \nthey want to make sure they are not doing anything unethical. They have \nto know who these people are. They can come around and ask us \nquestions. I don't know how many times each of us has maybe been caught \nup in this. You give them information, and they have information that \npeople don't have on Wall Street and they sell it. We ought to know \nwhat we are being used for, and this gives identity to these people. So \nI want these people registered like lobbyists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, there may be a problem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is a problem.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. But this amendment doesn't fix it. In the bill before \nthe committee, there was a provision to bring so-called political \nintelligence under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. Political intelligence \nis defined as information which is intended for use in analyzing \nsecurities or commodity markets or information investment decisions, \nbut what does that mean? Does it apply to a retailer who wants to open \nnew stores and calls the Armed\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nServices Committee to see whether there is a base that is going to be \nbuilt in a particular neighborhood? Some would say yes; some would say \nno. Violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act carries civil and criminal \npenalties. We just felt we wanted to get the anti-insider trading \nprovision out quickly and study this more. The bill calls for a GAO \nstudy.\n  Senator Collins and I announced we are going to hold a hearing on \nthis question. We need a little more time to do it thoughtfully. We are \nultimately dealing with first-amendment rights, and we ought not to \nlegislate until we are prepared to do so in a reasonable way.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Do I have time to tell the Senators not to vote for \nWall Street, vote for my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time. The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1481, as modified, offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nBrown. This amendment is subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Merkley and I \nhave proposed would require all Senators and their senior staff to sell \nindividual stocks that create conflicts or to place their investments \nin blind trusts. You can still invest in broad-based mutual funds. You \ncan keep your ownership interest in your family farm or small business.\n  If you are setting up a blind trust, you can instruct the trustee to \nhold on to your stock in your family company.\n  Current Senate ethics rules require committee staff making more than \n$25,000 a year to ``divest [themselves] of any substantial holdings \nwhich may be directly affected by the actions of the committee for \nwhich [they work].''\n  All Senator Merkley and I are saying is, Members of the Senate should \nhold ourselves to the same standard we already require of our committee \nstaff and executive branch employees.\n  As Senator Merkley said, baseball players cannot bet on their games. \nWe should not be able to hold stock in individual companies and then \nvote on issues that affect our holdings.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield half of the time in opposition to \nSenator Toomey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  I disagree with the fundamental premise of this amendment. I do not \nthink we should all be forced to divest ourselves of all of our \nholdings. But I think it is worse than it was characterized by my \nfriend from Ohio--worse in the sense that, as I read the definition of \nthe securities that would be covered and as the securities attorneys \nhave advised us on this--we would be required to divest ourselves even \nof our investment in a small family-owned business, a business that, \nperhaps, has absolutely no market whatsoever for the equity, and we \nwould, nevertheless, be forced to sell that where there is no buyer.\n  I think that is a very unreasonable standard, so I would urge a \n``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. This \namendment would take Congress from where we have always been and are \ngoing to be after this law passes. In pursuit of disclosure and \ntransparency, sunshine is the best guarantee of integrity. This would \nbe the first time I am aware of that in the legislative branch we would \nrequire divestment of personal holdings. For that reason, I oppose the \namendment.\n  Remember, in the underlying bill we have increased the public's \naccess to information about our holdings and our transactions. \nUltimately, that knowledge ought to be enough to guarantee the public \nor to energize the public to make sure we are following the highest \nethical norms. Divestment, in my opinion, is a step too far.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our Nation faces grave challenges. We are \nlooking at our fourth straight $1 trillion deficit, our credit rating \nhas been downgraded, and public spending is out of control. The Nation \ndemands leadership.\n  At some moments in our Nation's history--at moments of crisis--\nleaders have emerged, put partisanship aside, and worked to solve our \ngreatest challenges. Although our current President has compared \nhimself to both Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, his leadership \nis falling well short of their examples. Instead of taking the reins\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nand making tough choices when presented with our current fiscal crisis, \nhe has decided to put politics first. He always puts politics first.\n  Just this morning, at the National Prayer Breakfast, the President \ntook what has always been a nonpartisan opportunity for national unity \nand used it to promote his political agenda. He suggested to the \nattendees that Jesus would have supported his latest tax-the-rich \nscheme. With due respect to the President, he ought to stick to public \npolicy. I think most Americans would agree the Gospels are concerned \nwith weightier matters than effective tax rates.\n  As long as the President has decided to assume the role of \ntheologian-in-chief, he would do well to put tax policy aside and \nconsider the impact of one of his latest ObamaCare mandates. Secretary \nSebelius's decision to force religious institutions--over the strong \nobjections of churches and universities representing millions and \nmillions of Americans--to provide insurance coverage for abortifacient \ndrugs and contraceptives to their employees will require these groups \nto violate their deepest held religious beliefs.\n  The President's comments this morning share more of a political \nstrategy than they do the religious beliefs of most Americans. In 2008, \nthe President declared his nomination was the world historical moment \nwhen the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal. \nSomeone needs to remind the President there was only one person who \nwalked on water, and he did not occupy the Oval Office.\n  This drive to politicize every aspect of our institutions and public \ndiscourse took a serious and dangerous turn last month with the \nPresident's appointments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--\nthe CFPB--and to the National Labor Relations Board--the NLRB. Last \nweek, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama said Americans \ndeserve a government that plays by the rules. Yet his appointments of \nJanuary 4, just 1 day into a 3-day Senate recess, failed to meet his \nown standard.\n  Those unlawful appointments are the latest example of how he is \nwilling even to undermine the Constitution and weaken our government \ninstitutions to get what he wants. They are a deeply cynical political \nploy that puts his own ideological wants and electoral needs above our \nConstitution and rule of law.\n  The Constitution, not the President's political agenda or reelection \nstrategy, sets the rules we must live by and play by. In the regular \norder of the appointment process, the President nominates, but the \nSenate must consent for him to appoint. The President may not get his \nway every time, but this is one of many checks and balances in our \nsystem to make sure one part of the government does not gather too much \npower.\n  The Constitution also allows the President temporarily to fill \n``vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.'' These \nso-called recess appointments do not require Senate consent. However, \nthey are supposed to be an exception to the confirmation rule. The most \nobvious requirement for a recess appointment is that there actually be \na real recess. Needless to say, if the President alone can define a \nrecess, he can make recess appointments during every weekend or lunch \nbreak. The exception would swallow the rule and the President could \nissue the Senate out of the process all together.\n  Our Constitution refers to the recess of the Senate, not to a recess \nof the President's imagination or his lawyers' creation. Under the \nConstitution, the Senate has the authority to determine its own \nprocedural rules, including the what, when, and how long of Senate \nrecesses.\n  I will not go into all the twists and turns of recess appointment \nhistory. However, for decades, the standard has been that a recess must \nbe longer than 3 days for the President to make a recess appointment. \nThe Constitution, for example, requires the consent of the House or \nSenate for the other body to adjourn for more than 3 days. The \nCongressional Directory, which is the official directory of Congress, \ndefines a recess as ``a break in House or Senate proceedings of three \nor more days, excluding Sundays.'' The Senate's own Web site has the \nsame definition.\n  The Clinton administration argued in 1993 that a recess must be \nlonger than 3 days. The Clinton administration took that position. In \n2010, the Obama administration's own Deputy Solicitor General said this \nto Chief Justice John Roberts when arguing before the Supreme Court: \n``Our office has opined the recess has to be longer than three days.''\n  Let me repeat that. The Obama administration told the Supreme Court a \nrecess must be longer than 3 days for the President to make a recess \nappointment.\n  The Democratic majority in this body has endorsed this same standard. \nOn November 16, 2007, the majority leader said: ``The Senate will be \ncoming in for pro forma situations during the Thanksgiving holiday to \nprevent recess appointments.''\n  The four brief sessions he scheduled chopped the Thanksgiving break \ninto recesses of--you guessed it--3 days or less and so did the five \nsessions he scheduled during the Christmas break. This new tactic \nworked, and President Bush did not make another recess appointment for \nthe rest of his Presidency.\n  There is no record that then-Senator Barack Obama objected to this \ntactic in any way. He did not criticize it as a gimmick. He did not \nopine that the President could still make recess appointments despite \nthese pro forma sessions. He did not even suggest that pro forma \nsessions did anything other than create new, shorter recesses. That is, \nafter all, the only way the pro forma sessions can block recess \nappointments.\n  As far as I can tell, Senator Obama fully supported his party using \npro forma sessions to block recess appointments.\n  Finally, consider this. Our rule XXXI requires that pending \nnominations be sent back to the President whenever the Senate ``shall \nadjourn or take a recess for more than 30 days.'' Pursuing his strategy \nto prevent appointments during the August 2008 recess, the Democratic \nmajority leader scheduled no less than 10 pro forma sessions during \nthat period. As a result, because each pro forma session began a new \nrecess of less than 30 days, the Senate executive clerk did not return \nany pending nominations to the President.\n  The standard here is clear: Pro forma sessions create new recesses. \nRead the Congressional Record. Each pro forma session begins with the \nwords ``The Senate met'' and ends with the statement that ``The Senate \nstands in recess'' until a specific date and time. I don't know how \nmuch clearer it could possibly be. The Senate must adjourn for more \nthan 3 days for a President to make a recess appointment. The Senate \nhas endorsed this standard. The Democratic majority has endorsed this \nstandard, Senator Barack Obama endorsed this standard, and President \nBarack Obama's administration has endorsed this standard. A new recess \nbegins when a Senate session, even a pro forma session, ends.\n  But that was then; this is now. The Senate met on January 3, 2012, as \nthe Constitution requires, to convene the second session of the 112th \nCongress. The Congressional Record states that the Senate adjourned at \n12:02 until January 6, at 11 a.m. I know we see some fuzzy math here in \nWashington from time to time, but this is pretty simple. That was a 3-\nday recess, which was not long enough to allow a recess appointment.\n  The very next day, however, President Obama installed Richard Cordray \nas head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and he also \ninstalled three members of the National Labor Relations Board. These \nappointments were clearly unlawful because a sufficient recess did not \nexist. These appointments violated the standard President Obama himself \nendorsed when he served in this body, and they violated the standard \nhis own administration endorsed before the Supreme Court.\n  Senate Democrats routinely attacked President George W. Bush for \nsupposedly creating what they called an imperial Presidency. That \ncriticism was bogus for a host of reasons, but I can only imagine how \nthe majority would have howled had President Bush made recess \nappointments the day after those pro forma sessions in 2007 and 2008. \nThey would have denounced him for defying the Senate, for an \nunprecedented power grab, and for destroying the checks and balances \nthat\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nare so important in our form of government. They would have taken swift \nand firm measures in retaliation. Who knows, but they might even have \ngone to the Court over it. But President Bush respected the Senate and, \nwhether he liked it or not, declined to make recess appointments when \nthere was no legitimate recess.\n  President Obama apparently has no such regard for this body--one of \nwhich he was honored to be a Member. And to be clear, that means he has \nno such regard for the Constitution and its system of checks and \nbalances. He only wants his way. His political mantra last fall, that \nhe can't wait for Congress to enact his agenda, has now resulted in \nthese politicized appointments that violate our deepest constitutional \nprinciples.\n  No doubt some on the other side of the aisle will respond that the \nOffice of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice has issued a memo \njustifying these recess appointments. Well, as Paul Harvey used to say, \nHere is the rest of the story. That memo was issued on January 6--2 \ndays after President Obama made these unlawful recess appointments. I \nhad understood OLC's rule as giving objective advice before decisions \nwere made. Doing this after the fact looks as if it is a method of \ntrying to justify, rather than inform, this controversial decision, \nespecially when the memo admits that it addresses a novel issue with \n``substantial arguments on each side.''\n  The most egregious flaw in the OLC memo is that it addresses the \nwrong question. The question OLC should have answered is why a pro \nforma session, like any other session, does not start a new recess. \nThat is the real question here. OLC simply ignored that question \nentirely. And I am not at all surprised. The obvious answer is that a \npro forma session does begin a new recess, and then OLC would have had \nto justify the President making a recess appointment during an \nunprecedented 3-day recess.\n  Rather than address that necessary question, the OLC memo instead \naddressed whether the President may make recess appointments during a \nlonger recess that is ``punctuated by periodic pro forma sessions.'' I \nwish to know who made up this characterization of pro forma sessions as \nmerely procedural punctuation marks, but a cliche like that is no \nsubstitute for a real legal argument.\n  If that is the most egregious flaw in the OLC memo, its most \negregious omission might be failing even to mention, let alone explain \naway, the Obama administration's endorsement of the 3-day standard \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  In 1996, the Clinton Office of Legal Counsel advised that making \nappointments during a 10-day recess would ``pose significant litigation \nrisks.'' In this new memo, the Obama OLC admits that these appointments \nduring only a 3-day recess ``creates some litigation risks.'' They \nadmit that. The memo of course does not attempt to explain how \nappointments during an even shorter recess somehow pose less litigation \nrisks. Either way, litigation may be where this controversy is headed. \nAnd I certainly hope so.\n  Just as our Democratic colleagues accused President Bush of creating \nan imperial Presidency, they accused his administration's Office of \nLegal Counsel of helping him to do it. They attacked OLC for being his \nadvocate rather than an objective neutral adviser. Well, nothing OLC \ndid for President Bush looked anything like what we see today. This \nmemo reads like a brief by the President's personal lawyer. We all know \nJustice Department lawyers are not the President's personal lawyers.\n  When President Obama decided to make these appointments, the person \nwho should have been the most outraged was the Senate majority leader. \nAfter all, as the highest ranking officer in the Chamber, he should \nhave been particularly defensive of the rights and prerogatives of the \nSenate, and should have opposed any effort on the part of the Executive \nto undermine the Senate's role in the confirmation process.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Since the time the \nappointments were made, the Senate majority leader has, on multiple \noccasions, publicly endorsed the President's decision to ignore \nprecedent and bypass the Senate. He did so on television in mid-January \nand again this week here on this floor. The majority leader's decision \nto support and, indeed, applaud the President in this case is \ntroubling, given that, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it was under \nhis leadership that the Senate began to use pro forma sessions for the \nspecific purpose of preventing President Bush from making recess \nappointments.\n\n  The majority leader has acknowledged this to some extent, but his \nexplanation as to why he is taking these apparently contradictory \npositions is unclear and somewhat hard to follow. We need a better \nexplanation from the majority leader, because from the vantage point of \nmany here in the Chamber it appears that his position on the efficacy \nof pro forma sessions and the constitutionality of recess appointments \nvaries depending upon who is occupying the White House. No leader in \nthis body should ignore this question. And, frankly, our leaders should \nbe standing for the Senate against the White House on this matter.\n  Well, I hope that it isn't true that the constitutionality of recess \nappointments varies depending on who is occupying the White House. I \nhope I have simply misinterpreted what appears to be plain statements, \nboth past and present, on the part of the majority leader. That is why \nI, along with 33 of my colleagues, have submitted a letter to the \nmajority leader asking him to clarify his position on these \nappointments. Specifically, the letter asks him to state whether he \nbelieves the pro forma sessions have any impact on the President's \nrecess appointment power.\n  It also asks him to clarify whether he believes President Bush had \nthe constitutional authority to make recess appointments like the ones \nrecently made by President Obama and why, if he believes these recent \nappointments are constitutional, he instituted the practice of using \npro forma sessions in the first place. Why did he do that?\n  Finally, the letter asks the majority leader to state specifically \nwhether he agrees with the President's legal argument that the Senate \nwas unavailable to perform its advice and consent functions during the \nrecent adjournment period.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nletter, signed by 33 Senators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: In light of President Obama's \n     recent decision to break with precedent regarding the use of \n     recess appointments, we are writing to inquire about your \n     views on the matter so as to clear up what appear to be \n     serious inconsistencies on your part. We hope you will \n     provide a complete and candid response.\n       On January 4, 2012, the President announced his intent to \n     recess appoint Richard Griffin, Sharon Block, and Terence \n     Flynn to serve on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) \n     and Richard Cordray to serve as head of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Pursuant to a Unanimous \n     Consent agreement, the Senate was to go into pro forma \n     session every three days between December 17, 2011 and \n     January 23, 2012. However, the President, in a controversial \n     turn of events, determined that the Senate's use of periodic \n     pro forma sessions was insufficient to prevent him from \n     exercising his recess appointment power under Article II of \n     the Constitution.\n       As you are surely aware, it was under your leadership that \n     the Senate first began to use pro forma sessions in order to \n     prevent President George W. Bush from making recess \n     appointments beginning in November 2007. With very few \n     exceptions, this became the standard practice for the Senate \n     during the rest of President Bush's term in office, during \n     which time no recess appointments were made. And, though you \n     discontinued this practice when President Obama first took \n     office, the procedure was reinstituted last year.\n       Furthermore, in deciding whether to make these \n     appointments, the President reportedly relied on the opinion \n     of the Office of Legal Counsel which argued that, because no \n     business was to be conducted during the scheduled pro forma \n     sessions, the President could consider the Senate unavailable \n     to provide advice and consent and exercise his power to make \n     recess appointments. Yet, on December 23, 2011, one of the \n     days scheduled for a pro forma session, you, yourself, went \n     to the floor and conducted business to provide for the Senate \n     passage of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of \n     2011 (H.R. 3765), clearly undermining any claim that the \n     Senate is unavailable to perform its duties during a pro \n     forma session.\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\n       However, despite the fact that you were indisputably the \n     author of what became the routine use pro forma sessions to \n     prevent recess appointments and even though you are obviously \n     well aware that the Senate is able to conduct significant \n     business during a scheduled pro forma session, you have, on \n     multiple occasions, publicly expressed your support for \n     President Obama's efforts to bypass the Senate with regard to \n     these nominations. For example, while appearing on the \n     January 15, 2012 edition of ``Meet the Press,'' you stated \n     unequivocally that the President ``did the right thing'' in \n     making these appointments. And, while you did acknowledge in \n     the interview that it was you who established the procedure \n     of using pro forma sessions, you also stated that ``President \n     Bush didn't have to worry about recess appointments because \n     [you] were working with him,'' and that ``[you] believed \n     then, [you] believe now, that a president has a right to make \n     appointments.'' You made similar arguments this week on the \n     Senate floor.\n       This purported explanation directly contradicts remarks you \n     made on the Senate floor during the Bush Administration \n     wherein you explicitly indicated that the purpose of the pro \n     forma sessions was to prevent President Bush from making \n     recess appointments. On November 16, 2007, you stated that \n     ``the Senate would be coming in for pro forma sessions during \n     the Thanksgiving Holiday to prevent recess appointments,'' \n     and that you had made the decision to do so because ``the \n     administration informed [you] that they would make several \n     recess appointments.'' On December 19, 2007, you stated that \n     ``we are going into pro forma sessions so the President \n     cannot appoint people we think are objectionable. . .'' After \n     reading these statements, it is clear that, under the Bush \n     Administration, you believed that the use of pro forma \n     sessions was sufficient to prevent the President from making \n     recess appointments and that the practice was undertaken \n     specifically because you were unable to reach an agreement \n     with the President regarding specific nominees.\n       This apparent shift in your position raises a number of \n     concerns. Most specifically, it appears that you believe the \n     importance of preserving Senate's constitutional role in the \n     nomination and appointment process varies depending on the \n     political party of the President. Because we hope that this \n     is not the case and because we hope that you, as the Senate \n     Majority Leader, have taken seriously your responsibility to \n     protect and defend the rights of this chamber, we hope you \n     will answer the following clarifying questions:\n       1. In your view, what specific limitations does the \n     Senate's use of pro forma sessions place on the President's \n     power to make recess appointments under the Constitution?\n       2. Would it have been constitutional, in your view, for \n     President Bush to have made recess appointments during the \n     time the Senate, under your leadership, was using pro forma \n     sessions? If so, for what purpose did you establish the \n     practice of using pro forma sessions in the first place? If \n     not, why do you now believe it is constitutional for \n     President Obama to make recess appointments under similar \n     circumstances?\n       3. In your view, did the Senate's passage of the Temporary \n     Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 comply with the \n     constitutional requirements for the passage of legislation?\n       If so, do you disagree with the President's argument that \n     the Senate was ``unavailable'' to perform its advice and \n     consent duties during the recent adjournment?\n       Needless to say, these are very serious matters. While \n     there are many issues that divide the two parties in the \n     Senate, including the very appointments at issue here, we \n     hope that you share our view that neither party should \n     undermine the constitutional authority of the Senate in order \n     to serve a political objective.\n       Thank you for your attention regarding this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Orrin Hatch, Jim DeMint, Ron Johnson, Mike Johanns, John \n           Cornyn, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Michael B. \n           Enzi, John Boozman, Pat Roberts, Chuck Grassley, John \n           Hoeven, Roger Wicker, Pat Toomey, Dan Coats.

These so-called recess appointments were unlawful because \nthere was no legitimate recess in which they could be made.\n  There are many disagreements about policy and political issues. That \nis to be expected. But the integrity of our system of government \nrequires that even the President must, as he said in the State of the \nUnion Address, play by the rules. President Obama broke the rules in \norder to install the individuals he wanted. That action weakened the \nConstitution, our system of checks and balances, as well as both the \nSenate and the Presidency.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to draw the Senate's \nattention to recent developments in Egypt, and I begin by referring to \nthe outburst of violence yesterday by rival soccer fans after a match \nin that country in which 73 people were reportedly killed and hundreds \ninjured.\n  This is a shocking tragedy, and I want to express my condolences to \nthe Egyptian people and the families of the victims.\n  Last week tens of thousands of Egyptians gathered in Tahrir Square in \nCairo to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the popular revolution \nthat overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak. That courageous and \nlargely peaceful expression of popular will was inspirational to people \neverywhere, including millions of Americans.\n  The United States and Egypt share a long history of friendship and \ncooperation. Thousands of Americans travel and study in Egypt, and over \nthe years we have provided tens of billions of dollars in economic and \nmilitary aid to Egypt. Our countries share many interests, and it is \ncritically important that we remain friends and allies in that \nstrategically important part of the world during this period of \npolitical, economic, and social transition.\n  During the past 12 months, Egypt has been governed by a group of \nsenior military officers, each of whom held positions of leadership and \nprivilege in the repressive and corrupt Mubarak government. To their \ncredit, for the most part they did not attempt to put down the \nrevolution by force, and they pledged to support the people's demand \nfor a democratically elected civilian government that protects \nfundamental freedoms.\n  The transition process is a work in progress. On the positive side, \ntwo democratic elections have been held and a new Parliament has been \nseated. On the negative side, civilian protesters have been arrested \nand prosecuted in military courts that do not protect due process, and \nin December Egyptian police raided the offices of seven nongovernmental \norganizations, including four U.S.-based groups whose work for \ndemocracy and human rights has for years been hindered by laws and \npractices that restrict freedom of expression and association. Files \nand computers were confiscated, and some of their employees have been \ninterrogated.\n  There are also reports that as many as 400 Egyptian nongovernmental \norganizations are under investigation, allegedly for accepting foreign \ndonations. Apparently, to the thinking of Egypt's military rulers, \nthere is nothing wrong with the Egyptian Government receiving billions \nof dollars from U.S. taxpayers, but private Egyptian groups that work \nfor a more democratic, free society on behalf of the Egyptian people \nand that cannot survive without outside help do so at their peril.\n  Despite repeated assurances from Egyptian authorities that the \nproperty seized from these organizations would be promptly returned, \nthat has not happened. To the contrary, the situation has gotten worse \nas several of their American employees have been ordered to remain in \nEgypt. Some of them have obtained protection at the U.S. Embassy. With \neach passing day there are growing concerns that these groups could \nface criminal charges for operating in the country without permission.\n  This is a spurious charge, since registration applications were \nsubmitted and deemed complete by the government years ago, because the \norganizations regularly reported to officials on their activities, and \nsince, while registration was pending, they were permitted to operate. \nIronically, while the previous regime did not seek to expel them for \ntheir prodemocracy work, Egypt's current authorities, whose \nresponsibility it is to defend and support the democratic tradition, \nare attempting to do just that.\n  There is abundant misinformation about the work of the American-based\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\norganizations, with some Egyptian officials accusing them--without \noffering any evidence--of trying to subvert Egypt's political process. \nWithout belaboring the point, their work was no secret as they had \nnothing to hide. They were helping to build the capacity of Egyptian \norganizations engaged in peaceful work for democracy and human rights, \nsupporting the development of political parties, and working with \nEgyptian groups to provide nonpartisan voter education.\n  The military argues that since these groups were not registered, they \nwere in violation of Egyptian law, but this is a transparently specious \nexcuse for shutting them down. Their repeated applications for \nregistration were neither granted nor denied. The government simply \nchose to ignore them.\n  Egyptian officials also insist that this is simply a matter of \nupholding the rule of law, but the complaint against these \norganizations was issued by a Minister with no direct authority over \nlegal matters, and a negative propaganda campaign was unleashed in the \nstate-controlled media. The conduct of the raids, seizure of the files \nand computers, interrogation of the employees, and the no-fly order \nhave not been conducted consistent with legal standards but instead \nseem to be politically motivated. No warrants have been issued, no \ncharging documents made public, and no inventory of seized property \nmade available.\n  Many suspect that the force behind this crackdown is Minister of \nInternational Cooperation Faiza Aboul Naga, who was described in a \nWashington Post editorial this week as ``a civilian holdover from the \nMubarak regime'' and ``an ambitious demagogue [who] is pursuing a well-\nworn path in Egyptian politics--whipping up nationalist sentiment \nagainst the United States as a way of attacking liberal opponents at \nhome.'' Given Minister Aboul Naga's recent statements, I strongly \nbelieve that no future U.S. Government funds should be provided to or \nthrough that ministry as long as she is in charge. As the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the State Department and \nForeign Operations, I am confident there is strong support in Congress \nfor this position.\n  A related issue is the Egyptian military's continued use of vaguely \nworded emergency laws to silence dissent. While it is encouraging that \nthe head of the military, General Tantawi, announced plans to lift the \n30-year state of emergency, that is only a first step.\n  As I have mentioned, for decades the United States and Egypt have \nbeen friends and allies. While we have differed over issues of \ndemocracy and human rights, our two countries have worked together in \npursuit of common goals. Our partnership needs to be strengthened and \nbroadened to respond to the interests and aspirations of the Egyptian \npeople themselves. Our longstanding legacy of cooperation with the \nEgyptian Government is now in jeopardy, and it is in the interests of \nboth countries that this crisis is promptly and satisfactorily resolved \nand that we focus instead on moving forward to build an even stronger \nand enduring relationship.\n  In December, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for 2012. Section 7041(a)(1) of division I of that \nact provides that prior to the obligation of $1.3 billion in fiscal \nyear 2012 U.S. military aid for Egypt, the Secretary of State shall \ncertify that ``the Government of Egypt is supporting the transition to \ncivilian government including holding free and fair elections; \nimplementing policies to protect freedom of expression, association, \nand religion, and due process of law.''\n  These unprecedented requirements, which I wrote, were included for \ntwo reasons. First, we want to send a clear message to the Egyptian \npeople that we support their demand for democracy and fundamental \nfreedoms. Second, we want to send a clear message to the Egyptian \nmilitary that the days of blank checks are over. We value the \nrelationship and will provide substantial amounts of aid, but not \nunconditionally. They must do their part to support the transition to \ncivilian government. If the assault against international and Egyptian \nnongovernmental organizations continues, several of the requirements \nfor certification could not be met.\n  Egypt has an extraordinary history dating back thousands of years. \nAnyone who has stood at the base of the pyramids cannot help but be in \nawe of what that society accomplished centuries before Columbus arrived \nin America. It is a destination for thousands of American tourists and \nstudents each year. It has the potential to be a strong force for \ndemocratic change and moderation in the Middle East and north Africa.\n  I hope the Egyptian authorities fully appreciate the seriousness of \nthis situation and what is at stake. They need to permit these \norganizations to reopen their offices, return the confiscated property, \nend investigations of their activities and the activities of Egyptian \ngroups, and register them without conditions so they can continue to \nsupport the democratic transition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2012]\n\n          Egypt's Witch Hunt Threatens a Rupture With the U.S.\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       There is a grotesque incongruity in the tour around \n     Washington this week of an Egyptian military delegation even \n     as seven Americans who work for congressionally funded pro-\n     democracy groups are prevented from leaving Cairo and \n     threatened with criminal prosecution. What makes it worse is \n     that the ruling military council refuses to recognize the \n     seriousness of the crisis it has created in the U.S.-Egyptian \n     alliance.\n       The persecution of the Americans, which has been escalating \n     since their offices were raided Dec. 29, is an extraordinary \n     provocation by the generals who succeeded Hosni Mubarak. \n     Despite repeated appeals, including by President Obama, \n     military council chief Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi \n     has failed to deliver on promises to call off the witch hunt \n     and return confiscated funds and property. Over the weekend, \n     three of the Americans, including the son of Transportation \n     Secretary Ray LaHood, moved into the U.S. Embassy compound in \n     Cairo out of fear for their safety.\n       Meanwhile the Egyptian military delegation, headed by Fouad \n     Abdelhalim, defense minister for arms affairs, is here on a \n     business-as-usual mission to discuss security cooperation--\n     including the weapons purchases Egypt makes with the $1.3 \n     billion in U.S. military aid it receives each year. The \n     generals regard this funding as an entitlement, linked to the \n     country's peace treaty with Israel. They appear to believe \n     that Washington will not dare to cut them off, even if \n     Americans seeking to promote democracy in Egypt are made the \n     object of xenophobic slanders and threatened with \n     imprisonment.\n       Preserving the alliance with Egypt, and maintaining good \n     relations with its military, is an important U.S. interest. \n     But the Obama administration must be prepared to take an \n     uncompromising stand. If the campaign against U.S., European \n     and Egyptian NGOs is not ended, military aid must be \n     suspended.\n       Administration officials say Gen. Tantawi has been warned \n     repeatedly that the aid money is at risk. But they tend to \n     blame Congress, which attached conditions to the 2012 \n     military funding over the administration's objections. Before \n     aid is disbursed, the administration is required to certify \n     to Congress that Egypt is holding free elections and \n     protecting freedom of expression and association. Officials \n     acknowledge that no certification will be possible while the \n     prosecutions continue, and that funding could run out in \n     March. But the legislation provides for the certification to \n     be waived by the State Department on grounds of national \n     security. That course must be ruled out.\n       The campaign against the International Republican \n     Institute, National Democratic Institute and Freedom House, \n     along with a half-dozen Egyptian and European groups, is \n     being led by Minister of International Cooperation Faiza \n     Aboul Naga, a civilian holdover from the Mubarak regime. Ms. \n     Aboul Naga, an ambitious demagogue, is pursuing a well-worn \n     path in Egyptian politics--whipping up nationalist sentiment \n     against the United States as a way of attacking liberal \n     opponents at home. The regime's calculation has always been \n     that it can get away with such outrages because U.S. \n     policymakers will conclude they can't afford a rupture in \n     relations with Egypt. But if such a break is to be avoided, \n     the generals must be disabused of the notion that U.S. \n     military aid is inviolate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S319-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S319-S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PAYING A FAIR SHARE ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

They call it class warfare; they call it a \npolitical stunt. But in reality it is neither of those things. The \nPaying a Fair Share Act is common sense--the principle that everyone \nhas a right to earn as much money as they can in America, as long as \nthey are contributing their fair share.\n  We must have a sincere discussion about the distribution of tax \nburdens in this country. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nPaying a Fair Share Act, because it addresses this issue head on.\n  New York is a large, diverse State full of very different people with \nvery different views--a fact of which I am extremely proud. But all \nacross the State people agree on the basic principle that a Tax Code \nwhich allows the most privileged of our society, people making tens and \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year, to pay less than 14 percent in \ntaxes--significantly less than the average middle-class family--is \nbroken.\n  With the introduction of the Paying a Fair Share Act, we now have \nbefore us legislation that can significantly reduce our debt and \ndeficit without also breaking the backs of middle-class Americans. By \nensuring that millionaires and billionaires pay at least 30 percent of \ntheir income in taxes--a rate similar to many average Americans--we can \nreinstitute tax fairness in this country, a principle that our Tax Code \nhas sadly lacked since the Bush tax cuts ballooned our debt by cutting \ntaxes for the ultra wealthy.\n  I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take part in \nthis conversation. I consider the Paying a Fair Share Act as the \nbeginning of a conversation, not the end of it. As the co-chair of the \nSenate Philanthropy Caucus, I was pleased to see that my colleague from \nRhode Island included language that ensures we continue to promote \ncharitable giving and I would have liked to have seen a similar \nprovision for State and local income taxes. Regardless, I know we will \nhave the opportunity to build upon this proposal as it moves through \nconsideration in the Senate and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to improve it.\n  The issues of institutional unfairness in our Tax Code and our debt \nare not going away--not until we act. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle can take the Paying a Fair Share Act as the \nbeginning of a new chapter in the national debate, one that ends with a \nfairer Tax Code, deficit reduction, and a message to the American \npeople that their government will not rest until we have created a \nstronger, more prosperous, and fairer American economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S320-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n RECOGNIZING THE ARKANSAS LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE BLIND AND THE ABILITYONE \n                                PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize \nArkansas Lighthouse for the Blind and the AbilityOne program, two \nimportant partners in our efforts to help blind Americans and those \nwith other severe disabilities find meaningful employment.\n  The AbilityOne Program, formerly Javits-Wagner-O'Day, helps more than \n47,000 people who are blind or have other severe disabilities put their \nskills and talents to work. It is the largest source of employment for \npeople who are blind or have other severe disabilities in the country.\n  There are more than 600 nonprofit agencies throughout the United \nStates, including Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind, who participate in \nAbilityOne. These agencies produce over $2.3 billion in products and \nservices purchased by the Federal Government.\n  Before entering public service, I practiced optometry in Rogers, AK. \nAssisting people with vision problems was more than a career for me, it \nwas, and remains, a commitment. It led me to help establish a low \nvision program at the Arkansas School for the Blind in Little Rock and \nto offer my services as a volunteer optometrist at an area clinic that \nprovides medical services to low-income families. I see a tremendous \namount of passion and commitment in those who give their time and \nservices to Arkansas Lighthouse to the Blind.\n  Having visited the Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind, and seeing \nfirsthand the folks who work there and the products they make, I could \nnot be more proud of the work done by these men and women.\n  I applaud any organization that helps people who are blind or \nseverely disabled find employment. The same job that a colleague or I \nmight take for granted is a lifeline for those living with a \ndisability. The products and services produced through Arkansas \nLighthouse for the Blind and other organizations across the country \nalso prove that someone with a disability can lead a productive life \nand make major contributions within their community. They provide a \nvaluable service and I offer my continued support for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S320-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JEAN PACE\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, it is my great pleasure today to \nrecognize an Arkansan and a dedicated public servant on her approaching \n75th birthday. Jean Pace, the longtime mayor of Mammoth Spring, AR, \nwill celebrate her birthday on February 11, 2012. Family and friends \nwill gather to celebrate not only Jean's birthday but also her tireless \npublic service that has spanned 37 years.\n  Prior to her time in public office, Jean was drawn to Mammoth Spring \nfor a teaching job. Needless to say, she fell in love with the town and \nits people and still lives there today. She spent 15 years teaching in \nthe school district and played a significant role in developing the \nschool's gifted and talented program as well as the music and band \nprograms. Jean's love of music extended beyond the classroom as she \nalso taught hundreds of children and adults piano lessons in her free \ntime.\n  Though Jean loved inspiring her students each day in the classroom, \nshe ultimately decided to pursue a greater role in the community and \nran for mayor. Jean has now served 22 years in the mayor's office, and \nthe city and surrounding area have seen substantial improvements with \nher at the helm. Mayor Pace has a reputation for being relentless in \nher pursuit of grant monies and in her efforts to improve the quality \nof life for the residents of Mammoth Spring. Her time and efforts have \npaved the way for such things as a new fire truck for the fire \ndepartment, funding for the Aquatic Conservation and Education Center \nat Mammoth Spring National Fish Hatchery, and various improvements at \nthe State Park. Her tenure as mayor also saw Ozarka College open a new \nlocation in Mammoth Spring, which has provided additional educational \nopportunities to Mammoth Spring residents.\n  While her work on behalf of the city is how most people know Mayor \nPace, I would be remiss not to mention possibly the toughest and most \nrewarding job Jean has held. That is the job of mother and grandmother \nto her wonderful family. Jean's family includes her kids, Suzanne Pace \nKimes and George Spencer Pace; their spouses, Curt Kimes and Ellen \nPace; and two grandkids, George Sheffield Pace and Dalton Christine \nPace. I know they will all enjoy being together to celebrate Jean's \n75th birthday next week.\n  Mr. President, I ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing Jean a \nhappy 75th birthday and thank her for her 37 years of public service to \nMammoth Spring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S320-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S320-S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING EVELYN LAUDER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, late last year we lost Evelyn \nH. Lauder, a business leader, women's health advocate, refugee of \nnazism--and a friend.\n  Evelyn was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1936, the only daughter of \nErnest and Mimi Hausner. Two years later, after Nazi troops invaded \nAustria, the Hausners fled to England, where Evelyn's mother was sent \nto an internment camp on the Isle of Man.\n  In 1940, after Mrs. Hausner's release, the family sailed to the \nUnited States. They settled in New York, where Evelyn attended public \nschools and Hunter College. She then married Leonard Lauder; had two \nsons, William and Gary; and for a while worked as a schoolteacher in \nNew York.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  When Evelyn's mother-in-law Estee Lauder invited her to join the \nfamily's cosmetics company in 1959, it was a small business with a \nhandful of employees. Evelyn helped build it into an empire. She \ncreated the Clinique brand and held a number of positions at the \ncompany, including senior corporate vice president. Today, the Estee \nLauder Companies employ more than 32,000 people around the world.\n  Although Evelyn was a talented businesswoman, she arguably made her \nbiggest impact outside the business world. In 1989, Evelyn was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. Instead of allowing her illness to be a \nsetback, Evelyn made it a cause. She helped create the pink ribbon \ncampaign to raise awareness of breast cancer and also founded the \nBreast Cancer Research Foundation, which has raised more than $350 \nmillion and supports more than 180 scientists based in 13 countries. \nThe Breast Center at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center bears \nher name.\n  In a New York Times profile in 1995, Evelyn stated, ``I feel it's \nimportant to make a mark somewhere.''\n  Madam President, I believe Evelyn achieved this goal. Her leadership \nin business and philanthropy, along with her passionate advocacy for \nwomen's health issues, is virtually unmatched. We are thankful for her \nand the enduring legacy she left us.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a copy of the obituary the New \nYork Times published at the time of her passing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Nov. 12, 2011]\n\n    Evelyn H. Lauder, Champion of Breast Cancer Research, Dies at 75\n\n                            (By Cathy Horyn)\n\n       Evelyn H. Lauder, a refugee of Nazi-occupied Europe who \n     married into an illustrious family in the beauty business and \n     became an ardent advocate for breast cancer awareness, \n     raising millions for research, died on Saturday at her home \n     in Manhattan. She was 75.\n       The cause was nongenetic ovarian cancer said Alexandra \n     Trower, a spokeswoman for the Estee Lauder Companies.\n       As the wife of Leonard A. Lauder, the chairman emeritus of \n     the Estee Lauder Companies, and as the daughter-in-law of the \n     company's formidable matriarch, Estee Lauder, Evelyn Lauder \n     had to establish her own place in a family as complex as it \n     was competitive.\n       Mrs. Lauder frequently told the story of how, early in her \n     marriage, she returned to the couple's apartment to find that \n     Estee had rearranged the furniture more to her liking. When \n     Evelyn and Leonard were dating--it was only their second \n     date--Estee implored her to stay and be the hostess for a \n     birthday party she was giving her son.\n       ``So I stayed,'' Mrs. Lauder said in an interview in 2008. \n     ``What could I do? She was like a steamroller.''\n       Yet it was clear that Estee was crazy about the young \n     woman, and soon after Evelyn's marriage, in 1959, she joined \n     the family cosmetics company, then a small enterprise, \n     pitching in wherever she was needed.\n       ``I was very strong,'' she said. ``Having had a childhood \n     like the one I had, I was much more tough than a lot of \n     people. I was one of the few people who spoke my mind to \n     Estee.''\n       Mrs. Lauder learned she had breast cancer in 1989 and soon \n     became a strong voice on behalf of women's health, though she \n     was always reluctant to discuss her own condition. ``My \n     situation doesn't really matter,'' she told a reporter in \n     1995.\n       She was a creator of the Pink Ribbon campaign, a worldwide \n     symbol of breast health, and in 1993 she founded the Breast \n     Cancer Research Foundation, which has raised more than $350 \n     million.\n       In 2007 she received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, which \n     developed independently of her breast cancer, Ms. Trower \n     said.\n       Evelyn Hausner was born on Aug. 12, 1936, in Vienna, the \n     only child of Ernest and Mimi Hausner. Her father, a dapper \n     man who lived in Poland and Berlin before marrying the \n     daughter of a Viennese lumber supplier, owned a lingerie \n     shop. In 1938, with Hitler's annexation of Austria, the \n     family left Vienna, taking a few belongings, including \n     household silver, which Ernest Hausner used to obtain visas \n     to Belgium.\n       The family eventually reached England, where Evelyn's \n     mother was immediately sent to an internment camp on the Isle \n     of Man. ``The separation was very traumatic for me,'' Mrs. \n     Lauder said. Her father placed her in a nursery until her \n     mother could be released and he could raise money. In 1940, \n     the family set sail for New York, where her father worked as \n     a diamond cutter during the war.\n       In 1947, he and his wife bought a dress shop in Manhattan \n     called Lamay. Over time they expanded it to a chain of five \n     shops.\n       Mrs. Lauder grew up on West 86th Street and attended Public \n     School 9. During her freshman year at Hunter College, she met \n     Leonard Lauder on a blind date. Already graduated from \n     college and training to be a naval officer, Mr. Lauder had \n     grown up on West 76th Street, though in a sense it was a \n     world apart. ``He was the first person who took me out to \n     dinner in a restaurant,'' she recalled. They married four \n     years later at the Plaza Hotel.\n       Though always at home by 4 p.m. when her two children were \n     little, Mrs. Lauder said she never considered being a stay-\n     at-home mom, in spite of the family's growing wealth. ``I \n     couldn't bear it,'' she said. ``I grew up with a working \n     mother.'' Mrs. Lauder was also a public school teacher for \n     several years.\n       She held many roles at Estee Lauder, including creator of \n     training programs and director of new products and marketing. \n     In 1989, the year of her breast cancer diagnosis, she became \n     the senior corporate vice president and head of fragrance \n     development worldwide.\n       Mrs. Lauder is survived by her husband; her sons, William \n     and Gary; and five grandchildren.\n       Though Mrs. Lauder, an avid photographer, had a home in \n     Colorado and a penthouse on Fifth Avenue lined with modern \n     art, she and her husband liked to retreat to a plain cabin in \n     Putnam County, N.Y., where Mrs. Lauder might serve guests \n     German food she had prepared.\n       Asked once how she felt about working with her husband in \n     the early days, she replied, ``Working with Leonard was a \n     riot.'' Indeed, she joked that he had such a sense of \n     business, without family favoritism, that getting an \n     appointment with him was sometimes tough. ``It would take me \n     much longer to get a date with him,'' she said, ``than \n     someone who didn't have his name.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S321-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S321-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S321-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1173.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to speed \nAmerican innovation in research and drug development for the leading \ncauses of death that are the most costly chronic conditions for our \nNation, to save American families and the Federal and State governments \nmoney, and to help family caregivers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Spending \nReductions Through Innovations in Therapies Agenda Act with my good \nfriends and colleagues, Senators Collins, Kerry, Blumenthal, and \nWarner. This is a bi-partisan and bi-cameral bill that I have worked on \nwith Representatives Markey and Smith and community organizations and \nleaders such as George and Trish Vradenburg's U.S. Against Alzheimer's. \nThis legislation will help us sprint to the finish line by getting \ninnovative therapies from bench to bedside more quickly for chronic \ndiseases like Alzheimer's. It spurs innovation in advanced research and \ndrug, device, and diagnostics development for chronic health conditions \nthat are leading causes of death as well as the most costly to \ntaxpayers and families.\n  The act puts the focus where it needs to be. It tackles the health \nproblems we are challenged with today and will be faced with in the \nfuture if there is inaction. We must conquer these complex health \nconditions and plug the drain that draws money from our nation's \neconomy and patients, families, and taxpayers checkbooks.\n  It is been over 10 years since a new Alzheimer's drug entered the \nU.S. market. Eleven industry sponsored clinical trials have failed in \nrecent years. It takes 10 to 15 years to develop a drug and get the FDA \ngold seal of approval. Each drug that successfully enters the market, \ncosts over $1 billion to develop. This is because of the high failure \nrates in the ``Valley of Death.''\n  Currently, 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's and 15 million \nAmericans are caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. There are no \ndrugs on the market today to delay-onset, prevent, or cure Alzheimer's. \nMedicare spending for Alzheimer's patients is 3 times higher than \nMedicare patients without Alzheimer's. Medicaid spending for \nAlzheimer's patients age 65 and older is 9 times higher. This is \nunsustainable. Families are left bewildered, bereft, and broke.\n  I know what this is like. My own dear father was one of the 5 million \nAmericans with Alzheimer's. I remember when I would go to visit him. It \ndidn't matter that I was a United States Senator or the Senator who \nrepresents the National Institutes of Health. It didn't matter that I \ncould get Nobel Prize winners on the phone. The information that would \nhave made his life easier just wasn't there. My family and I knew about \nthe long goodbye. We lived the 36-hour day. It was devastating for him, \nheart-breaking to my mother, and heart-wrenching for my sisters and me. \nWhat was difficult was not only the disease but that we also felt \npowerless. All we could do was make my father comfortable. There was no \ncure. There was no safety net for our family.\n  I vowed to do everything I could. Not just to support research and \ndevelopment in Alzheimer's but also to create a safety net for \nfamilies. I know it is gut-wrenching to wonder how you'll be able to \ncare for a parent. I have always believed Honor thy mother and father' \nis a good commandment to live by and a good policy to govern by. We \nneed innovative strategies like the SPRINT program to make sure your \nbrain span lasts your life span.\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n  SPRINT speeds the development of drugs and therapies to combat the \nmost deadly and costly chronic diseases. It compresses the product \ndevelopment timeline and increases the volume of drugs in the \ndevelopment pipeline so that priority is given to the most promising \ndrugs. This bill expedites the Food and Drug Administration review \nprocess. It helps get more drugs out of the labs and into patient's \nhands more quickly.\n  This act establishes a new program--the SPRINT Program. SPRINT will \ndevelop new therapies to reduce federal health care spending on chronic \nhealth conditions like Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancer \nthat are the leading causes of death identified by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. In fact, some researchers are already \nworking hard to see if diabetes or heart diseases are associated with \nAlzheimer's. I have seen first-hand that many Alzheimer's patients have \nmultiple chronic conditions.\n  SPRINT directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work \ncollaboratively with non-profit investors to identify public and \nprivate organizations with expertise in developing therapies for these \nconditions like a biotech company or an academic health center such as \nUniversity of Maryland or Johns Hopkins. Prize payments, contracts, \ngrants, or cooperative agreements will be awarded to accelerate \ndevelopment of therapies that have potential to prevent or diagnose, \ndelay onset or cure, and aid recovery or improve health outcomes for \nAlzheimer's disease and other high-cost conditions.\n  This bill is built on a public-private partnership. We will make a \n$50 million Federal investment and leverage private capital by raising \n$2 in private investment for every Federal dollar to combat this \nproblem together. For this small investment we will get huge returns in \nlives saved and new cures. By making a small investment today we will \nsave billions in future health care spending and long-term care costs. \nAlzheimer's Association estimates that Alzheimer's alone costs our \nfederal health programs, Medicare and Medicaid, over $183 billion \nannually.\n  SPRINT is a job creator. Manufacturers in Maryland and other states \nare on the frontier of discovering new drugs and biologics. By helping \npatients find new treatments we can also make targeted investments in \nour innovation economy. Biotech companies are an economic engine in \nMaryland's economy. SPRINT helps America remain number one in \nbiomedical innovation and job creation.\n  I have a saying, ``each of us can make a difference and together we \ncan make change''. I will keep fighting for a cure for Alzheimer's. I \nwill keep fighting to support our innovative industries in their quest \nfor new therapies and treatments that will help patients globally and \ncreate jobs domestically. And I will keep fighting to help families \nliving with Alzheimer's. We are working together because a Congress \nthat works together works the best. We will get this done. Some people \nwant to go to Mars but I want to be in the United States of America \nwhen they say ``we found a cure for Alzheimer's.''\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to, with my colleague from \nMaryland, introduce the Spending Reductions through Innovations in \nTherapies agenda, or SPRINT, Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill to \naccelerate the development of treatments and therapies for high-cost \ndiseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.\n  Alzheimer's and other chronic conditions take a tremendous personal \nand economic toll on millions of Americans and their families. \nMoreover, in addition to the human suffering they cause, they pose \nsignificant challenges to the fiscal health of our Nation.\n  Alzheimer's disease alone costs the United States $183 billion a \nyear, a figure that will only increase exponentially as the baby-boom \ngeneration ages. If nothing is done to slow or stop the disease, \nAlzheimer's will cost the United States $20 trillion over the next 40 \nyears.\n  At a time of mounting deficits, the increasing incidence of diseases \nsuch as diabetes and Alzheimer's also has dire implications for our \nFederal budget. For example, it is estimated that spending on diabetes \naccounts for one out of three Medicare dollars. The average annual \nMedicare payment for an individual with Alzheimer's is three times \nhigher than for those without the condition. For Medicaid, average \npayments for someone with Alzheimer's are nine times higher.\n  The Federal Government is currently spending hundreds of billions of \ndollars a year caring for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, \ndiabetes, cancer, heart disease, and other conditions. This pricetag \nwill only increase as our population ages. Left unchecked, these \ndevastating diseases threaten not only to destroy our Nation's health, \nbut also to bankrupt our finances.\n  The SPRINT Act, which we are introducing today, is intended to speed \nthe development of therapies to significantly modify, cure, or prevent \nthese high-cost, chronic conditions. Among other provisions, the bill \nauthorizes $50 million for a public-private SPRINT program and fund \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services to support advanced \nresearch into promising therapies that are most likely to improve \nhealth outcomes and reduce health care costs.\n  Modeled after the successful Defense Advance Research Project Agency, \nDARPA, the SPRINT program and fund will complement the basic research \ndone by the National Institutes of Health. It will work through public-\nprivate partnerships to provide modest resources to research \ninstitutions and other innovators conducting advanced research into \ntherapies and treatments for Alzheimer's and other high-cost chronic \nconditions.\n  Funding provided under the bill will be targeted to chronic \nconditions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nas being among the top 10 causes of death and focused on those that \naccount for high current and projected costs to Federal health \nprograms; reduce a victim's ability to carry out activities of daily \nliving; have a death rate that has increased and is projected to \nincrease significantly in future years; and lack existing therapies to \nprevent, control, or cure the condition or delay cognitive decline.\n  Each Federal dollar awarded under the program must be matched by at \nleast $2 in private funding, and the Secretary may modify or terminate \nfunding for projects that fail to meet milestones. Finally, the \nlegislation will expedite review by the Food and Drug Administration of \nthe therapies developed through the program so they can be delivered to \npatients as quickly as possible.\n  Chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes, and \ncancer cause great suffering and financial hardship for millions of \nAmericans and their families. Given their increasing prevalence as our \npopulation ages, they also threaten to bankrupt critically important \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The SPRINT Act will leverage a relatively small Federal investment to \nspeed the development of therapies that have the potential to prevent, \ndelay, cure, and improve outcomes for these terrible diseases. It also \noffers us an opportunity to control the costs associated with these \ndevastating conditions. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe Alzheimer's Association endorsing our legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Alzheimer's Association,\n\n\n                                         Public Policy Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Alzheimer's \n     Association, thank you for your leadership on issues \n     important to Americans with Alzheimer's disease and their \n     caregivers. As the co-chair of the Congressional Alzheimer's \n     Task Force you are well-aware of the national and global \n     epidemic that is Alzheimer's disease. This devastating \n     disease is the ultimate thief--a thief of memories, thief of \n     independence, thief of control, thief of time and ultimately, \n     a thief of life. The Alzheimer's Association is pleased to \n     support your bill, the Spending Reductions through \n     Innovations in Therapies Agenda Act of 2012 (SPRINT Act), \n     which would create a novel mechanism to target research \n     investments that development of new treatments and reduce \n     overall spending by Federal health care programs for high-\n     cost chronic conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.\n       The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading \n     voluntary health organization in\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\n     Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to \n     eliminate Alzheimer's disease and other dementias through the \n     advancement of research, to provide and enhance care and \n     support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia \n     through the promotion of brain health. Our vision is a world \n     without Alzheimer's.\n       In 2011, the cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's to \n     American society will total an estimated $183 billion, \n     according to Alzheimer's Association's 2011 Alzheimer's \n     Disease Facts and Figures report. This is an $11 billion \n     increase over last year--a rate of increase more than four \n     times inflation. According to the Alzheimer's Association \n     report, Changing the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease: A \n     National Imperative, unless a treatment is found that can \n     prevent cure, or even slow the progression, by 2050, as many \n     as 16 million Americans will have Alzheimer's disease and the \n     cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's \n     dollars). This will create an enormous strain on the health \n     care system, families and the federal budget.\n       The SPRINT Act aims to speed American innovation in \n     research and drug development for the leading causes of death \n     that are the most costly chronic conditions for our Nation, \n     which includes Alzheimer's disease. The legislation \n     highlights the growing need for research and the importance \n     of finding innovative ways to find a cure for Alzheimer's on \n     behalf of the estimated 5.4 million Americans currently \n     living with the disease.\n       The Alzheimer's Association appreciates your continued \n     leadership on Alzheimer's disease.

Res. 367\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate the social, emotional, and \n     cognitive development of a young person;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for the \n     people who serve as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in formal mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in spite of the progress made in increasing \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2012 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will help call attention to the critical \n     role mentors play in helping young people realize their \n     potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas, most significantly, National Mentoring Month--\n       (1) will build awareness of mentoring; and\n       (2) will encourage more people to become mentors and help \n     close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2012 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages more adults and students to volunteer as \n     mentors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S326-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1511.

Res. 367\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate the social, emotional, and \n     cognitive development of a young person;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for the \n     people who serve as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in formal mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in spite of the progress made in increasing \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2012 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will help call attention to the critical \n     role mentors play in helping young people realize their \n     potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas, most significantly, National Mentoring Month--\n         (1) will build awareness of mentoring; and\n         (2) will encourage more people to become mentors and help \n     close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2012 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages more adults and students to volunteer as \n     mentors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/02/senate-section/article/S327-5", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2064\n\n  Mr. REID.

After this passage, there will be no dispute whatsoever.\n\n  I appreciate the fact that we will now move to the FAA bill, which is \ngoing to be completed in the form of a conference report. It is very \nhard to do. People worked extremely hard. Is it a perfect piece of \nlegislation? No, it is not. But we have not had an FAA bill since 2003. \nWe have had 23 temporary extensions.
