Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 415, S. \n3240.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 415, S. 3240, a bill to \n     reauthorize the agricultural programs through 2017, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nfarm bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time until 10:30 a.m. will be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees. At 10:30 a.m. there \nwill be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the farm bill. We \nhope we can reach agreements on the amendments today.\n  The hour following the cloture vote will be equally divided, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  Mr. President, here we are again on these endless, wasted weeks \nbecause the Republicans are preventing us from going to legislation. We \nshould have been legislating on this bill. This is a bipartisan bill. \nIt is managed by two very good Senators. One is a Democrat, Debbie \nStabenow, chairman of that committee, and Pat Roberts from Kansas, who \nin the past has been chairman of the committee and is ranking member of \nthe committee today. They have come up with a very good bill. It saves \nthe country $23 billion. It gets rid of a lot of wasted subsidies. It \nis a fine piece of legislation.\n  We hear the hue and cry constantly from our Republican friends to do \nsomething about the debt. This bill does it. It saves the country $23 \nbillion. We are going to have a cloture vote on the ability for us to \nproceed to the bill, and on the ability for us to start legislating.\n  I don't need to give a lecture to the Presiding Officer about how \nvexatious this is, that we have to do this every time. The Presiding \nOfficer wanted to do something to change this process at the beginning \nof this Congress. I will bet, Mr. President, if we maintain our \nmajority--and I feel quite confident we can do that and the President \nis reelected--there are going to be some changes. We can no longer go \nthrough this on every bill. There are filibusters on bills they agree \nwith. It is a waste of time to prevent us from getting things done. So \nenough on that. It is such a terrible waste of our time.\n\n\n          Measures Placed on the Calendar--S. 3268 and S. 3269\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are two bills at the desk due for a \nsecond reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader is correct. The clerk \nwill read the titles of the bills for the second time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3268) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     provide rights for pilots, and other purposes.\n       A bill (S. 3269) to provide that no United States \n     assistance may be provided to Pakistan until Dr. Shakil \n     Afridi is freed.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to these bills, en bloc.\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbills will be placed on the calendar under rule XIV.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the \nday.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved. Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 a.m. will \nbe equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair start \ncalling the roll, with the time equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been a week now since the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate and the House sent several good-\nfaith, bipartisan proposals to the White House in an effort to resolve \nthe student loan issue. And what has the White House done? Absolutely \nnothing. The President has not yet responded. One can only surmise he \nis delaying a solution so he can fit in a few more campaign rallies \nwith college students while pretending someone other than himself is \nactually delaying action.\n  Today the President is taking time out of his busy fundraising \nschedule to hold an event at UNLV, where, once again, he will use \nstudents as props in yet another speech calling on Congress to act. \nWhat the President won't tell these students is that the House has \nalready acted and that Republicans in both Chambers are ready to work \non solutions as soon as the President can take the time. All the \nPresident has to do is to pick up his mail, choose one of the \nbipartisan proposals we laid out in a letter to him last week--\nproposals he has already shown he supports, with pay-fors he has \nrecommended--and then announce to the students that the problem has \nbeen solved.\n  Unfortunately, the President is apparently more interested in \ncampaigning for the students at UNLV than actually working with \nCongress to find a solution.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest you open your mail. Just open your \nmail, and you will find a letter there from the Speaker and from the \nmajority leader in the House and from Senator Kyl and myself laying out \na way to pay for the extension of the current tax rates for student \nloans for another year that you yourself previously recommended. The \nonly people dragging their feet on the issue are over at the White \nHouse itself--dragging their feet to fit in yet another college visit.\n  Republicans here in Congress have been crystal clear on this issue \nfor weeks. We are ready to resolve the issue. It is time the President \nshowed some leadership and worked with Congress to provide the \ncertainty young people and their parents need. I encourage the \nPresident, if he really wants to do something to help students, to join \nus in working to find a solution. This is really pretty easy. We all \nagree that we ought to extend the current student loan rates for a \nyear.\n  We have recommended to you, Mr. President, the way to pay for it that \nyou have already adopted. This isn't hard.\n  Every day he is silent on solutions is another day closer to the \nrapidly approaching deadline here at the end of the month.\n\n\n                           Tax Rate Extension\n\n  Mr. President, I stood with the Speaker of the House yesterday and \nhis conference leadership and called for at least a 1-year extension of \ncurrent tax rates to provide certainty to families and job creators \naround the country that their taxes will not be going up on January 1.\n  In the Obama economy, we are facing a looming fiscal crisis that some \nhave called the most predictable in history. Millions are unemployed, \nmillions more are underemployed, and the country is facing the largest \ntax hike in history at the end of this year.\n  This tax hike the President wants would hit hundreds of thousands of \nsmall businesses. To put that in perspective, this tax hike would hit \njob creators who employ up to 25 percent of our workforce, and we \nreally can't allow that to happen. I think we all know we cannot allow \nthat to happen. The economy is far too fragile right now.\n  Former President Bill Clinton said we are in an economic recession, \nand earlier this week, before the Obama campaign got to him, he was for \ntemporarily extending current tax rates. Yesterday the Democratic \nSenate Budget Committee chairman came out and said he was for \ntemporarily extending current tax rates. And I would remind everyone \nthat it was the President himself in December of 2010 who said that you \ndon't raise taxes in a down economy. Well, the economy is slower now \nthan it was when he last agreed with us to extend current tax law back \nin December of 2010. In fact, the rate of growth in our economy is \nslower now than it was in December 2010 when the President agreed with \nus that at that point we ought to do a 2-year extension of the current \ntax rates. We are experiencing slower growth now than then. The same \narguments apply now.\n  This is the time to prevent this uncertainty and the largest tax \nincrease in American history--right in the middle of a very fragile \neconomy. It really doesn't make any sense to do otherwise. Let's extend \nall the current tax relief right now--before the election. Let's show \nthe American people we are actually listening to them. Let's send a \nmessage that in these challenging economic times, taxes won't be going \nup for anyone at the end of this year. And let's not stop there. Let's \ntackle fundamental, progrowth tax reform. This is something upon which \nthere is bipartisan agreement. I think we all agree it has been over 25 \nyears since we did comprehensive tax reform in this country. It is time \nto do that again. We all agree on that. The President thinks that and \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Congress think that. The time to act \nis now. If the President is serious about turning the economy around, \npreventing taxes from going up at the end of the year is one bipartisan \nstep he could take right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to move \nforward on the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act, also known as \nthe farm bill. I hope my colleagues will vote to join us and begin the \ndebate officially on this important jobs bill because it is so \nimportant to 16 million people who get their jobs from agriculture.\n  Our economy has seen some tough times, as we all know. Certainly we \nknow that in Michigan. But agriculture has been one of the really \nbright spots. It is an underpinning of our economic recovery, and we \nwant to keep it that way. If we fail to pass a new farm bill before the \ncurrent one expires in September, it would cause widespread uncertainty \nand result in job losses in a very important part of our economy that \nis critical to keeping our recovery going.\n  Agriculture is one of the only parts of the economy, if not the only \npart, that has a trade surplus--$42.5 billion in 2011--the highest \nannual surplus on record. We know that for every $1 billion in exports, \n8,400 people are working. So this is a jobs bill.\n  Thanks to the farm bill, tonight American families will sit down \naround the kitchen table and enjoy the bounty of the world's safest, \nmost abundant, and most affordable food supply. I think it is too easy \nfor all of us to take that for granted. The men and women who work hard \nfrom sunrise to sunset every day to put that food on our tables deserve \nthe economic certainty this bill provides.\n  The farm bill before us today makes major reforms. We are cutting \nsubsidies. We are ending direct payments. We cut the deficit by over \n$23 billion. As my friend and ranking member has said, this is \nvoluntary. This is a real cut, as my budget chairman would say, and it \nis more than double what was\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nrecommended in the Simpson-Bowles Commission. So this is serious. This \nis real. And we in agriculture--the first authorizing committee to \nrecommend real deficit reduction cuts--are serious about making sure we \nare doing our part and that the families and ranchers and people \ninvolved in agriculture are doing their part as well. They are willing \nto do that. We have to have economic certainty because we are talking \nabout creating jobs all across America, in rural areas and in urban \nareas.\n\n  This farm bill gives farmers new export opportunities so they can \nfind new global markets for their goods and create jobs. This farm bill \nhelps family farmers sell locally. We are tripling support for farmers \nmarkets, which are growing all over this country, and new food hubs to \nconnect farms with schools and other community-based organizations.\n  This farm bill provides training and mentoring and access to capital \nfor new and beginning farmers to get their operations off the ground. \nThe bill really is about the future of agriculture in our country. As I \nhave said so many times, this is not your father's farm bill. This is \nabout the future.\n  We had three young farmers visiting with Senator Roberts and me \nyesterday, and I can tell my colleagues they were so impressive--I feel \nvery confident about the future--but they were saying loudly and \nclearly that we need to get this done now so they can plan for \nthemselves and their families.\n  We are also for the first time offering new support and opportunities \nfor our veterans who are coming home. The majority of those who have \nserved us in such a brave and honorable way in Iraq and Afghanistan \ncome from small towns all across America, and they are now coming home. \nMany of them want the opportunity to stay at home, to be able to go \ninto farming, to be able to have their roots back in their communities. \nWe are setting up new support in this farm bill to support our veterans \ncoming home.\n  The farm bill supports America's growing biomanufacturing businesses, \nwhere companies use agricultural products instead of petroleum to \nmanufacture products for consumers. I am so excited about this because \nin my State of Michigan, we make things and grow things, and \nbiomanufacturing is about bringing that together. As we move through \nthis bill, I look forward to talking more about that.\n  This bill moves beyond corn-based ethanol into the next generation of \nbiofuels that use agricultural waste products and nonfood crops for \nenergy. This bill provides a new, innovative way to support \nagricultural research--the men and women who every day fight back \nagainst pests and diseases that threaten our food supply--with a new \npublic-private research foundation to stretch every dollar and get the \nmost results.\n  We extend rural development with a new priority for those proposing \nto maximize Federal, State, local, and private investment so that \nsmalltown mayors--such as those who came before our committee--across \nthe country can actually understand and use the programs. We are \nsimplifying it. We are going from 11 different definitions of ``rural'' \ndown to 1 so that it is simple and clear and so that smalltown mayors \nand local officials have better tools to use to support their \ncommunities.\n  Finally, let me say one more time that this bill is a jobs bill. \nSixteen million people work in this country because of agriculture. We \nare creating jobs. We are cutting subsidies. We are reducing our \ndeficit by over $23 billion. I hope our colleagues will join with us \nthis morning in a very strong vote to move forward on this bill.\n  Can the Chair announce the time remaining on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 18 minutes on the \nRepublican side and 11\\1/2\\ minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me first yield, if I might--I know Senator Nelson \nalso wishes to speak--7 minutes, if that is appropriate, to our \ndistinguished budget leader.\n  In introducing the Senator from North Dakota, I wish to say that we \nwould not have the thoughtful approach on the alternative in the \ncommodity title that we have today--we know we are going to be working \nmore to strengthen that as we move through the process, but we would \nnot have the strong risk-based approach we have without the senior \nSenator from North Dakota, our budget chairman. We also would not have \nthe energy title we have that creates jobs without his amendment and \nhis hard work. Frankly, this is somebody whom I looked to on every page \nof the farm bill because of his wonderful expertise.\n  I have to say one more time that I am going to personally and, as a \nSenator and chair of the committee, greatly miss him when he leaves at \nthe end of the year. I think I may be locking the door so he can't \nleave.\n  So I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say that the Senator has \nprovided brilliant leadership on this legislation. I am in my 26th year \nhere. I have never seen a chairwoman so personally and directly engaged \nto make legislation happen in an extraordinarily difficult and \nchallenging environment.\n  When the history of this legislation is written, Senator Stabenow, \nthe chairwoman of our committee, will be in the front rank of those who \nmade this happen. I want to express my gratitude to her on behalf of \nfarm and ranch families all across America for the extraordinary \nleadership she has provided.\n  Farm policy has many critics, and they perpetuate a myth about the \nfarm bill: that it only benefits a handful of wealthy farm and ranch \nfamilies. The truth is much different. The critics, who often look down \ntheir noses at hard-working farm families who feed this country, do not \nseem to understand the competition farmers face in the international \narena and what an extraordinary success this farm policy has been.\n  The simple fact is, our agricultural policy benefits every consumer \nin America. As a share of disposable income, Americans have the \ncheapest food in the history of the world. Americans spend less than 10 \npercent of their disposable income on food, which is far less than any \nother country. As the Senator, the chairwoman of the committee, Ms. \nStabenow, says very clearly, this is not only good for consumers, this \nis a jobs bill. Sixteen million people in this country have jobs \nbecause of an agricultural policy that has been a stunning success.\n  It is also a bill that helps us compete around the rest of the world. \nThe 2008 farm bill has been a tremendous success by any measure--record \nfarm income, record exports, record job creation. That is the history \nof the 2008 bill. It has contributed to the strong economic performance \nof American agriculture. As you may recall, it passed with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority and it was paid for. It was paid for. \nWe actually reduced a little bit of the deficit with that legislation.\n  That strong safety net created by the 2008 bill has enabled American \nfarmers to continue to produce food for our Nation, even while facing \ntremendous market and weather risks.\n  Critics of farm policy also imply that the farm bill is busting the \nbudget. That is simply false. Farm bill spending is only a tiny sliver \nof the overall Federal budget. Total outlays for the new farm bill are \nabout 2 percent of total Federal spending; and of the farm bill \nspending, only about 14 percent--14 percent--goes to commodity and crop \ninsurance programs. The vast majority of the spending in this bill goes \nfor nutrition. Mr. President, 79 percent of the spending in this bill \ngoes for nutrition programs. Only 14 percent goes for what could \ntraditionally be considered farm programs. The farm provisions \nconstitute less than one-third of 1 percent of total Federal spending. \nThat is a bargain for American consumers and taxpayers.\n  The truth is, our producers face stiff international competition. In \n2010, our major competitors--the Europeans--outspent us almost 4 to 1 \nin providing support for their farmers and ranchers. And the EU is not \nthe only culprit. Brazil, Argentina, China, and others are gaining \nunfair market advantages through hidden subsidies such as currency \nmanipulation, market access restrictions, and input subsidies that the \nWTO is incapable of disciplining.\n  The reality is that farming is a risky business. Not only do farmers \nand ranchers have to deal with unfair global competition, they also \nhave to face\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nnatural disasters and unpredictable price fluctuations.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee, working together in a bipartisan \nway, will contribute over $23 billion to deficit reduction. That is \ntwice as much as the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission recommended--\ntwice the savings that the Simpson-Bowles commission recommended. In so \ndoing, the committee has provided more than its fair share of fixing \nthis country's deficit and debt problems. If the rest of the committees \nof Congress did what this committee has done under the leadership of \nSenator Stabenow, there would be no deficit and debt problem. That is a \nfact.\n  This is also a reform bill. This is the strongest reform bill that \nhas gone through a committee of Congress in the history of farm \nlegislation, and the chairwoman and ranking member can be incredibly \nproud of the leadership they have provided.\n  This legislation streamlines conservation programs, reducing the \nnumber of programs, and making them simpler to understand and \nadminister. It reauthorizes important nutrition programs for 5 years, \nhelping millions of Americans.\n  I also want to thank Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin and the eight \nother sponsors on the Ag Committee for joining me in an amendment to \ncontinue funding for key rural energy programs. We are spending almost \n$1 billion a day importing foreign energy. How much better off would we \nbe as a Nation if that money stayed here in the United States, instead \nof looking to the Middle East, if we could look to the Midwest for our \nenergy supplies? This legislation will help move us in that direction.\n  In addition, I want to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Hoeven for \nworking with me to pass an amendment that will improve the bill for \nfarmers in our part of the country. I am also pleased the new farm bill \nwill continue the livestock disaster programs that are so important to \nour ranchers when feed losses or livestock deaths occur due to \ndisaster-related conditions.\n  This legislation is the product of countless hours of deliberation, \nand to reach this point was no easy task. However, I still have some \nconcerns about this legislation.\n  I am concerned that the new Agriculture Risk Coverage, or ARC, \nprogram will not do enough if agriculture prices collapse again, as \nthey have done so many times in the past.\n  For those of you who do not believe that crop prices can fall again, \nI will tell you that I have heard that argument before. In 1996, many \nsaid that we had reached a new plateau of high prices, so Congress put \nin place the freedom to farm legislation that removed price supports. \nTwo years later, Congress had to pass the largest farm disaster program \nin history because prices had crashed and farmers were going under. I \nwill continue to work to ensure that we improve these provisions before \nthe final passage of this bill so that we do not find ourselves in that \nsituation again.\n  It is vital that we pass a farm bill, and it is just as vital that we \nmake sure these programs continue to work for American producers and \nconsumers.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairwoman and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do we have on the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Eighteen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to the farm bill. Let me point out what \nthe distinguished chairwoman and the distinguished Senator who has just \nspoken have already pointed out--and it bears repeating; I know it is \nsomewhat repetitive if people have been paying attention to the remarks \nwe have had here prior to this vote--but this is a reform bill at a \ntime in which reforms are demanded. It saves $23.6 billion in mandatory \nspending. They are real cuts. They are real deficit savings. It \naccomplishes this by reforming, reducing, and streamlining programs.\n  We eliminate four commodity programs. These programs are very \ndifficult to go through at the FSA office, the Farm Service Agency we \nhave. So when farmers have come in to try to wade through the four \ncommodity programs, they have always been terribly difficult and \ncomplex.\n  We streamline the 23 conservation programs into 13 and eliminate \nduplication. We tighten a major loophole in nutrition programs. We cut \n16 rural development authorizations. We cut over 60 authorizations in \nthe research title and streamline programs.\n  In whole, we cut and/or streamline over 100 programs. Show me another \ncommittee that has done that on a voluntary basis. There is not any in \nthe House or the Senate.\n  We have had speech after speech after speech after speech--heartfelt \nspeeches--why can't you work together back there in Washington and do \nwhat is right for the American people and quit spending money we do not \nhave? We had a supercommittee that worked on this for a considerable \namount of time. I do not question anybody's intent who had that tough \njob. At that time, we offered to the supercommittee a package that \ncould have been done at that particular time. But we did it--``we'' \nmeaning the chairwoman and myself and members of the committee, and \nstaff as well, who worked extremely hard.\n  So there has not been anybody else who has come forward and said: \nHere is real deficit reduction. That is why we should support the \nmotion to proceed. We have made the tough decisions because that is \nwhat you do in rural America--whether it is in Michigan, Kansas, the \nDakotas, or Nebraska. Because that is what you do when budgets are \ntight and you need to get things done.\n  Those in rural America are also why we need to get this bill done. \nThe current law expires September 30. How many things around here are \nin purgatory? Tax extenders, the tax bill, what we call the tax cliff \nthat we are looking at over here if we do not get things done, the \nspecter of a lameduck Congress--in 3 weeks trying to get things done \nlike that. And you put folks in purgatory where they cannot make any \ndecisions.\n  Well, it would be a disaster in rural America if we do not pass this \nlaw before we revert back to the permanent 1949 law. That law in no way \nreflects current production or domestic and international markets. And \nI would say, even if we extend the current law, it does not reflect \nwhat we need as of today. That law goes back to base acres of 25 years \nago. We are talking about planted acres as of today. So basically it \nwould be government-controlled agriculture on steroids, and it would \nalso mean that virtually all programs in the current law would expire.\n  We cannot let that happen. We need certainty. Farmers need certainty. \nRanchers need certainty. Bankers need certainty. Everybody up and down \nevery Main Street in rural America needs certainty. Agribusiness needs \ncertainty. We need it because our farmers and ranchers and their \nbankers need to know what the farm bill and the programs are going to \nlook like.\n  In farming, you have to go to your banker every year to get an \noperating loan for the coming year. We raise winter wheat in Kansas. We \nare known for that. Kansas is known as the ``wheat State.'' It will be \nplanted in September. That means farmers will be going to their bankers \nas early as late July--next month--or early August to get their \noperating notes for the coming year. Without certainty in the farm \nbill, it is more difficult to make any economic projection, and it is \nmore difficult for farmers to obtain loans and for bankers and farm \ncredit to provide that credit. That is why we need to get it done now \nin their behalf. Rural America needs to know the rules of the game.\n  Just as importantly, American taxpayers are demanding government \nreforms and reduced deficit spending. This bill delivers on both \nfronts. It is true reform.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  Let's get this bill done. I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion \nto proceed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before turning to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, I want, one more time, to say what a pleasure it \nhas been--and continues to be--to work with the senior Senator from \nKansas. This has been a partnership effort. It has been a strong \nbipartisan effort. And I look forward to continuing to have that be the \ncase as we move to get this bill done.\n  Now I wish to yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska. And \nI thank Senator Nelson for his strong advocacy for rural development, \nfor helping us make these true reforms. He has been a strong advocate \nfor the reforms in the commodity title, moving us to a risk-based \nsystem. He has been a strong advocate for crop insurance and for \nconservation, EQIP--things that are important, I know, to Nebraska.\n  This is also someone whom we are going to dearly miss on the \ncommittee and in the Senate at the end of the year. I think I may put \nthe Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from North Dakota in a room \ntogether, lock the door, and not let them leave, because they are both \nso invaluable.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Senator for her strong efforts in \nbringing together this very important reform bill. We are moving in the \nright direction now with farm policy, moving away from protectionism, \nmoving away from outmoded programs to something that certainly is, in \ntoday's world, important; that is, a safety net but a safety net that \ninvolves risk management as opposed to direct farm payments.\n  This is particularly important to the State of Nebraska and all our \nproducers. We are No. 1 in production of many commodities, from red \nmeat to great northern beans; second in the Nation in the production of \nethanol, pumping more than 2 billion gallons of this homegrown fuel \ninto our energy supply every year.\n  Our productive farmers and ranchers in Nebraska make us fifth in the \nNation in agricultural receipts. While nearly one-third of all Nebraska \njobs are related to agriculture, it is our No. 1 industry. Given that \nimportance to my State, I truly appreciate the work that has been done \nand the strong bipartisan support of 16 to 5 to get this bill out from \nthe committee to the floor.\n  Truly it is about reform. It creates a market-oriented safety net. It \neliminates direct farm subsidy payments. It streamlines and simplifies \nand consolidates programs and at the same time creates jobs, helping \nour economy grow.\n  I would like to emphasize one point again. This major reform moves us \naway from government controls on production and moves us toward the \nprivate market to help sustain American agriculture, going in the right \ndirection. It does all that while also making, as it has been noted, a \nsubstantial contribution, more than $23 billion, to deficit reduction. \nThat sets the example of how Washington can begin to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. Our bipartisan work in the agriculture bill is \nimportant. It demonstrates that we can work together, particularly when \nit comes to deficit reduction and finding new ways to do things in a \ndifferent way.\n  Turning to the reforms, by ending duplication and consolidating \nprograms, the bill eliminates more than 100 programs or authorizations. \nIt contains strong payment limitation language. Funding programs for \nthose who do not need them is nothing short of agricultural welfare. \nProducers in my State understand we cannot keep funding programs for \nthose who do not need them, nor should we.\n  They understand we do need to fund programs for those who are in \nneed, particularly given our national fiscal problems. We need to \nprioritize better. So the bill ends those outdated subsidies, ensuring \nthat farmers will not be paid for crops they are not growing on land \nthey are not planting, and ends direct farm payments, saving taxpayers \n$15 billion on that program alone. That is a lot of money, even in \nWashington terms.\n  As we end those subsidies, the farm bill establishes that crop \ninsurance will be the focal point of risk management, as it should, by \nstrengthening crop insurance and expanding access so farmers are not \nwiped out by a few days of bad weather. This allows farmers and \nranchers on their own to select the best risk management for their \nproduction needs, rather than having to rely on the sometimes good will \nof the government to bail them out in periods of volatility.\n  At the same time, one of the greatest challenges farmers face is the \nrisk that prices will decline or collapse over several years. When \nthings are good, people never expect them to go bad. When they are bad, \nthey are worried they will never go good. Insurance will not cover \nmultiyear price plunges. This leaves farmers exposed to high costs and \nlow prices, and that can put them out of business.\n  In the Agriculture Committee, we worked to address this risk by \ncreating the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, a program that \nprovides producers with a very simple choice to determine how best to \nmanage their operation's risk. It seeks to strike a better balance with \nthis market-oriented approach. We want farmers to stay in farming, but \nwe do not want them to farm Federal programs.\n  To conclude, this is a solid reform-minded start. In my mind, it \nstrikes the right balance between the need to cut spending while \nmaintaining a strong safety net to ensure a stable supply of food, \nfeed, fuel, and fiber. It is my hope that we will act on this bill soon \nand that the House will follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the Republicans have time remaining.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the \ndistinguished chairwoman and thank her so much for this team effort \nthat has brought this excellent farm bill to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we bring this time to a close, I just \nonce again wished to thank my ranking member and friend Senator \nRoberts. I wish to thank all the members of the committee. We had some \ntough negotiations. We had a strong bipartisan vote. As with any farm \nbill, there are still improvements we can make, and we are committed to \ndoing that as we move forward.\n  But, overall, what we see before us is a true reform bill, cutting \nover $23 billion from the deficit, the first authorizing committee to \ndo that, cutting or consolidating about 100 different authorizations or \nprograms. That, frankly, is unheard of. We have done that while \nstrengthening the farm safety net, moving to a risk-based system, \nstrengthening conservation. I am very proud that we have 643 different \nconservation groups supporting this bill. All together, we are moving \nforward on a strong agriculture, reform, food and jobs bill.\n  I hope colleagues will join us in a very strong vote to proceed to \nthis bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The cloture motion \nhaving been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to \nread the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 415, S. 3240, a bill to reauthorize \n     agricultural programs through 2017, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Debbie Stabenow, Carl Levin, Kent Conrad, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Herb Kohl, Patrick J.

Mr. President, political leaders on the Democratic side \nof the aisle are now preemptively charging the Supreme Court with \njudicial activism if that Court would strike down President Obama's \nhealth care law as unconstitutional. I cannot remember when such a \nsignificant threat to judicial independence was made in attempting to \naffect the outcome of a pending case. It is an outrageous attack on the \nseparation of powers.\n  Democrats claim unless the Court rules in accordance with the policy \npreferences of a particular speaker, the Court's decision would be \nillegitimate. This is dangerous and this is wrong.\n  President Obama wrongly argued it would be unprecedented for the \nSupreme Court to strike down a law that a large congressional majority \npassed. He was wrong on the size of the majority, and he was wrong \nabout the Supreme Court's history in striking down laws they consider \nunconstitutional. The President of the United States knows better \nbecause he is a former constitutional law lecturer. He should know the \nSupreme Court has done just that on many occasions over more than two \ncenturies, and it is just not the case, as Democrats claim, that the \nSupreme Court can strike down ObamaCare only by failing to follow \nestablished commerce clause jurisprudence.\n  When the Judiciary Committee held a hearing last year on the \nconstitutionality of the law, I asked whether the Supreme Court would \nneed to overturn any of its precedents to strike down the individual \nmandate part of the health care reform. None of the witnesses--and most \nof those witnesses were selected by the majority Democrats--could \nidentify a single precedent that would have to be struck down. No \nmatter how many times liberals repeat the statement, it is just not \nso--the Supreme Court would not be an activist court if it struck down \nhealth care reform.\n  What is unprecedented is health care reform's infringement on \npersonal liberty. The Constitution establishes a very limited Federal \nGovernment. But when the Supreme Court asked him the obvious question \nof what limit to Federal power would exist if the individual mandate \nwere upheld, the Solicitor General, arguing for the government and in \nsupport of the constitutionality, could not and did not provide an \nanswer.\n  So the Obama administration believes the Federal Government can force \nAmericans to purchase broccoli or gym memberships, and don't believe \nanyone who says otherwise once we start down that road of unprecedented \npower of the Federal Government under the commerce clause.\n  Critics contend that the whole body of law allowing Federal \nregulation of the economy would be threatened if the Supreme Court \nstruck down the health care reform bill. They even say that such a \nruling would harm the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That is just \nplain nonsense. The Supreme Court has never addressed a law like this. \nStriking down ObamaCare would have no effect on any other existing law.\n  The real change in the law--and to the country as a whole--would be \nif the health care reform bill were upheld as constitutional. People \nunderstand this instinctively. A recent Gallup poll found that 72 \npercent of Americans--including even 56 percent of people who call \nthemselves Democrats--believe the individual mandate is \nunconstitutional. So they clearly would accept the legitimacy of a \nruling striking down the individual mandate.\n  There is a constitutional law professor I am familiar with who leans \non the conservative side. He rarely discusses his work with his young \nchildren. But the health care case has generated such attention that \nhis 8-year-old son asked him about it. The father explained that the \ncase involved whether the government could make people buy health \ninsurance. This is what his 8-year-old son said: ``They can't do that. \nThis is a free country.'' So even 8-year-olds understand the overreach \nof health care reform.\n  Unlike the supporters of ObamaCare, who really never bothered to \nthink through the law's constitutionality before passing it, most \nAmericans understand that this law threatens our freedom unlike any \nprevious law. And I expect that the Supreme Court will agree. They \nunderstand that the law is not compatible with the Constitution and \nmust be struck down.\n  It is ridiculous to claim that striking down this law would be \njudicial activism. A ruling that ObamaCare is unconstitutional would \nrecognize that the law departed from the text of the Constitution, the \nvery structure of our federalism, and even against the history of our \ncountry.\n  As former Judge McConnell has written, judicial activism cannot be \ndefined one way when the meaning of actual constitutional text is at \nissue and another way when the words of the Constitution are silent on \nquestions such as same-sex marriage and abortion. This is what Judge \nMcConnell wrote:\n\n       [T]here cannot be one set of rules for liberal justices and \n     another set for conservatives.\n\n  By threatening the Court in advance, the critics are showing that \nthey now have real doubts that the health care reform bill is \nconstitutional. Whether addressed to an individual Justice or to the \nCourt as a whole, claims that only one possible result can be reached \nor the Court's ruling would be illegitimate are shockingly improper \nattempts to influence a pending case.\n  But all the Justices seem to have agreed to combat what they see as \nany threat to their judicial independence. I suspect that inappropriate \nattempts to influence the Court's decisions on pending cases will \nbackfire. They will make the Justices more determined than ever to show \nthat they are adhering to their oath to defend the Constitution without \nregard to popular opinion. They will never want their rulings to appear \nto have been the result of political browbeating. So let the\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nJustices undertake their proper responsibility in deciding the \nconstitutionality of health care reform. Let them do it without \nthreatening to pillory them in advance if we do not like the outcome. \nThere is always time for reasoned criticism after any ruling and \nparticularly this ruling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to respond to what I believe \nare irresponsible and dangerous attacks on the legitimacy of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  Over a 3-day period, beginning on March 26 of this year, the Supreme \nCourt held more than 6 hours of oral argument to address the \nconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. I was privileged to \nattend each of those sessions, and I can say that as a lifelong student \nof the Constitution and as one who served as a law clerk at the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, I was very interested to not only watch the \narguments but also to read many of the briefs and follow each of the \nproceedings very closely.\n  Like so many others who watched or read those proceedings, I was most \nimpressed by the quality of the questions, the quality of the advocacy, \nand the overall discussion that took place in the Supreme Court. \nThrough their questions, the Justices showed keen interest in the \nnature of the arguments made in support of ObamaCare. For example, \nJustice Kennedy asked whether, under the administration's theory of the \ncommerce clause, there could be any meaningful limitation on the \nFederal Government's power under the commerce clause. He asked \nspecifically, ``Can you create commerce in order to regulate it?'' Such \nquestions and hypotheticals are common and they are a useful way by \nwhich lawyers and judges tend to test the basic principled limits \nenshrined in our Constitution.\n  If the Federal Government may compel commerce so that it may regulate \nthe resulting commercial activity, there would arguably be little, if \nany, limit to the scope of Federal power. There would be no aspect of \nour individual lives that the Federal Government could not dictate and \ncontrol. Such an all-powerful authority is, of course, flatly \ninconsistent with the Constitution's doctrine of enumerated powers--\nthis principle that is perhaps more well-settled than any other \nprinciple within our almost 225-year-old founding era document.\n\n  Based on the Justices' questions and oral argument, many \ncommentators--myself included--have predicted that the Supreme Court \nmay well choose to invalidate the individual mandate of the Affordable \nCare Act. Apparently anticipating this possible outcome, some of my \ncolleagues, as well as President Obama, have made statements suggesting \nthat it would somehow be improper for the Supreme Court to invalidate \nthe Affordable Care Act. They have asserted that striking down an act \nof Congress such as this one would somehow amount to judicial activism \nand that that would otherwise be wildly inappropriate. They have \ncriticized some of the questions asked by individual Justices, and they \nhave even gone so far as to suggest that those Justices who might vote \nto invalidate the Affordable Care Act would do so for reasons \nrepresenting bias or partisan political motivations. This reminds me of \nthe old saying that you can often tell in a particular game which team \nis losing by which side happens to be yelling at the referee.\n  In response to these false and, frankly, reckless statements, I would \nlike to make three points.\n  First, attempts to manipulate or to bully the Supreme Court, \nespecially during deliberations in a particular proceeding, are \nirresponsible, and they tend to threaten the very fabric of our \nconstitutional Republic. Each Justice has sworn an oath to support, \ndefend, and bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and to \ndischarge his or her duties faithfully and impartially.\n  From time to time, politicians and others may disagree with the Court \nas to important constitutional issues or even on the merits of a \nparticular case. I certainly feel that way myself from time to time. \nBut it is simply inappropriate for elected representatives--who \nthemselves have sworn an oath to the Constitution--in a spirit of \npartisanship, to question the honesty and impartiality of our Nation's \nhighest Court in what could be perceived as part of an effort on the \npart of those elected politicians to influence a case pending before \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Second, criticisms of the well-established principle of judicial \nreview grossly misrepresent how our constitutional Republic functions.\n  President Obama and some Members of this body have suggested that the \njudiciary--which they sometimes denigrate as a group of unelected \npeople--should simply defer to Congress. But, of course, each branch of \ngovernment, including the judiciary, has an essential duty under the \nConstitution to police its own actions, to make sure that its own \nactions comply with the text, the spirit, and the letter of the \nConstitution.\n  Congress and the executive branch should police themselves to make \nsure they don't transgress those limits. But when the political \nbranches happen to overstep their own boundaries, their own legitimate \nlimits--as I believe happened with the individual mandate--the Supreme \nCourt can and indeed must enforce the Constitution.\n  In a recent appearance before the Judiciary Committee, Justice Breyer \nexplained, ``We are the boundary patrol.'' The Constitution sets \nboundaries, of course. That is what is at issue here. This foundational \nprinciple applies to popular laws just as much as it applies to \nunpopular laws.\n  The vast majority of Americans--about 74 percent, according to one \nrecent poll--oppose the ObamaCare individual mandate. The Supreme Court \nwill not strike it down merely because it is unpopular, but the Court \nmust do so if the mandate exceeds the authority granted to Congress \nunder the Constitution. That is what is at issue.\n  Third and finally, it simply is not the case that a court can \nproperly be described as activist just because it enforces the \nConstitution's structural limits on Federal power. In this context, it \nis not altogether helpful to focus the discussion of whether the Court \nis acting properly on the contours of the words ``activist'' or \n``activism.'' We have to remember that, for the Supreme Court, not \nacting to invalidate an unconstitutional law is every bit as bad, is \nevery bit as repugnant to the rule of law and to the Constitution as it \nis for the Court to act to invalidate a law that is entirely justified \non a constitutional basis. Both represent, both are the product of a \nbetrayal of the Supreme Court's duty to decide cases according to the \nlaws and to the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  When the Supreme Court acts to enforce the Constitution's limits on \nFederal power--as I expect it may do in the Affordable Care Act case--\nit does so pursuant to specific textual provisions of the Constitution. \nEnforcing the law in this undeniably legitimate matter is not activist; \nrather, it is an essential function of the judiciary in preserving the \nliberties guaranteed by our Constitution. Among those liberties, of \ncourse, are those protected by perhaps the most important fundamental \ncomponent of the Constitution, this notion that we are all protected \nwhen the power of Congress and the power of the Federal Government as a \nwhole is restricted. This is why James Madison appropriately observed \nthat it was with good reason that the Founding Fathers reserved to the \nStates powers that he described as numerous and indefinite, while \ndescribing those powers that were vested in this body as few and \ndefined. We are all safer, we are all more free, we are all more \nprosperous to the extent that we stand by this most important \nfundamental precept of the Constitution. That is what is at issue in \nthis case.\n  I hope and I trust that, moving forward, President Obama and my \ncolleagues in this body will refrain from attempting to bully the \nSupreme Court or seeking to misrepresent the Court's important work in \nfulfilling its constitutional duties. Let's stop yelling at the \nreferees and let the Supreme Court do its job while we do ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak to this same question. As \neveryone knows, a ruling on the constitutionality of ObamaCare is \nexpected\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nlater this month. I think it is important that it be done in the right \ncontext. A lot of our Democratic colleagues have made clear their view \nthat if the ruling doesn't go the way they want it to, it is not \nbecause they passed an unconstitutional law but rather, in their view, \nbecause it is some kind of a partisan activity by judicial activists \nand a lot of attention has been specifically focused on Chief Justice \nRoberts. This should not stand.\n  The President himself actually started this, I think, when he said:\n\n       I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what \n     would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning \n     a law that was passed by a strong majority of a \n     democratically elected Congress.\n\n  Never mind it was not passed by a strong majority--and, by the way, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee said something very recently, \nbasically issuing a warning to Chief Justice Roberts on the floor of \nthe Senate, stating that a 5-to-4 decision to overturn the law would be \ncontroversial. ``I trust he will be a Chief Justice for all of us and \nthat he has a strong institutional sense of the proper role of the \njudicial branch.'' In other words, the intimation here is if the \ndecision doesn't go their way, the Court's reputation, and specifically \nthe reputation of Chief Justice Roberts, is on the line.\n  The Wall Street Journal wrote about this, and others have, talking \nabout threats by the President and certain other members of his party \nwith warnings that:\n\n       Mr. Roberts has a choice--either uphold ObamaCare, or be \n     portrayed a radical who wants to repeal the New Deal and a \n     century of precedent.\n\n  Let's clear up a few things. First of all, as I said, the law was not \npassed by a strong majority of Congress, it was passed exclusively by \nDemocrats. Not a single Republican supported it. It was the first time \nin history that major domestic legislation was passed by one party.\n  That is not the key point in terms of the constitutionality of the \nlaw, however. The key point is that the Court's job is, as Chief \nJustice Roberts said at his confirmation hearing, to work as an umpire, \ncalling the balls and strikes as the Court sees them. Nonlegal \narguments, such as the Court's decisions have to be popular or \nunanimous--those are just unserious and frankly political rhetoric.\n  We all know that in 1803, in the Marbury v. Madison case, the U.S. \nSupreme Court established the review of congressional action under \narticle III of the Constitution. Since then, courts have overturned \nhundreds of laws. It would hardly be, therefore, unprecedented or \nextraordinary for the Court to overturn a congressional enactment as \nthe President has said. As the Supreme Court noted in that case, courts \ndetermining whether acts of the legislative branch are consistent with \nthe Constitution is ``of the very essence of judicial duty.'' The Court \nfurther noted that ``the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act \nof the legislature.'' If the two conflict, ``the Constitution and not \nsuch ordinary act must govern the case to which they both apply.''\n  The actual substance of the case which Democrats seem eager to avoid \ntalking about is that ObamaCare, if upheld, empowers the Federal \nGovernment to order its citizens to purchase particular goods and \nservices that the government believes its citizens must have. That sort \nof all-powerful Federal Government is at odds with the concept of \nenumerated powers, as is creating commerce in order to regulate it, as \nJustice Kennedy intimated at the oral argument.\n  This is why a significant majority of Americans dislike the law. They \nknow the Constitution is meant to place limits on the power of our \nGovernment in order to protect the freedom of the people.\n  I can't guess how the Court is going to rule. It may not agree with \nmy views. But I suggest that political leaders in the executive and \nlegislative branches need to cool their rhetoric, as my colleague said, \nstop yelling at the umpire and stop the thinly veiled threats and react \nto the ruling after it is rendered, rather than before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the Chair advise me when 5 minutes \nhave elapsed.\n  I wish to add a few more words to what has already been said by some \nof our most distinguished lawyers in the Senate; that is, it is not \ncontroversial that, since 1803, the doctrine of judicial review, as \ndecided by the U.S. Supreme Court, has held in essence that it is the \nresponsibility of the judiciary, the Supreme Court, to say what the law \nis. Congress has its role and the Court has its role and they are \ndifferent. We can tell one reason they are different is because \nCongress is elected every 6 years in the Senate, every 2 years in the \nHouse. We are accountable to the people for our decisions, for the \npolicies we vote for and against. That is why we are called the \npolitical branches of government, as is the executive branch. The \nPresident stands for election. In essence, every Presidential election, \nevery congressional election is a referendum on the people and the \npolicies they embrace.\n  The role of the Supreme Court and Federal courts is very different, \nas we all know. It is kind of remarkable to me that we are having this \nconversation, but it is necessitated by the fact that the President and \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee have--at \ndifferent times and different places--questioned the legitimacy of the \nSupreme Court performing this function, which Chief Justice John \nMarshall wrote about in 1803 in Marbury v. Madison, that it is the \nrole, the emphatic duty of the Court to say what the law is.\n  If it is Congress's responsibility to write the policies and to write \nlegislation, how is it different from the judiciary? Sometimes the \njudiciary interprets that legislation, trying to figure out what \nCongress intended. But in the area of constitutional review, more \nfundamentally they want to make sure Congress has stayed within the \nlimits imposed upon it by the American people when they ratified the \nU.S. Constitution. Of course, that is the big decision in the health \ncare case.\n\n  It is almost unprecedented. We probably have to go back to the 19th \ncentury to find where the Supreme Court gave so much time for advocates \nto argue a Supreme Court case. Ordinarily, it is very strict time \nlimits. But here the Court set 3 days' worth of arguments down because \nof the importance of the case and importance of the issues that the \nCourt will be called upon to decide.\n  My colleagues have already talked about the fact that the individual \nmandate has been the focus of so much attention. It is not the only \nissue. There is another very important issue in terms of whether the \nCongress and the Federal Government can commandeer State resources \nthrough a huge expansion in Medicaid, which is then forced down on the \nStates that they then have to accommodate within their State balanced \nbudget requirements. But on the individual mandate, certainly we saw \nhow the Solicitor General of the United States stumbled, not because he \nis inarticulate or incapable--he is very articulate, he is a very \ncapable lawyer--but he simply did not have a good argument to make when \nhe was asked what is the principle limitation on the Federal \nGovernment's authority under the commerce clause if the Federal \nGovernment can do this. Stated another way, what is it that the \nCongress cannot do, the Federal Government cannot do, if they can force \nus to buy a government-approved product and then fine us if we do not \ndo that, which is the individual mandated argument.\n  I don't think it is a controversial topic, and I am surprised we even \nfind ourselves here, responding to the Congress's remarks and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee's remarks questioning the authority \nthat existed since 1810 in Marbury v. Madison, the doctrine of judicial \nreview and the role of the judiciary to say what the fundamental law of \nthe land allows and does not allow in terms of Federal power.\n  There is another argument being made; that is, that if the Supreme \nCourt comes out and disagrees with Congress on the health care law, \nthat somehow its legitimacy will be jeopardized. I do not think public \nopinion polls have or should have anything to do with the way the \nSupreme Court decides an issue because their focus should be on the \nConstitution and not on the policy arguments. In other words, they \nshould not interfere with our role to make policy because, of course, \nwe are then held accountable to the voters while they are given life \ntenure and they are given the protection\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nof no reduction in their salary during their service on the bench--\nexactly for the reason they need to be protected from public opinion \nbecause their role is to focus on the Constitution.\n  I close by saying, according to a recent poll, 74 percent of \nAmericans want the Court to strike down the individual mandate. Were \nthe Court to do that, it would hardly undermine the legitimacy of the \nCourt if the Court happened to, by coincidence, render a decision that \nthe majority of Americans would agree with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the agriculture bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent to speaking as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the speech given \non health care reform, and I would like to put in perspective what the \nchallenge is that faces America. Absent health care reform, absent a \nchange in the growing increase in the cost of medical care, not only \nfamilies but businesses and governments will find it impossible to \nadequately fund the health care Americans need. If we do not come \ntogether, as we tried with our health care reform bill, and dedicate \nourselves to reducing the increase in the growth of the cost of medical \ncare and do it with an assurance of quality being protected, then the \nnet result of all this, I am afraid, is going to end up with America \nwith medical bills it cannot pay.\n  We find as we look at government programs--Medicare, Medicaid, \nveterans programs, for example--that if we do not change the projected \nrate of growth of cost in these programs, in just a short period of \ntime, the Federal budget of America will be consumed by health care \ncosts and interest on the national debt to the exclusion of everything \nelse.\n  I just heard my friend, the Senator from Texas, speak against \nindividual mandates. The word ``mandate,'' I am sure, rubs many people \nthe wrong way. But let's take a look at what that individual mandate \nis. From my point of view, it is a question of individual \nresponsibility, whether individuals in this country have a \nresponsibility to have health insurance.\n  Some argue of course not; they do not. Yet the reality is that if we \ndo not have some sort of individual responsibility, the people without \nhealth insurance will get sick, present themselves at the hospital, be \ntaken care of, and their expenses will be shifted to all the rest of \nus, to everyone else. So to argue that people have no responsibility to \nhave health insurance is an argument against individual responsibility \nand an argument that others should have to pay for the medical bills of \nthose who have no insurance. That, to me, is unfair as well.\n  We had, within the Health Care Reform Act, protection against \nexpensive premiums. We limited the amount an individual would have to \npay for health insurance to 8 percent of their income. We provided \nspecial help to those in lower income categories. I think that in \nitself is an effort to strike the right balance.\n  I have been given a note by the staff that the Republican side has \ntime left. I see my colleague, the Senator from Alabama, has come to \nthe floor. I will yield to him at this point and resume after he has \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know the Senator is the assistant \nleader. The majority has a lot of things to do. If he would like to \nfinish now, I would be pleased to yield.\n  The American people are all worried about the direction of our \ncountry and for a good reason; they have witnessed a growing disregard \nfor the Constitution and the limits that it places on the federal \ngovernment. Our Government is a government of limited powers. In \nessence, I hear my friend and colleague and able advocate Senator \nDurbin say the question is about medical care. The question is about, \nhe thinks, that it is unfair that some people do not buy insurance and \ntherefore we ought to make them buy insurance. He thinks that is \nunfair.\n  We had a nearly year-long debate in this Congress, and Senator Durbin \nprevailed by a single vote, before Senator Brown could be confirmed to \nkill the health care bill. They were able to pass it through with an \ninterim Senator by a single vote and it passed. But that is not what I \nand Senator Cornyn and others are here to talk about today. The point \ntoday is, Should the Supreme Court of the United States decide this \nquestion as a matter of law and principle or should they divine what \nthey think the people want--although the polls show the American people \nconsistently oppose this legislation and never supported it, ever, but \nit was rammed through anyway. So they want to say: This is important. \nWe think it is unfair--even though the polling data shows people don't \nwant this law--and the Supreme Court should uphold the law and \nshouldn't worry about a little thing like the Constitution and limited \npowers.\n\n  So that is what I want to talk about today. I want to affirm the duty \nof the Supreme Court of the United States, and that duty is to fairly \nand objectively interpret the Constitution and to render justice, not \nbased on polling data and not based on congressional desire.\n  Polling data shows that the American people overwhelmingly think the \nlaw is an impermissible, unconstitutional regulation, so it is \ndifficult for me to say this is such a matter that the Supreme Court \nhas to acknowledge a minority view and approve it even if the \nConstitution doesn't agree. I don't think that is an argument that can \nbe sustained, in my view.\n  Since the oral arguments in the case, in my view--and a lot of my \ncolleagues share this view--the President himself, Democrats in the \nHouse and the Senate, their friends in the media and liberal \ngovernment, pro-health care advocates have stepped up undignified and \nunjustified attacks on the Court, which seems to me to be a pretty \ntransparent effort to try to influence the decision of an independent \nbranch of government. It also seems to me an attempt--since I have been \na student of this for some time now--to lay the groundwork and to \ndeclare that the Supreme Court is somehow illegitimate if they don't \nrender a verdict in line with one that my colleagues think should be \nrendered.\n  I will say parenthetically that 2 years ago when this passed 60 to \n40, it took 60 votes to pass it. It wouldn't pass today. It wouldn't \neven come close to having 60 votes today because the American people \nspoke and sent home a lot of people who voted for this bill when they \ndidn't want them voting for it. That was a big deal in the election, \nfrankly, if you want to talk about that.\n  So this philosophy that we hear advocated is a dangerous philosophy \nof law and jurisprudence. It is results-oriented. It is political, not \nlaw, and it surely is contrary to the great heritage of law that this \ncountry has been so blessed with. It may be that my colleagues are \nconcerned because when pressed by the Supreme Court Justices during \noral argument, the Solicitor General of the United States seemed to be \nutterly incapable of identifying any limiting principle on government \npower. The Solicitor General proffered various reasons why health care \nis unique, but not one of them was effectively grounded on any \nconstitutional text, principle, or theory--at least in my view.\n  People can disagree. The Justices will have the final word on it. The \nnonlegal argument that the Court should not overturn a popular law \nsuggested by many is, of course, irrelevant, not only because this \nhealth care law is, in fact, unpopular, but because popularity does not \ntranslate into constitutionality. Of course, under the popularity \ntheory, it would be wrong for the Court to strike down the Defense of \nMarriage Act, which the administration has decided is unconstitutional \nand refuses to defend in court, even though the law was so popular that \nit passed 342 to 67 in the House and 85 to 14 in the Senate. So making \nthe popularity argument revealed the lack of legal argument. It \ncondemns such advocates as advocates against law, not for law.\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\n  Supporters of the health care law have disdainfully and consistently \ndismissed the notion, and it was done during the debate, that the \nlegislation raised serious constitutional questions. I remember the \ndebate in the Senate. This disdain was no more starkly demonstrated \nthan when a reporter asked then-Speaker of the House of Representatives \nNancy Pelosi what the constitutional basis was for the statute, and she \ncondescendingly replied: Are you serious?\n  Is our time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how long might the majority leader \nexpect to be, and if it is possible to have consent to speak an \nadditional 5 minutes after the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be recognized for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the majority leader is extremely busy, and I \nappreciate his courtesy and respect with the difficult duty he has \nhere.\n  She said: Are you serious? Well, when the Solicitor General of the \nUnited States was being grilled by the Justices, I have to say it \nlooked serious then. It is axiomatic that the Commerce clause--which is \nthe provision in the Constitution that the law's supporters argue gives \nthe government the power to take over health care--was never understood \nto grant unlimited power to the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment, without doubt, is a government of limited powers.\n  It certainly never meant that Congress could regulate noncommerce \nunder the power to regulate commerce. We can't regulate noncommerce \nwhen the only power the Federal Government is given is the power to \nregulate commerce. Give me a break.\n  As distinguished Judge Roger Vinson stated in his opinion in this \ncase when he struck this bill down:\n\n       It would be a radical departure from existing law to hold \n     that Congress can regulate inactivity under the Commerce \n     clause. If it has the power to compel an otherwise passive \n     individual into a commercial transaction with a third party \n     merely by asserting--as it was done in the Act--that \n     compelling the actual transaction is itself ``commercial and \n     economic in nature, and substantially affects interstate \n     commerce,'' it is not hyperbolizing to suggest that Congress \n     could do almost anything it wanted . . . If Congress can \n     penalize a passive individual for failing to engage in \n     commerce, the enumeration of powers in the Constitution would \n     have been in vain, for it would be ``difficult to perceive \n     any limitation on federal power'' (Lopez), and we would have \n     a Constitution in name only. Surely this is not what the \n     Founding Fathers could have intended.\n\n  It is a serious question. The Supreme Court needs to decide it, and \nthey don't need to have Congress trying to pressure them one way or the \nother.\n  The President of the United States, President Obama, might think that \nit is, in his words ``unprecedented'' or ``extraordinary'' for the \nCourt to strike down a clearly unconstitutional statute, but it is not. \nThe Supreme Court has a duty under the Constitution and under the \npowers of the judiciary to speak clearly if Congress passes a law that \nviolates the Constitution, that assumes powers Congress does not have, \nand that attempts to act in ways on behalf of the Federal Government \nthat the Constitution never gave the government the power to do. They \nhave a duty to strike it down.\n\n  The Court's reputation would be damaged if it bows to political \nbullying, but it won't be damaged if it follows the Constitution. I \nthink it is wrong to disparage and threaten the Court during the \npendency of a case in order to influence the outcome. I don't have any \nproblem with criticizing a decision if I disagree with it, but to try \nto politically pressure the Court I think is wrong for us to do.\n  These are important questions of law. I have an opinion, but the \nCourt has a duty. That duty is to decide the case before them \nimpartially, as a neutral umpire, and without regard to the crowd \nnoise. I believe they will do their duty, and we all await the outcome.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Productivity of Congress\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the last Congress was the most productive in \nthe history of the country. Some say not the most productive, but \ncertainly no one disagrees that it is the most productive since \nFranklin Roosevelt was President during his first term. But since there \nis a new majority in the House, this Congress has been altogether \ndifferent and that is an understatement.\n  Consistently this Congress has taken weeks or months to pass even \nsimple, commonsense legislation and proposals that would have \npreviously passed in minutes. The Senate has wasted literally months \nconsidering bipartisan bills only to have those bills smothered to \ndeath under nonrelevant Republican amendments.\n  Congressional Republicans have held even the most important jobs \nmeasures hostage to extract votes on unrelated ideological amendments--\ndespite the minority leader's own call to ``stop all the showboats.'' \nThose were his words.\n  The Democrats and American people have endured this blatant \nobstruction all year--in fact, for 18 months. What is it we are talking \nabout? Obstruction. If you look in the dictionary, it says it all. I \ndid that this morning. The dictionary says that obstruction is a \ncondition of being clogged or blocked. Doesn't that define what has \nhappened here in this wonderful body we call the Senate? Republicans \nhave clogged or blocked everything we have tried to do, even things \nthey have agreed on.\n  Yesterday we read that we will have to endure it every day for the \nrest of the year--every day for the rest of this Congress. And this \ncame from Congressman Cantor, the No. 2 person in the Republican-\ndominated House of Representatives. House Republican leaders admit they \nhave given up on actually running the country. Despite the work that \nremains to keep our country on the right track and continue 27 months \nof private sector job growth, they say they are done legislating for \nthe year, and in spite of the fact the President is working to create \n4.3 million private sector jobs.\n  But listen to this report from the political publication Politico \nyesterday, and I quote:\n\n       Serious legislating is all but done until after the \n     election . . . The rest of this year, Cantor said, will \n     likely be about sending ``signals. . . .''\n\n  Let's try that again. Because it is hard to comprehend that someone \nwho is supposedly running the other body would say such a thing, but he \ndid.\n\n       Serious legislation is all but done until after the \n     election. The rest of this year, Cantor said, will likely be \n     about sending ``signals. . . .''\n  So rather than work with Democrats to strengthen our economy and \ncreate jobs, congressional Republicans will put on a show designed to \ndemonstrate the extreme ideological direction in which they would lead \nthis country.\n  Majority Leader Cantor's candor is frightening. He said out loud what \npractically every Republican on Capitol Hill has been thinking all \nalong: They care more about winning elections than creating jobs. We \njust don't usually hear them say so in public when reporters are \nlistening.\n  Just a short month ago, Speaker Boehner urged Congress ``to roll up \nyour sleeves and get to work.'' To an audience of conservatives, the \nSpeaker said, ``We can't wait until after the election to legislate.''\n  Less than a week after, he said Leader McConnell urged us to ``stop \nthe show votes that are designed to fail. Let's stop the blame game. \nLet's come together and do what the American people expect us to do.''\n  The statements of Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell are Orwellian. \nThey do exactly the opposite of what they say.\n  Republican Senator Olympia Snowe, by all means a moderate Senator, \nwho is retiring amid frustration of increasing partisanship in \nWashington, wrote to me in April to urge quick Senate action on many of \nthe challenging issues facing us. It was a letter crying out for help--\nbut not for help from us, not for help from Democrats. She was speaking \nto the Republicans. She knew they were holding up virtually everything \nwe were trying to do. I am sure that is one reason this fine woman is \nleaving the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n  Leader Cantor's remarks provide a window into the true Republican \nagenda. It seems when congressional Republicans forget the world is \nwatching, they say what they really mean. They are more interested in \nputting on a partisan sideshow than in solving the real problems facing \nthis Nation. In truth this comes as no surprise. It is just more of the \nsame.\n  Republicans have launched a series of attacks on access to health \ncare for women, even contraception, and have filibustered legislation \nto ensure American women get equal pay for equal work.\n  In my desk--I haven't used this in a while, but I knew it was here \nall the time. Filibuster, filibuster, filibuster, filibuster. That is \nwhat obstruction is all about. ``Filibuster,'' from the dictionary:\n\n       One of a class of piratical adventurers who pillaged the \n     Spanish colonies in the West Indies during the 17th century; \n     one who engages in unauthorized and irregular warfare against \n     foreign States; a pirate craft.\n\n  Now, it is also defined as:\n\n       To obstruct progress in legislative assembly; to practice \n     obstruction.\n\n  That is what they have done. They have filibustered legislation to \nensure American women get equal pay for equal work. Who could be \nagainst that? The American people--if we take a poll, no one is against \nit. Republicans aren't against it, except Republicans in the Congress \nof the United States.\n  They have stopped us from restoring fairness to the Tax Code to \nensure billionaires don't pay a lower tax than middle-class families. \nThey put women at risk by holding the Violence Against Women Act in \nlimbo. They blocked a bill to hire more teachers, cops, firefighters, \nand first responders. They have stalled important jobs measures such as \nthe aviation bill. We had 22 short-term extensions of that.\n  Finally, they shut down the government on one occasion--the \ngovernment as it relates to the Federal Aviation Administration--\nputting tens of thousands of people out of work. They have stalled for \nmonths and months work done on a bipartisan basis by two fine Senators: \nSenator Boxer, the chairman of that committee, and Senator Inhofe, the \nranking member. It doesn't matter. They are stalling the highway bill. \nMillions of jobs. We can't get it done.\n  For months, congressional Republicans have actively worked against \nany piece of legislation that might create jobs or support economic \ngrowth. We don't need to take my word for it, just look at the record. \nDemocrats have known all along that congressional Republicans' No. 1 \ngoal isn't to improve the economy or to create jobs. It is to defeat \nPresident Obama.\n  People say: Oh, come on. You don't really mean that, do you? I mean \nevery word of it. Here is why: The leader of the Republicans in the \nSenate said it. I didn't make it up. The minority leader, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, said so plainly in another one of those moments \nof candor. Here is what he said:\n\n       The single most important thing we want to achieve is for \n     President Obama to be a one-term President.\n\n  He said that in October of 2010 when this country was mired in \nmonumental challenges, rather than saying let's work together and do \nsome things. How many jobs could we have created if we had some \nsemblance of help from the Republicans in Congress? Not 4.3 million \njobs. Remember, 8 million or 10 million were lost in the Bush \nadministration. We have struggled to get some of them back. We could \nhave created millions more jobs just with a little help, but here is \nwhere they are headed. They are headed toward doing everything they \ncan, no matter what it takes, to try to make President Obama a one-term \nPresident.\n  We are fighting back from the greatest recession since the Great \nDepression. Yet Republicans' top priority hasn't been to create jobs; \ntheir top priority wasn't to help businesses to grow and to have people \nhire workers. It wasn't to train the next generation of skilled \nemployees or to hire more cops and firefighters or to put construction \ncrews back to work building those roads and bridges we need. We have \n70,000--not 7,000--70,000 bridges that are in trouble in this country. \nThey need help.\n  We have a bridge in Reno, NV, where they will not have the kids stay \non the schoolbus. They take them out, drive the bus over the bridge, \nand have the kids walk across the bridge. That is not the only place; \nall over the country that is happening. But we are getting no help. No, \nthat wasn't their top priority, to help create those construction jobs. \nIt was to drag down the economy in the hopes of defeating President \nObama. Thanks to Leader Cantor's candor, today we know Republican \npriorities haven't changed one single bit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the majority leader for \nthat statement. He comes to the floor with the other members of the \nleadership team to call to the attention of the Nation a statement made \nyesterday by the majority leader of the House Republicans, Eric Cantor \nof Virginia.\n\n  Many people remember, I say to the majority leader, that it was Eric \nCantor who was appointed to the deficit task force the President \ncreated, chaired by Vice President Joe Biden--a bipartisan effort to \ntry to deal with the deficit--and people will remember there came a \nmoment after several weeks when Mr. Cantor stood up and said: I am \nleaving. He walked out, literally walked out of this highest level \nnegotiation on deficit reduction. He said: I want no part of it.\n  Well, we have another walkaway. Eric Cantor, the majority leader in \nthe House, has announced we are finished for business this year. There \nis nothing more we are going to do. We are going to politic and \ncampaign and posture. To him, I guess, that is an important \nresponsibility. To the rest of America it is an abdication of \nresponsibility--an abdication of responsibility.\n  This morning, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, \nappeared before the Joint Economic Committee. They wanted to talk to \nhim about what more could be done at the Federal Reserve on monetary \npolicy dealing with interest rates to get the economy moving forward. \nIt is a legitimate policy question. But if Mr. Bernanke could have \nturned the tables for a moment, he might have asked the Members of \nCongress: Well, what are you doing to get the economy moving forward? I \nthink that is a reasonable question.\n  Let me suggest to Mr. Cantor, who thinks we are finished for business \nthis year, that there are many elements of outstanding business that \ncan help create jobs in America. Let's start with the first one: the \nTransportation bill. The Transportation bill will create 2.8 million \njobs in America. What kind of jobs? As the majority leader said, jobs \nto repair bridges and highways, to build our airports, to make sure \nAmerica has a safe infrastructure upon which to build our economy.\n  Well, in the Senate, we came to an agreement. Senator Barbara Boxer, \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator \nJim Inhofe from Oklahoma, the ranking Republican member, reached an \nagreement and brought a bill to the Senate floor. We went through the \nlong process of amendments, and it passed. I think the final rollcall \nwas 74 to 22. It was an overwhelming bipartisan vote that extended for \n2 years highway construction in America and created 2.8 million jobs.\n  Well, obviously, that is something that is good for America. The \nquestion that should be asked is, Well, where was the House \nTransportation bill? The honest answer is they never produced one--\nnever. They couldn't agree on a bill. The House Republicans failed to \npass the Transportation bill. Ultimately, they passed a measure to \nextend the current highway trust fund and taxes that are collected to \nJuly 1, just a few weeks from now.\n  Then the majority leader appointed a conference committee, and I am \nhonored to be on that committee with a number of my colleagues. I can't \ntell my colleagues how hard Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe have \nworked on that committee. This bipartisan effort, Democrats and \nRepublicans, has resulted in a compromised counteroffer which they \npersonally hand-delivered to the Chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee John Mica. They understand we have a July 1 \ndeadline. They understand the urgency to take it up and move it to \ncreate and keep 2.8 million jobs in America.\n  What was the response of Speaker Boehner? Well, it was warming and\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nwelcoming, but the fact is as of today, maybe tomorrow--the House is \ngone for a week. So in this critical period of time when we are up \nagainst a July 1 deadline, when millions of American jobs are on the \nline, the House Republicans are leaving and the Republican majority \nleader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, said it doesn't make any difference if \nthey stayed because they are not going to do anything significant. They \nare just going to politic and posture.\n  How do we explain that to the families of all of these workers across \nAmerica--workers who need a job at a time when the economy is tough? I \nguess people living paycheck to paycheck now have to accept this \nfurlough that the majority leader has announced for the rest of the \nyear.\n  There is important work to be done, and it isn't just the \nTransportation bill. The majority leader raised some questions and \nissues that are still pending between us. Let me also add another one \nto the list: cybersecurity.\n  I attended a meeting, I guess it was about 2 months ago, the likes of \nwhich I have never seen since I have been in the Senate. We had a \nrequest by the administration--in fact, it started with Senator \nMikulski asking them for it--to ask all of the Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to go to a classified setting--a secret setting--for a \nbriefing on cybersecurity. There was a large turnout, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and they spelled out to us the threat to the United States \nof America from China, Russia, other countries, and individual actors \nwho are trying to invade our information technology to steal the \nsecrets not only of our government but also of major companies, to \nburrow into our systems such as the utilities of America and be \nprepared at a moments' notice to destroy the capacity of the U.S. \neconomy or worse.\n  We went through the exercise, and it really spelled out for us what \nmight happen; what might happen if there were a cybersecurity attack \ninto the United States and it literally turned out the lights on the \ngreat city of New York. What would happen? Well, it would take days \nbefore we could restore service. In the process, people would die, the \neconomy would be crippled, and we are at risk of that happening.\n  So the administration has produced a cybersecurity bill to keep \nAmerica safe from that kind of attack. Well, unfortunately, it doesn't \nmeet Mr. Cantor's test. He has told us we can't do anything the rest of \nthe year. All we can do is campaign, politic, and give speeches.\n  We have a responsibility as Members of the Senate and the House to \naccept the challenges facing this Nation; No. 1, to create jobs, \ninvigorate the economy, and get this country moving forward; second, \nkeeping America safe.\n\n  I might say to Mr. Cantor from Virginia, take some time during your \nnext recess--which is next week--and go over to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and sit down with them and talk about cybersecurity \nand the danger to the United States, and ask them if we can wait 6 \nmonths or a year to get back to this issue. I know what they are going \nto say. They are going to remind him he swore to defend and uphold this \ngreat United States of America. And if he is going to do it, he ought \nto roll up his sleeves and go to work instead of coming up with another \nexcuse for political campaigning and delay.\n  This comes down to a basic question. Eric Cantor, House Republican \nmajority leader, has all but predicted that 2012--this year--is \nsubstantively over. We are finished. No more heavy lifting. It reminds \nme of when I was a kid on the last day of school before summer \nvacation. Remember that? It is usually a half day. You could not wait \nto race out the front door, screaming and hollering and throwing things \nin every direction, jumping up and down with your buddies, saying: We \nare going to go swimming tomorrow. And get your bike out. We are going \nto go have some fun. It was 3 months, at least, of pure unadulterated \njoy, no responsibility.\n  Well, Majority Leader Cantor has announced that school is out for the \nHouse Republicans. They are finished for the year. But America is not \nfinished. Our agenda is still there.\n  I want to commend the Senate Republicans who have joined us in \npassing this transportation bill. And I want to say to Speaker Boehner: \nWhen you return from the next recess, next week, roll up your sleeves \nand get to work. Put 2.8 million Americans to work with this bipartisan \ntransportation bill. Have the courage to bring it for a vote on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives so we can put America to work and \nmake certain they know we take our job seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in support of the words of the \nmajority leader and the majority whip. Many of us have been frustrated \nlately by the glacial pace of activity in the House of Representatives. \nThe Senate is supposed to be the cooling saucer, but, these days, the \nHouse is where jobs bills and other important measures go to die.\n  They are dragging out negotiations on a highway bill that would put \nmillions to work. They refuse to even allow a conference on a \nbipartisan Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, even though the \nSenate produced a bill with 68 votes. They have refused to act at all \non a bipartisan bill that cracks down on China's unfair currency \npractices--something which their own party's nominee for President \nclaims to support.\n  Why the stalling? Well, we got our answer in the pages of Politico 2 \ndays ago.\n  Eric Cantor, who controls the floor schedule in the House, has \ndecided to forgo legislating in favor of politicking full time.\n  Despite all the major challenges this Congress faces--despite the \ncrisis of confidence that may hit our markets in the fall due to \nuncertainty over the looming fiscal cliff--Eric Cantor has declared a \nmoratorium on any serious legislating until after the fall elections.\n  The House of Representatives is like a computer that has been turned \non sleep mode, and it does not plan to be rebooted until after \nNovember.\n  This is a breathtaking admission by the No. 2 Republican in the \nHouse. I would not be surprised if Leader Cantor wishes he could take \nhis statement back. It contradicts the rhetoric from many on his own \nside.\n  Just last month, in a speech at the Peterson Institute, the Speaker \nof the House made a great show of calling on the administration and \nCongress to tackle tax cuts and the debt ceiling now--before the \nelection. Here is what Speaker Boehner said:\n\n       It's about time we roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\n  Unfortunately, Leader Cantor's comments seem to reflect House \nRepublicans' true intentions more so than Speaker Boehner's quote. And \nthat is a terrible shame. Leader Cantor and the House Republicans are \nshrinking from a potentially historic moment.\n  I have a message for Leader Cantor: You may have abandoned any \nintention to legislate this year, but we will not bow to election-year \npolitics here in the Senate. The Nation needs us, and we have too much \nto do.\n  All around this Chamber, there are green shoots of bipartisan \nactivity. In the last 2 months alone, we have overhauled the postal \nsystem, approved a multiyear transportation program, renewed the \nViolence Against Women Act, streamlined drug approval rules at the FDA, \nrenewed the Export-Import Bank, and passed a bill to help business \nstartups. We have confirmed 20 judges and put the Federal Reserve Board \nat full strength for the first time in 6 years. And just this morning, \nwe moved to proceed to a farm bill--the first overhaul of agriculture \nin 5 years--by an overwhelming 90-to-8 vote.\n  Every one of the issues I mentioned had broad bipartisan support. \nEach would not have been accomplished without bipartisan support. These \nare items, certainly, that are not the same as the big challenges that \nawait us on taxes and spending, but they are not trivial. They are not \npost office namings either. They are real accomplishments.\n  ``The Senate is on something of a roll,'' the New York Times recently \nreported. These accomplishments could very well prove to be the \nbuilding blocks for bipartisan compromise on the bigger issues that \nawait our Nation. So the House may already have entered election mode, \nbut, I daresay, the Senate may be starting to gel at just the right \ntime.\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\n  In the Senate there is a hunger to legislate. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike in this Chamber sense our Nation is at a crossroads, \nand their first instinct is not to pause to contemplate its political \nimplications, but to get things done. For this, I must salute the \ngrowing number of my colleagues across the aisle who are seeking to \nwork across the aisle.\n  Even as the loudest voices on the Republican side cite the \nPresident's defeat as their No. 1 goal, I believe there is a silent \nmajority within the Republican Caucus that yearns to come together and \naddress the Nation's problems, free of partisan politics.\n  Even after the extreme elements in their own party have claimed two \nof the most esteemed Members of this body--one by retirement; one in a \ncontentious primary--a silent majority of brave Republicans still dares \nto believe that compromise is a virtue, not a vice.\n  My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, is a Senator I \nadmire. He has taken the lead in bringing Members together to tackle \nthe big issues that await us at the end of this calendar year.\n\n  I was at a briefing this week organized by Senator Alexander, a \nRepublican, and Senator Warner, a Democrat. Believe me, no one in that \nroom thinks, as Leader Cantor apparently does, that these issues should \nbe put off till the election. The conversations were quite preliminary, \nfor sure, but the motivations of all the Senators who attended were \npure.\n  Senator Coburn is another brave Republican. I may disagree with Tom \nCoburn on most issues, and even on many of his tactics, but I admire \nthe courage he displays on a daily basis by standing up to even the \nmost powerful special interests in his party. He does not talk the talk \nabout bucking his party's orthodoxy on revenues. He walks the walk. \nJust this morning, I watched him on one of the morning news programs \nmaking great sense about the need for both parties to show leadership \nin confronting the big issues. He also made a point of saying that, \nunlike Leader Cantor, he does not believe these issues should wait till \nthe election.\n  My colleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham, is another such \nbrave Republican. We have our differences on many issues, but he is a \nstatesman, plain and simple. He has been quite vocal on his wish to \noverturn the defense cuts in the sequester. But while others in his \nparty propose to replace these cuts on entirely their own terms, \nSenator Graham has bravely signaled an openness to make the tradeoffs \nneeded to help bridge the partisan divide. Asked by the New York Times \nrecently about the potential for tapping revenues to replace some of \nthe sequester cuts, Senator Graham bravely bucked his party's \northodoxy. ``I have crossed the Rubicon on that [one],'' he said. Be \nassured, Senator Graham is someone we can negotiate with.\n  Senators Alexander, Coburn, and Graham are not alone. There are \nothers who realize the need to act in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Senator Alexander's colleague from Tennessee, Senator Corker, \nrecently called out his own party for famously rejecting a deal, a \nhypothetical deficit deal with a 10-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax \nincreases.\n  Senators Isakson and Collins said in the same Politico article that \nthey, too, would be open to supporting a grand bargain that includes \nrevenues as well as spending cuts.\n  And my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, is featured in the \npages of Roll Call today for his Herculean efforts to get House \nRepublicans to be reasonable on a long-term highway bill, along with \nhis colleague and our friend Senator Boxer.\n  I suggest that the House majority leader reconsider his remarks to \nPolitico and take a page from the book of these brave Republicans. The \nHouse may be in an all-politics mode, but the Senate is not done \nlegislating--not by a long shot. And let's be honest: If a solution to \nthese big issues is at all possible in the lameduck, or maybe even \nbefore the election, it is not going to come from the House. It is \ngoing to come out of the Senate.\n  So I suggest to Leader Cantor, Washington does not need an election \nto bridge our differences. It needs the Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come today to talk--as my colleagues \nhave discussed--about the fact that Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives seem ready to pack it in for the year.\n  Led by their majority leader and by the ``my way or the highway'' \nphilosophy they have stuck to all year, they have signaled that they \nhave given up on the work of the American people.\n  From our yearly responsibility to pass appropriations bills, to \nlegislation that would create thousands of good-paying construction \njobs, to efforts to stop an impending student loan hike, to a bill that \nwould protect vulnerable American women from violence, House \nRepublicans have now indicated they would rather kick the can down the \nroad.\n  It is unfortunate that this is their attitude--not just for our \ncollege students or construction workers looking for jobs or women at \nrisk, but it is statements such as the one the House majority leader \nmade that make every American shake their head. That is because as \nAmerican families come together around their kitchen table to make \ntough decisions about their mortgage or how to make tuition payments or \neven about how they are going to afford groceries, they want to see us \ncoming together to make similarly tough decisions.\n  But as Leader Reid and my other colleagues have made clear: It is \ntough to legislate from only one side of Capitol Hill. It is tough to \naddress the issues affecting everyday Americans when House Republicans \nare more interested in drawing dividing lines than coming to the \nmiddle. It is pretty tough to create jobs and help our economy rebound \nwhen House Republicans are more focused on next year than on the bills \nthat are stuck in their Chamber today. And it is impossible to do \nanything about the looming fiscal cliff we face when House Republicans \ncontinue to show they do not get that it will take a balanced approach \nto fix.\n  The bottom line is we need a partner in legislating, and it appears \nfrom comments such as those that were made this week that hope is \nquickly fading.\n  What is particularly concerning about House Republicans wanting to \nshutter their Chamber for the year is the fact that bipartisan, \ncommonsense Senate legislation is languishing there. Bills that have \ngotten support from overwhelming majorities, and that were carefully \ncrafted over months of negotiations, are in limbo for no good reason.\n  In fact, what I would like to do today is highlight two important \nnumbers to illustrate what I mean. The first number is 68. Madam \nPresident, 68--that is the number of Senators who voted to pass a \nbipartisan, inclusive bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct. It is a total that includes 15 Republican Senators who, like the \nvast majority of Americans, agreed with us that we not only need to \nreaffirm our commitment to protect those at risk from domestic violence \nbut that we also need to improve and expand protections. Those are 68 \nSenators who came together to say that our commitment to saving the \nlives of victims of domestic violence should be above politics; 68 \nSenators who said we cannot allow partisan considerations to decide \nwhich victims we help and which we ignore; 68 Senators who sent a \nstrong bipartisan message to the House that we can come together to \nstrengthen protections for all victims, regardless of where they live \nor their race or their religion or gender or sexual orientation. \nUnfortunately, it is a message that Republicans in the House have \nignored. True to form, instead of taking up our bipartisan bill, \nRepublicans have passed a bill that leaves out both the additional \nprotections for vulnerable women and the delicate compromises we \nachieved.\n\n  Men and women across our country see the headlines that Leader Reid \npointed out earlier. They know their protections are at risk, and they \nare at risk not because the Senate cannot come together but because \nHouse Republicans refuse to join us.\n  The second number I wanted to highlight today is 74. That is the \nnumber of Senators who came together to send a bipartisan \ntransportation jobs bill to the House; 74 Senators who voted for a bill \nthat will create or save millions of jobs in the country today; 74 \nSenators\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nwho said that politics should not get in the way of our economic \nrecovery or the need to fix our crumbling infrastructure; 74 Senators \nwho got behind a bill that was the product of intense and long \nnegotiation between Senators we know often did not see eye to eye but \nwho did come together to pass a bill that could truly be called a \ncompromise.\n  Yet here we are, months after this bill was passed with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, and it, too, is now the subject of political games \nin the House. Another bill that should never be considered political \nhas become part of their grandstanding routine. It does not have to be \nthis way. If Republicans can set aside politics and stand up to their \ntea party base, we can protect victims of domestic violence. We can \npass a transportation bill. We can stop those tuition hikes. We can \npass our appropriations bills.\n  In fact, we can even come together on the big issues that House \nRepublicans have indicated they believe can only be resolved after an \nelection. If Republicans are ready to admit it will take a balanced and \nbipartisan deal to avoid that fiscal cliff, we can make a deal \ntomorrow. But on this issue, Republicans have not just refused to meet \nus in the middle. They will not even come out of their corner.\n  We all know a bipartisan deal is going to be required to include new \nrevenue along with spending cuts. Unfortunately, Republicans are \nsingularly focused on protecting the wealthiest Americans from paying a \npenny more in taxes. Democrats are ready. We are willing to compromise. \nWe know it is difficult, but we have to have a partner to do that.\n  Republicans need to understand that the fiscal cliff is not simply \ngoing to disappear if they close their eyes and wish hard enough. We \nare going to have to act, and Republicans should not let politics stop \nthem from working with us now on a balanced and bipartisan deal which \nmiddle-class families expect and deserve.\n  Statements such as the one made by the House majority leader only \nreaffirm what American families fear the most, that at a time when they \ndeserve a government at their backs, they are being abandoned. In the \nSenate, we have shown we can come together around bipartisan solutions. \nBut we cannot do it alone. House Republicans need to send the American \npeople a clear message they are willing to be a partner in compromise.\n  It is time for them to take up our bipartisan legislation to protect \nwomen and put workers back on the job. It is time to work with us in \nthe appropriations process and help our Nation too. It is time to \nrealize that a solution to the impending fiscal cliff will require a \nbalance. It is certainly not time to give up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the wonderful statements by Senators \nDurbin, Schumer, and Murray. We have a problem in this country based on \nwhat Cantor said. Here are the headlines: ``Congress switches from \npolicy to politicking.'' All we have said here today has been based on \nfact. That is too bad. It is too bad we have someone who is running the \nHouse of Representatives who is trying to kill these important pieces \nof legislation Senator Schumer outlined that we have passed over here. \nWe have passed all these things, worked very hard to get them done.\n  Because of politicking, and not policy, the majority leader of the \nHouse of Representatives is killing all this legislation for reasons we \nall understand.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Madam President, cloture has been invoked on the motion to proceed to \nthe farm bill by an overwhelming vote of 90 to 8. Senators Stabenow and \nRoberts are now, as we speak, working on an agreement to amendments to \nthe bill. I am hopeful they can make significant progress over the \nweekend. There will be no more rollcall votes today. Monday at 5:30 we \nwill have a vote on Andrew Hurwitz to be a Ninth Circuit judge.\n  I hope we can get the farm bill done next week and lock in an \nagreement on flood insurance, which is also vitally important to this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                              Legislating\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about \nlegislating. I was struck, in fact, by the comments recently because \nwhat I am here to talk about is essentially the yeoman's bipartisanship \nwe have seen with Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts on the farm \nbill. I am going to talk about some specific ideas, each of which I \nbelieve could win bipartisan support and help strengthen the \nlegislation as we go forward in the Senate.\n  I believe it is hard to overstate the importance of writing the best \npossible farm bill in the Senate. When America desperately needs more \njobs, and 1 in every 12 American jobs is tied to agriculture, this bill \nis an opportunity for the private sector to grow more jobs. When \nobesity rates are driving the American health care challenge, this bill \ncan promote healthier eating without extra cost to taxpayers. When we \nare concerned about the threat to our treasured lands and air and \nwater, this bill is our primary conservation program. When our rural \ncommunities are especially hard hit, and the Presiding Officer knows \nabout this because she has a lot of rural country in her State, these \nrural communities are walking on an economic tightrope, and this bill \ncan be a lifeline.\n  I spent much of last week in rural Oregon. In my State, Oregonians do \na lot of things well, but what we do best is grow things--lots of \nthings. Oregon grows more than 250 different crops, including \neverything from alfalfa seed to mint and blueberries. Several weeks \nago, the Oregon Extension Service reported that agricultural sales in \nmy home State increased more than 19 percent in 2011.\n  Agriculture in Oregon is now more than a $5 billion industry \nannually, and much of this is driven by high prices for wheat and \ncattle and dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and other specialty \ncrops. The fact is, agriculture is the lodestar to prosperity for many \nrural Oregon communities. Nationwide, there are many other towns in a \nsimilar position to the small communities I have the honor to represent \nin the Senate.\n\n  That is what is apropos about this talk and the need for \nbipartisanship. Senator Schumer listed a number of these bipartisan \nareas. I consulted with the chair of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nStabenow, and the ranking member, Senator Roberts, who I also served \nwith in the other body. After getting their counsel, I selected 28 \nOregonians, from every corner of my State and across all types of \nagriculture, to help serve as an advisory committee on ways to improve \nthe economic opportunities for Oregon, specifically through this bill.\n  We have the good fortune to have the committee chaired by Mrs. Karla \nChambers, who owns a farm in the Willamette Valley, Stahlbush Farms, \nand also Mike Thorne, a wheat farmer in eastern Oregon.\n  From the outset, this advisory committee did not talk at all about \npolitics, did not talk about whether there was a Democratic way to \nwrite a farm bill or a Republican way to write a farm bill. What they \ndid talk about was the importance of the issues I have just outlined: \njobs, health care, conservation, rural communities. That is what they \nspent their time focused on and particularly the jobs issue was central \nto their discussion.\n  There are about 38,000 farms in my home State which roughly support \n234,000 jobs. That is about 11 percent of our State's employment. As \nmuch as 80 percent of the agricultural goods produced in Oregon are \nsold out of State. Half of that is exported to foreign countries. That \nis especially important to me because I chair the trade subcommittee of \nthe Senate Finance Committee. So what I have taken as the centerpiece \nof my approach to agriculture and to our country's economy is that we \nought to do our very best to: grow things in the United States, to add \nvalue to them in the United States, and then ship them somewhere.\n  It is especially important for Oregon agriculture. As I just noted, \n80 percent of the agricultural goods that are produced in our State are \nsold out of State.\n  Abroad, our producers are doing very well. Nationally, each $1 \nbillion in agricultural exports is tied to approximately 8,400 American \njobs. These growing overseas markets represent a\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\nway to create and sustain good-paying jobs that rely on export sales. \nIn fact, agriculture is one of the only sectors with a trade surplus, \nand in 2011, it boasted a surplus totaling $42.5 billion--the highest \nannual surplus on record.\n  That is why I was honored to have a chance--when Chairman Baucus was \ntied up in discussions with respect to the super committee--to manage a \nsignificant part of the debate on the three recently passed free-trade \nagreements, which again give us a chance, as I have indicated, to build \non that proposition that I have outlined, where we grow things here, \nadd value to them here, and then ship them somewhere else.\n  Nothing says that more than giving those opportunities to producers \nfrom Oregon to Florida. They sell their fruits and vegetables, their \nwheat, their beef, their nursery crops, and other high-value products \nat home and abroad. The farm bill continues those programs that \nAmerican producers rely on to help market their goods in foreign \nmarkets. I think it is important again to stress the bipartisanship \nassociated with making sure there are bountiful opportunities for \nAmerican agriculture and particularly for Oregon agricultural goods.\n  The second area my agriculture advisory committee focused on was \nstressing the importance of healthy nutrition here at home. Of course, \nthe USDA, our Department of Agriculture, has recommended eating five \nfresh fruits and vegetables daily.\n  What that means is that from Burns, OR, to Bangor, ME, farm programs \nneed to make it easier for those with low incomes to be able to eat \nhealthier. There never ought to be a tradeoff between health and \naffordable food. So I think we have to look at some fresh approaches to \npromote healthy nutrition in this country. I believe it is not just an \neconomic threat to our economy, it is also a national security threat \nto our Nation because we have seen, regrettably, that many Americans \nwho would like to wear the uniform of the United States, patriots, have \nnot been able to pass the health standards necessary to serve in our \nmilitary.\n  In the past three decades, obesity rates have quadrupled for children \nages 6 to 11. More than 40 percent of Americans are expected to be \nobese by 2030. The Centers for Disease Control reports that in 2008 \nalone, the United States spent $147 billion on medical care related to \nobesity. Obesity is the top medical reason one in four young people \ncannot join the military, and it has been identified by the Department \nof Defense as a threat to national security. It doesn't have to be this \nway.\n  I wish to outline some specific ideas for changing that and to \npromote good health in our country without adding extra costs to \ntaxpayers. One opportunity for change is through the Farm to School \nProgram. Again, without costing taxpayers additional money, it ought to \nbe easier for delicious pears, cherries, and other healthy produce, \ngrown just a few miles down the road, to make it into our schools. This \nought to be a national approach. Schools from Springfield, OR, to \nSavannah, GA, currently purchase their fruits and vegetables from \nUSDA--the Department of Agriculture--warehouses, which may be hundreds \nof miles away. Many of our farmers and our producers would like to sell \ntheir goods to local schools, and many schools would like to source \ntheir produce locally. The farm bill ought to promote that.\n  When I was in Oregon last week, I had a chance to meet with the \nmanagement of Harry & David. They are a major employer in my State, and \nan Oregon pear producer. They told me they want to sell their fruit to \nschools down the street, but instead a complex maze of Federal rules \nand regulations has created a hassle for them, and the process sounds \nlike bureaucratic water torture. So I am going to offer an amendment \nthat would make it less of a hassle for producers such as Harry & David \nand farmers to sell directly to local schools, all without spending \nadditional Federal dollars.\n  A second opportunity to improve our Nation's health lies with the \nSNAP program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better \nknown as food stamps. This program currently spends over $70 billion a \nyear. This is the big expenditure in the farm bill, and there is no way \nto really determine whether it promotes good nutrition. Think of all of \nthe possibilities for helping our country, all the possible benefits if \nthe SNAP program did more to improve nutritional outcomes for those who \nuse the program.\n  Let me make clear that I am not for cutting benefits. I understand \nthe crucial lifeline this program provides for millions of our people. \nWhat I am interested in doing is seeing that, through that $70 billion, \nit is possible to improve nutritional outcomes, all while getting the \nbest value out of that enormous expenditure.\n  One of the ways we could do it would be to allow States to obtain a \nwaiver from the SNAP program when they bring their farmers, their \nretailers, their health specialists, and their beneficiaries together \nand say: We have a consensus for improving the nutritional outcomes in \nour State, for those on the Food Stamp Program, the SNAP program. They \nought to be able to get a waiver in order to do that and help us \nproduce more good health in America. That is not some kind of national \nnanny program. That is not telling people they can only eat this or \nthat. It is just common sense to have farmers, retailers, those on the \nprogram, and health specialists look, for example, to try to create \nsome voluntarily incentive to promote better nutrition with this \nenormous expenditure, and I intend to offer an amendment to do that.\n  A third opportunity for improvement is through what is known as \ngleaning. Historically, gleaners gathered leftover produce from the \nfields, but today gleaners play a crucial role in reducing the \nstaggering amount of food that goes to waste each year. At a time when \nfood waste is the single largest category of waste in our local \nlandfills--more than 34 million tons of food--again, without spending \nextra taxpayer money, we can do more to ensure that this unwanted food \nis used to tackle hunger in America.\n  Led by the dedicated work of local food banks, many are striving to \nput America's food bounty to better use. In Portland, OR, Tracy Oseran \nruns a wonderful nonprofit organization known as Urban Gleaners. They \nare poised to collect surplus food--hundreds of thousands of pounds of \nfood--from grocers, restaurants, parties, and all kinds of social \norganizations, and they redistribute those hundreds of thousands of \npounds of food to organizations that serve the hungry. Urban Gleaners \nis doing great work, but they could be doing a lot more.\n  Without spending a dime of extra money, we can advocate for gleaners \nall across America by making it possible for them to receive loans \nthrough the Microloan Program. If someone is trying to set up a \ngleaning program in a small town and they have to borrow, say, $20,000 \nto start a refrigeration program to preserve the quality of the food, \nlet's make it possible for the gleaners to do that.\n  I am not proposing--and I discussed this with the chair of the \ncommittee, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Roberts, the ranking minority \nmember--to allocate one additional dime to the program. I think it is a \nfine program. I simply want to say that when we have gleaners in our \ncountry who are telling us about the enormous amount of food that is \nstill wasted despite their tremendous efforts, let's not pass up an \nopportunity to, with this bill, make it possible to promote gleaning in \nour country.\n  To produce the healthy food needed to feed America, we need fertile \nagricultural land, and conservation plays a central role in that. \nRoughly 28 percent of Oregon's land mass is devoted to agricultural \nproduction. Maintaining this land is crucial for our long-term \nproductivity. For more than half a century, the farm bill has supported \ninfrastructure modernization and conservation projects. They give, once \nagain, the opportunity for collaboration, and that is key to our \nnatural resources.\n  I see my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, here. We talked about \ndoing this in the forestry area years ago. We ought to be promoting \ncollaborative projects to boost rural economies. It is the Oregon way, \nand we ought to build on that in this farm bill as well.\n  The time is also ripe to promote farmers markets and locally grown \nfood, which will lead to greater awareness of local markets, roadside \nstands, and community-supported agriculture.\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\nThis farm bill expands those opportunities, and I think these types of \nlocal initiatives give us the opportunity to change the trajectory--the \ntragic and staggering trajectory--of obesity in this country, and to \nensure the viability of these programs, the land required to produce \nnutritious foods must be addressed.\n\n  I plan to offer, as I have indicated in these comments, a number of \namendments to the farm bill, each of which I have discussed with the \nchair of the committee, Senator Stabenow, and ranking member, Senator \nRoberts.\n  The farm-to-school amendment that I will offer would not spend \nadditional taxpayer money, but it would make it easier for schools to \npurchase locally for the breakfast, lunches, and snacks they serve \nchildren.\n  My second amendment would allow States across this country to get a \nwaiver under the SNAP program, so they can consult with their farmers, \ntheir retailers, their health specialists, and those who use it, and \ntry to come up with a way to get more good health and nutrition out of \nthe $70 billion that is spent on the program. States ought to have an \nopportunity to do that so that the SNAP program can be a launch pad for \nhealthier eating rather than just a conveyor belt for calories. With a \nwaiver, States with innovation and effective ideas could improve \nnutritional outcomes and put their good ideas into action.\n  Third, I intend to offer an amendment--again, it doesn't spend \nadditional taxpayer money--to promote gleaning through the Microloan \nProgram.\n  Finally, based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, I \nwill offer an amendment to make it possible to advance some of the \nrecommendations of the Institute of Medicine to look at the \nrelationship between agriculture policy, the diet of the average \nAmerican, and how we can reduce childhood obesity. This amendment would \ngive us a chance to advance the recommendations of the Institute of \nMedicine. They have made a number of thoughtful proposals that I think \nwill give us a chance to reduce obesity and promote our national \nsecurity, and we certainly should pursue them through this farm bill.\n  The last comment I will make is that I think Oregonians got it right, \nand I think we ought to be building on the work done by Senator \nStabenow and Senator Roberts. At a crucial time in American history, \nthis bill can help us grow more jobs, it can help us improve the health \nof the people of our country without spending additional money, and it \nis an opportunity to protect our treasured land and air and water. \nFinally, it is a lifeline for rural communities--these communities that \nI have described as walking on an economic tight rope.\n  I intend to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis. I have \nheard all this talk about how the legislating is over. We ought to \nbuild on the work that has been done already and get this important \nbill across the finish line because it will be good for our economy, \nfor our national security, and it will be good for our health and for \nour environment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Fallen Heroes\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, last week on Memorial Day, Americans \nremembered our Nation's fallen troops who laid down their lives for our \nNation. We are blessed to live in a country where individuals volunteer \nto defend our Nation and our freedoms--no matter the cost. Because of \nthe sacrifices of our Nation's veterans, we have the opportunity to \nlive in the strongest, freest, and greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Today at Arlington National Cemetery, 30 U.S. servicemembers will be \nhonored for their service and sacrifice to our country. These men were \nkilled last August when insurgents fired upon their helicopter as it \nwas rushing to aid troops in a firefight in Wardak Province in \nAfghanistan. More than 20 U.S. special operations forces were killed \nwhen the helicopter crashed--the deadliest single loss of American \nforces in the war in Afghanistan.\n  Among those lost were brave soldiers who called Kansas home: CWO \nBryan Nichols of Hays, SPC Spencer Duncan of Olathe, and SGT Alexander \nBennett of Tacoma, WA, who was stationed in New Century, KS. These men \nwill be given full honors during a special memorial service and laid to \nrest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  We lost 30 American heroes on that tragic day--brave men who answered \nthe call to defend our country. Our Nation is forever indebted to these \nyoung men for their service and sacrifice. Especially today, we think \nof their families and the loved ones they left behind. May God comfort \nthem in their time of grief and be a source of strength for them.\n  Yesterday, in Kansas, another soldier's life was remembered. PFC Cale \nMiller of Olathe was killed just 2 weeks ago during a combat mission in \nAfghanistan when the vehicle he was driving was struck by an improvised \nexplosive device.\n  It has been said that the ``American soldier does not fight because \nhe hates who is in front of him, he fights because he loves those who \nare behind him.'' This passage was read during Cale's service in \nOlathe, and it is a fitting description of this young man's devotion to \nhis country.\n  Cale was raised in Olathe and was a 2007 graduate of Olathe Northwest \nHigh School, where he was a member of the football and track teams and \nplayed trumpet in the marching and jazz bands. Three years after \ngraduation, Cale joined the Army and was assigned to Ft. Lewis in \nWashington State.\n  Cale was known as a fierce warrior on the battlefield and was one of \n``the best of the best.'' Among his buddies he had a reputation for \nbeing a hard worker, someone who would go above and beyond to \naccomplish the task at hand. Cale's battalion commander said he was \nknown as ``everyone's protector'' and was ``hands down, the best \nStryker driver he ever had seen.''\n  More importantly, his sergeant said Cale had the unique ability of \nknowing the right thing to say at the right moment. He was a source of \nstrength that pulled his sergeant and his squad mates through many \ndifficult days.\n  Cale loved the Army, but he was also devoted to his family. He loved \nto laugh and had a great sense of humor, which helped his family find \nthe bright side of every situation. His stepfather Dave is known for \ngiving sound and practical advice and served as a role model for Cale. \nIn fact, Cale once told his mom he was turning into the ``Dave'' for \nhis buddies since they often turned to him for advice or encouragement. \nCale had a close relationship with his sister Courtney and loved his \nmother deeply. He spoke of her often to his buddies.\n  My heart goes out to the entire Miller family, and I ask that all \nKansans, all Americans, join me in remembering them in our thoughts and \nprayers during this difficult time.\n  On Monday, Cale was given a hero's welcome upon his return to Kansas. \nVolunteers placed flags along 151st Street in Olathe and hundreds of \npeople stood in silence waving those flags and signs that read \n``Community 4 Cale'' to honor this young man and his service to our \ncountry. This demonstration of support comes naturally to Kansans who \nrespect and honor those who volunteer to defend and serve our Nation.\n  Today we honor Cale Miller, Brian Nichols, Spencer Duncan, and \nAlexander Bennett, who laid down their lives for our country. We thank \nGod for giving us these heroes, and we remain committed to preserving \nthis Nation for the sake of the next generation so they, too, can \npursue the American dream with freedom and liberty. We are indebted to \nour veterans to do nothing less.\n  May God bless our service men and women, our veterans, and the \ncountry we all love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank Senator Moran of Kansas for a very \nmoving tribute to those who have served and sacrificed. I know the \npeople of Kansas join him in expressing their gratitude for their \nservice and sacrifice, and I thank the Senator from Kansas for a very \neloquent and moving statement. God bless.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ntremendous service.\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and I be permitted to join in a colloquy on the \nsituation in Syria.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before entering into our colloquy, I would like to make \nsome brief remarks.\n  It should come as no surprise to any of our colleagues--and it \ncertainly comes as no surprise to me--that the civil war raging in \nSyria has only deteriorated further over the past 2 weeks. On Saturday, \nMay 26, we read the horrific news of a massacre that Bashar al-Assad's \nforces committed in the Syrian town of Houla. At least 108 civilians--\nthe majority of them women and children--are now believed to have been \nkilled, some from repeated shelling by Assad's tanks and artillery, but \nmost slaughtered in their homes and executed in the streets. Survivors \ndescribe a scene so gruesome that even after 16 months of bloodshed and \nmore than 10,000 dead, it still manages to shock the conscience.\n  There are now reports of another massacre by Assad's forces with as \nmany as 78 Syrians dead and that Syrian authorities are blocking access \nto the scene for the U.N. monitors on the ground. These massacres of \ncivilians are sickening and evil, but it is only the latest and most \nappalling evidence there is no limit to the savagery of Assad and his \nforces. They will do anything, kill anyone, and stop at nothing to hold \non to power.\n  What has been the response of the United States and the rest of the \ncivilized world to this most recent atrocity in Syria? More empty words \nof scorn and condemnation. More hollow pledges that the killing must \nstop. More strained expressions of amazement at what has become so \ntragically commonplace.\n  Indeed, as Jeffrey Goldberg has noted, administration officials are \nnow at risk of running out of superlative adjectives and adverbs with \nwhich to condemn this violence in Syria. They have called it \n``heinous,'' ``outrageous,'' ``unforgivable,'' ``breathtaking,'' \n``disgraceful,'' and many other synonyms for the same. I don't know \nwhat else they can call it. Yet the killing goes on.\n  The administration now appears to be so desperate they are returning \nto old ideas that have already been tried and failed. Let me quote from \na New York Times article that appeared on May 27.\n\n       In a new effort to halt more than a year of bloodshed in \n     Syria, President Obama will push for the departure of \n     President Bashar al-Assad under a proposal modeled on the \n     transition in another strife-torn Arab country, Yemen. . . . \n     The success of the plan hinges on Russia, one of Mr. Assad's \n     staunchest allies, which has strongly opposed his removal.\n\n  This is a case of history repeating itself as farce. Trying to enlist \nRussia in a policy of regime change in Syria is exactly what the \nadministration spent months doing earlier this year, and that approach \nwas decisively rejected by Russia when it vetoed a toothless sanctions \nresolution in the U.N. Security Council in February.\n  How is this recycled policy working out? Well, last week, a human \nrights organization disclosed that on May 26, a Russian ship delivered \nthe latest Russian supply of heavy weapons to the Assad regime in the \nPort of Tartus. Last Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a \nstatement on the Houla massacre--and blamed it on the opposition. \nPresident Putin, after blowing off a trip to Washington in favor of a \nvisit to Europe, suggested that foreign powers were also to blame for \nthe Houla massacre. He went on to reject further sanctions on the Assad \nregime and to deny Russia is shipping any relevant weapons to Assad.\n\n  Not to be outdone, last week the Russian Foreign Minister also \ndescribed the situation in Syria this way.\n\n       It takes two to dance--although this seems less like a \n     tango and more like a disco, where several dozens are taking \n     part at once.\n\n  One might think this alone would be enough to disabuse the \nadministration of its insistence, against all empirical evidence, that \nRussia is the key to ending the violence in Syria. One might think so, \nbut one would be wrong. Asked last week whether he could envision some \nkind of military intervention in Syria without a U.N. Security Council \nresolution, which is subject to a Russian and Chinese veto, the \nSecretary of Defense said, no, he cannot envision it.\n  Similarly, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, rejected the idea \nof providing weapons to the Syrian people to help them defend \nthemselves, saying that would lead to--get this, get this: If we \nsupplied weapons to the Syrian resistance, it would lead to ``chaos and \ncarnage,'' and it would militarize the conflict. It would militarize \nthe conflict. After more than 10,000 have been slaughtered by Bashar \nal-Assad with Russian weapons, Iranians on the ground, it would \nmilitarize the conflict.\n  It is difficult even to muster a response to statements and actions \nsuch as these. U.S. policy in Syria now seems to be subject to the \napproval of Russian leaders who are arming Assad's forces and who \nbelieve the slaughter of more than 10,000 people in Syria can be \ncompared to a disco party. Meanwhile, the administration refuses even \nto provide weapons to Syrians who are struggling and dying in an unfair \nfight, all for fear of ``militarizing the conflict.'' If only the \nRussians and the Iranians and al-Qaida shared that lofty sentiment.\n  I pray that President Obama will finally realize what President \nClinton came to understand during the Balkan wars. President Clinton, \nwho took military action to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and did so \nin Kosovo without the U.N. Security Council mandate, ultimately \nunderstood that when regimes are willing to commit any atrocity to stay \nin power, diplomacy cannot succeed until the military balance of power \nchanges on the ground.\n  As long as Assad and his foreign supporters think they can win \nmilitarily, which they do, they will continue fighting and more Syrians \nwill die. In short, military intervention of some kind is a \nprerequisite to the political resolution of the conflict we all want to \nachieve.\n  The question I would pose to my colleague from Connecticut and to the \nadministration is this: How many more have to die? How many more have \nto die? How many more young women have to be raped? How many more young \nSyrians are going to be tortured and killed? How many more? How many \nmore before we will act? How many more?\n  I would like to also ask, When will the President of the United \nStates speak up in favor of these people who are fighting and dying for \nfreedom?\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his continued involvement. \nHe has shared the same experiences I have in refugee camps, meeting \npeople who have been driven out of their homes, family members killed, \ntortured, young women raped as a matter of policy and doctrine of \nAssad's brutal forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is an honor to join in this \ncolloquy with my friend from Arizona, though I obviously take no \npleasure in it because it is an outcry--a cri de coeur--an outcry of \nthe heart about the slaughter going on in Syria now, once again, with a \ngovernment killing its own people to maintain its own presence and \npower. It is an outcry because for more than a year now the rest of the \nworld, including the United States, has offered these victims of the \nbrutal violence of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Damascus essentially \nwords--words of condemnation, words of sympathy. But those words--or \nthe few cell phones we have given those Syrian freedom fighters--don't \nstand up against Assad's tanks, his guns, and the brutality of his \nforces.\n  So I would say the answer to the question my friend from Arizona \nposed--how many more people have to be killed?--obviously, too many \npeople have already been killed. It is time for the United States to \nshow some leadership.\n  Senator McCain and I are not calling for American troops on the \nground in Syria. We are not calling for the United States alone to take \naction. There is a coalition of the willing. If we continue to say we \nare not going to take action to help the victims of Assad's brutality \nuntil and unless we get authorization from the U.N. Security Council, \nthere is never going to be any help to go to these victims in\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nSyria because the Russians and probably the Chinese will veto any U.N. \nresolution.\n  Every time we say we have to go to the U.N., we raise the power of \nRussia to protect its ally in Damascus. But there is a coalition of the \nwilling ready throughout the Arab world, and I think some in Europe and \nelsewhere, which will not act until the United States shows some \nleadership.\n  I want to just briefly put this in a historical context. After the \nNazi Holocaust of the last century, the world said, ``Never again.'' \n``Never again.'' We have kept that pledge in some cases, such as Bosnia \nand Kosovo, although it took us too long--too many people were killed \nbefore the world acted--and in other places, such as Rwanda, we turned \naway from the slaughter of people there.\n  Once again, we are challenged to show the victims whether we are true \nto our words. I read something a few days ago in the Washington Post. \nAn article was drawing parallels between the genocide in Bosnia during \nthe 1990s and the killing that is taking place in Syria today. There \nwas a 37-year-old survivor of the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia that \nfinally got the world to get involved, who said:\n\n       It's bizarre how ``never again'' has come to mean ``again \n     and again.'' It is obvious that we live in a world where \n     Srebrenicas are still possible. What is happening in Syria \n     today is almost identical to what happened in Bosnia two \n     decades ago.\n\n  So what is the world waiting for? A Syrian Srebrenica when thousands \nare killed on a single day by their own government before we act? I \nhope not. And that is why we speak out today.\n  Just within the hour, a story was posted on Reuters news service out \nof Beirut:\n\n       Six hours after tanks and militiamen pulled out of Mazraat \n     al-Qubeir, a Syrian farmer said he returned to find only \n     charred bodies among the smoldering homes of his once-\n     tranquil hamlet.\n       ``There was smoke rising from the buildings and a horrible \n     smell of human flesh burning'' said a man who told how he \n     watched Syrian troops and ``shabbiha'' gunmen attack his \n     village as he hid in his family olive grove.\n       ``It was like a ghost town'' he told Reuters, . . .''\n\n  Senator McCain and I have been explicit for some period of time. We \nhave been both to Turkey and Lebanon to talk to leaders of the \nopposition and people in the refugee camps, and they simply say to us: \nAs Americans, you are our only hope. This is from a people whose \ngovernment has been determined in its anti-American posture, the Assad \ngovernment, and yet the people now turn to us--as people always do in a \ntime of crisis around the world--and say, This is what America is \nabout. America has a moral government that cares about people's right \nto life and liberty, and we will not be saved unless you get involved.\n  I hope the latest events move our government to go beyond words to \nactions. And immediately. Again, Senator McCain and I have talked about \nactions we would support: arms to the opposition fighters, training of \nthe opposition fighters, safe havens in Turkey, and perhaps other \nneighboring countries to Syria, where they can be trained and equipped; \nprovision of intelligence that we have, which will help the opposition \nfight to defend themselves and their families.\n  Frankly, if it were up to us--and I know I can speak for Senator \nMcCain--I think if we wanted to help and turn the tide quickly without \na lot of unnecessary loss of life, we would use allied air power, \nAmericans and our allies, and we would hit some targets important to \nthe Assad government. I think that would break their will, and it would \nincrease the number of defections from Assad's army and from the very \nimportant business community, and would result in a much sooner end to \nthis terrible waste of lives.\n  So that is our outcry, and that is my answer to the question of my \nfriend from Arizona. I thought the Senator was particularly right in \ncondemning the idea that if we get involved, it militarizes the \nconflict--the conflict is already militarized on one side. Russia and \nIran are providing Assad with all the weapons he needs. In the \nmeantime, the opposition is scrounging around, paying exorbitant prices \njust for bullets which they have been running out of.\n  I ask my friend from Arizona, people say that intervention in Syria \nwill be much harder than it was in Libya. I wonder if he would respond \nto that argument against us getting involved.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. I also want to point out that \ntraveling in the region and meeting with the leaders in these various \ncountries, it cries out for American leadership, I think my colleague \nwould agree, in a coordinated partnership with these countries. But \nthey cry out for American leadership. And meanwhile, the President of \nthe United States, as this slaughter goes on, is silent. His spokesman \nsays they don't want to militarize the conflict. How in the world could \nyou make a statement like that when 10,000 people have already been \nslaughtered? That, to me, is so bizarre. I am not sure I have ever seen \nanything quite like it.\n  There is always the comparison, I say to my friend from Connecticut, \nabout Libya. There is an aspect of this issue. Libya was not in \nAmerica's security interests. Libya was clearly a situation where we \ngot rid of one of the most brutal dictators who was responsible for the \nbombing of Pan Am 103 and the deaths of Americans. But if Syria goes on \nthe path to democracy, it is the greatest blow to Iran in 25 years. \nHezbollah is broken off. Russia loses its last client state. Iran loses \nthe most important ally it has in the region.\n  Finally, I would say to my friend we keep hearing over and over again \nthat extremists will come in; Al Qaida will come in. We heard that in \nTunisia, we heard that in Libya, we are hearing that in Egypt, and we \nare hearing that again--neglecting the fact that al Qaida and \nextremists are the exact antithesis of who these people are. These \npeople believe in peaceful demonstrations to bring about change--they \nhave been repressed through brutality--whereas al Qaida, as we know, \nbelieves in acts of terror.\n  I agree with my colleague, if we provided a sanctuary for these \npeople in order to organize and care for the wounded, to have a shadow \ngovernment set up as we saw in Libya, then I think it is pretty obvious \nthat it would be a huge step forward.\n  Again, as my friend from Connecticut has often said so eloquently, \nprobably the most immortal words ever written in English are: We hold \nthese truths to be self-evident, that all of us are endowed--all--by \nour Creator with certain inalienable rights.\n  The people of Syria who are suffering under this brutal dictatorship \nand are being slaughtered as we speak I believe have those inalienable \nrights. The role of the United States has not been to go everywhere and \nfight every war, but it has been the role of the United States of \nAmerica, when it can, to go to the assistance of people who are \nsuffering under dictatorships such as this, one of the most brutal in \nhistory. And for us to now consign them to the good graces of Russia \nand whether they will veto a U.N. Security Council resolution as to \nwhether we will act on behalf of these people is a great abdication of \nAmerican authority and responsibility.\n  Finally, I wish to say that Senator Lieberman and I have visited \nthese places. We have seen these people. I wish all of our colleagues--\nI wish all Americans--could have gone to the refugee camp where there \nare 25,000 people who have been ejected from their homes, the young men \nwho still had fresh wounds, the young women who had been gang raped, \nthe families and mothers who had lost their sons and daughters. It is \ndeeply moving. It is deeply, deeply moving. And, as my friend from \nConnecticut said, they cry out. They cry out for our help.\n  We should be speaking up every day on their behalf, all of us, and we \nshould be contemplating actions that stop this unprecedented brutality.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator McCain. I think he \nspoke with real clarity and strength, and this is exactly what we need \nto continue to do.\n  I want to go to the point he made. Some people say we shouldn't get \ninvolved in Syria because we don't know who the opposition is; \ntherefore, we should be cautious before helping them.\n  We have had the opportunity to meet the opposition and their \nleadership, both the political opposition and the military opposition. \nAnd I would tell you, to the best of my judgment--I believe it is our \njudgment--these aren't extremists. These are Syrian patriots.\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\nAs Senator McCain said, this whole movement started peacefully. They \nwent out into the squares in big cities in Syria. They were asking for \nmore freedom. They actually weren't at the beginning asking for an \noverthrow of the Assad government. But what was Assad's response to \nthem? He turned his guns on them and started to kill them wantonly. And \nwhen they decided there was no peaceful course--because he rejected \nevery compromise alternative that intermediaries put in--they took up \narms such as they could find.\n  The danger here is not that the people who are the leaders of the \nopposition are extremists or terrorists; the danger is that the \nextremists and terrorists will take over this movement if we and the \nrest of the civilized world don't get involved, and the Syrian \nopposition will be sorely tempted to take their support because they \nhave no alternative. We simply can't let that happen.\n  I know there is a lot going on in our country. I know people are \nworried about the economy, as we are, of course. But America's strength \nand credibility in the world has actually always been not only what we \nare about by our founding documents and our history but what maintains \nour credibility and strength in the world, which is a foundation of our \neconomic strength. The longer we give words but no action in response \nto the murder and rape of victims in Syria, the lower our credibility \nis. And we can't afford that.\n  Senator McCain said, and I want to emphasize, the main reason to get \ninvolved here is humanitarian. It is what America is about. It is about \nthe protection of life and liberty. But it happens to be that this \nmakes a lot of strategic sense, too, because the No. 1 enemy we have in \nthe world today is Iran. If Assad goes down, Iran will suffer a \ngrievous blow.\n  Some people said, and some still say it--including high officials of \nour government--that it is not a question of whether Bashar al Assad \nwill fall but when. I don't agree. Having been over there talking to \nthe opposition, watching what is happening, this is a profoundly unfair \nfight. Assad has most of the guns and systems, and the freedom fighters \nhave very little. He will keep doing this as long as he has to, and \nthis war will go on a long time, with thousands and thousands and \nthousands of more innocent people killed as they were earlier today in \nthe Mazraat al-Qubeir.\n  The facts cry out for us to take action. I hope and pray we will. \nSenator McCain and I and others have. Senator Rubio has an op-ed in the \nWall Street Journal today that speaks to some of the points we have \nmade, and others on both sides I hope will continue to speak out until \nfinally there will be action to save the lives of innocents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \nquestions that opponents of our involvement raised, and the answers I \nwould offer to those questions arguing for our involvement with a \ncoalition of the willing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Providing weapons to the opposition will only \n     ``militarize'' the situation in Syria further and add to the \n     chaos there.\n       Our policy must be based on the reality of the situation in \n     Syria as it is, not as we might wish it to be--and the \n     reality in Syria today is that the conflict has already \n     militarized. It has militarized not because of the Syrian \n     opposition--which began last year by holding peaceful \n     protests--but because of Bashar al Assad himself, who \n     responded to peaceful protests by unleashing tanks, \n     artillery, militias and attack helicopters to slaughter the \n     Syrian people, and will keep doing so until he is stopped.\n       Bashar's regime has been enabled and encouraged in its \n     campaign of violence by Russia, by Iran, and by Hezbollah. \n     They are providing and resupplying Assad with weapons. They \n     are providing funding to sustain his killing machine. They \n     are providing training and instruction to Assad's forces. \n     There are even reports that Iranian operatives are on the \n     ground in Syria. In fact, an IRGC Quds force commander \n     acknowledged this last week.\n       That is why the situation has militarized in Syria. And \n     right now, it is not a fair fight. While Assad is being armed \n     and resupplied by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, the Free \n     Syrian Army has only light weapons to defend itself. When \n     Senator McCain and I traveled to southern Turkey in April to \n     meet with Syrian refugees and opposition fighters, we were \n     told that opposition fighters were running out of ammunition. \n     Getting communications equipment to the opposition in Syria, \n     as the United States has pledged to do, will be helpful. But \n     radios alone will not protect the Syrian people against tanks \n     and helicopters.\n       Providing weapons and intelligence and other lethal support \n     to the Syrian opposition therefore won't militarize the \n     situation in Syria. The conflict already has been \n     militarized, because of Assad. What we can do is give the \n     Syrian people the chance to defend themselves against Assad, \n     by providing them with weapons. This will give the Syrian \n     people a chance to fight back and change the military balance \n     on the ground in Syria.\n       And let me add: it has been almost a year since President \n     Obama said that Assad must go. And still he remains in power. \n     We all agree that there will be no peace or stability in \n     Syria as long as Assad is in charge. But there is absolutely \n     no prospect that he will leave power until the military \n     balance of power in Syria turns against him. As of now, Assad \n     thinks that he is winning. The only way to change the \n     military balance of power is to begin to provide the \n     opposition with the means to turn the tide of this fight \n     against him. Until that happens, Assad will stay, and the \n     Syrian people will continue to die.\n                                  ____\n\n       Syria is not Libya. Intervention in Syria will be much \n     harder and more complicated.\n       It is true that there are differences between Syria and \n     Libya. Syria's air defenses are far more sophisticated. The \n     population of Syria is larger and more diverse than the \n     population of Libya. And the opposition in Syria does not \n     have a safe zone--although it is worth remembering that the \n     only reason the opposition in Libya had a safe zone was \n     because of our intervention. Had we not stepped in when we \n     did, Qaddafi's forces would have overrun Benghazi and \n     slaughtered the people there--just as Bashar al Assad did \n     after the opposition briefly took over Homs and Hama and \n     other cities in Syria. Likewise, if we were to intervene as \n     we did in Libya, we could create a safe zone for the Syrian \n     opposition to organize.\n       But here is another difference between Libya and Syria that \n     is even more important. The stakes in Syria are dramatically \n     higher than they were in Libya.\n       First, let's remember: Bashar al Assad is Iran's most \n     important ally in the Arab world. His regime is the critical \n     linchpin that connects Iran and Hezbollah. As General Mattis \n     told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, \n     the fall of Assad would represent ``the biggest strategic \n     defeat for Iran in 25 years.'' It would make it harder for \n     Tehran to ship weapons to Hezbollah, including the tens of \n     thousands of rockets that are pointed at our ally Israel. \n     That is why the Iranians are doing everything in their power \n     to help Assad crush the opposition and stay in power. The \n     fight in Syria, therefore, is fundamentally about Iran. If \n     Assad stays in power, it will be viewed by everyone in the \n     Middle East as a huge victory for Iran, and a defeat for the \n     United States.\n       Second, if things continue on their current path in Syria, \n     it is increasingly clear that the country will descend into a \n     sectarian civil war. The result could be a failed state in \n     the heart of the Middle East, and the perfect environment for \n     al Qaeda to establish a toehold. In addition, we are already \n     seeing signs that chaos in Syria is spilling over and \n     destabilizing Lebanon. This will likely get worse, \n     threatening not only Lebanon but also Syria's other \n     neighbors, including Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and of course \n     Israel. In short, if Syria collapses, it will be a threat to \n     the entire Middle East, including some of our closest friends \n     there. Add to this that the Syrian regime has one of the \n     largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world.\n       For all of these reasons, the United States has vital \n     national interests at stake in Syria--much more than we did \n     in Libya. We cannot afford to let Iran prevail in Syria. We \n     cannot afford to let Syria become a failed state with weapons \n     of destruction that threaten its neighbors. We cannot afford \n     to allow Syria to become a new base for al Qaeda. And yet, in \n     the absence of our intervention, these are precisely the \n     outcomes that are most likely to happen.\n                                  ____\n\n       Unlike in Libya, there is no international consensus for \n     intervention in Syria.\n       Let's be absolutely clear. The United States should not act \n     unilaterally in Syria. Nor do we need to put any boots on the \n     ground there. On the contrary, our key partners in the Middle \n     East have the money, resources, and territory that are needed \n     for a full-scale effort to train, equip, arm, and organize \n     the Syrian opposition against Assad--and they are ready to do \n     so. What has been missing is leadership, organization and \n     strategy, which only the United States can provide.\n       Senator McCain and I have personally traveled to the Middle \n     East on several occasions this year. We have spoken to the \n     leaders of our key partners in the region. They are ready to \n     work with us to help the opposition. They have also said so \n     publicly. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have called for providing \n     weapons to the Syrian resistance. The Kuwaiti parliament has \n     called on its government to do the same. The leader of Turkey \n     has spoken openly about the need for establishing safe zones. \n     Most importantly, Syrians themselves have for months been \n     calling for international intervention, including military \n     intervention.\n       Now it is true we cannot get a UN Security Council \n     resolution authorizing military\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\n     intervention in Syria. That is because of Russia and China, \n     whose governments made clear long ago that, for their own \n     reasons, they will veto any meaningful resolution related to \n     Syria. There is no sign that is going to change.\n       But let's also remember: NATO took military action in \n     Kosovo in 1999 without UN authorization. Then, as now, a \n     dictator was slaughtering innocent people. Then, as now, the \n     dictator was a close ally of Moscow, which made clear it \n     would not allow the UN to authorize the use of force. \n     Thankfully, this did not stop President Clinton from rescuing \n     Kosovo. At the time, he argued, correctly, that the UN \n     Security Council was not the sole path to international \n     legitimacy and instead worked through NATO to save Kosovo.\n       The same is true today. And there is no reason why the Arab \n     League or the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) or perhaps the \n     Friends of Syria Contact Group couldn't provide the \n     legitimacy for military measures to save Syria, just as NATO \n     did in 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n       Why not just let Syria's neighbors take the lead in helping \n     the Syrian opposition? Why does America need to be involved?\n       It's true that many of our partners in the Middle East want \n     to help the Syrian opposition by providing them with weapons. \n     But they want and need America to work with them in this \n     effort. They recognize that only the United States can \n     provide the leadership, the organization, and the strategy to \n     ensure that these efforts to support the Syrian opposition \n     are successful.\n       That being said, I don't doubt that, in the absence of U.S. \n     leadership, some countries in the region will try to supply \n     the Syrians with weapons on their own. Likewise, the Syrian \n     fighters themselves are trying to find weapons wherever they \n     can--including through the black market and criminal \n     networks. And can we blame them for doing so? They are in a \n     fight for their very lives.\n       So the question is not whether weapons are going to flow to \n     the opposition. The question is whether we the United States \n     play a role in this process, or whether we take a hands-off \n     approach and just let the chips fall where they may. The \n     question is, which path is more likely to allow us to protect \n     our interests and encourage a decent outcome in Syria? Which \n     path is more likely to be successful?\n       If we stand back, it is much more likely that the people in \n     Syria who will end up with weapons will not be the people we \n     want to see empowered. It will not be the elements in the \n     opposition who respect human rights and reject terrorism.\n       By contrast, if we get involved, we will be in a much \n     stronger position to influence the conduct of the Syrian \n     opposition, to empower the responsible elements inside the \n     country and sideline those on the fringes who commit human \n     rights abuses or who have ties to al Qaeda.\n                                  ____\n\n       The Russians can be persuaded to abandon Assad. We should \n     focus on attention on diplomacy with Moscow, rather than \n     aiding the opposition.\n       For months, the Obama Administration has told us that \n     Russia is on the brink of changing its position and \n     abandoning Assad. For months, we have been told that Moscow \n     is coming around to seeing things our way. And as we've \n     waited and waited for the Russians, thousands more Syrians \n     have been killed, the situation inside Syria has \n     deteriorated, and nothing has changed.\n       Mr. President, it is time to stop waiting for Putin. The \n     Russians are not going to abandon Assad--especially as long \n     as he seems to be winning on the battlefield. If there is any \n     chance to get Moscow on board, it will only happen when the \n     Russians realize that Assad is going to lose--and that it is \n     therefore in their interest to work with us to hasten his \n     departure in exchange for protecting their interests in post-\n     Assad Syria.\n       Finally, let me add, even if Putin is somehow persuaded to \n     abandon Assad, it is far from clear that he has the means to \n     deliver. Last year, the Turkish government--which had \n     previously been one of Assad's closest partners in the \n     world--turned against him as the violence in Syria escalated. \n     This had absolutely no effect on Assad, who continued his \n     campaign of terror. The same very well could prove to be the \n     case with Russia as well.\n                                  ____\n\n       We don't know who the opposition is, and we should \n     therefore be cautious before helping them.\n       Mr. President, we hear again and again that we don't know \n     who the Syrian opposition is. This astonishes me. It has been \n     nearly a year and a half since this uprising began. If we \n     don't know who the Syrian opposition is by now, it is only \n     because of a willful refusal on the part of the Obama \n     Administration to find out who they are.\n       The truth is, we do have a good idea of who these people \n     are. Senator McCain and I have met with them--here in \n     Washington, in Turkey, Lebanon and elsewhere in the region. \n     We have met the leaders of the Syrian National Council and of \n     the Free Syrian Army. We have met with young Syrian activists \n     who have been going back and forth into Syria. We have met \n     with the refugees who have fled the killing fields of Hama \n     and Homs and Deraa into neighboring countries.\n       So there is no great mystery here. These people are not al \n     Qaeda. They are Syrians who are desperately trying to free \n     themselves from a terrible dictatorship.\n       Now it is unquestionably true that al Qaeda is trying to \n     exploit the situation in Syria. They want to get a foothold \n     there. But that is precisely why we must help the opposition. \n     The fact is, the longer this conflict goes on, the more the \n     Syrian people are going to be vulnerable to radicalization. \n     And if responsible nations abandon the people of Syria, al \n     Qaeda will stand a better chance of making inroads.\n                                  ____\n\n       The opposition is too divided, and therefore we can't \n     effectively help them until they unify and get organized.\n       It is true that there are divisions in the Syrian \n     opposition. But it is worth remembering that the Libyan \n     opposition also was divided. It was our intervention that \n     helped them to unite, not least because we ensured that they \n     had the safe zone in which to do so.\n       People who therefore argue that we shouldn't help the \n     Syrian opposition until they are united have it exactly \n     backwards. It is precisely by helping the Syrian opposition \n     that we can unite them.\n       A U.S.-coordinated train-and-equip mission would provide \n     the leverage to better unify and broaden the opposition, \n     incorporate all of the key stakeholders in Syrian society, \n     and influence their conduct. The benefit for the United \n     States in helping to lead this effort directly is that it \n     would allow us to more effectively empower those Syrian \n     groups that share our interests and our values.\n       Syrian fighters who want our help must reject al-Qaeda and \n     terrorism; refrain from human rights abuses and revenge \n     killings; place themselves under civilian-led opposition \n     command-and-control; and secure any weapons stockpiles that \n     fall into their hands.\n                                  ____\n\n       The American people are tired of war. We can't afford to \n     get involved in another fight in the Middle East.\n       Mr. President, Senator McCain and I know that the American \n     people are tired of war. But the fact is, the United States \n     remains the leader of the world. We are the indispensable \n     nation. And we have vital national interests in the world \n     that we need to uphold, and we have values that we have to \n     stand for. Everyone in the world knows that there is only one \n     nation on earth that can stop the killing in Syria, if it \n     chooses to do so, and that is us. And if we fail to do so, \n     then the responsibility for that failure and that continued \n     killing will also rest with us--just as it did with Rwanda.\n       Let me close, Mr. President, by asking a simple question: \n     how many people must die before the United States puts an end \n     to this slaughter? More than 10,000 have been killed. More \n     than 1,000 have died just since the Annan plan was announced \n     two months ago. How many more must be killed before we do \n     something meaningful to hasten the end of the Assad regime?\n       A few days ago, the Washington Post ran a story about the \n     parallels between the genocide in Bosnia during the 1990s, \n     and the killing that is taking place in Syria today. The Post \n     interviewed a 37-year old survivor of the Srebrenica \n     massacre, who said: ``It's bizarre how `never again' has come \n     to mean `again and again.' It's obvious that we live in a \n     world where Srebrenicas are still possible. What's happening \n     in Syria today is almost identical to what happened in Bosnia \n     two decades ago.''\n       That is sadly true. Shame on us if we fail to stop history \n     from repeating itself.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask permission to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Gaspee Day\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are always wise in this Chamber \nto reflect with reverence and gratitude on those who risked their lives \nfighting to establish this great Republic. Today I would like to \nrecognize and celebrate the 240th anniversary of one of the earliest \nacts of defiance against the British Crown in our American struggle for \nindependence.\n  Most Americans remember the Boston Tea Party as one of the major \nevents building up to the American Revolution. I see the pages in front \nof me nodding knowledgeably: Yes, I do know about the Boston Tea Party.\n  We learned that story of the spirited Bostonians--literally spirited \nBostonians, I am told--clamoring onto the decks of the East India \nCompany's ships and dumping those tea bags into Boston Harbor to \nprotest British taxation without representation.\n  However, there is a milestone on the path to the Revolutionary War \nthat is too often overlooked, and that is the story of 60 or so brave \nRhode Islanders who challenged British rule more than\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\na year before the Tea Party in Boston. Today I rise to honor those \nlittle-known heroes who risked their lives in defiance of oppression on \none dark night in Rhode Island 240 years ago.\n  In the year before the Revolutionary War, as tensions with the \nAmerican Colonies grew, King George III stationed revenue cutters, \narmed customs patrol vessels, along the American coastline to prevent \nsmuggling and force the payment of taxes and impose the authority of \nthe Crown. One of the most notorious of these ships was stationed in \nRhode Island's Narragansett Bay. The HMS Gaspee and her captain, Lt \nWilliam Dudingston, were known for destroying fishing vessels, seizing \ncargo, and flagging down ships only to harass, humiliate, and \ninterrogate the colonials.\n  Outraged by this egregious abuse of power, the merchants and \nshipmasters of Rhode Island flooded civil and military officials with \ncomplaints of the Gaspee, exhausting every diplomatic and legal means \nto stir the British Crown to regulate Dudingston's conduct. Not only \ndid British officials ignore the Rhode Islanders' concerns, they \nresponded with open hostility. The commander of the local British \nfleet, Adm John Montagu, warned that anyone who dared attempt acts of \nresistance or retaliation against the Gaspee would be taken into \ncustody and hanged as a pirate, which brings us to June 9, 1772, 240 \nyears ago this week.\n  Rhode Island ship captain Benjamin Lindsey was en route to Providence \nfrom Newport in his ship, the Hannah, when he was accosted and ordered \nto yield for inspection by the Gaspee. Captain Lindsey and his crew \nignored that command and raced northward up Narragansett Bay--despite \nthe warning shots fired by the Gaspee. As the Gaspee gave chase, \nCaptain Lindsey knew that his ship was lighter and drew less water, so \nhe sped north toward Pawtuxet Cove, toward the shallow waters off \nNamquid Point. The Hannah shot over the shallows, but the heavier \nGaspee grounded and stuck firm.\n  The British ship and her crew were caught stranded in a falling tide \nand would need to wait many hours for a rising tide to free the hulking \nGaspee. Spotting this irresistible opportunity, Captain Lindsey \nproceeded on his course to Providence and enlisted the help of John \nBrown, a respected merchant from one of the most prominent families in \nthe city. The two men rallied a group of Rhode Island patriots at \nSabin's Tavern in what is now the East Side of Providence. Together, \nthe group resolved to put an end to the Gaspee's reign over Rhode \nIsland waters.\n  That night, the men, led by Captain Lindsey and Abraham Whipple, \nembarked in eight longboats quietly down Narragansett Bay. They \nencircled the Gaspee and called on Lieutenant Dudingston to surrender \nhis ship. Dudingston refused and ordered his men to fire upon any who \ntried to board. Refusing to yield to Dudingston's threats, the Rhode \nIslanders forced their way onto the Gaspee's deck, wounding Dudingston \nwith a musket ball in the midst of the struggle. Right there in the \nwaters of Warwick, RI, the very first blood in the conflict that was to \nbecome the American Revolution was drawn.\n  As the patriots commandeered the ship, Brown ordered one of his Rhode \nIslanders, a physician named John Mawney, to head immediately to the \nship's cabin to tend to Dudingston's wound. In their moment of victory, \nBrown and his men showed mercy to a man loathed for his cruelty, a man \nwho had threatened to open fire on them only moments before.\n  Allowing the Gaspee's crew time to collect their belongings, Brown \nand Whipple took the captive Englishmen to the shore before returning \nto the despised Gaspee to rid Narragansett Bay of her presence once and \nfor all. They set her afire. The blaze spread to the ship's powder \nmagazine, setting off explosions like fireworks, the resulting blast \nechoing across the bay as airborne fragments of the ship splashed down \ninto the water.\n  The site of this historic victory is now named Gaspee Point in honor \nof these audacious Rhode Islanders. So I come again to this Senate \nfloor to share this story and to commemorate the night of June 9, 1772, \nand the names of Benjamin Lindsey, John Brown, and Abraham Whipple, a \nman who went on to serve as a naval commander in the Revolutionary War. \nI do know that these events and the patriots whose efforts allowed for \ntheir success are not forgotten in my home State. Over the years, I \nhave enjoyed marching in the annual Gaspee Day Parade in Warwick, RI, \nas every year we recall the courage and zeal of these men who fired the \nfirst shots that drew the first blood in that great contest for the \nfreedoms we enjoy today. They set a precedent for future patriots to \nfollow--including those in Boston who more than a year later would have \ntheir Tea Party.\n  But don't forget, as my home State prepares once again to celebrate \nthe anniversary of the Gaspee incident, that while Massachusetts \ncolonists threw tea bags off the deck of their British ship, we blew \nours up and shot its captain more than a year before. We are little in \nRhode Island, but, as Lieutenant Dudingston discovered, we pack a \npunch.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Jobs\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I just returned from a week back home in \nIndiana where I had the opportunity to meet with Hoosiers from all \nparts of our State and on all kinds of different issues. One of the \ncommon themes that came out of my week back home was the sentiment that \nwe just are not growing as fast as we need to as a nation in order to \nget people back to work.\n  We held a job fair in Lafayette, IN. About 2,200 people showed up at \nthis job fair looking for work opportunities. While many walked away \nwith job offers in hand, clearly there are not enough viable \nopportunities out there to get the people back to work who really want \nto get back to work.\n\n  As I talked to businesspeople across the State, particularly with \nsmall business owners, there was a common theme that came forward: they \nare very reluctant to hire. It is not that their businesses aren't \nimproving. We have seen some significant improvement, particularly in \nIndiana, with some drop in the unemployment rate. But they say it is \nnot specifically that they don't have the work, it is that they are \nafraid to hire. They are afraid to hire new people because there is so \nmuch uncertainty about what their taxes are going to be, what new \nregulations are going to come forward, what new items are going to be \nimposed upon them by the regulatory authorities in Washington, DC, and \nby the health care reform bill which puts some new mandate on them.\n\n       To hire new employees, they say, we have to factor in all \n     of these various uncertainties in terms of our ability to \n     continue this business on a profitable basis. So whether it \n     is talking to farmers in southern Indiana who are upset about \n     the various proposed regulations affecting their businesses \n     or whether it is manufacturers in northwest Indiana or to \n     small business people across the State, I am hearing this \n     repetitive response--that Washington is trying to impose too \n     much, and there is too much uncertainty about their ability \n     to deal with the future and make decisions about hiring.\n\n  One of the latest things we have been hearing is that the EPA is \nimposing significant new regulations relative to the Clean Air Act on \nemissions that will affect Indiana utilities in a very significant way. \nAnother thing our businesspeople mentioned is they don't know what \ntheir utility rates are going to be in the future because of these new \nregulations coming out, and the utilities are basically telling them \nthey are going to have to pay more in the future because of these new \nregulations.\n  I stand here as someone who voted for the Clean Air Act and supports \nthe Clean Air Act. We are all for clean air. However, there are those \nof us who are trying to propose reasonable ways of achieving that goal \nwithout negatively impacting our ability to hire people and the ability \nof consumers to pay their utility bills and the ability of corporations \nand businesses to have reasonable rates so they can compete\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nworldwide in producing products. They are not asking for a return to \ndirty skies. They are not asking for a return to dirty water. They are \ncitizens of the United States. They breathe the same air we all \nbreathe. What they are saying, however, is that they need a solution to \nthe problem handled in a responsible, reasonable way, and an affordable \nway that gives them time to implement these regulations. There has been \na lot of talk recently about two items the EPA has been imposing on the \npower industry, and after visiting with Indiana utilities it is clear \nthe EPA timeline will result in more job loss and skyrocketing rates. \nSo, again, while we all want to support clean air, doing so in a way \nthat also keeps our people at work and keeps our utility rates at a \nreasonable level is not being considered by the EPA.\n  I joined with a Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to bring \nforward legislation that meets the standards and meets the goals but \ndoes so in a way that gives those power-producing utilities the \nopportunity and time and cost opportunity to be able to accomplish \nthat. All we have done is just extend, in the case of one of the \nregulations, for 2 years, and in the case of another, for 3 years to \ngive those utilities time to comply because the immediate compliance \nrequirements of the EPA on these utilities means they are going to have \nto shut down the plants.\n  Some of them are in retrofit as we speak; however, that retrofit may \nnot meet the EPA deadline. Therefore, they are asking for the right to \nget a waiver for an extension. That is what Manchin-Coats--Coats-\nManchin--does. It provides a reasonable way of achieving the goals of \nclean air, but doing so in a way that doesn't have a devastating impact \non our States as these regulations would do.\n  One is the CSAPR Rule, which deals with sulfur and nitrogen oxide \nemissions, and the other is called Utility MACT, which reduces mercury \nemissions. In particular, there is a movement underway now to remove \nmercury from these emissions. But if we don't do it in a responsible \nway, the consequences of the EPA regulations coming down hard mean \nclosing up to six powerplants in Indiana and a skyrocketing of utility \nrates.\n  There is a particular impact on small business. Small business, as we \nknow, provides most of the hiring and those small businesspeople don't \nhave the backroom support to comply with all the written and required \nregulations that are being imposed on them. I have talked to so many \npeople who have said instead of being out on the showroom floor, being \nout front at the counter, they have to be back half the time in their \nbusiness complying with regulations. A hospital administrator told me \nof the 12,000 people under their employ, 6,000 provide care and 6,000 \nfill out paperwork for compliance with regulations, compliance with \nreimbursement, administrative costs, many of which are imposed by \nlegislation or regulation, in most cases, that comes out of Washington.\n  So as we look at opportunities in the Senate to responsibly address \nsome of these issues, in this business it is always tempting to \npoliticize the process so that if someone doesn't immediately step up \nand salute the latest EPA regulation, we are harming people here or \ndenying people there; that there are safety concerns, and we are \nrisking harm to people and so forth. All we are asking for is a \nreasonable way to go forward to meet reasonable health and safety \nstandards. What we are saying is that the surge of regulations that is \npouring out of Washington upon our people and upon our businesses \nwithin the last 2 or 3 years is staggering, and it is clearly holding \ndown growth. It is clearly holding down economic recovery. It is \nclearly holding down the ability of businesses to hire and put more \npeople back to work.\n  So whether it is the Inhofe resolution of disapproval, which I \nstrongly support, or any of a number of other proposals, I am going to \nsupport those. The blank check that has been given to regulatory \nagencies, because it is not possible for this administration to pass it \nthrough Congress as they did in 2009 and 2010 with a total majority no \nlonger exists. Therefore, the regulatory agencies appear to have been \ngiven a blank check, and they have just run amok with regulations. So \nas we look at these regulations, let's take a reasonable look in terms \nof what we need to accomplish and in terms of providing for the health \nand safety of our people and what the consequences are of trying to do \nit in a way that jeopardizes our economic recovery and getting people \nback to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on S. 3240, the \nlegislation to reauthorize the farm bill. As a former chairman and \nformer ranking member of the Agriculture Committee in the Senate, I \nrecognize how difficult it is to combine all of the diverse interests \ninto legislation that meets the needs of all crops, regions, and rural \nand urban communities that the farm bill impacts. This bill before us \nis no exception. I am disappointed that at this time I am not able to \nsupport this bill because of its current form.\n  I wish to take a moment to commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their efforts in putting a farm bill together in the very \ndifficult budget time we are in. We all understand that agriculture has \nto pay its fair share of deficit reduction. Frankly, for what it is \nworth, it is going to be at the lead of the pack when it comes to \nparticipating in deficit reduction. We are one of the first agencies \nout of the box to make a commitment to do so.\n  That being said, it is my hope that at the end of the day, I will be \nable to support this bill as we complete the legislative process. \nHowever, as of today, the bill is filled with inequities and is \nunbalanced. Contrary to statements made on this floor over the last \nseveral days, the bill under consideration seeks to place a one-size-\nfits-all policy on every region of the country. It works for some \nregions, but it does not work for other regions. Because the \ndistribution of benefits is skewed to one particular region, it fails \nthe basic test of fairness that we all seek in legislation that moves \nthrough this Chamber.\n  I believe the farm bill needs to provide an effective safety net for \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural communities in times of deep and sustained \nprice decline. It should also responsibly provide nutrition assistance \nto those in need in all parts of the country, urban and rural alike.\n  The farm bill initially, and remains, focused on farmers and \nranchers, helping them manage a combination of challenges, much out of \ntheir own individual control, such as unpredictable weather, variable \ninput costs, and market volatility. All combined determine profit or \nloss in any given year. The 2008 farm bill continues today to provide a \nstrong safety net for producers, and any follow-on legislation must \nadhere to and honor the same commitment we made to our farmers and \nranchers across America 4 years ago.\n  At the same time, I believe the agriculture sector can contribute to \ndeficit reduction, and the bill before us provides savings and \nmandatory spending programs. The key, though, is to do this in an \nequitable and fair manner throughout all titles and areas of the bill. \nThe nutrition benefits in this bill, which are already inflated by the \nPresident's failed stimulus package, are reduced by only one-half of 1 \npercent, while the commodity title is cut by roughly 15 percent. By \nthis account, it is clear that the Agriculture Committee carefully \ndetermined how best to contribute to deficit reduction to ensure an \nundue burden was not placed on those truly in need.\n  This farm bill will be my fourth as a Member of Congress, and each \nhas had its own unique challenges and opportunities. Balancing the \nneeds and interests of all agriculture requires patience and an open \near. It is very important that we recognize the unique differences \nbetween commodities as well as different parts of the country.\n  As agricultural markets become more complex, we must be mindful that \na one-size-fits-all program no longer works for U.S. agriculture. \nRegions are much more diverse than they ever were, and we need to \nrecognize this diversity by providing producers with different options \nthat best match their cropping and growing decisions.\n  My greatest concern with this bill is that the commodity title \nredistributes resources from one region to another not based on market \nforces or cropping decisions, but based on how the underlying program--\nthe Agriculture Risk Coverage Program--was designed.\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\nAfter deducting a share for deficit reduction, certain commodities \nreceive more resources than others, and crops such as peanuts and rice \nare left without any safety net whatsoever.\n  There are many reports illustrating the lopsidedness of this bill. \nAmong the biggest losers in budget baseline are wheat, barley, grain, \ngrain sorghum, rice, cotton, and peanuts. We should not convince \nourselves that this is not going to have an enormous negative \nconsequence for many regions of the country. Put simply, by making the \nbill too rich for a few at the expense of many it lacks balance.\n  Some will say planting shifts are responsible for much of the change \nin the budget baseline, and that is partly true. But it does not take \naway the injury that would be inflicted on regions of the country nor \ndoes it tell the whole story. By squeezing all crops into a program \nspecially designed for one or two crops, this bill will force many \ngrowers to switch to those crops in order to have an effective safety \nnet. This is the very planting distortion caused by farm policy that we \nseek to avoid in any farm bill.\n\n  But there is another very serious problem with this bill: It is not \ngoing to be there when farmers really need it. Whether offered on an \non-farm or area-wide basis, offering farmers a narrow 10-percent band \nof revenue protection will not provide a safety net if crop prices \ncollapse--and we know they will. Under this bill, a farmer has an 11-\npercent deductible, then the next 10 percent of losses is covered, but \nthen farmers are left totally exposed to a plunge in crop prices all \nthe way down to the loan rate. If that happens, Congress will be asked \nto pass ad hoc disaster programs again. We should seek to avoid such \ndisaster packages, and farm bills give us the opportunity to do that, \nnot create ad hoc disaster opportunities. Crop insurance can cover the \nproduction side of the risk if you can afford to buy higher coverage, \nbut it does not cover year-on-year low prices. Even the 10-percent \nrevenue band the bill does cover has problems. Because the revenue \nguarantee is based on the previous 5 years' price and production, the \nguarantee is only as good as those previous 5 years. If they were bad \nor they become bad, the guarantee is also bad. This is not an effective \nsafety net.\n  Just last week, my staff and I traveled throughout south Georgia, and \nwe witnessed crop damages and in some cases total losses of crops which \nwere the result of a hailstorm that occurred across a 40-mile stretch \nof Georgia. It is estimated that well over 10,000 acres have been \ndamaged or totally lost. I do not see how a small band of revenue \nprotection, provided for in this bill, that is limited to $50,000, is \nhelpful to some farmers who lost over $1 million in one field. The ARC \nproposal in this bill is simply not an effective safety net.\n  Members have come to the floor championing the commodity and crop \ninsurance programs included in the bill, as well as stating that we \nwere solving the problem with commodity programs by eliminating direct \npayments. I have seen quotes in the press criticizing southern \ncommodities, stating we are too closely tied to direct payments.\n  Well, let me be very clear. I have never been a fan of direct \npayments, and back in 1996, as a Member of the House, I supported a \nmuch different proposal. Let me also state clearly that from my point \nof view, direct payments were always difficult to defend and we needed \nto find a different way to provide a safety net, while doing it in a \nfiscally responsible way. Southern growers have not asked for direct \npayments at any time during the current discussions. My criticism stems \nentirely from the fact that this farm bill shoehorns all producers into \na one-size-fits-all policy. Producer choice based on a producer's \ninherent risk is the better course to follow.\n  The University of Georgia's National Center for Peanut \nCompetitiveness evaluated the ARC Program, which is the fundamental \nsafety net that is provided for in this farm bill, and they determined \nthat it is of little utility to peanut producers. The center has a \ndatabase of 22 representative farms spread throughout Oklahoma, New \nMexico, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, \nNorth Carolina, and Virginia. Based on the analysis provided, this farm \nbill does not provide the same level of protection as for midwestern \ngrowers who will be growing corn and soybeans. That is a fact.\n  I want to work with the chair and ranking member with respect to \ntrying to make the bill more balanced and more equitable, but, frankly, \nall of our offers to this point in time have been rejected. Peanut \nproducers have offered no proposal that includes direct payments, yet \nthey are labeled as ``unwilling to change from the status quo.'' The \nARC Program is not new; it is a derivative of a program in the 2008 \nfarm bill that experienced low participation. In fact, when producers \nhad a choice, they chose something other than this type of program.\n  In spite of all this, I should point out that this bill includes a \nnew program for cotton that complies with our international commitments \nand will show our trading partners that we will abide by our \ninternational agreements.\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, I \ncommitted to finding a solution to the WTO Brazil case. I authored \nlegislation in 2005 and again in 2008 that made significant changes in \nthe cotton and export programs to bring us into compliance with our \ninternational commitments. We eliminated the Step 2 program, we \nreformed the cotton marketing loan program, and reduced the cotton \ncountercyclical program unilaterally and in good faith.\n  We find ourselves again reforming the cotton safety net with what is \ncalled the Stacked Income Protection Plan for users of upland cotton, \nor the STAX program. The program in this bill is a significant \ndeparture from what is available to other covered commodities and puts \nus down the path of resolving the WTO dispute with Brazil. My hope now \nis that our Brazilian friends engage in a real and meaningful way and \nwe can put this issue behind us.\n  At the end of the day, let's remember, the reason we are here is to \nrepresent the hard-working men and women who work the land each day to \nprovide the highest quality of agricultural products in the world. I \nbelieve we have the opportunity to pass a bill that can be equal to \ntheir commitment in providing food, feed, and fiber that allow us to \ncontinue to be the greatest producer on the Earth.\n  Right now, this bill lacks the commitment and strength of those it \nwas designed to support. I do not intend to impede the movement of the \nfarm bill that, if repaired through an open amendment process--of which \nwe have been assured at this point--has the potential of providing for \nall of America.\n  Farm bills are complex. They always consume a lot of floor time. But \nthe farm policy is also very important. I look forward to the \nforthcoming debate over the next several days and weeks and, at the end \nof the day, to hopefully having a true, meaningful, and balanced farm \nbill that will provide producers an equitable opportunity of a safety \nnet and at the same time continue to provide the world with the safest, \nmost productive, and highest quality agricultural products there are \ntoday.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                   Majority Control of Senate Agenda\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, earlier today the majority leader and the \nmajority whip came to the floor to decry and denounce, attack \nRepublicans for what appeared to be literally everything bad that has \nhappened in the world in the last several years, to the point you have \nto ask yourself, do they really believe what they are saying? They came \ndown here to talk about how Republicans are blocking this, are blocking \nthat.\n  I think it is important to point out that now for the past 6 years, \nthe Democrats have been the majority party in the U.S. Senate. In fact, \nfor 2 of those years, they had a filibuster-proof, 60-vote majority in \nthe Senate. Filibuster proof--literally, they could do anything they \nwanted to in the Senate. They had a majority in the House of \nRepresentatives, and, of course, they got the Presidency.\n  If you look at the volume of the legislation that was produced at the \ntime, most of the things that were accomplished with the 60-vote, \nfilibuster-proof majority were things the American people disagreed \nwith--I think as\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nevidenced now by what you see in terms of public opinion polling about \nthe health care bill. Most people disagree with the individual mandate \nthat was included in that legislation and disagree generally with many \nof the provisions in the bill.\n  But my point very simply is, for a period of time, the Democrats \nliterally had the run of the tables here in Washington, DC, as we know \nit--a filibuster-proof, 60-vote majority in the Senate, a majority in \nthe House of Representatives, and the Presidency--yet they come down \nand decry Republicans as being responsible for all the things that have \nor have not happened here in the Senate.\n  One of the things they point out is that there is this intent by \nRepublicans to continue to filibuster legislation. I would argue that \nnothing could be further from the truth. In fact, everybody knows that \nin the Senate the majority leader is the person who is first to be \nrecognized on the Senate floor, which allows him to use that power to \noffer a series of Democratic amendments to pending legislation in a way \nthat prevents Republicans from offering their own ideas. It is called \nfilling the tree--sort of a term of art that is used around here in the \nSenate. But filling the tree essentially is what the Democratic \nmajority leader has the opportunity to do because he has the power of \nrecognition and he can fill the amendment tree and prevent the \nRepublican amendments from being offered and voted on.\n  Now, interestingly enough, Majority Leader Reid once insisted that \nthis practice ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.'' Let me \nrepeat that. Majority Leader Reid once insisted that filling the \namendment tree ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.'' But by \nthe way the Senate operates today, it is pretty clear that he has \nabandoned that assessment.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the CRS, Majority \nLeader Reid has employed this tactic a record 59 times. He has used it \nto block minority input into legislation 50 percent more often than the \npast six majority leaders combined. I think that is worth repeating. \nThis majority leader has used the filling-of-the-tree procedure 50 \npercent more often than the past six majority leaders combined. So the \nonly option the minority is left with under that scenario is to \nbasically try to get votes on amendments and to work with the majority, \nin which case the majority says: No, we are not going to give you any \namendments; we have filled the tree. So a cloture motion is filed, and \nwe end up having a vote on cloture.\n  What we have seen repeatedly now is the Senate sort of break down \ninto this state of dysfunction simply because the majority does not \nwant to make tough votes on amendments. We have seen this over and over \nand over again. As I say, it is historic and unprecedented in terms of \nthe number of times it has occurred in the U.S Senate.\n  I would also suggest that the real reason, probably, that we do not \nhave votes on amendments and that the filling of the tree is used \nrepeatedly is because Members on the other side do not want to make the \nhard decisions, do not want to cast the tough votes. I think that is \nevidenced as well by the fact that for 3 years in a row now, we have \nnot had a budget in the Senate.\n  If there was a real interest in solving problems, you would think the \nmajority--again, which has the responsibility to put a budget on the \nfloor--would bring a budget to the floor that would set a direction for \nthe future of this country and ask the Members of the Senate to vote on \nit, to vote on amendments, to have an opportunity to say to the \nAmerican people: This is how we would lead the country. That has not \nhappened now for over 1,100 days, for the past 3 years.\n  Now, Republicans are ready and willing to work with the majority, as \nwe have evidenced on many occasions. In fact, we are going to debate, \nthis next week, farm bill legislation--something for which there is \nbipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I would argue that there are many things we would like to see done. \nWe would love to have an opportunity to vote on extending the tax rates \nthat are in effect today--which is something that even President \nClinton in the last few days has come out in support of--because we \nknow--everybody here knows--we are facing this fiscal cliff. It could \nbe very dangerous to our economy if steps are not taken to prevent and \navoid that. And we would be more than willing to work with the majority \non extending the tax rates to give some certainty to our job creators \nand our small businesses.\n  We would also like to work with them on the sequester that is going \nto happen at the end of the year, in redistributing those cuts in a way \nthat does not completely decimate our national security budget.\n  There are lots of things the Republicans are ready to work on with \nour colleagues on the other side when it comes to trying to grow the \neconomy and create jobs. But, frankly, we believe it is important that \nwe at least have an opportunity to get amendments debated and voted on. \nThat simply has not happened, as I pointed out by the number of times \nthe majority leader has filled the tree.\n  So I am not suggesting there is not plenty of blame to go around in \nWashington for the state of the situation we are in. All I am simply \nsaying is that for the majority leader to come down here and suggest \nthat somehow Republicans are responsible for gridlock here in the U.S. \nSenate is a complete denial of reality and a denial of the facts.\n  As I said before, they had a period here for a few years where they \nhad the complete run of the place. They had a 60-vote, filibuster-proof \nmajority in the Senate, a majority in the House of Representatives, and \nthe Presidency, enabling you to do literally anything you wanted to do. \nThey still have the majority in the U.S. Senate, the ability to control \nthe agenda and to determine what does and does not come to the floor, \nwhat amendments are allowed, and the use of the filling of the tree in \nan unprecedented way. It is pretty clear to me that to suggest for a \nmoment it is Republicans who are attempting to slow things down around \nhere or keep the majority from working its will is completely contrary \nto the facts and the reality, as I think most Senators--all Senators, I \nthink--know.\n  I know my colleague from Wyoming is someone who is somewhat new here, \nbut he has been here long enough now to have seen many times where the \nmajority has prevented the minority from actually offering amendments, \ngetting votes on amendments on the floor of the Senate. I would just \nsuggest to him and allow him to make some observations with regard to \nthis subject as well because it strikes me, at least, that he and I \nboth--and many of our colleagues--are very interested in working with \nthe majority on things that would actually put people back to work, get \nour economy growing again.\n  We would love to have that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would just like to comment on that. \nBecause it does not matter how long one is here, all we need do is pick \nup the newspaper or pick up the National Journal. I agree with my \ncolleague from South Dakota.\n  At the beginning of this year, the National Journal, big article, \npicture of the majority leader, and the headline is: ``Reid's New \nElectoral Strategy.'' ``Forget passing bills'' is the subheadline. \n``Forget passing bills. The Democrats just want to play the blame game \nin 2012.''\n  That is exactly what we saw this morning on the floor of the Senate. \nThis is not some piece of fiction. This is something that actually the \nmajority leader told 40 Democrats from the House about his goal, his \nintentions for the 2012 year in Congress. It goes on to say:\n\n       Working with the White House, Senate Democrats are \n     applauding a 2012 floor agenda driven by Obama's reelection \n     campaign. . . .\n\n  It goes on.\n\n       Senate floor action will be planned less to make law--\n\n  We have 8.2 percent unemployment, and this party admits--the leader \nadmits in this piece the Senate action will be planned less to make \nlaw--\n\n     than to buttress Obama's charge that Republicans are \n     obstructing measures. . . .\n\n  That is what their goal is? That is a year's plan, as outlined to \nDemocrats in the House from the majority leader.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       . . . Democrats will push legislation that polls well and \n     dovetails with Obama's campaign. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\n\n  With 8.2 percent unemployment, that is not polling so well. With the \nNew York Times reporting today that over two-thirds of Americans want \nto find that the health care law is unconstitutional--New York Times, \ntwo-thirds of Americans, unconstitutional health care law. That is what \nthe people are saying.\n  Nothing this President and this administration and the Democrats are \ndoing is polling very well. We ought to look back at the history of \nthis great institution. The Senate is a unique legislative institution. \nNo matter who the majority is, it is designed to guarantee the minority \nparty, and therefore a large block of Americans whom it represents, \nthat that party has a voice.\n  Traditionally, this body functions well when the majority party works \nto find consensus with the minority party on the process and the \nsubstance of legislation--consultation, compromise, and both parties \nworking together. Historically, that has been the rule, not the \nexception, as we have seen in recent years.\n  I sit here and look at the seat, the empty seat a couple rows ahead \nof me and off to the other side of the aisle where Robert Byrd sat.\n  Senator Byrd understood the importance of allowing for a full debate \nand amendment process in order to preserve the Senate as a unique \ninstitution in our democracy--``the one place in the whole government \nwhere the minority is guaranteed a public airing of its views.'' The \nSenate, he taught, ``was intended to be a forum for open and free \ndebate and for the protection of political minorities.'' Indeed, ``as \nlong as the Senate retains the power to amend and the power of \nunlimited debate, the liberties of the people will remain secure.''\n  I would say allowing the minority to debate and amend legislation has \ngiven way to what we see now as Democrat's election-year political \nstrategy of blaming Republicans as obstructionists. The minority and \nthe majority need to work together. Majority Leader Reid has done all \nthese things in terms of the strategy and the blaming by preventing \nRepublicans from amending pending legislation, ending debate before it \nstarts, and bypassing the committee process.\n  He has made a habit of squelching the voice of the minority by \ncurtailing its ability to amend legislation. The majority leader is \nalways the first to be recognized on the Senate floor. He can use that \npower to offer a series of Democratic amendments to pending legislation \nin a way that prevents Republicans from offering any of their ideas. It \nis called filling the tree.\n  How often does it happen? Let's think first about the history. The \nmajority leader once insisted that this practice of filling the tree, \nhe said, ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.'' By the way \nthe Senate operates today, however, it is clear he has abandoned that \nprevious assessment.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, Majority Leader Reid \nhas employed this tactic a record 59 times. He has used it to block \nminority input in legislation 50 percent more often than the past five \nmajority leaders combined. The minority's only option, under these \ncircumstances, is to oppose ending debate on legislation known as \ninvoking cloture in order to convince the majority to allow it to offer \namendments to legislation and thereby represent the interests of their \nconstituents.\n  This is a very bad practice. When one takes a look at Congress after \nCongress, whether it was George Mitchell, Bob Dole, Trent Lott, Tom \nDaschle, Bill Frist, combined, here we have Senator Reid 50 percent \nmore than all the others combined.\n  So here we are. We have come to the floor of the Senate to respond to \nwhat we heard from the majority leader this morning about \nobstructionism, and what do we see? It is just a page from the majority \nleader's playbook of the electoral strategy for 2012 from the leader of \nthe majority. Forget passing bills, the Democrats just want to play the \nblame game in 2012. That is exactly what we saw today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, actually, I am not here to play the \nblame game. I am here to talk about a place where we in the Senate have \nfound real bipartisan consensus. It is an issue that is critical to us \nin the State of New Hampshire and to all the Senators because, in 23 \ndays, our country's surface transportation programs are going to shut \ndown unless Congress can come to an agreement on critical legislation.\n  Nearly 3 months ago, 74 Senators voted to pass a measure that would \nreauthorize these programs through the end of fiscal year 2013, \nproviding much needed certainty to our States and to private industry. \nIn this Chamber, Senators from vastly different ideologies were able to \nlay aside those differences and come up with bipartisan ways to pay for \nthis bill, to streamline Federal programs, and to make our \ntransportation investments more efficient, so we spend less on \noverhead, more on roads and bridges and other transportation projects.\n  This process was not easy, as everyone remembers. It required \ncompromise from both sides to ensure that we could put together \nlegislation that would bring America's transportation policies into the \n21st century. But if Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma, the ranking member on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and Barbara Boxer, the \nchair of that committee, can come together and figure out how to put \ntogether a transportation bill, there is no reason why our adjoining \nbody over in the House cannot do the same thing.\n  I have been very disturbed by recent news that the House is less \ninterested in finishing this bill than in approving a host of unrelated \npolicies. There is a time and a place for us to consider whether some \nof the amendments that have been proposed on the Transportation bill in \nthe House, such as whether coal ash should be regulated as a hazardous \nmaterial, but the Transportation bill is not one of those places.\n\n  We need to focus on policies that will encourage the types of \ninvestment in our highways, in our railroads, in our bridges that put \nAmericans back to work and spur economic growth. We just heard the \nunemployment rate went up slightly for the last month. We have \nlegislation pending that came out of the Senate that would put people \nback to work.\n  Every billion dollars we spend in transportation funding puts 28,000 \npeople to work, and we have the House fiddling while construction \nworkers all over this country are out of work. The conference committee \nneeds to focus on transportation policies that will reduce congestion, \nthat will create jobs, and that unleash economic development.\n  We have a project similar to that in New Hampshire. It is one of our \nmost important roads. It is the corridor that goes from our largest \ncity of Manchester down to the border with Massachusetts. It has too \nmuch traffic on it today. It is a safety concern. We need to finish \nthis road. We are being held up from doing that because of the failure \nof the House to be willing to go along with what the Senate did and \nreach agreement.\n  Our Department of Transportation in New Hampshire has said that work \non just a single portion of this highway, Interstate 93, will put to \nwork 369 people in the construction industry, which is still \nstruggling. That is the industry in this country that still has the \nbiggest impact from this recession. Last year in Nashua and Portsmouth, \nNH, construction employment declined by 7 percent. Job creation in that \nindustry remains stagnant in New Hampshire and nationwide and we need \nthis legislation to get these folks back to work.\n  It is not only construction jobs that depend on Federal investments \nin transportation; it is our economy as a whole. The deteriorating \ncondition of America's infrastructure, its roads, its railroads, its \nbridges, costs businesses more than $100 billion a year in lost \nproductivity, and this is a bill that a broad coalition of people are \nbehind. Both the AFL CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce agree that we \nneed transportation legislation.\n  Despite the importance of this spending to American workers and \nbusinesses today, the House plans to vote on a motion to cut Federal \ntransportation investment by one-third. The Federal Highway \nAdministration found that cutting funding so severely would put 2,000 \npeople in New Hampshire alone out of work, one-half million people in \nthe country out of work.\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n  This is a time when we should be creating jobs, not destroying them. \nCutting funding at this time would be so shortsighted. Brazil, China, \nand India are all spending about 9 percent of their GDP per year on \ninfrastructure, roads, bridges, public transportation. What we are \nspending in the United States is roughly 2 percent. That is half of \nwhat we were spending in the 1960s when there was real bipartisan \nsupport for policies from both President Kennedy and President Dwight \nEisenhower to invest in projects such as our Interstate Highway System.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that investment in our \nInterstate Highway System was one of the best decisions in our Nation's \nhistory. Members of both parties need to come together as we have for \ndecades and focus on reasonable bipartisan policies that will end the \nuncertainty that States and private industry are facing when it comes \nto our transportation legislation.\n  On June 30, it will have been 1,000 days since our last Federal \nTransportation bill expired. Congress needs to come together now and \npass a transportation reauthorization bill before we get to the end of \nthose 1,000 days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the farm \nbill which is now before the Senate. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I worked, together with my fellow committee \nmembers, on a bipartisan basis to put forward what we believe is a \nsound farm bill for this country. We passed the bill out of committee \non a strong bipartisan vote, 16 to 5. So it comes to the Senate floor \nfor deliberation. The bill is entitled ``The Agriculture, Reform, Food \nand Jobs Act of 2012.''\n  I would like to begin with just a simple question. Why is the farm \nbill so important? Why is the farm bill so important? I think the first \nchart I have sums it up. This is the most important point I will make \ntoday. I am going to begin and I am going to conclude my comments with \nit as well. U.S. farmers and ranchers provide the highest quality, \nlowest cost food supply in the world. Our farmers and ranchers today \nprovide the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world.\n  Not only do they provide the highest quality, lowest cost food supply \nin the world, but in the history of the world. That is vitally \nimportant to every single American. So when we pass a farm policy that \nsupports our network of farmers and ranchers throughout this great \ncountry, we are doing something that makes a fundamental difference \nevery day for every American and for millions of people beyond our \nborders.\n  There are other aspects to the farm bill that are very important as \nwell. For example, we have a tremendous number of jobs in farming and \nranching across this country--every State in this country, throughout \nour heartland and beyond. There are not just direct jobs in farming and \nranching but there are indirect jobs, from food processing to retail, \nto transportation, to marketing--you name it. We could say it is an \nincredible jobs bill, which it is. There is no question about it. When \nwe provide a good, sound, solid farm program for our farmers and \nranchers, we are also very much passing a jobs bill as well.\n  We can also talk about it in terms of a favorable balance of trade. \nThe United States has a deficit in its trade balance, but agriculture \nhas a positive balance of trade. We export millions in food products \nall over the world to feed hungry people, and it generates a positive \nreturn for this country in a big way.\n  We can talk about it in terms of national security. Think about how \nimportant good farm policy is for national security. We produce not \nonly the food we need, but far more than the food we need for our \ncitizens, we provide food for many citizens in other countries as well. \nThink about the national security implications if we had to depend on \nother countries for our food supply--maybe even countries that don't \nnecessarily share our interests or values, which is currently the case \nwith energy. We certainly don't want to be in that situation when it \ncomes to feeding our people. So it is truly an issue of national \nsecurity. We want to be in the position to make sure we have farmers \nand ranchers who will supply not only the food we need in this country \nbut food that people consume in many countries throughout the world.\n  For all those reasons this is an incredibly important bill. It is not \njust incredibly important to farmers and ranchers, it is incredibly \nimportant for every single one of us--for all those reasons and more.\n  The second point I want to make is this farm bill is cost-effective. \nIt is not only cost-effective, but we provide real savings to help to \nreduce the deficit and the debt. It provides strong support to our \nfarmers and ranchers, but it does it the right way. It does it in a way \nwhere we provide savings that will go to reduce the deficit and debt. \nOur farmers and ranchers are stepping up and not only doing an amazing \njob for this country in terms of what they do in food supply and job \ncreation, but they are helping meet the challenge of our deficit and \ndebt as well.\n  The second chart is an example of what I am talking about in terms of \nthe farm program being cost-effective. I will use this and several \nother charts to go into the actual numbers to show that the farm \nprogram--particularly this bill we have crafted--is not only cost-\neffective, but it provides real savings as well. At the same time, it \nprovides enhanced support for our farmers and ranchers throughout the \ncountry.\n  Looking at the chart, if you think of the total Federal budget as \nthis cornfield, the portion that goes to the farm bill would be similar \nto this ear of corn out of the cornfield. If you think of the total \ncornfield as the Federal budget, the farm bill would be about one ear \nof corn. The portion of the farm bill that goes to farmers and ranchers \nto support what they do would be one kernel of corn out of the entire \ncornfield. To put those numbers into perspective--and these are \nanalyzed numbers--you are talking about Federal spending of about $3.7 \ntrillion, in that range. You are talking about a farm bill that, on an \nannualized basis, is about $100 billion. So it is $100 billion out of \n$3.7 trillion. Then if you talk about the portion that actually goes to \nsupport farmers and ranchers and support that network, you are talking \nabout less than $20 billion out of $3.7 trillion. That is why I use \nthis frame of reference.\n  If we go to the next chart, we will go into some of the numbers and \nhow that funding is broken out in the farm bill itself. This pie chart \nshows the CBO scoring. Of course with any legislation you need the CBO \nscoring that shows the actual cost. We try to do that in a consistent \nway across all of the legislation we pass. CBO uses a 10-year scoring \nperiod. On that basis, this entire pie, the farm program score, over a \n10-year period is $960 billion. Of that, almost $800 billion is \nnutrition programs. Almost 80 percent goes to nutrition. I mean by \nthat, primarily SNAP, nutritional assistance payments, or food stamps. \nSo nutrition programs comprise 80 percent of the total cost in the farm \nbill.\n  Only about 20 percent actually goes for farming and ranching, for \nfarm programs, and for conservation. So in the scoring, that is only \nabout $200 billion. We know the bill is not a 10-year bill, it is a 5-\nyear bill. So the actual cost is $480 billion, or half of the score. \nThat means approximately $400 billion goes for nutrition programs, food \nstamps, and so forth; and less than $100 billion goes for farm programs \nand conservation programs. So we are talking about an annual cost of \nthis farm program--a program that supports farmers and ranchers who \nfeed this country and much of the world--of about $20 billion--actually \nless.\n  Let's go to the next chart on how the program actually provides \nsavings, how farmers and ranchers are providing real savings for \ndeficit reduction in this country. This bill saves more than $23 \nbillion--$23.6 billion is the savings generated by this farm bill; $15 \nbillion comes from the farm programs themselves; $6 billion comes from \nconservation programs; only about $4 billion comes out of nutrition \nprograms. So 80 percent of the cost in the bill is nutrition programs, \nwhich is $400 billion over 5 years. Only $4 billion comes out of the \nnutrition programs; close to $20 billion comes out of the agriculture \nportion of the bill. Going back to my prior chart, if you go back to \nthe crop insurance provisions and commodity,\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nwhich comprise the farm support network, that is about $150 billion in \nthe CBO scoring. Remember, I said $15 billion comes out of that $150 \nbillion. My point is that 10-percent reduction. So farmers and ranchers \nare stepping up in the farm bill and saying, OK, we are going to help \nmeet the deficit and the debt challenge. They are, in essence, taking \n10 percent less.\n  Think about that, if throughout all aspects of the Federal budget \neverybody stepped up the way farmers and ranchers are in this \nlegislation and said, OK, here is a 10-percent reduction we are going \nto take to help get the deficit under control and the debt under \ncontrol. My point is, very clearly, in this legislation we have real \nsavings, and that savings is being provided by our farmers and \nranchers.\n  At the same time--this is my third point, and it is very important--\nthis farm bill provides the kinds of support our farmers and ranchers \nneed by providing the risk management tools our farmers need. This farm \nbill provides strong support for our farmers and ranchers, and it does \nit the right way. It does it right, with sound risk management tools. \nWhat are those risk management tools? I have them here on the chart. It \nenhances crop insurance. Second, a new Agriculture Risk Coverage--or \nARC--Program. It includes also reauthorization of the no-net-cost sugar \nprogram. It improves and extends the livestock disaster assistance \nprogram. These are the kinds of risk management tools our farmers and \nranchers have asked for. They are cost-effective and a market-based \napproach. They provide the sound, solid safety net our farmers and \nproducers need to continue to produce the food supply for this country.\n  I will go into more detail on the next chart on crop insurance. As I \ntravel around the State, and as myself and others who are members of \nthe Ag Committee travel the country, one thing our farmers and ranchers \nsay to us over and over again is that they want enhancements to crop \ninsurance. We worked on the safety net for our farmers, and as we \nworked on the tools for them, they said the heart of the farm bill \nneeds to be enhanced crop insurance. That is exactly what we have done \nwith this legislation. That is the heart of the bill.\n  Enhanced crop insurance involves a number of things. First, farmers \ncan buy individual crop insurance, and do buy it, at whatever level \nthey deem appropriate. They look at their farm operation and decide how \nmuch crop insurance they are going to buy to cover that farm operation. \nBut as they insure at higher levels, the cost to buy that insurance \ngets more and more expensive. One of the things we tried to do in terms \nof enhancing crop insurance is figure out how we can help insure at a \nhigher level at an affordable price. That is one of the new \ninnovations. It is called the supplemental coverage option, or SCO. It \nenables farmers to insure or cover their farming operation at a higher \nlevel, but still at an affordable price.\n  The way it works is, the farmer buys his normal, individual, crop \ninsurance that he would normally purchase. But then, in addition, on a \ncountywide basis, he can buy supplemental coverage, with the \nsupplemental coverage option, on top of his existing insurance. If he \ntypically insures up to, say, 60, 65, or maybe a 70-percent level, he \ncan buy additional insurance on top of his regular policy at a \nreasonable premium. His regular policy is an individual, farm-based \npolicy, and this is a county-based policy that provides additional \ncoverage at a reduced rate--again, management tools on a market-based \napproach to cover their farming operation.\n  The second innovation on the next chart is a program called \nAgriculture Risk Coverage, or ARC. Very often, farmers--obviously, one \nof the challenges they face is due to weather. When they face weather \nchallenges, oftentimes we can get in a wet cycle or a dry cycle. So the \nproblem they have with weather may not be limited to one year. You may \nhave a number of years where they face real weather challenges.\n  In addition, what may happen is that it may trigger losses in their \nfarming operation that are not severe enough to trigger their regular \ncrop insurance, but still cause them losses. You can have repetitive or \nshallow losses. Over time, those can make an incredible difference in \nterms of farmers being able to continue in farming and continue their \noperation. We add shallow loss coverage, or the agriculture risk \ncoverage, to help them protect against these repetitive losses, which \nthey often face due to weather conditions. That is the agriculture risk \ncoverage. It covers between 11 and 21 percent of historical revenue.\n  How do you calculate that percentage? That is a 5-year average--the \nlast 5-year average--based on price and yield, the revenue they \ngenerate on their farming operation. You take out the high year and the \nlow year, and you average the other three. The way it works is, when \nyou have a year where the farmer's crop insurance may not trigger, they \nstill have help when they have a loss, but a loss that may not trigger \non their crop insurance. In other cases, it works with their crop \ninsurance to make sure they are adequately covered so they can continue \ntheir farming operation. Again, an enhanced risk management tool, cost-\neffective, focused on a market-based approach to make sure our farmers \nand ranchers have the coverage they need to continue their operation.\n\n  One other point I want to make in wrapping up is that this bill also \ncontinues strong support for agricultural research. Agricultural \nresearch is making a tremendous difference for our farmers in terms of \nwhat they are doing to increase productivity. Obviously, we all know \ntechnology has done amazing things to help productivity. But at the \nsame time, agricultural research has made an incredible difference in \nnot only food production--productivity when it comes to food \nproduction--but energy production as well.\n  So that is it. That is how this legislation works. It provides strong \nsupport to our farmers and ranchers. It provides that support on a \ncost-effective basis. The bill emphasizes a market-based approach, \nfocused on crop insurance, which is exactly what producers have told us \nthey want. At the same time, this legislation provides real savings--\n$23.6 billion--to help reduce the Federal deficit and the debt. It is \nbipartisan, and it received strong committee support.\n  I know some of our southern friends are still looking for more help \nwith price protection, and we are working with them. It is likely the \nHouse Agriculture Committee will seek to do more in that area as well. \nBut this is legislation that we need to move forward. This is \nlegislation that supports our farmers and our ranchers the right way as \nthey continue to provide--and I am going to go back to my very first \nchart--support our farmers and ranchers as they provide the highest \nquality and the lowest cost food supply for every single American.\n  As I said, this is where I started my comments, and this is where I \nwill conclude. When we are talking about a farm bill, we are talking \nabout something that is important to every single American--every \nsingle American. We do it the right way here, and I ask all of my \nfellow Senators on both sides of the aisle--we worked together in a \ngreat bipartisan way in the committee--to work together in a great \nbipartisan way on the Senate floor and pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the House of Representatives will \nvote on the Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2012. I want to say a few \nwords about that bill, which repeals two of the more counterproductive \nof the many components of the President's health care law.\n  Specifically, it repeals the restrictions on the use of FSAs and HSAs \nin the purchase of over-the-counter medications, as well as the medical \ndevice tax.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House for advancing this \nlegislation. Repeal of the onerous OTC restrictions and the device tax \nare priorities of\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nmine as well. I have introduced legislation that specifically repeals \nthe medical device tax, and my bill--the Family and Retirement Health \nInvestment Act--includes the repeal of the limitations on the purchase \nof over-the-counter medication.\n  Others in the Senate, including my friend and colleague Senator \nHutchison, have also been working to repeal the OTC restrictions. My \nfriends from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, Senators Brown and Toomey, \nhave been strong advocates for repeal of the medical device tax. I \nappreciate working with them and all Members who are committed to the \nrepeal of the President's health care law.\n  I appreciate the hard work of Chairman Camp and Speaker Boehner in \nmoving the Health Care Cost Reduction Act through committee and onto \nthe floor. I also want to thank, in particular, my friend Congressman \nErik Paulsen of Minnesota for his hard work. We have partnered on both \nthe OTC repeal and the medical device repeal, and he has been tireless \nin fighting not only for his constituents but for all Americans who are \nburdened by these misguided policies.\n  Despite some weak protestations to the contrary from the White House, \nneither of these provisions serve any health policy purpose. They exist \nfor one reason: to bankroll the $2.6 trillion in new spending that is \nthe real soul of ObamaCare. There is no good that can come of \nObamaCare. The bad and ugly are plenty, however.\n  The restriction on the purchase of over-the-counter medications--what \nsome have called a medicine cabinet tax--inconveniences patients and \nbusy families, increases burdens on primary care providers, reduces \npatient choice, and may actually increase health care utilization and \nspending. So much for bending the cost curve down.\n  The medical device tax, in addition to harming patients, is a job \nkiller at a time when our country needs all the good jobs it can get. \nTogether, they are also clear violations of the President's pledge not \nto raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year.\n  With respect to the restrictions on the purchase of over-the-counter \nmedications, ObamaCare now requires the holders of health savings \naccounts and flexible spending arrangements to obtain a physician's \nprescription before using those accounts to purchase over-the-counter \nmedicine. In some respects, this policy, more than any \nother, represents the incredible arrogance and wrongheadedness of the \nPresident's signature domestic achievement.\n\n  When President Obama and his allies touted the virtues of this law, \nthey mentioned increased access and lower costs. Yet to pay for the \nlaw's coverage expansions, they included this medicine cabinet tax, \nwhich will do nothing but burden medical providers, undermine access to \nhealth care, and increase costs for patients and businesses.\n  It is worth noting that in yesterday's Statement of Administration \nPolicy announcing President Obama's opposition to the House bill, they \ndid not even describe this provision in detail, much less defend it. It \nseems clear to me the administration is embarrassed by this tax on \npatients, and they should be.\n  A study from the Consumer Health Products Association determined that \n10 percent of office visits are for minor ailments, and 40 million \nmedical appointments are avoided annually through the self-care enabled \nby over-the-counter drugs.\n  According to a study by Booz & Company, the availability of these \nover-the-counter medications saves $102 billion annually in clinical \nand drug costs. Yet ObamaCare deliberately restricts their \navailability.\n  With respect to the medical device tax, we all know how bad this tax \npolicy is. I am sure the President knows how bad this policy is as \nwell, but he and his allies continue to defend it. Beginning next year, \nObamaCare imposes a tax on the sales of medical device makers--not the \nprofits, the sales.\n  With this excise tax, even unprofitable firms will be responsible for \na 2.30-percent tax on sales of their devices. It is difficult to \noverstate the damage to patients and our economy this tax will wreak.\n  According to one analysis, this ObamaCare tax will kill between \n14,000 and 47,000 jobs. We wonder why we are having trouble with \nunemployment. According to another analysis by Benjamin Zycher, it will \nreduce research and development by $2 billion a year. The resulting \ncollapse in innovation will undermine care for not only the elderly but \nall patients. Zycher has determined that the effect of this tax will be \n1 million life-years lost annually--one million life-years lost \nannually.\n  Between 1980 and 2000, new diagnostic and treatment tools, such as \nimproved scanners, catheters and tools for minimally invasive surgery, \nhelped increase life expectancy by more than 3 years. Medical devices \nhelped to slash the death rate from heart disease by a stunning 50 \npercent and cut the death rate from stroke by 30 percent.\n  From 1980 to 2000 the medical device industry was responsible for a \n4-percent increase in U.S. life expectancy, a 16-percent decrease in \nmortality rates, and an astounding 25-percent decline in elderly \ndisability rates, according to a study by MEDTAP International.\n  Why on Earth would anyone vote for a targeted tax on an industry that \nprovides such enormous value and security to patients?\n  For those who vote against repealing this tax today and stand against \nits repeal in the Senate, it is worth recalling last week's jobs \nreport. In the month of May, our economy created only 69,000 new jobs. \nThat is, frankly, pathetic. It is barely keeping up with population \ngrowth, much less digging us out of our jobs deficit.\n  I think there is little doubt the mere threat of this tax on medical \ndevices is contributing to these paltry numbers. In other words, this \ntax is undercutting a key industry, creating deep uncertainty, and \nhindering job creation.\n  Since President Obama signed this tax into law, the dollar amount of \nventure capital invested has declined more than 70 percent. The $200 \nmillion raised last year is the lowest level of medical device startup \nactivity since 1996.\n  This industry is one of the engines of our economy. According to the \nLewin Group--a highly respected group--the medical technology industry \ncontributes nearly $382 billion in economic output to the U.S. economy \nevery year. In 2006, it shipped over $123 billion in goods, paid $21.5 \nbillion in salaries to 400,000 American workers, and was responsible \nfor a total of 2 million American jobs.\n  It pays its employees on average $84,156--that is 1.85 times the \nnational average--and more than 80 percent of medical device companies \nare small businesses employing 50 people or less. Yet this is the \nindustry President Obama decided to target? This is the industry every \nSenate Democrat voted to tax when Obamacare passed the Senate?\n  There are over 120 medical device companies in my home State of Utah \nalone. Let me tell you, they know what is going to happen if this tax \ngoes into effect, and it is not going to be pretty. I think the \nPresident must know this. He and his advisers must know what a disaster \nthe medicine cabinet tax and the medical device tax are as both fiscal \nand health policy. But yesterday they doubled down on it. Their \nStatement of Administration Policy threatened a veto of the House bill. \nIt is clear to everyone that the USS Obamacare is a sinking ship, but \nthe President seems committed to going down with it.\n  Obamacare needs to go. All of it. The law created a web of \nunconstitutional, misguided, unrealistic, and costly regulations, \ntaxes, fees, and penalties. That web must be pulled down in its \nentirety, whether by the Supreme Court, or by a Republican Congress and \nPresident Romney.\n  There are few policies more emblematic of that law's failures than \nthe medical device tax and restrictions on the purchase of over-the-\ncounter medications, and I commend my friends in the House for \nrepealing them today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coons pertaining to the introduction of S. 3275 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since we are talking about farm \nlegislation as well as nutrition legislation, I think I should be very \ntransparent when I talk about this and talk about my background and \nlifetime in farming. I don't want to say something about farm bills and \nthen have people who don't know where I am coming from find out later \nthat I am a farmer and might benefit from some of the farm programs. So \nin the vein of transparency and accountability, I will just say that \nsince 1960, when my father died, I have been involved in farming. Since \n1980, I have been involved with my son Robin renting my farmland, \nfarming with what we call in Iowa 50 50 farming. Others might call it \ncrop share. Basically, that means that he and I are partners, and I pay \nfor half the expenses, and I get half of the crop to market, and he \ngets the land rent-free. When you are crop-sharing or when you are 50 \n50, that means I am not an absentee landowner collecting cash rent, \nthat I have risks. With risks, you assume that maybe you might get a \ncrop or not get a crop, and if you don't get a crop, you don't get your \nrent as a landlord. It is the same for my son. He has risks as well. If \nhe doesn't get a crop, he won't have to pay rent, but he isn't going to \nhave anything to live on if he doesn't have a crop. So that is kind of \nthe situation I have been in since 1960 when I was farming on my own \nand then in partnership with my son.\n  In the last 7 or 8 years, we have had a grandson, Patrick Grassley, \nwho is a member of the State legislature, join our farming operation, \nand what I found out, with having a grandson in the farming operation, \nthey don't have a lot of work for a grandfather to do. So last year \nabout all I did was fall tillage with what we call in Iowa chisel \nplowing.\n  With that background, I want to go to my statement.\n  Growing up on my family farm outside of New Hartford, IA, where I \nstill live today, I grew to appreciate what it means to be a farmer. \nThe dictionary defines a farmer as ``a person who cultivates land or \ncrops or raises animals.'' But that definition doesn't come close to \nfully describing what a farmer is. Being a farmer means someone willing \nto help a cow deliver a calf in the middle of the night when it might \nbe 5 degrees outside. A farmer is someone who is willing to put all of \ntheir earthly possessions at risk just to put a bunch of seed in the \nground and hope the seed gets rain at just the right time. Farmers work \nhard cultivating their crops and get the satisfaction of seeing the \nresult of their hard work at the end of each crop season. They take \ngreat pride in knowing they are feeding this Nation. A farmer in Iowa \nproduces enough food to feed 160 other people. So obviously we export \nabout one-third of our agricultural production.\n  Farmers tend to be people who relish the independence that comes with \ntheir chosen profession. They are people with dirt under their \nfingernails, and they also work very long hours. Often they are \nunderappreciated for what they do to put food on America's dinner \ntable, and they receive an ever-shrinking share of the food dollar.\n  At this point, I would speak about a fellow Senator. I won't name the \nfellow Senator, but he is from an urban State.\n  Throughout our years of service here, I like to say to him: Do you \nknow that food grows on farms?\n  And he says: Oh, does it?\n  Well, the other night at the spouses' dinner we had, he came up to my \nwife and he said: I know food grows in supermarkets, but Chuck thinks \nit grows on farms.\n  So that is the sort of camaraderie we have around here on \nagriculture, and I am very glad to have it.\n  I always say that agriculture is probably a little easier in the \nSenate because I believe every Senator, even in Alaska, Hawaii, and New \nHampshire, represents agriculture to some degree--maybe not as much as \nin the Midwest, where I come from, or California or Texas, but every \nState has some agriculture, and there is an appreciation of it. In the \nother body, our House of Representatives, I don't know an exact figure, \nbut I would imagine that there are probably only 50 districts that \nreally are agriculture-oriented districts and the rest of them are very \nurban or suburban. So we have an understanding of agriculture and how \nimportant it is. When I talk about it, I don't mean to talk down to my \ncolleagues, but I do think I understand agriculture. It is not to say \nthat other Senators don't understand agriculture, but I think if you \nhave been involved in it for a lifetime the way three or four of us \nhere in the Senate have been, it means a little more.\n  Farmers have chosen a line of work that comes with risk. It is a risk \nthat is inherent in farming and often out of their control. The risk \ninherent in farming is why we have farm programs.\n  If I may digress a little bit here, from memory, just to show how \nthere are a lot of issues with agriculture that are beyond the control \nof farmers--I am not just talking about natural disasters such as hail \nor drought. In 1972 Nixon wanted to get reelected so bad that he froze \nthe price of beef. It was only for a short period of time, maybe 3 or 4 \nmonths, because they found out it was not working the way he wanted. He \ndidn't care about the farmers. Iowa was No. 1 in beef production up to \nthat time. After that, everybody got squeezed out of the beef business \nbecause of the freeze. We went from No. 1 down to No. 13. Now I think \nwe are about fifth or sixth in the production of beef.\n  Another example is when soybeans were being exported and they got up \nto $13 a bushel in 1973 or 1974--let's see. I am just trying to think. \nIt was either when Nixon or Ford was President. At the time, one of \nthem decided it was going to drive up the price of food in America, so \nthey forbid the export of soybean. Soybean prices fell from $13 down to \n$3.\n  Another time, Carter decided that it was wrong for Russia to invade \nAfghanistan. At that time, we were selling them wheat, until the \ndecision was made that we were not going to sell them any more wheat, \nso the price dropped.\n  I suppose I ought to think of things a lot more recent, but there are \na lot of international politics that affect farming. Right now it is \nwith Iran sanctions and oil. I am not sure to what extent that affects \nthe price of energy, but agriculture is a big user of energy.\n  So what I am trying to say with just a few examples--and I ought to \nhave more from memory--is that there are so many things that are beyond \nthe control of farmers that if you ever wonder why we have a farm \nsafety net, that is why.\n  Why do we have a farm safety net? For national security. As Napoleon \nsaid, an Army marches on its belly. We have to have food. Why do you \nthink Japan and Germany protect their farmers so much today? Because \nthey found in World War II that if they don't have food, they don't \nhave very good national security. Or how long can a nuclear submarine \nstay underwater? Forever. Except if it runs out of food, it has to come \nup. Or what about the old adage of being nine meals away from a \nrevolution? In other words, as a mother and dad, if you can't get food \nfor your kids for 3 days, and they are crying, you might take any \naction to make sure they get food.\n\n  So I think having a secure supply of food is very essential to the \nsocial cohesion of our society.\n  We don't worry about that in America, do we? We go to the supermarket \nand the shelves are full, but there are a lot of places in the world \nwhere they don't have that. There are a lot of places in the world \nwhere they pay more than 50 percent of disposable income for food, and \nin America it is about 9, 10, or 11 percent.\n  So there are plenty of reasons to make sure we have a sound \nagricultural system in America, and we ought to make sure we take it \nseriously, both from a national security standpoint and for our social \nbetterment.\n  If we want a stable food supply in this country, we need farmers who \nare able to produce it. When they are hit by floods, droughts, natural \ndisasters, wild market swings, or unfair international barriers to \ntheir products, farmers need the support to make it through because so \nmuch is beyond the control of farmers. Most farmers I know wish there \nwasn't the need for a government safety net, but they appreciate that \nsafety net when they do need it. For decade after decade, Congress has \nmaintained farm programs because the American people understand the \nnecessity of providing a safety net for those providing our food.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  That is not to say that each and every farm program ever created \nneeds to continue. In fact, there is a lot in this farm bill we have \nbefore us that brings reform, and some programs not reauthorized, that \nprove what I just said--that just because we have had some for 60 years \ndoesn't mean we have to have them for the next 5 years in this farm \nprogram. Just as there are shifts in the market, sometimes public \nsentiment toward certain farm programs also shifts.\n  Take direct payments, for instance. There was a time and place for \ndirect payments to help farmers through some lean years. But now times \nare OK in the agriculture industry, and the American people have \nrightly decided it is time for direct payments to end. With a $1.5 \ntrillion deficit every year, it is also a reality that those payments \ncan't continue from a budget point of view. So the Senate committee has \nresponded, and we have proposed eliminating the direct payment program, \nand many farmers agree direct payments should go away as well.\n  There are other reforms the American taxpayers want to see. There is \nno reason the Federal Government should be subsidizing big farmers to \nget even bigger. I might repeat myself as I go through my statement, \nbut I want to say that a farm safety net ought to protect the people \nwho don't have the ability to get beyond these things that are beyond \ntheir control--whether it is domestic politics or whether it is a \nnatural disaster or whether it is international politics or energy \npolicies or all of the things that can happen.\n  There are some farmers who might not get over that hump because it is \nbeyond their control--a problem that affects them financially. But \nthere are some farmers who have that capability, and I think \ntraditionally we have geared the farm program--not enough, from my \npoint of view--but we have geared the farm program toward a safety net \nfor small- and medium-sized farmers.\n  We have a situation where 10 percent of the farmers in recent years--\nthe biggest farmers--are getting 70 percent of the benefits of the farm \nprogram. There is nothing wrong with getting bigger. I want to make \nthat clear. In fact, in agriculture, with the equipment costs a farmer \nhas to get bigger, but the Federal taxpayers should not be subsidizing \nfarmers to get bigger. It isn't just a case of a principle not to do \nthat; it is the economic impact. When we do that--provide the \ngovernment subsidy to the big farmers--they go out and buy more land, \nwhich drives up the price of farmland or drives up the cash rent in a \nparticular area. Consequently, it makes it very difficult for young \npeople to get started farming.\n  We want to be able--we have to pass this on to the young farmers. \nMany farmers understand that in order for us to have a farm program \nthat is defensible and justifiable, it needs to be a program designed \nto help these small- and medium-sized farmers who actually need the \nassistance to get through rough patches out of their control.\n  So what I have been trying to do for years, and it was finally put in \nthis farm bill, is to put a hard cap on the amount of money one farming \noperation can get so, hopefully, we cut down that 10 percent of the \nlargest farmers that gets 70 percent of farm payments, so it is more \nproportional to the benefit of small- and medium-sized farmers. That is \nin this bill at $50,000 per individual and $100,000 per married couple \nfor the payments under the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program. It is in \nthis bill. I know to a lot of people listening that $50,000 and \n$100,000 is too much, and it is even too much for most Iowans. But \nthere are some sections of this country, such as the South and West, \nwhere we will find our fellow Senators--I don't know how open they are \ngoing to be about this, but behind the scenes they are raising Cain \nabout this $50,000 cap. I just about had this put in the present farm \nbill in 2008, except I had 57 votes, and we know how things work around \nhere. We have to have 60 votes to get something done if people want to \npush the point. So I didn't get 60 votes. Now it is in the farm bill. I \ndon't know who is negotiating around here on amendments, but there is \ngoing to be somebody trying to take this out of here--somebody from the \nSouth, I would imagine--trying to take this $50,000 cap out.\n  I expect to have the same considerations to this not being taken out \nby a 60-vote margin as I was kept from putting it in 5 years ago \nbecause if it had been put in 5 years ago, we would have saved $1.3 \nbillion over that period of time.\n  Taxpayers are tired of reading reports about how so many nonfarmers \nreceive farm payments. I have been working to get reforms on the farm \npayment eligibility for years, and just as the tide has turned on the \nstatus quo for direct payments, the tide has turned on program \neligibility. The bill contains crucial reforms to the ``actively \nengaged'' requirements. These reforms will ensure farm payments go to \nactual farmers. The American people are not going to stand idly by \nanymore and watch farm payments head out the door to people who don't \nfarm. In other words, if they aren't out there working the land--if \nthey are on Wall Street or something and have farmland in the Midwest--\nthey shouldn't be collecting these farm payments.\n  There have been some people complaining about the payment limit \nreforms I have talked about. They complain it will detrimentally change \nthe way some farm operations do things. Well, if they mean it will not \nallow nonfarmers to skirt around payment eligibilities and line their \npockets with taxpayers' money meant for actual farmers, then the answer \nis, yes; that is what those reforms will do.\n  Let me make it perfectly clear. The reforms contained in this bill \nwill not impact a farmer's ability to receive farm payments. \nFurthermore, the reforms will not affect the spouse rule. In other \nwords, if the husband and wife are together in the farming operation, \nand some Senator comes around and says the spouse who is working beside \nthe other spouse in this farming operation can't get the benefit of it, \nthey are wrong.\n\n  These reforms reflect what we hear from the grassroots, which is \nCongress needs to be a better steward of the taxpayers' dollars. That \nis true if we are talking about farm programs or any other Federal \nprogram.\n  Those who are against these reforms are asking the American people to \naccept the status quo and to continue to watch as farm payments go to \nmegafarms and nonfarmers. We cannot and will not accept the status quo. \nIn other words, 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 70 percent of \nthe benefits of the farm program ought to end.\n  The Agriculture Committee should be proud of the improvements we are \nmaking to payment limitations in this bill. With these reforms we bring \ndefensibility and integrity to this farm bill. In addition, it is \nprobably the only bill that is going to pass this year that is going to \ncut any programs, and it is going to do that by $23 billion. In fact, \nwithout these reforms in the farm program, I wouldn't be able to \nsupport this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to voice their support for these important \npayment limitation provisions and join with me in resisting any attempt \nto weaken these reforms, particularly from people in the Southern \nStates who say somehow we ought to still continue to allow these \nmegafarmers to get these millions of dollars of payments.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to discuss today several \namendments I have to the farm bill that is now before the Senate. What \nmight surprise many people to learn is that the overwhelming majority \nof funds in the farm bill are not spent on anything to do with farmers \nor even agriculture production. For instance, crop insurance amounts \nto--which is a big part of the new bill and is progress, I think--the \ncrop insurance provisions amount to just 8 percent of what we will be \nspending. Horticulture is less than 1 percent. But a full 80 percent of \nthe farm bill spending goes to the Federal food stamp program. Yet only \n17 percent of the small savings that are found in this proposal comes \nfrom food stamps. Out of the $23 billion in cuts, none of which\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\noccurs next year, out of almost $1 trillion in spending over 10 years. \nSo about $23 billion in cuts. Most of that is taken from the farm \nprovisions, but only 20 percent of it goes to that. At the same time, \nfood stamp spending is virtually untouched. I believe they propose $4 \nbillion in savings after 80 percent of the cost of this bill is in the \nfood stamp program. The other $17 billion comes out of the 20 percent--\nnot the food stamps.\n  Overall, the legislation will spend $82 billion on food stamps next \nyear--$82 billion, and an estimated $770 billion over the next 10 \nyears. To put these figures in perspective--and they are so large it is \ndifficult to comprehend--we will spend, next year, $40 billion on the \nFederal highway program, but $80 billion on the food stamp program.\n  Food stamp spending has more than quadrupled--four times. It has \nincreased fourfold since the year 2001. It has increased 100 percent \nsince President Obama took office, doubled in that amount of time. \nThere are a number of reasons for this arresting trend. While the poor \neconomy has undeniably increased the number of people who qualify for \nfood stamps, this alone does not explain the extraordinary growth in \nthe program.\n  For instance, between 2001 and 2006, food stamp spending doubled, but \nthe unemployment rate remained around 5 percent. So from 2001 to 2006, \nwe had a doubling of food stamps while unemployment is the same. When \nthe food stamp program was first expanded nationwide, about 1 in 50 \nAmericans received food stamp benefits. Today, nearly one in seven \nreceive food stamp benefits.\n  We need to think about that. This is a very significant event. We \nneed to ask ourselves, is this good policy? Is it good for America? Not \nonly is it a question of, do we have the money, the second thing is, is \nit going to the right people? Is the money being expended wisely? Is it \nhelping people become independent? Is it encouraging people to look for \nways to be productive and be responsible themselves for their families? \nOr does it create dependency, part of a series of government programs \nthat, in effect, are not beneficial to the people who actually benefit \nfrom them in the short term?\n  Three factors help explain this increase. First is that eligibility \nstandards have been significantly loosened over time with a dramatic \ndrop in eligibility standards in the last few years. Second, it has \nbeen the explicit policy goal of the Federal bureaucracy to increase \nthe number of people on food stamps. Bonus pay is even offered to \nStates that sign up more people. States administer this program.\n  And, third, the way the system is arranged with States administering \nthe program but the Federal Government providing all of the money, all \nof it, they do not have--States do not match food stamps. States have \nan incentive, do you not see, to see their food stamp budget grow, not \nshrink, because it is more Federal money coming into the State which \nthey pay no part of.\n  That means overlooking, I am afraid, I hate to say, dramatic amounts \nof fraud and abuse, because the enforcement and supervision is given \nover to the States. So I filed a modest package of food stamp reforms \nto the farm bill which will achieve several important goals: save \ntaxpayer dollars, which is a good thing; reduce the deficit; achieve \ngreater accountability in how the program is administered; confront \nwidespread waste; direct food stamps to those who truly need them; and \nhelp more Americans achieve financial independence.\n  I guess I am the only person in the Senate who has ever dealt with \nfraud in the food stamp program. Shortly after law school, when I was a \nyoung Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted fraud in the food stamp program. \nLater I came back as a U.S. attorney, and we saw drug dealers selling \nfood stamps, we saw various other manipulations of it. As attorney \ngeneral of Alabama for a period, I was involved in enforcing integrity \nin the program. So I know the benefits food stamps play to people in \ndesperate need. I know it is helpful. But I know, Americans know, they \nsee it every day, that there are abuses in this program. It is the \nfastest growing entitlement program bar none. We need to look at it. I \nunderstand there are some who oppose even saving $4 billion over 10 \nyears out of the food stamp program.\n  We are spending 80 a year. Four years ago, we were spending 40. We \ncannot do better than that?\n  Food stamps is the second largest Federal welfare program following \nMedicaid. If food stamp spending were returned next year to the 2007 \nfunding level, and you agreed to increase it for 10 years at the rate \nof inflation, that would produce an astonishing $340 billion in savings \nfor the U.S. Treasury. And we have to have some savings because we \ndon't have the money to continue spending at the rate we are.\n  Food stamps are 1 of 17 Federal nutritional support programs and 1 of \nnearly 80 Federal welfare programs. So there is no confusion, these \nfigures count only low-income support programs. They don't include \nMedicare, Social Security, or unemployment benefits.\n  Collectively, our Federal welfare programs constitute about $700 \nbillion in Federal spending and $200 billion in State contributions to \nthe same programs. That is about $900 billion on the Federal-State \ncombined--most of it Federal--and $900 billion is about one-fourth of \nthe entire Federal budget.\n  An individual on food stamps may receive as much as $25,000 in \nvarious forms of financial assistance for their household from the \nFederal Government--as much as $25,000--in addition to whatever salary \nthey may earn in part- or full-time work, or any support they may \nreceive from their families or communities. In other words, this is not \nnormally the only source of income for the person.\n  Changes in eligibility have also eliminated the asset test for food \nstamp benefits, which brings me to the first of four amendments I have \nfiled.\n  No. 1, let's restore the asset test for food stamps. This change has \nbeen quite significant. Through a system known as categorical \neligibility, States can provide benefits to those whose assets exceed \nthe statutory asset limit, as long as they receive some other Federal \nbenefit. Why is that? I don't know; it makes no sense to me. If you \nqualify for another program, you automatically get food stamps. \nCategorically, you are eligible for them. One State went so far as to \ndetermine that individuals were food-stamp eligible solely because they \nreceived a brochure for another benefit program in the mail. Well, that \nmeant there is more money from the Federal Government coming into their \nState, more benefits. I guess they see it as an economic benefit. It \ndidn't cost them any money; the money came from Washington.\n  According to the CBO, the simple process of going back and \nrestricting the categorical eligibility problem that is now springing \nup would produce $12 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 \nyears and should not eliminate a single person who qualifies for food \nstamps under the statutory restrictions for the program. All it would \nmean is that if you qualify for food stamps and fill out the proper \nform, you get it, like everybody else has to do.\n  Second, there is the heating subsidy loophole. Fifteen States are \nusing a loophole in order to get more food stamp dollars from the \nFederal Government. They do this by mailing a very small check--get \nthis--often less than a dollar a month--under the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Anyone who receives that check, \nwhich may be as little as a few dollars a year, becomes eligible to \nclaim a lower income on the basis of home energy expenses--even if they \ndon't pay those expenses.\n  This reform will require households that receive food stamps to \nprovide proof of payment for their heating or cooling in order to \nqualify for the income deduction. If the government is paying for your \nheating, you should not say I need food stamps because I have a big \nheating bill. But this is a clever maneuver designed by States--\nfrankly, deliberately--to extract more money from Washington--free \nmoney for their States, and it is not good policy for America. It is \nnot right that some States get more under the food stamps program by \nusing this technique than others who don't use this abusive practice. \nClosing this loophole will produce $14 billion in savings over the next \n10 years. That is a lot of money.\n  No. 3, let's end the bonus payments going to States for increasing \nthe number of people who sign up. We ought to\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nbe giving bonuses to people who identify people who are abusing the \nproblem and bringing those down, if anything.\n  States currently receive bonus payments for enrolling individuals in \nthe food stamp program. Those bonus payments highlight the perverse \nincentive States have to expand food stamp registration rather than to \nreduce fraud and help more people achieve financial independence. We \nneed to be focusing on helping people to get work and to be more \nproductive and to bring in more money for their families than food \nstamps would bring in. That is what the focus of American vitality and \ngrowth should be.\n  No. 4, let's implement the SAVE Program for food stamp usage. This \namendment would simply require the government to use a very simple SAVE \nProgram, similar to the E-Verify Program, to ensure that adults \nreceiving benefits are in fact lawfully in the country. This is a \ncommonsense thing to do at a time when we have to borrow 40 cents out \nof every dollar we spend in this government. We spend $3,700 billion \nand we take in $2,400 billion. We borrow the rest every year. We cannot \nafford to be providing incentives, benefits, bonuses, and payments to \nreward people who have entered the country illegally. We just don't \nhave the money.\n  Ultimately, beyond first steps, the best way to achieve integrity in \nthe food stamp program is to block-grant it to the States. Send so much \nfor the program, a fair percentage to each State, and let them \ndistribute it. This will provide States with a strong incentive to make \nsure each dollar is being properly spent. They don't have that today. \nIt does no damage to a State if somebody is getting the money \nimproperly, or getting more than they are entitled to. If a State is \nadministering the program and some people are getting too much and \nothers are not getting enough, then the State has an incentive to make \nsure the abuses stop and the aid goes to the people who need it. That \nis the kind of program we need in America--one that works and has \nincentives built in to make the program have integrity.\n  The House budget adopts this reform. They like to complain about the \nHouse and say the House doesn't know what they are doing. This is a \ncommonsense reform. I am proud of what the House did. They did exactly \nthe right thing. Senate Democrats, of course, have not even written a \nbudget in 3 years. It has become clear that if we had gone through a \nfinancial analysis, a budget debate in this Congress, we could save a \nlot of money by ending the abuses in the Food Stamp Program, and it \nwould help us do other things the government needs to do. It would also \nbecome clear that we will run out of money to pay for this program if \nwe don't make changes soon. We are in a financial situation that is so \ngrave that every expert has told us we are on an unsustainable path and \nwe have to get off of it. If we don't, we can have another financial \ncatastrophe, like in 2007, and like they are having in Europe today. \nThat is very possible. So we have to reduce our deficit and our abusive \nspending.\n  Reforming the way we deliver welfare is the compassionate course. It \nis not mean-spirited to say that people who are not entitled to the \nbenefits don't need the benefits and should not get them. There is \nnothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with having incentives \nin your program, not to see how many people you can get on food stamps \nbut to see how many we can get to work and be productive and take care \nof themselves.\n  The result of welfare reform in 1996, if you remember that--and many \nof you do--was less poverty, more growth, less teen pregnancy, more \nwork, and more people successfully caring for themselves. We have \nslipped back, in my opinion. We moved back from some of the progress we \nmade from the 1996 provision.\n\n  Unfortunately, since 1996, Members in both parties have failed to \nprotect these gains. The welfare budget has swelled dramatically. \nOversight has diminished. Standards have slipped. We now find ourselves \nin need of welfare reform for the 21st century. We do. That is the \nnature of any government, where once programs are established, they go \nbeyond rationality and need to be reformed periodically.\n  It is time to re-engage the national discussion over how the receipt \nof welfare benefits can become damaging, not merely to the Treasury but \nalso to the recipient.\n  Left unattended, the safety net can become a restraint, permanently \nremoving people from the workforce. And Federal programs, unmonitored, \ncan begin to replace family, church, and community as a source of aid \nand support.\n  We need to reestablish the moral principle that Federal welfare \nshould be seen as temporary assistance, not permanent support. The goal \nshould be to help people become independent and self-sufficient.\n  Such reforms, made sincerely and with concern for those in need, will \nimprove America's social, fiscal, and economic health. Empowering the \nindividual is more than sound policy; it remains the animating moral \nidea behind the American experience, our national exceptionalism. We \nbelieve in individual responsibility. We believe in helping people in \nneed, but we don't believe in creating circumstances where decent, \nhard-working people, who work extra and save their money, who give up \nvacations and going out to eat so they can take care of their family, \nare also required to support people who are irresponsible. That is not \na healthy situation for us to be in.\n  We need to strike the right balance. We can help those people in need \nand create a government and a social assistance program in America that \nbenefits the people we seek to benefit and benefits the State \ntreasuries at the same time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I come to the floor fairly often to \nshare letters I get from people in Ohio and especially when it is an \nissue that is on the tips of so many young people's tongues and on the \nminds of so many in our State.\n  I spent much of the last month visiting with students on college \ncampuses at Wright State University in Dayton, at Hiram College in \nPortage County in northeast Ohio, at the Cuyahoga County Community \nCollege in Cleveland, at the University of Cincinnati, and Ohio State \nUniversity. Just this last Monday, I was at Owens Community College in \nToledo. I hear over and over and over about the debt that far too many \nof our young people bear when they get out of school.\n  Today is the last session day for our pages from the winter term, and \nI hope the burden of debt on them--they are still several years away \nfrom absorbing the debt from college and going on to the workplace. But \nI worry for them, as I worry for so many of my constituents from \nCleveland to Cincinnati and Ashtabula to Middletown and Gallipolis to \nWauseon because the average Ohio student who is graduating from a 4-\nyear school and who has borrowed money owes $27,000. This is a small \nstep, but it is one more piling on of debt. If we are not able to \nfreeze interest rates on Stafford loans--which is what my legislation \nwill do, with Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Harkin of Iowa--to \nfreeze interest rates for at least another year, these students will be \nfaced with another $1,000, in addition to what they are already facing.\n  It has become a moral issue. If we turn things over to these young \npeople when they come out of school and they face this kind of debt, it \nmeans they are less likely to buy a house, it means they are less \nlikely to start a business, and it means they are less likely to start \na family. Do we want to do that to this generation of smart, young, \nenthusiastic, talented people, instead of giving them a better launch \nfor their lives in their twenties and thirties? That is why it is \nessential we do this.\n  Two years before the Presiding Officer came to the Senate, in 2007, \nwe\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\npassed this freeze; President Bush signed legislation that Senator \nKennedy and I and others in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee worked on to freeze interest rates for Stafford subsidized \nloans at 3.4 percent. There is a 5-year freeze. If we don't act by July \n1, 2012, 5 years after we passed it, that will mean these loans are \ngoing to double.\n  I wish to share a couple letters I have gotten from people in Ohio. \nThis doesn't just affect the students; there are some 380,000 college \nstudents in my State whom it affects. But it doesn't just affect these \nstudents; it affects their families. Their parents, sometimes their \ngrandparents, send us letters about how serious this is for them. I \nwill read two letters.\n  Jeff from Lorain--which happens to be my home county:\n\n       I've been a lifelong resident of Lorain, OH. My daughter \n     graduated top of her class from Southview in 2008. She just \n     graduated from Hiram College with a bachelor in Mathematics \n     and minor in Political Science Cum Laude. She maxed out her \n     Stafford loans each year, and these help her to attend \n     college. I've worked in factories all my life, the last 20 \n     years at Avon Lake Ford so we are able to help some but the \n     major work was done by our daughter with her focus and hard \n     work. She is moving on to grad school but at some point she \n     will have to start repaying these loans. Do we want to burden \n     these young bright minds with loan payments that are so large \n     they will weigh them down financially for a large portion of \n     their young adult lives? Were these loans designed to help \n     students who don't come from families with large disposable \n     incomes? Or are they to be used as a way to make money off \n     our young people trying to reach their potential?\n\n  One of the good things President Obama did about this was he helped \npeople get into the Federal Direct Loan Program so they would no longer \nbe borrowing from banks at much higher interest rates. College is too \nexpensive. The States don't put enough money into colleges so that the \ncolleges don't charge such high tuitions. Tuitions have gone up like \nthis over the years. But at least we were able to make a big difference \non interest. This is our chance to do it again, and we shouldn't let \nJeff and his daughter down and others.\n  The other letter I will read is from Marcelline from Wilberforce.\n\n       I am 60 years old. I went back to school to get a job that \n     would not continue to destroy my physical health. My previous \n     job for companies like BP and Wal-Mart were devastatingly \n     hard on me all with little or no medical help. I also \n     returned in hopes of obtaining employment that will position \n     me to be gainfully employed for the next 15 to 20 years. I am \n     supporting my two grandchildren both are aspergers and my son \n     while he tries to gain a degree of his own. I see no \n     possibility of retiring before I die. I also see no \n     possibility of paying off my education before I die. When I \n     started my education I could justify the cost, but I have \n     seen it going up yearly to the point I see no way of paying \n     for it now, especially if interest rates continue to climb. I \n     cannot conceive how the young people will be able to repay \n     their debts. I am very concerned for them. The burden this \n     will place on them as they go forward is heartbreaking.\n\n  This is the story the Presiding Officer hears in Anchorage, in \nFairbanks, in Nome. I hear it in Toledo. I hear it in Lima. I hear it \nin Mansfield. I hear it in Sandusky. It is incumbent upon us--it is a \nmoral question--not to load more debt on these young people so they can \ndevelop their talents in a way that not only will help them \nindividually, not only will help their families but will help our \nsociety prosper.\n  We know what the GI bill did in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s. It not \nonly helped millions of service men and women and their families, it \nalso lifted the prosperity of the United States of America. We owe this \ngeneration no less than that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

On this assignment, Investigator Lewis helped the \nTask Force with the difficult and important work of locating and \narresting fugitives throughout eastern North Carolina.\n  Investigator Lewis was dedicated to protecting the people of North \nCarolina, and today we remember him as he gave his life in service to \nour State.

I know that \nInvestigator Lewis will be forever missed, and his service and \nsacrifice will not be forgotten.\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3836-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING JOHN D. WRAY\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a former \nTuskegee University professor whose efforts to support this country \nduring the First World War, with the help of the hard-working young \npeople he recruited for agricultural clubs, have gone largely \nunacknowledged until recently.\n  After the United States entered World War I in April of 1917, \nProfessor John D. Wray left his position at Tuskegee University and \nrelocated to North Carolina to aid in the war effort. As a professor \nspecializing in agricultural science, Wray utilized his unique skills \nto help grow food for servicemembers fighting abroad. He partnered with \nBlack county agents to organize and encourage African-American farmers' \nchildren to join agricultural clubs, which became known as the Saturday \nService League. Wray even created a newspaper, the Rural Messenger, \nwhich was advertised as ``the only Negro farm journal in the world.''\n  In the first issue, Wray wrote that the children ``were told why they \nshould engage in this work as a necessary defense for their country; \nthat they could greatly assist by growing food to feed the boys who had \ngone to the trenches.'' In just 1 year's time, Wray had increased \nparticipation in North Carolina agricultural clubs tenfold, growing \nenrollment from 1,400 to more than 14,000. The Saturday Service League \nproduced more than 17,000 chickens, 30,000 eggs, 23,000 pounds of pork, \n700 bushels of wheat, 500 bushels of peas, 1,800 bushels of peanuts, 32 \nbales of cotton, 45,000 bushels of corn, and 700 bushels of potatoes in \na single year.\n  Even after the war ended in 1919, many of the youth were inspired by \nWray's patriotism and continued to work in the clubs to help feed the \nhungry and displaced peoples of Europe. By World War II, the clubs were \nnicknamed the ``Victory Volunteers.''\n  Born in 1889, Wray grew up on a tobacco farm near Durham and moved to \nGreensboro, NC, to attend the Agricultural and Technical College, where \nhe received his degree in agricultural science. There he met his wife \nand developed a passion for community organizing. Utilizing the \nagricultural skills he learned at the college, Wray taught the youth he \norganized modern farming techniques that increased yields 10 times \nover, actively improving the utility of each farmer he encountered. In \n1915, the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station offered him a \njob with a salary of $1,200 per year, making him the first African-\nAmerican agent for the North Carolina Extension Service. He also became \nan advocate for young Black men who were mistreated while serving their \ncountry in military service.\n  While many wartime stories focused on the front lines of combat, it \nis equally important to recognize Americans who worked to support them. \nProfessor John D. Wray knew exactly what he could do to maximize his \nsupport for the United States in one of our greatest times of need. I \nlearned of Professor Wray through his granddaughter, Kathryn Green, who \nnow resides in Denver, CO. She and her family take great pride in his \ncontributions to our Nation's war effort during World War I. I join \nthem and all Americans today in offering our gratitude and thanks to \nProfessor Wray's outstanding commitment to country, community, and the \nagricultural sciences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3836-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK LANGE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Chuck Lange, \nwho recently retired as the executive director of the Arkansas \nSheriff's Association after more than two decades of service at the ASA \nand a lifetime of dedication to safety and law enforcement.\n  As executive director of ASA, Chuck worked for the sheriffs of \nArkansas but he shared his expertise in law enforcement with many more \npeople. Chuck's passion for law enforcement and the lessons he learned \nat the University of Arkansas, the Southwest Texas State's Crime \nPrevention Institution, and the FBI National Academy benefitted \nArkansans during his 43 years in law enforcement and security-related \nservices.\n  Chuck's professional achievements are far-reaching and his \naccomplishments continue far beyond the office. He passed along his \ndecades of law enforcement knowledge to others. As a volunteer, Chuck \nconducts training sessions for rape victim advocates, earning him \naccolades from Rape Crisis, Inc. Having also taught women's self-\ndefense classes, it is evident that Chuck has a true commitment to \nmaking sure Arkansans understand how to protect themselves and stay \nsafe.\n  Chuck shares his strong commitment to law enforcement as a member of \nseveral boards and task forces including the Arkansas Law Enforcement \nMemorial Board; executive board at the Criminal Justice Institute; \nArkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence Board; Governor's \nStrategic Prevention Framework Advisory Board and Governor's Task Force \non After School Programs.\n  I congratulate Chuck Lange for his outstanding achievements and \nsuccess in law enforcement and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring him on his retirement. I wish him continued success in his \nfuture endeavors. We are all grateful for his years of service and \nleadership to Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3836-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING KATIE BECKETT\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe courage of Katie Beckett, whose recent passing bids us pause to \nremember the challenges faced by families with children with long-term \ncare needs, and the support we can provide to them.\n  Katie and her family will forever be known as heroes who fought for \nfair Medicaid benefits for every child. Before their advocacy work, \nMedicaid did not cover at-home treatment for children with disabilities \nor special health care needs. As a child suffering from viral \nencephalitis, Katie was forced to live in a hospital in order to \nreceive treatment under Medicaid. Her mother went to work lobbying on \nbehalf of Katie and other children in the same situation. As a result \nof her efforts, President Reagan passed a waiver that would allow \nchildren on Medicaid the option to receive medical care in their homes.\n  To this day, the waiver--which is referred to as the ``Katie Beckett \nWaiver''--enhances the quality of life of thousands of children across \nthe Nation, including many in my home State of Rhode Island.\n  Caroline Friedman of Portsmouth, RI weighed 2 pounds, 15 ounces when \nshe was born. In order to survive, Caroline must receive cardiac \nmedicine through a central line in her heart. Because of the Katie \nBeckett Waiver, Caroline receives her life-sustaining treatment outside \nof the hospital. She is now 9 years old, and is living a full life \nattending school, joining Girl Scouts, and even taking karate classes.\n  Because of the Katie Beckett Waiver, Jacob Vandal of Little Compton, \nRI, who suffers from a rare genetic disorder, was able to receive home-\nbased therapy services. Receiving this treatment at home made a huge \ndifference to his developmental progress. Now, Jacob is a well-adjusted \n27 year old who works in a supported employment program--something his \nparents say would not have been possible without the at-home care \nafforded to him by the Katie Beckett Waiver.\n  Katie Beckett and her family paved the way for Caroline, Jacob, and \nso many others like them to receive their treatment at home with their \nfamily, where they most wanted to be. I know these individuals and \ntheir families will be forever grateful for the difference the Beckett \nfamily has made to their lives. On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I \nextend my heartfelt condolences to the Beckett family for their \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3836-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3836-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3836-S3837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3837-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 292.

A bill to provide all Medicare beneficiaries with the right \nto guaranteed issue of a Medicare supplemental policy; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, approximately one in five Medicare \nbeneficiaries--or 9 million people--purchase a Medigap supplemental \ninsurance policy to protect against high out-of-pocket costs and to \nmake health care costs more predictable. Current law includes a \n`guaranteed issue right' to Medigap for beneficiaries age 65 or older, \nwhich means they cannot be denied Medigap coverage or charged a higher \nMedigap premium because of their medical condition.\n  Unfortunately, current law discriminates against Medicare \nbeneficiaries with disabilities who are under age 65, as well as \nbeneficiaries with kidney failure, End Stage Renal Disease or ``ESRD'' \nby denying them the same right that seniors have to guaranteed issuance \nof Medigap policies. This exposes individuals with disabilities and \nkidney failure to substantial out-of-pocket costs and poses a \nsignificant barrier to health care services. In the absence of equal \nopportunity and access to Medigap policies at the Federal level, 29 \nStates have enacted guaranteed issue rights to disabled and ESRD \nbeneficiaries.\n  Individuals with kidney failure are subject to an additional \ndiscriminatory provision in federal law that prohibits Medicare ESRD \nbeneficiaries from joining Medicare Advantage plans. They are the only \ngroup of Medicare beneficiaries currently denied the same Medicare \nchoices as other Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Today I am introducing the Equal Access to Medicare Options Act, a \nbill that improves coverage options to Medicare beneficiaries. My \nlegislation would eliminate discriminatory treatment in the \nsupplemental insurance market, bring more financial stability to \nMedicare beneficiaries with disabilities and ESRD with high out-of-\npocket health care costs, and reduce reliance on Medicaid as the payer \nof last resort. Specifically, it would extend guaranteed issue of \nMedigap policies to all Medicare beneficiaries, including beneficiaries \nwith disabilities and ESRD. It would ensure equal access to \nsupplemental insurance for all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of \nage, disability or ESRD status.\n  Additionally, my legislation recognizes that Medicare beneficiaries \nneed flexibility to adjust their coverage as changes to their plans are \nmade. It would give guaranteed issue rights to Medicare Advantage \nenrollees if they decide to switch to traditional Medicare during an \nenrollment period. Today, if a Medicare Advantage enrollee learns of \npremium increases or benefit reduction in their plan, they have the \noption of returning to traditional Medicare but they have no assurance \nthey can buy Medigap coverage if they do so.\n  The Equal Access to Medicare Options Act would provide guaranteed\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\nissue to dual-eligibles who lose their Medicaid coverage and find \nthemselves in traditional Medicare without the cost protections of \nMedicaid and without supplemental coverage options. Finally, this \nlegislation would--for the first time--give beneficiaries with end-\nstage renal disease the option of enrolling in Medicare Advantage \nplans.\n  I would like to thank the nearly 50 organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Equal Access to Medicare Options Act \nand who have endorsed it today, including the California Health \nAdvocates, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Dialysis Patient Citizens, \nFresenius Medical Care, Medicare Rights Center, and the National Kidney \nFoundation.\n  The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination based on health \nstatus in the private health insurance market, beginning in 2014. It is \ninconsistent and unconscionable for federal law to allow insurers to \ndiscriminate based on health status in the Medigap market. All \nindividuals, regardless of their health status, deserve the same access \nto comprehensive and affordable coverage options.\n  The reforms included in this legislation would finally end \ndiscriminatory Medicare policies in Federal law and would ensure that \nall Medicare beneficiaries regardless of their disability or age have \nequal opportunity and access to affordable Medicare options. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to achieve these \ngoals in the context of health care reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Moran, Mr. Tester, Mr. Franken, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 3275. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe publicly traded partnership ownership structure to energy power \ngeneration projects and transportation fuels, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, when it comes to America's energy policy, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have made it clear they support an all-\nof-the-above energy strategy.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, serving on the Energy Committee along \nwith me, there is broad agreement on the need for a comprehensive \napproach that will develop secure, homegrown, efficient energy sources \nfor our next generation.\n  I believe an across-the-board policy that accepts the likely reality \nof our current dependence on our fossil-based fuels going forward, as \nwell as the vital need to develop and deploy new, promising, clean \nenergy fuels of the future, is essential. Such a policy will provide \ncertainty to our markets, opportunities to our families and companies \nand communities, and ensure that we are not--as some would say--picking \nwinners and losers in the energy space.\n  Yet there is today an obstacle standing in the way of a truly \ncomprehensive strategy that at least both parties say they want. It is \na provision in our Federal Tax Code that has its metaphoric thumb on \nthe scale, tipping the balance in favor of traditional fossil fuels. \nThat is why I am so glad I have been able to work with my colleague and \nfriend Senator Moran of Kansas to today introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that will level the playing field and bring parity to one \npiece of Federal tax policy relating to energy.\n  Investors in oil, natural gas, coal, and pipelines have for nearly 30 \nyears been able to form publicly traded entities called master limited \npartnerships, or MLPs. These partnerships include a passthrough tax \nstructure that avoids double taxation and leaves more cash available to \ndistribute to investors. They have for investors the liquidity and the \nreturn that is commonly associated with equity and the tax advantage \nthat is associated with partnerships, and they have been able to \naggregate and deploy a significant amount of private capital in the \ntraditional fossil fuel marketplace, roughly $350 billion today across \n100 MLPs. They have access to private capital at a lower cost, \nsomething that capital-intensive alternative energy projects in the \nUnited States badly need now more than ever.\n  As a result, MLPs should be a great source for raising private \ncapital for clean energy projects as well as they have been for fossil \nfuel projects. The only problem is, under current law, only fossil \nfuel-based energy projects can attract this type of private energy \ninvestment. That is right--we are currently in our tax policies working \nagainst our broadly stated commitment as a country to an all-of-the-\nabove energy policy with a statute that explicitly excludes clean \nenergy projects from forming these MLPs. This inequity is starving a \ngrowing portion of America's domestic energy sector of the very capital \nit needs to build and grow and compete. So Senator Moran and I, along \nwith other colleagues, decided to fix it. We came together and said it \nwas time to level the playing field.\n  Sometimes when I have the opportunity, I have gone for a run here in \nWashington or, even better, in my home State in Delaware. Something any \nrunner can tell you is that going up and down hills is what saps your \nstrength. When a surface is flat, you can go farther, you can go \nfaster, and it is the same with our Federal Tax Code. When it comes to \nevening things out, we have two choices. We can either lower everything \nto a common level by eliminating MLPs--by saying this tax advantage \nshouldn't be given to its traditional beneficiaries in gas and oil and \ncoal, or we can raise the level of opportunity and attract greater \ninvestment by broadening the fields that can take advantage of MLPs to \ninclude wind and solar, biomass, geothermal, cellulosic, biodiesel.\n  In my view, the better strategy, the better approach is the \nbipartisan one that takes our colleagues at their word and says we \nintend to stop picking winners and losers and, instead, embrace an all-\nof-the-above energy strategy. Senator Moran and I have chosen this \noption and believe that rather than eliminating MLPs, bringing \neverything together and making renewables on the same level playing \nfield with fossil fuels has a better promise for the future of the \nAmerican energy economy.\n  This is a relatively straightforward proposal. Our bill, the Master \nLimited Partnerships Parity Act, will bring new fairness to the Tax \nCode in this specific area. It recognizes revenue from projects that \nsell electricity or fuels produced from clean energy sources as \nqualifying MLPs.\n  This change will encourage investment in domestic energy resources, \nand could bring substantial new private capital off the sidelines to \nfinance renewable projects ranging from wind and solar to geothermal \nand cellulosic ethanol, just at a time when we so badly need it.\n  Harnessing the power of the private market is essential if \nalternative energy projects are to grow and create jobs all across \nAmerica. Two experts in energy finance, Felix Mormann and Dan Reicher \nfrom Stanford's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, \nwrote an op-ed this past week in the New York Times endorsing this \nlegislation.\n  They said:\n\n       If renewable energy is going to become fully competitive \n     and a significant source of energy in the United States, then \n     further technological innovation must be accompanied by \n     financial innovation so that clean energy sources gain access \n     to the same low-cost capital that traditional energy sources \n     like coal and oil and natural gas enjoy.\n\n  In the search for common ground on energy policy, this kind of simple \nfairness is the sort of thing I hope we can all agree on. That is why \nthe MLP Parity Act carries the strong support of a wide range of \nbusiness groups, financial experts, and energy organizations.\n  David Crane is the CEO of Fortune 300 company NRG Energy. NRG has \ngenerating assets across a wide range of traditional fuel sources and \nclean and alternative energy sources. Mr. Crane said:\n\n       The MLP Parity Act is a phenomenal idea. It's a fairly \n     arcane part of the tax law, but it's worked well and has been \n     extremely beneficial to the private investment in the oil and \n     gas space. The fact that it doesn't currently apply to \n     renewables is just a silly inequity in our current law.\n\n  We are also grateful for the support of national organizations such \nas the American Wind Energy Association, the Solar Energy Industries \nAssociation, the American Council on Renewable Energy, and many others, \nand thank them for their hard work in promoting this commonsense energy \nfuture for our country.\n  I also wish to specifically thank Dr. Chris Avery and Franz \nWuerfmanns-\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\ndobler who worked in my office so well in preparing this and moving \nthis forward as public policy. And I wish to thank Josh Freed of Third \nWay for bringing this to our attention and producing one of the first \npolicy papers on how master limited partnerships can be a great \nfinancing vehicle for clean energy.\n\n  I have no doubt there is significant growing opportunity worldwide in \nalternative fuels. There is a clean energy future coming. The only \nquestion is whether American workers, American communities, and \nAmerican companies will benefit from this, or will simply be bystanders \nand watch our competitors pass us by. I think if we are going to lead, \nwe have to work together. The private sector can and will provide the \nfinancing and the researchers to develop critical innovations and \ndeploy them, but the Federal Government--the Congress in particular--\nmust set a realistic and positive policy pathway to sustain these \ninnovations and let the market work to its fullest potential. The \nMaster Limited Partnerships Parity Act moves us toward that goal. By \nleveling the playing field for fair competition, this market-driven \nsolution could provide vital and needed support for the kind of \ncomprehensive energy strategy we need to power our country for \ngenerations to come.\n  Some of us who will support this bill also support things such as the \nITC, the PTC, and other clean energy financing vehicles. Others may \nnot. On the specific question of master limited partnerships, the bill \nwe introduced today simply allows us to come together in a bipartisan \nway to open it up to all energy sources, and to build a sustainable \nenergy financing future on this planet.\n  Once again, I want to thank my cosponsor, Senator Moran. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues, on the Energy Committee \nand throughout the Senate and the House, to move forward this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to terminate the Federal authorization of the \nNational Veterans Business Development Corporation; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncease federal involvement in the National Veterans Business Development \nCorporation.\n  This bipartisan bill would cease, once and for all, Federal \ninvolvement in the National Veterans Business Development Corporation, \nalso known as The Veterans Corporation or simply TVC. Let me begin by \nthanking the bill's cosponsors, former Small Business Committee Chair \nKerry and Senator Coburn. Senator Coburn, as most in this body will \nrecognize, is a true leader in efforts to streamline the Federal \nGovernment. Recently he spoke with us about ideas for Federal entities \nor programs that could be eliminated and we readily provided TVC as an \nexample of an entity that we had already identified that the Federal \nGovernment should sever its ties with.\n  I want to say at the outset that an amendment, with identical text as \nour legislation, passed the Senate by a vote of 99 0 in May of 2011, \nbut the bill it was attached to did not pass. We are introducing this \nrepeal as a standalone bill because TVC has been ineffective and \ncontroversial since its inception as part of the Veterans \nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act, P.L. 106 50 in \n1999. In December of 2008, former Small Business Committee Chairman \nKerry and I investigated TVC, and issued a report detailing the \norganization's blatant mismanagement and wasting of taxpayers' dollars.\n  The report found, among other things, that TVC failed to support \nVeteran Business Resource Centers; had wasteful programs; lacked \noutcomes-based measurements; provided its employees with unacceptably \nhigh executive compensation; engaged in dubious expenditures, and \nfailed to properly fundraise.\n  For instance, our report concluded that TVC had spent only 15 percent \nof the Federal funding that it had received on veterans business \nresource centers, which TVC was required to establish and maintain \nunder law. In fiscal year 2008, the percentage dropped to about 9 \npercent. We also found that TVC's executives received unacceptably high \nlevels of compensation given the organization's limited resources and \nreach. While an average of 15 percent of TVC's federally appropriated \nfunds went to the Centers, 22 percent of TVC's fiscal year 2007 Federal \nappropriation dollars were spent on its top two executives' \ncompensation packages alone. Moreover, the organization miserably \nfailed to fundraise--which was required by law in order for it to \nbecome self-sufficient--and during fiscal years 2005 through 2007, TVC \nleaders spent $2.50 for every $1.00 they raised through the \norganization's fundraising efforts--almost entirely at the taxpayers' \nexpense. Additionally, through broad decision-making powers granted to \nTVC's executive committee under the organization's bylaws, the \ncommittee approved a number of measures without proper approval or \nratification from the full Board, including $40,000 in employee bonuses \nin 1 year alone.\n  Since the issuing of the Small Business Committee's report, Congress \nhas appropriated no further funding for TVC, and the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, has incorporated the Veteran Business Resource \nCenters, VBRCs, that TVC previously funded into its existing network of \nVeteran Business Outreach Centers, VBOCs. These moves were publically \nsupported by a variety of veteran service organizations, including the \nAmerican Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW. For instance, in \nAugust of 2008, the American Legion passed a resolution at its national \nconvention, Resolution No. 223, stating that the Legion ``. . . no \nlonger support[s] the continuing initiatives or existence of the \nnational Veterans Business Development Corporation.''\n  At present, TVC is still federally chartered. At the same time, it \nreceives no Federal funds, has no Department or Agency oversight. In \nlight of everything I have discussed, it is my belief that the Federal \ngovernment must take the next step and fully sever all ties with the \norganization. I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 486\n\n       Whereas, since 1984, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), \n     also known as the Kongra-Gel, has waged a campaign of \n     violence and terrorism against the people and Government of \n     Turkey;\n       Whereas it is estimated that at least 30,000 people have \n     been killed in PKK-associated violence since 1984;\n       Whereas the United States Government designated the PKK as \n     a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997, as a Specially \n     Designated Global Terrorist in 2001, and a Significant \n     Foreign Narcotics Trafficker in 2008;\n       Whereas, in 2010 and 2011, the Department of the Treasury \n     designated the top leaders of the PKK/Kongra-Gel as \n     Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers, including the head \n     of the PKK/Kongra-Gel Murat Karayilan and senior leaders Ali \n     Riza Altun and Zubayir Aydar;\n       Whereas, in 2004, the Council of the European Union added \n     the PKK to its list of terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush in October 2007 \n     characterized the PKK as a ``common enemy'' of the United \n     States and Turkey, saying of the PKK, ``It's an enemy to \n     Turkey, it's an enemy to Iraq, it's an enemy to people who \n     want to live in peace.'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama in April 2009 stated that, \n     ``Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat \n     from terrorism. . . And that includes the PKK'';\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey, under Prime Minister \n     Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has begun to take historic steps to \n     resolve sources of grievance among Kurds in Turkey that are \n     exploited by the PKK;\n       Whereas the PKK has a safe haven in the Qandil Mountains of \n     northern Iraq where many PKK fighters are currently based;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has been developing and \n     deepening diplomatic, economic, and strategic ties with the \n     Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Erdogan on April 20, 2012, stated, \n     ``The stance of the Turkish state is clear: once [the PKK] \n     lay down their arms, it is [our stance] to completely stop \n     military operations'';\n       Whereas Masoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional \n     Government in northern Iraq, stated on April 20, 2012, ``The \n     PKK should lay down its arms. . . If the PKK goes ahead with \n     weapons, it will bear the consequences.'';\n       Whereas the PKK has support networks in countries in \n     Europe, which engage in illicit and deceptive activities to \n     facilitate PKK recruitment, financing, logistical support, \n     training, and propaganda, including satellite television \n     broadcasting and print media that support the PKK's violent \n     terrorist agenda;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 EU Terrorism Situation and \n     Trend Report, published by the European Police Office \n     (EUPOL), the PKK is ``actively involved in money laundering, \n     illicit drugs and human trafficking, as well as illegal \n     immigration inside and outside the EU,'' and fundraises in \n     the EU ``using labels like `donations' and `membership fees', \n     but are in fact extortion and illegal taxation'';\n       Whereas the Europe-based satellite television channel, Roj \n     TV, was banned from broadcasting in Germany by the German \n     Interior Ministry in 2008 and, in January 2012, convicted by \n     a court in Denmark for ``promoting terrorism'' as an \n     undeclared propaganda arm of the PKK;\n       Whereas PKK-affiliated television channels continue to \n     operate in European countries, including Sweden, Norway, and \n     Denmark;\n       Whereas Turkey since 1952 has been a member of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the armed forces of Turkey and the United States \n     have served together as allies during the Korean War, in \n     Kosovo, in Afghanistan, and in the 2011 NATO intervention in \n     Libya, Operation Unified Protector;\n       Whereas President George W.

Turkey is an important part of Europe. And \n     Turkey and the United States must stand together, and work \n     together, to overcome the challenges of our time'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the continued campaign of terrorism by the \n     Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and expresses solidarity with \n     the victims of PKK violence;\n       (2) reaffirms that the PKK is a common enemy of the United \n     States and Turkey, and all responsible countries and \n     governments in the world;\n       (3) urges the PKK to lay down its arms, renounce violence, \n     and pursue peaceful dialogue with the Government of Turkey;\n       (4) commends the historic steps taken by the Government of \n     Turkey to address the sources of grievance and alienation \n     that have been exploited by the PKK to justify acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (5) welcomes efforts by the United States Government to \n     support the Government of Turkey in developing and \n     implementing a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the threat \n     posed by the PKK;\n       (6) encourages the United States Government to make \n     available diplomatic, military, and intelligence support to \n     the Government of Turkey so that it can apprehend or \n     eliminate irreconcilable violent elements of the PKK;\n       (7) applauds the deepening economic and political ties \n     between the Government of Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional \n     Government in Iraq;\n       (8) supports greater cooperation between and among the \n     relevant authorities in Turkey, the United States, the Iraqi \n     Kurdistan Region, and Iraq to end the PKK sanctuary in the \n     Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq;\n       (9) urges increased intelligence and counterterrorism \n     cooperation among the governments of the United States, \n     Turkey, Germany, and other countries in Europe to disrupt and \n     eliminate PKK support networks based in Europe, including PKK \n     financing and fundraising; and\n       (10) urges the European Union and governments in Europe--\n       (A) to take measures to ensure the PKK cannot use their \n     territories for fundraising, recruitment, financing, \n     logistical support, training, and propaganda; and\n       (B) to ban and prevent from operating on their territory \n     any media, including satellite broadcasting stations, that is \n     financed, controlled, or coordinated by the PKK or that \n     promotes the PKK's violent terrorist agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3843-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3843-S3844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 487--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n    AMBUSH MARKETING ADVERSELY AFFECTS TEAM USA AND THE OLYMPIC AND \n            PARALYMPIC MOVEMENTS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONDONED\n\n  Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Isakson) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (B) obesity is the leading medical reason why applicants \n     fail to qualify for military service;\n       (4) in April 2010, more than 100 of the top retired \n     generals, admirals, and senior military leaders in the United \n     States released a report entitled ``Too Fat to Fight'', which \n     urgently called on Congress to pass new child nutrition \n     legislation that would--\n       (A) get junk food out of schools;

and\n       (E) funding for the supplemental nutrition assistance \n     program established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 \n     (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) accounts for nearly 75 percent of the \n     total cost of this Act;\n       (8) since the enactment of the Food, Conservation, and \n     Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8701 et seq.), there has been a \n     sea change of interest and focus on the obesity epidemic in \n     the United States;\n       (9) Congress should have the very best information when \n     making policy decisions;

At its highest \npoint, the fire was ravaging nearly 5,000 acres in western Utah and \nsoutheastern Nevada, including sagebrush and other grasses in Lincoln \nCounty, NV.\n  Between the two of them, Captain Tompkins and First Officer Chambless \nhad been flying for nearly three decades, including over a decade \nfighting fires. Captain Tompkins said he liked his work because it \nhelped save communities and lives. Sadly, when he went into that \nmission on Sunday, he could not save his own.\n  My State has incurred much devastation from wildfires in recent \nyears. These blazes have destroyed homes, displaced families and \nbusinesses, and wiped out both critical wildlife habitat and productive \ngrazing lands.\n  Of course, without the brave work of the air tanker pilots dispatched \nto battle these fires, the damage could have been much worse. It is \ntherefore critical that we help ensure these courageous men and women \nhave the tools they need to conduct their important public safety work \nand preserve their own lives.\n  Today, we are asking for unanimous consent for Senate passage of \nlegislation introduced by Senators Wyden and Bingaman, S. 3261, which \nwould allow the Forest Service to quickly complete the contracting \nprocess for acquiring at least seven new large air tankers to fight \nwildfires during the 2012 and 2013 fire seasons.\n  The Forest Service is contending with an aging fleet of aircraft. The \nagency is working with planes that were designed for combat in the \nKorean War. Finding parts for tankers a half-century old is difficult, \nleading them to be grounded for long periods of times when repairs are \nneeded.\n  The Forest Service has said it needs between 18 and 28 new air \ntankers for optimal response to emergency response to wildfires. Today, \nhowever, there are only nine Forest Service tankers deemed airworthy to \nfight fires during what is expected to be a terrible fire season. If we \nact promptly, Congress has the opportunity to help the Forest Service \nput more tankers into service this year.\n  To partially satisfy the need for new air tankers, the Forest Service \nhas requested that Congress waive a 30-day\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nnotification requirement before it awards contracts for four large air \ntankers. S. 3261 would waive this requirement, and allow the Forest \nService to deploy these urgently needed air tankers.\n  There are hundreds of men and women currently fighting the White Rock \nfire, and I understand they are making progress. We should recognize \ntheir bravery, and provide them with the tools needed to do their \ndangerous job more safely by taking swift action on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and any statements relating to this \nmatter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3261) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER.\n\n       Notwithstanding the last sentence of section 3903(d) of \n     title 41, United States Code, the Chief of the Forest Service \n     may award contracts pursuant to Solicitation Number AG 024B S \n     11 9009 for large air tankers earlier than the end of the 30-\n     day period beginning on the date of the notification required \n     under the first sentence of section 3903(d) of that title.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we less than a week ago had two pilots \nkilled in Nevada fighting fires with one of these airplanes that was \nold, old, old. I appreciate the work of the Senators who worked so hard \nto get this done. This is an important piece of legislation that will \nallow us to do a better job of fighting fires when we have these new \nlarge air tankers. The old ones are really, really old.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3871-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MAKING A TECHNICAL CORRECTION IN PUBLIC LAW 112 108\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 476\n\n       Whereas the Chinese scientist and democracy advocate, Fang \n     Lizhi, passed away at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on April \n     6, 2012;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi was born in February 1936 in Beijing, \n     China;\n       Whereas, in 1952, Fang Lizhi enrolled in the Physics \n     Department of Peking University, where he met his future \n     wife, Li Shuxian, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in \n     1955;\n       Whereas, in 1955, Fang Lizhi openly questioned the lack of \n     independent thinking in China's education system and, in \n     1957, drafted a letter with Li Shuxian and other associates \n     proposing political reform;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were sentenced to hard \n     labor in 1957 and 1958, respectively, as victims of China's \n     Anti-Rightist Campaign;\n       Whereas, during China's Cultural Revolution, Fang Lizhi and \n     other faculty members and students of the University of \n     Science and Technology of China were sentenced to \n     ``reeducation through labor'' in a coal mine and a brick \n     factory;\n       Whereas, after he was again freed from confinement, Fang \n     Lizhi emerged as China's leading astrophysicist and wrote the \n     first modern Chinese-language cosmological studies, although \n     the theory of general relatively contradicted Communist \n     dogma;\n       Whereas, when he was appointed as vice president of the \n     University of Science and Technology of China in 1984, Fang \n     Lizhi initiated a series of reforms intended to democratize \n     the management of the university and enhance academic \n     freedom;\n       Whereas, in the winter of 1986 1987, when Chinese students \n     across China protested on behalf of democracy and human \n     rights, the Government of China fired Fang Lizhi from his \n     post at the University of Science and Technology of China and \n     subsequently purged him from the Communist party;\n       Whereas when, in the wake of his purge, excerpts from Fang \n     Lizhi's speeches were distributed by authorities in China as \n     examples of ``bourgeois liberalism'', his writings became \n     tremendously popular among Chinese students;\n       Whereas, in February 1989, Fang Lizhi published an essay \n     entitled ``China's Despair and China's Hope'', in which he \n     wrote, ``The road to democracy has already been long and \n     difficult, and is likely to remain difficult for many years \n     to come.'';\n       Whereas, in this essay, Fang Lizhi also wrote that ``it is \n     precisely because democracy is generated from below--despite \n     the many frustrations and disappointments in our present \n     situation--I still view our future with hope'';\n       Whereas, in the spring and early summer of 1989, Chinese \n     students gathered in Tiananmen Square to voice their support \n     for democracy, as well as to protest corruption in the \n     Chinese Communist Party;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi chose not to join the protests at \n     Tiananmen Square in order to demonstrate that the students \n     were acting autonomously;\n       Whereas, from June 3 through 4, 1989, the Government of \n     China directed the People's Liberation Army to clear \n     Tiananmen Square of protestors, killing hundreds of students \n     and other civilians in the process;\n       Whereas, the Government of China issued arrest warrants for \n     Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian after the Tiananmen Massacre, \n     accusing the pair of engaging in ``counterrevolutionary \n     propaganda'' and denouncing Fang as the ``instigator of chaos \n     which resulted in the deaths of many people'';\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1989, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were \n     escorted by United States diplomats to the United States \n     Embassy in Beijing;\n       Whereas, between June 1989 and June 1990, United States \n     diplomatic personnel under the leadership of Ambassador James \n     R. Lilley sheltered Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian at the United \n     States Embassy in Beijing, despite the many hardships it \n     imposed on the mission;\n       Whereas, at a November 15, 1989, ceremony awarding Fang \n     Lizhi the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy said of Fang ``What Andrei Sakharov was in \n     Moscow, Fang Lizhi became in Beijing.'';\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1990, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were \n     allowed to leave China for the United Kingdom and then the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in 1992, Fang Lizhi received an appointment as a \n     professor of physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, \n     where he continued his research in astrophysics and \n     advocating for human rights in China;\n       Whereas, in the years since June 4, 1989, a new generation \n     of Chinese activists has continued the struggle for democracy \n     in their homeland, working ``from below'' to protect the \n     rights of Chinese citizens, to increase the openness of the \n     Chinese political system, and to reduce corruption among \n     public officials; and\n       Whereas, with the passing of Fang Lizhi, China and the \n     United States have lost a great scientist and one of the most \n     eloquent human rights advocates of the modern era: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Fang Lizhi;\n       (2) honors the life, scientific contributions, and service \n     of Fang Lizhi to advance the cause of human freedom;\n       (3) offers the deepest condolences of the Senate to the \n     family and friends of Fang Lizhi; and\n       (4) stands with the people of China as they strive to \n     improve their way of life and create a government that is \n     truly democratic and respectful of international norms in the \n     area of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3872-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3872-S3873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMENDING THE FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL--USS \n                             ``MIAMI'' FIRE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 488) commending the efforts of the \n     firefighters and emergency response personnel of Maine, New \n     Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, who came together \n     to extinguish the May 23rd, 2012, fire at Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nrecognizing the incredible courage and tremendous skill of the \nfirefighters and emergency first responders who extinguished the fire \naboard the USS Miami (SSN 755), a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered \nsubmarine, 2 weeks ago at Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, \nME.\n  At approximately 5:41 p.m. on Wednesday, May 23, 2012, a four-alarm \nfire broke out inside the forward compartment of the USS Miami, which \nwas 3 months into a 20-month overhaul at Kittery-Portsmouth. More than \n100 first responders from 23 locations in 4 separate States responded \nto successfully contain the damage of the blaze and ensure that there \nwas no tragic loss of life.\n  With nothing less than fearless determination in the face of what has \nbeen called the most significant emergency to strike the shipyard in \ndecades, brave firefighters battled zero visibility in tight, \nobstructed quarters filled with noxious smoke and searing heat for more \nthan 10 hours to limit the fire to the forward quarters of the ship and \neventually extinguish it entirely.\n  Due to the unimaginably challenging space constraints, Kittery-\nPortsmouth firefighters, in a command capacity and with a succinct \ncollaborative effort with shipyard project team personnel, directed the \nrotation of multiple waves of groups of only three or four firefighters \nat a time to descend two stories into the ship to push back the flames. \nTheir critical decision to immediately request assistance from mutual \naid communities up and down the coast ensured sufficient manpower to \nsustain the continuous delivery of roughly three million gallons of \nwater and fire suppressants needed to tame the blaze.\n  The integration of firefighters from so many seacoast communities was \nseamless, and should be held as an example of successful inter-\njurisdictional cooperation that could be used as a model for similar \nemergencies in the future. Furthermore, the fact that each and every \none of these exceptional firefighters, many of whom had no prior \nexperience aboard a submarine, could walk into such an extraordinarily \ndifficult situation and perform so successfully is a testament to their \nexhaustive training, remarkable abilities and undaunted valor.\n  Due to their inspirational efforts, with only seven responders \nsuffering minor injuries, the fire and all subsequent damage was \ngreatly limited, and the ship's nuclear reactor remained safe and \nstable throughout. After the fire, I had the privilege of meeting some \nof the firefighters who summoned unparalleled bravery and demonstrated \nsuch tenacity and skill in preventing the potentially catastrophic \nescalation of this fire. These men and women represent the very best of \ntheir field, and it is an honor to sponsor this resolution recognizing \nthem.\n  Indeed, it is largely thanks to these able firefighters and emergency \nfirst responders that we have the opportunity to repair the USS Miami. \nWhen I spoke with Navy Vice Admiral McCoy, commander of Naval Sea \nSystems Command, after the fire, he said, ``We're determined to send \nthe Miami back to sea.''\n  I join Admiral McCoy in this sentiment. With a growing shortage of \nsubmarines in our Navy, it is vital that the USS Miami and its crew are \nable to quickly return to their vital work of keeping this country safe \nand secure, as the boat has done since its commission in 1990. Indeed, \nin the coming weeks and months, I look forward to working with the \nNavy, the men and women of Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and my \ncolleagues in the Senate to ensure that the USS Miami is quickly \nreturned to service.\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 488) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 488\n\n       Whereas the USS Miami (SSN-755), a Los Angeles-class \n     nuclear attack submarine with a crew of 13 officers and 120 \n     enlisted personnel, arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on \n     March 1, 2012, for 20 months of scheduled maintenance;\n       Whereas at 5:41 p.m. EDT on May 23, 2012, a 4-alarm fire \n     occurred in the forward compartment of the USS Miami;\n       Whereas emergency response personnel, led by the \n     firefighters of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, worked for nearly \n     10 hours in tight, obstructed quarters filled with noxious \n     smoke and searing heat--\n       (1) to prevent any loss of life;\n       (2) to bring the fire under control; and\n       (3) to successfully prevent the flames from reaching any \n     nuclear material and allow the nuclear reactor to remain \n     unaffected and stable throughout;\n       Whereas 23 fire departments and emergency response teams \n     from the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and \n     Connecticut provided mutual aid support during the fire, \n     including--\n       (1) Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire;\n       (2) York County Hazardous Materials Response Team, Maine;\n       (3) Massachusetts Port Authority Logan Airport Crash Team;\n       (4) South Portland Fire Department, Maine;\n       (5) Eliot Fire Department, Maine;\n       (6) Lee Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (7) Dover Ambulance, New Hampshire;\n       (8) Portsmouth Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (9) Hampton Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (10) Kittery Fire Department, Maine;\n       (11) Newcastle Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (12) American Medical Response Ambulance, New Hampshire;\n       (13) Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts;\n       (14) Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut;\n       (15) Rye Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (16) Greenland Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (17) York Fire Department, Maine;\n       (18) Newington Fire Department, Connecticut;\n       (19) Somersworth Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (20) Rollinsford Fire Department, New Hampshire;\n       (21) South Berwick Fire Department, Maine;\n       (22) York Ambulance, Maine; and\n       (23) York Beach Fire Department, Maine; and\n       Whereas the heroic actions of those firefighters, emergency \n     response personnel, and the USS Miami crew and shipyard \n     firefighters, 7 of whom suffered minor injuries during the \n     fire, directly prevented catastrophe, and greatly limited the \n     severity of the fire even in the most challenging of \n     environments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the exemplary and courageous service of all \n     the firefighters and emergency response personnel who came \n     together to successfully contain the fire, minimizing damage \n     to a critical national security asset and ensuring no loss of \n     life; and\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n       (2) expresses support for the Navy and the exceptionally \n     skilled workforce at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, \n     Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3873-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE SPRING PAGE CLASS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked hard. Not as hard as I would \nhave liked or not as long hours as I would have liked and not as much \naccomplished as I would have liked, but this is the last day for this \ngroup of pages.\n  These spring pages have been exemplary. I really enjoy walking past \nthem. They are out there studying. They are sitting here as we speak \nnow. I wish I could have been a page. I really do. I think it would \nhave been a great life.\n  We have done a much better job of making sure they are safe and \nhappy. When I first came here, the pages lived wherever they could find \na place to live. Now we have wonderful, safe, secure dormitories for \nthose young men and women. We have a wonderful educational program for \nthem. It is hard; no one can say it is easy. They learn a lot.\n  Two of my granddaughters have been pages. It changed their lives. \nThey came here not having much interest in government. By the time they \nleft, they had started reading the newspapers--not like the Presiding \nOfficer and I, they did most of their reading online. But they were \ninterested in government, and they still are. I guess they are both \nseniors now, one at New York University and one at the New School in \nNew York.\n  One of my prized possessions in my office is a picture of my first \ntwo grandchildren, these two little girls, Ryan and Mattie. They are in \ndiapers, and they are hanging onto each other. Then I have a picture \nright on the same little table of them in their page uniforms. That is \na wonderful picture for me. It shows the progress of people's lives. It \nis really meaningful to me.\n  I can say this to these pages: This will be an opportunity they will \nnever forget. They will make friends here who will be friends for the \nrest of their lives. The Presiding Officer and I know the friends you \nmake when you are young are just so important to you as you proceed \nthrough life. I still love to pick up the phone and call some of the \nyoung men and--in fact, I talked to a woman today with whom I went to \nschool. That is good. That is what life is all about. Make good friends \nand maintain that friendship.\n  Now, they have seen some things in the Senate that I think will be in \nthe history books forever. We passed the surface transportation bill, \nwe passed the Violence Against Women Act, we passed the Ex-Im Bank \nreauthorization, Iran sanctions bill, FDA Modernization Act, postal \nreform--we passed that.\n  We are in the process of trying to resolve the student loan debate, \nbut we worked on that. That was something we were able to move on \nthrough this body. We did not pass the paycheck fairness--we did not, \nbut we have been involved for a long time on the Paycheck Fairness Act. \nThey have been able to watch all of this, and they can go home and tell \ntheir friends and family that they all relate to this stuff all of the \ntime because they know now how the foundation of the government works. \nThey have been here.\n  So I appreciate personally everything they have done. Senator \nMcConnell is going to speak to the pages tomorrow. I am not going to be \nable to be here. But he will tell those assembled that he is speaking \non our behalf. I appreciate that very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/07/senate-section/article/S3873-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 11, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
