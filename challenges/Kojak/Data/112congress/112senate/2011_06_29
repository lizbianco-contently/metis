Madam President, often very good ideas, no matter how \nimportant, take time to ripen. Even when they are ripe they need \ndedicated advocates to make them a reality. Let me give one example.\n  President Harry Truman once said:\n\n       Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of \n     opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not \n     now have protection or security against the economic effects \n     of sickness. And the time has now arrived for action to help \n     them attain that opportunity and help them get that \n     protection.\n\n  But in 1945 when he spoke those words to Congress, the time had not \nyet truly arrived. In fact, it would be another 20 years before \nTruman's good idea was realized. It would be 20 years before Truman \nbecame the first of 19 million Americans to receive a Medicare card.\n  President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law in the \nTruman Presidential Library in Independence, MO. The law took effect \nalmost a year later, 45 years ago this week, on July 1, 1966.\n  At the time Medicare took effect, only half of Americans 65 and older \nhad access to health care coverage. A third of American seniors lived \nin poverty. ``Poverty was so common that we did not know it had a \nname,'' President Johnson said, describing a time before Medicare.\n  Today, virtually every American over 65 has access to health care and \nthe number of seniors who live below the poverty line has dropped by 75 \npercent. That is no accident. Medicare provides 47 million Americans \nwith the\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\naccess to care and protection from poverty that President Truman \nenvisioned 65 years ago, and Medicare and Medicaid do not only protect \nseniors from poverty, they also protect those seniors' children. Forty-\nsix years ago, middle-class families often spent themselves into the \npoorhouse honoring their commitment to their moms and dads. Today's \nseniors and their children have the security that Medicare and Medicaid \nwill be there to honor that commitment--to providing health care and \nnursing home care when they need it.\n  But Medicare doesn't only save American seniors money, it saves their \nlives. In 1964, just before Medicare was signed into law, seniors lived \nan average of not quite 70 years. Today the national average is more \nthan 78 years. There is, perhaps, no achievement greater than that. \nThis law literally extended Americans' life expectancy. Forty-six years \nago, before signing Medicare into law, President Johnson made this vow:\n\n       No longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice to \n     those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \n     labor to the progress of this progressive country.\n\n  Democrats intend to honor that solemn vow of President Johnson. But \ntoday Medicare is under siege. Republicans would trade away the health \nand safety of today's seniors for the sake of tax breaks for \nbillionaires, wealthy oil companies, and corporations that ship jobs \noverseas. They would trade that sense of security, that ``hand of \njustice'' Johnson described, for the sake of tax breaks on their \ncorporate jets and their yachts. Their ideological budget would end \nMedicare as we know it, once again subjecting seniors to the rising \ncosts of health care. Democrats refuse to let that happen.\n  A lot has changed since 1966 and that law. New technologies and \nmedicines are there for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. We now have \nhip replacements and chemotherapy, all pioneered in the late 1960s, and \nthey are now performed in the United States every single day. Medicine \nhas changed for the better.\n  But one thing has not changed. Seniors need Medicare. In fact, the \nrising cost of health care today means seniors need Medicare's \nprotection more now than ever. That is why we will never stop fighting \nto preserve this successful program. As long as I am in the Senate, I \nwill oppose Republican plans to weaken or undermine it, because the \nRepublicans' plan to weaken Medicare is an idea whose time will never \ncome.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4166-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the past several days the \nAmerican people have watched a serious debate unfold right here in \nWashington about our Nation's debt and about the future of our economy, \nand for many the debate has been extremely illuminating. It has done a \nlot to clarify where the two parties stand. Both sides agree that our \ndeficits and our debt are unsustainable. But beyond that, the \ndifferences are stark.\n  Republicans believe if you increase spending to the point that you \ncan no longer pay the bills, then you need to find a way to cut costs. \nDemocrats seem to think if you increase spending to the point that you \ncan no longer pay the bills, you need to find other people to pick up \nthe tab. This is a fundamental difference between the two parties.\n  Republicans think Democrats should be held accountable for the way \nthey have mismanaged the national checkbook over the past 2 years and \nDemocrats seem to think that taxpayers should take the hit.\n  Democrats spend beyond their means and now they expect a bailout from \nthe taxpayers. That is what this debate is all about. It is about \nholding Washington accountable, for a change. It is about drawing a \nline in the sand and saying, no, the taxpayers will not bail out \npoliticians. It is about refusing to subsidize the Democrats' \nirresponsible spending habits another day. Democrats have shown through \ntheir reckless spending over the past 2 years that they are not at all \nconcerned about our fiscal future. They should not expect to be \nrewarded for that.\n  The entire Democratic approach to this debate has been astonishing, \nreally. I mean, here we are in the midst of two national crises: 14 \nmillion unemployed and more than $14 trillion in debt--14 million \nunemployed and $14 trillion in debt--chronic unemployment and record \ndeficits and debt. And what are the Democrats proposing? Higher taxes \nand more spending. In the middle of a jobs crisis they want to slam \nalready struggling businesses with a massive tax hike. In the middle of \na debt crisis they want to borrow and spend more money as a solution to \nthe problem. This is not a negotiation, it is a parody.\n  In a discussion about reducing the debt, they want to increase \nspending. Let me say that again. In a discussion about reducing the \ndebt, they want to increase spending. In the middle of a jobs crisis \nthey want to raise taxes--even as they claim to support job creation. \nWhich is it? Yesterday the President went to a manufacturing plant to \ntout jobs. Yet even as he was speaking, his administration was looking \nto saddle manufacturing companies, including the one he was visiting \nyesterday, with billions of dollars in new taxes.\n  According to a letter from a group of trade associations, including \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, this particular tax would be \n``devastating'' to manufacturers. The President himself said as \nrecently as 6 months ago that keeping taxes where they are enables \nbusinesses to hire more workers. Six months ago the President said \nthat. In other words, he was saying that raising taxes leads to fewer \njobs. So he can call for tax hikes but he cannot call for tax hikes and \njob creation. It is one or the other--six months ago making the \nargument that tax hikes lose jobs; today out touting jobs on the one \nhand and pushing for higher taxes on the other. He can't have it both \nways.\n  The Democrats' spending spree has brought us to the brink of an \neconomic calamity and now they are telling taxpayers they will not do \nanything to prevent it unless the taxpayers hand over more money in the \nform of tax hikes. And they have the nerve to call their critics \nimmoral. I want to know what you call spending trillions more than you \nhave and then expecting others to pick up the tab; that is what this is \nall about, spending trillions more than you have and expecting somebody \nelse to pick up the tab.\n  Does anybody seriously propose tax hikes as a solution to a job \ncrisis? Who proposes more spending as a solution to a debt crisis? Who \nthinks if we raise the debt limit now without enacting serious spending \ncuts and meaningful reforms first it will lead to greater fiscal \ndiscipline later? There is an important principle at stake in this \ndebate. It is not about rich versus poor. It is not about an election. \nIt is about whether Washington will ever be held accountable for its \nmistakes. That is why Republicans refuse to let the taxpayers take the \nhit when it comes to reducing the debt, and that is why all 47 \nRepublicans in the Senate support a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.\n\n  The debate we have been having over the past few days shows more than \never why we need a balanced budget amendment in Congress. A balanced \nbudget amendment would require that lawmakers stop spending money we \ndon't have. When we come back after July 4, we will fight for an \nopportunity to vote for it. Broke or balanced, that is the choice. The \nAmerican people should know where their Senators stand on this issue of \naccountability. Senators can talk all day long about the importance of \nbalancing the books and living within our means, but a vote in favor of \nthe balanced budget amendment will show we actually mean it. A vote \nagainst it will show that they don't.\n  Look, no one denies that both parties are guilty of spending beyond \nour means. But this White House has taken\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nwasteful spending to new heights, and its allies in Congress are all \ntoo quick to defend it. The last time the Senate voted on a balanced \nbudget amendment, the government's annual deficit was about $100 \nbillion, the national debt was about $5.5 trillion, and it failed by a \nsingle vote--a single vote. Today, the annual deficit is $1.6 trillion, \nand the national debt is $14.5 trillion.\n  The President and his party need to be held accountable. The fiscal \nmess they have helped create calls for rehab. That is what the balanced \nbudget amendment would provide--a spending straitjacket. No more blank \nchecks. If Democrats won't pass a budget of their own, it is time \nAmericans impose a budget on them. Americans are not about to let \nDemocrats use another crisis as an excuse to expand the size of \ngovernment.\n  If ever there were a time for Washington to pass through a crisis and \ncome out smaller on the other side, it is right now. Republicans are \ntotally united in this effort. All we need is 20 Democrats to join us. \nWashington should be forced to make the kinds of difficult choices the \nrest of the country has to make. Lawmakers should have to make the case \nfor a spending increase before they approve it. Never again can they \njust spend away and then demand in the teeth of a crisis that taxpayers \ncough up the money--as I said earlier, the taxpayer bailout.\n  It is time to put the American people back at the helm of our ship of \nstate, and if that is what this vote achieves, then this debate we are \nhaving this summer will have been well worth it. If Washington is \nforced to finally reform its ways, then one day we will look back and \nsay that the American people won this debate, and we will say the \nbalanced budget amendment was just the thing we needed to get the house \nin order. Broke or balanced, that is the choice before us.\n  I look forward to this vote. The American people clearly want it. \nLet's hold Washington accountable, and let's begin to restore power to \nthe people who sent us here not to do our own will but to carry out \ntheirs. That is the principle at stake. It is about the kind of \ngovernment we want to have--a government of the people or a government \nabove the people. That is the choice. Much depends on the outcome.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4167-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today we are beginning what might prove \none of the most consequential debates in American history. The American \npeople are demanding that Congress debate and pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. They are going to get that debate, and I \nam confident that if Congressmen and Senators listen to their \nconstituents, the citizens of this Nation are going to have the \nopportunity to ratify a balanced budget amendment this year. All 47 \nRepublican Members of the Senate are of one mind on the need for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We have listened to our \nconstituents who are pleading with us to take action that will \npermanently resolve our debt crisis and keep us from getting into this \nsituation again.\n  The situation is a disaster. We all know the numbers: three straight \ntrillion-dollar-plus deficits; $14.5 trillion in debt and rising every \nday; $62 trillion in total liability that this government owns. Since \nDemocrats last passed a budget--that was over 790 days ago--our \nnational debt has risen by $3.2 trillion, and now the administration is \nasking for more.\n  We simply cannot do this anymore. Madam President, 100 percent of our \ntax revenues are spent on mandatory spending and interest on the debt. \nEvery other penny is borrowed. The money is simply not there to finance \na government of this size, and everyone knows this, although not \neveryone will admit it. They know deficit spending and skyrocketing \ndebt have come to an end. Our Nation's current debt-to-GDP ratio is 95 \npercent. Countries with debt above 95 percent of GDP have growth that \nis 1 percent below normal, resulting in a loss of 1 million jobs. Our \ndebt is a lead weight around the neck of the economy.\n  But in the current negotiations over the debt limit, the \nadministration insists that it is Republicans who, by refusing to pass \nan increase of the debt limit that does not include meaningful efforts \nto address our fiscal situation, are holding back the economic recovery \nand undercutting the stock and bond markets. This has things exactly \nbackward. The markets understand that our long-term deficit projections \nare moving toward a full-blown debt crisis. The markets understand that \nwe are currently on the glidepath to Greece. The markets would respond \nlike gangbusters to spending cuts, spending caps, and a balanced budget \namendment that brings our long-term fiscal problems under control.\n  I am more convinced than ever that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is essential if we are to right our fiscal ship. This is \nnot the first time we have been down this road, but the stakes could \nnot be higher this time, and the amendment could not be better designed \nto address the crisis. Our amendment is not just an amendment for \nfiscal balance, it is an amendment that takes on the root cause of our \ncurrent debt crisis; that is, government spending. Our amendment \nrequires a balanced budget. It establishes a spending cap of 18 percent \nof GDP, and it establishes supermajority requirements for tax increases \nor future debt-limit increases.\n  We will hear a number of tired arguments against the BBA. Its \nopponents will say the amendment is not properly vetted. We have been \ntalking about the balanced budget amendment for decades, and if we had \npassed it back in 1997, when it fell by 1 vote short of being sent to \nthe States for ratification, we would not be in the mess we are in \ntoday.\n  They will say it stacks the deck by requiring spending cuts rather \nthan tax increases to balance the budget. This is an issue I will \naddress at length, but the American people understand the solution to a \nspending crisis is not to give the government more money to spend, \nespecially this government.\n  They will say a balanced budget amendment is unnecessary and Congress \njust needs to do its job. But we have heard this over and over before, \nand the American people know that waiting for Congress to balance the \nbudget and shrink the size of government without a constitutional \namendment is less fruitful than waiting for Godot.\n  They will say the spending cuts required as a result of this BBA will \nhurt children and the elderly. But the real harm to our children will \nbe when we hand them a future of national indebtedness and dim economic \nprospects, and the real harm to the elderly will be the coming \nbankruptcy of the Nation's entitlement programs--the guaranteed result \nof the President's failure to lead on entitlement reform.\n  Finally, they will say the Constitution should not be amended. I \nagree that it should not be amended lightly, but the Founders \nthemselves expected that changing circumstances and national \nemergencies would demand amendments to the Constitution from time to \ntime.\n  The American people understand that this is one of those times. In \nthis country, the people are sovereign, the Constitution is their \nConstitution, and they are demanding that Congress pass a balanced \nbudget amendment and send it to them and the States for ratification.\n  My hope is that the party of Thomas Jefferson will listen to their \nconstituents and follow their founder's lead,\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nkeeping faith in the people and their good sense and stewardship over \nthe Constitution.\n  Later this summer we will vote on a balanced budget amendment. God \nwilling, this fall the people in the States will start down the road to \nratification.\n  I am proud to be joined this morning by several of my colleagues who \nhave been critical leaders on the balanced budget amendment. Each \nbrings a unique perspective to this debate, and I think it is great \nthat they are standing up to lead on this issue.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague, the junior Senator from Kentucky. \nHe is a remarkable spokesperson for limited government, and I am glad \nto have him on my side in the coming fight for the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the balanced budget amendment is \ninteresting when you look at polls and ask the American public: Do you \napprove of what Congress is doing? Do you approve of congressional \naction? Do you think they are doing a good job? It is actually 14 \npercent to 15 percent of the American public who think we are doing a \ngood job. The other side of that equation is, you ask the American \npublic: Do you think a balanced budget amendment would help Congress do \na better job? It is 75 percent to 80 percent of the American public who \nthink we would do a better job if we had a balanced budget amendment.\n  I don't think this is a partisan issue. I would ask the Senator from \nUtah--and perhaps an opinion from the Senator from Texas--do you think \nthis should be a partisan issue or do you think this goes beyond \npartisanship, and can we get the Democrats to understand this isn't a \nRepublican-Democratic issue but really an issue for the good of the \ncountry?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, that should go way beyond partisanship. If we pass \nit here by the requisite two-thirds vote and we pass it in the House, \nwhich we will, this will be submitted to the States, and then the \nStates can make their determination whether or not we have a balanced \nbudget amendment. The Democrats who hate the balanced budget \namendment--some of them; in fact, most of them--all they have to do is \nget 13 States to defeat it. We have to get 38 States to win. Frankly, \nwe will win this because the American people are with us. And this is \nthe right thing to do. It is the right thing to do at this time. It is \nthe only thing that is going to get us to right this fiscal ship.\n  Mr. PAUL. What does the Senator say to those who say that statutory \ncaps would work, something like Gramm-Rudman or something like pay-as-\nyou-go? What is his answer?\n  Mr. HATCH. Gramm-Rudman lasted all but a year and a half, 2 years, \nbefore the same people went on a spending spree again, although it was \na light spending spree compared to today. Today it is multitrillions of \ndollars.\n  I have to tell you that has never worked. We have to put a \nstraitjacket into this matter where the Congress has to live the way 49 \nStates have to live. There is only one State that doesn't require a \nbalanced budget in its State constitution. Why should we have a \nrequisite desire--not only desire but rule to have a balanced budget as \nwell? I am convinced that we have to do it after being in the Senate \nfor 35 years and seeing, year after year after year, people unwilling \nto do this.\n  Mr. PAUL. And I think what is interesting, if you look at this and \nyou really look at polling data and say: Who is for the balanced budget \namendment, it goes across all party lines. If you look at Independents, \nDemocrats, if you look at Republicans, it is in the high sixties to the \nmidseventies in the percentage of the public who would like to see \nthis. And I think it goes hand in hand that they don't think we are \ndoing a good enough job here and that we need more backbone, and the \nConstitution is supposed to be our backbone. The Constitution helps us \nto do a good job, to help restrain the size and growth of government.\n  I can't see an argument against this, and I really don't understand \nhow a vast majority of the public can be for this and yet this body \nstill refuses to act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. I think the Senator makes very \ngood points there. Frankly, I know this body very well. I am the most \nsenior Republican. I have been here 35 years. I have seen year after \nyear after year excuses to go into debt, excuses to deficit spend, \nexcuses for why they are putting our country into this terrible state \nof bankruptcy--just plain excuses. And, of course, they hide behind the \nfact that they are trying to do it for the good of the people. It is \nnot for the good of the people. It is not good to not live within your \nmeans, and unfortunately that is what has been going on here all of the \ntime I have been here.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think one of the alarming things we see is that on the \ncourse we are taking now, if we do nothing dramatic to reform the \nprocess--if we don't pass the balanced budget amendment--within about a \ndecade, the budget will be entirely consumed by entitlements and \ninterest. This is being driven by something beyond the control of \nRepublicans, beyond the control of Democrats, and out of everyone's \nhands. It has to do with the fact that we are living longer and there \nare fewer young people and more old people because a lot of babies were \nborn after World War II.\n  These are demographic facts we can't escape. When we look at some of \nthe charts about what goes on with this, we see what happens if we do \nnothing. We see the projected debt way out here. Most of this debt \nproblem is entitlements. We have to come together as parties. The \nbalanced budget amendment will help us do this, but then we need to \nacknowledge that these problems exist and we need to come together--\nboth parties--to figure out solutions.\n  I think the balanced budget amendment may well be what forces us to \nhave a discussion. To be good legislators, we need to decide priorities \ninstead of just adding on new program after new program. We have 80 \ndifferent Federal programs that are work programs. We need to think \nabout consolidating and minimizing government. I think the balanced \nbudget amendment would allow us to have a discussion in this body on \nwhere we can cut spending.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I think he states it very well. That is the whole \npurpose of the balanced budget amendment. So I thank him for his cogent \nremarks and his erudition.\n  Last week, I signed a pledge that many people in this body are \nhearing about from their constituents. It is called the cut, cap, and \nbalance pledge. Those of us who signed this pledge committed ourselves \nto significant spending cuts, a cap on government spending, and a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution as a condition for \nsupporting any increase in the debt limit. I was pleased to work with \nmy colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, in developing a balanced budget \namendment that is supported by every Republican in this body. Of \ncourse, we worked with many others as well, especially Senator Cornyn. \nI am now pleased to be working with him on the goals of the cut, cap, \nand balance coalition, a remarkable group of grassroots activists \ncommitted to getting our Nation's spending under control.\n  Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague from \nUtah, Senator Lee.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank my distinguished colleague, my senior Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, for his leadership on the balanced budget amendment \nover the years. He has been a consistent and stalwart advocate for the \ncause of amending the Constitution in such a way that restricts \nCongress's ability to engage in deficit spending.\n  It is the practice of perpetual, reckless deficit spending that has \ncreated this almost $15 trillion debt we are now dealing with. It is \nthis practice of perpetual, excessive deficit spending that has fueled \nthe expansion of the Federal Government far beyond the limits the \nFounding Fathers had in mind and far beyond the natural limits this \ngovernment can handle.\n  It is important to remember we are now spending through the Federal \nGovernment more than 25 percent of our annual GDP. More than one-\nquarter of every dollar that moves through the American economy is \nconsumed by Washington. This is a problem. This is a problem, and it \nis, unfortunately, not something that is at all consistent with where \nwe have been historically as Americans.\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\n  We have to remember that for about the first 140 years of our \nRepublic's existence under the Constitution, our Federal spending was \nnowhere near this high as a percentage of GDP. Between 1790 and the \nearly 1930s, the Federal Government tended to spend between 1.5 and 4 \npercent of GDP every single year, year in and year out. There were two \nblips, two exceptions--one during the Civil War and one during World \nWar I and its immediate aftermath. But after those cycles passed, we \nwent right back to where we had been before. That started to change in \nthe 1930s and we have been on a gradual upswing almost ever since then \nto where we are now above 25 percent.\n  But it gets worse. By the year 2035, we are predicted to be spending \nalmost 34 percent of gross domestic product by the Federal Government \nevery single year. As a result, the Federal Government will be \ncommanding a very substantial portion of the American economy. That \nmakes every American less free. The more government spends--the more \nmoney it has access to and the more it borrows on our behalf--the less \nfree we become, the less individual liberty we have to spend our money, \nto use our resources, to devote our lives to the pursuits we choose.\n  That is why the cut, cap, and balance pledge is necessary to support \nindividual liberty and to protect our most basic freedoms, because it \nwill protect us from the inexorable growth of the government.\n  We are at an important time in American history. We are at a time \nwhen we are being asked to extend our debt limit once again; a time \nwhen we are being asked to say: Yes, we are going to give the Federal \nGovernment authority to borrow even more money against our unborn \nchildren and grandchildren. This is a problem.\n  One reason we are willing to sign this pledge is that we are willing \nto say: OK. We have been put on a path with government spending at this \nrate. We can't halt that spending immediately. We are willing to \nconsider raising the debt limit but if and only if certain conditions \nhave been satisfied to make sure this doesn't continue in perpetuity. \nWe need cuts. We need some kind of significant cuts to our spending \nright now. We need some kind of statutory spending cap to put us on a \ngradual glidepath toward a balanced budget. Most importantly, we have \nto amend the U.S. Constitution so as to say this will not continue in \nperpetuity and future Congresses will not be able to do what Senator \nHatch referred to a minute ago, which is exempt itself out of statutory \nspending caps once it has adopted them.\n  We can't bind future Congresses to cut $2 trillion over the course of \na decade or more because we can't command future Congresses to do what \nwe want it to do unless, of course, we amend the Constitution, which is \nwhy we have to do that right now. This is essential to economic \nprogress in America. This is essential to economic well-being and to \nindividual liberty in America.\n  I would love to talk with anyone who wants to about this. I have \ninvited Utahans who may be in town and I invite anyone within the sound \nof my voice, here or elsewhere, to join me in my office this \nWednesday--today--and every Wednesday at 3:30, when we have what we \nrefer to as a JELL-O bar. Utah consumes more JELL-O per capita than any \nState in the Union. We serve up JELL-O and we will talk about the cut, \ncap, and balance pledge.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah. He is a \nwonderful Senator and he serves as a leader in this area.\n  I don't have enough good words to say about my friend from Texas, my \ncolleague, Senator Cornyn, who was a judge on the Supreme Court in \nTexas before coming here. From the minute he set foot in this Chamber, \nhe has been a strong conservative, committed to constitutional \ngovernment. From the beginning of this Congress, he knew we needed to \npass a balanced budget amendment, and we are going to need him in this \nfight.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague from Texas, Senator \nCornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I join my colleagues from Kentucky and \nthe junior Senator from Utah in recognizing the leadership of the \nsenior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, on this even more compelling issue \ntoday than it was even back in 1997, the balanced budget amendment.\n  I couldn't help but be struck by the figures the senior Senator from \nUtah mentioned earlier when he said that in 1997, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the balanced budget amendment. It came to the \nSenate and failed by one vote. The deficit in 1997 was roughly $107 \nbillion. Today, it is $1.5 trillion. The national debt in 1997, if I \nrecall what the Senator said--and he can correct me if I am wrong--\ntoday it is roughly $14.3 trillion, approaching $15 trillion. Back in \n1997, it was $5 trillion. Did I get those figures roughly correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator did. Back in 1997, we lost by one vote. I was \nleading the fight on the floor. We had 67 votes and one of our Senators \nflipped on us at the last minute and we lost it by one vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree with the Senator from Kentucky who says this is \nnot a partisan issue. As a matter of fact, back in 1997 a lot of our \nDemocratic colleagues joined Republicans to vote in favor of a balanced \nbudget amendment. If there is an issue that threatens not only the \neconomy but also our national security today more than the national \ndebt, I don't know what it is.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said the \nsingle largest threat to our national security is the debt. Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton said the debt sends a message of weakness \ninternationally.\n  I was just over at the Heritage Foundation giving a speech. They are \nstudying the role of China in the world, the rise of China, but \nparticularly what I was concerned about, and the subject of my remarks, \nwas the fact that the Treasury Department estimates that $1.1 trillion \nof U.S. debt is held by the Communist Chinese Government. That is one-\nthird of all our outstanding debt. We know that at least on one \noccasion, a retired Chinese general said that if we didn't do what \nChina wanted, they would then threaten to disrupt our economy by \nselling off the debt they own. So my colleagues may care to comment.\n  Larry Lindsey, the renowned economist, wrote an article recently \nwhere we cited three things that worry him the most about high \nunemployment and the lassitude of the private sector. He said it is \nslow economic growth, of course, because many in the private sector are \ndiscouraged--the entrepreneurs who create jobs, the job creators who \nwould otherwise expand--and slow economic growth concerns him. I think \nin the first quarter it was 1.8 of our gross domestic product. It is \nnot enough to generate jobs to get people back to work and one reason \nfor our high unemployment.\n  He said the other two issues that worry him the most are, one, the \ninterest payments on our national debt. He points out that because of \nthe Federal Reserve policy, the interest rates on our national debt are \nat below historic norms. He points out, for example, if inflation were \nto kick in or the Federal Reserve, for some reason, should decide to \ntighten its policy and raise interest rates, what it would do to \nballoon the interest payments alone on our national debt in a way that \nwould threaten our ability to fund national defense or other issues as \nwell.\n  Two, he also points out the exploding costs of the health care bill, \nwith more and more employees incentivized to dump people onto the \nState-based exchanges subsidized by taxpayers as opposed to their \nemployers.\n  I wonder if any of my colleagues--I see the Senator from Kentucky--\nmay have some comments about the interest on the debt and what he views \nas a threat to our economy and our security.\n  Mr. PAUL. From that same article, it is interesting that he talks \nabout what happens if interest rates rise. For every point of an \ninterest rate rising, it adds $140 billion. So he talks about getting \nback to the historic average of 5.4 percent, that over 10 years it \nwould add $4.9 trillion to our debt problem. But here is the rub. We \nare having discussions where people are saying we are going to cut $2.5 \ntrillion over 10 years. Senator Hatch points out we cannot bind future \nCongresses. Senator Lee said the same thing. So when they promise us \nthat they are going to cut $2.5 trillion, compare that to what happens \nif interest rates rise. One, we\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\ncan't bind future Congresses, but if interest rates rise, all of a \nsudden we have $5 trillion in extra expenses.\n  We must bind future Congresses and we must bind ourselves by amending \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I couldn't agree more with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. This is the silent but potentially deadly threat to our \nwhole economy. If interest rates were to go up, if China purchases more \nof our debt, they are not going to buy it at current rates; we are \ngoing to have to offer a better rate of return.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So I join my colleagues in supporting the balanced budget \namendment. I look forward to the vote on this amendment--sometime \nduring the week of July 18 I think we are shooting for. We invite our \ncolleagues on the other side to join us. The reason we are here today \nis because it is important to let the people across the country know \nwhat we are doing, the solution we are proposing, and to ask them to \nencourage other Senators and Congressmen to support it because this is \nthe single most important thing we could do to get our economy back on \ntrack and to save generations in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague for those cogent \nremarks.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven, knows a thing or two \nabout balancing budgets. As a former Governor, he knows this is \nsomething States have to do every day. Governors and legislatures \nbalance their books by making the tough decisions the Federal \nGovernment is too often unwilling to make.\n  So I yield the remaining time to my friend and colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Hoeven.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank my esteemed colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, for taking the lead on this balanced budget \namendment. I am pleased to join him, pleased to be one of the original \ncosponsors, and I am extremely pleased every member of the Republican \ncaucus--all 47 Senators are supporting this balanced budget amendment \nand doing everything we can to reach across the aisle and bring our \nDemocratic colleagues with us and then to send this balanced budget \namendment to a vote--to pass this balanced budget amendment by a two-\nthirds vote--and then send it out to the States for ratification. \nThree-fourths of the States would have to ratify it as well. I believe \nthey will.\n  What a great way for us to join together at the Federal and State \nlevel to make sure we live within our means, that we balanced our \nbudget, that we do the things we need to do to not only get this \neconomy back on track but to make sure future generations can enjoy the \ngreat country, the great opportunity we and those who have gone before \nus have enjoyed in the United States of America. We have that \nopportunity. We need to seize that opportunity by passing this balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  As the senior Senator from Utah correctly mentioned just a minute \nago, I had the opportunity--the great honor and privilege--to serve my \nState as Governor. As a matter of fact, at the time I was elected to \nthe Senate, last year, I was the longest serving Governor in the United \nStates. I served for a decade. Every single year we balanced our \nbudget.\n  Madam President, 49 of the 50 States have some form of balanced \nbudget requirements. The only one that does not is Vermont. Forty-nine \nStates have that requirement. This year, so far, 46 of the States are \nexpected to balance their budgets.\n  Families balance their budgets. Businesses have to balance their \nbudgets. Cities have to balance their budgets. States have to balance \ntheir budgets. The Federal Government needs to balance its budget. It \nis not doing that.\n  When we look at the statistics--we have gone through them before, but \nthese statistics we have to continue to talk about; our current \nsituation is something we have to continue to talk about with the \nAmerican people--right now, our revenues are $2.2 trillion. The annual \nrevenues to the Federal Treasury, $2.2 trillion. Our expenses are $3.7 \ntrillion. That is about a $1.5 trillion, 1.6 trillion deficit each and \nevery year.\n  When we roll that up, that is why we are now at $14.5 trillion in \ndebt, and that debt continues to grow. But it is similar to any debt, \nas any family can tell us or any business can tell us or any State can \ntell us, that as we continue to accumulate and grow that deficit and \naccumulate that debt, it gets harder and harder to get on top of it. It \nis akin to having credit cards. As one continues to charge and add to \nthat balance on the credit card, it gets more and more difficult to get \non top of that debt and deficit and reduce it.\n  So we have to get started. We have to get going. The task gets \nharder, not easier. That is what the balanced budget amendment is all \nabout. We need the President to lead. When we talk about getting this \ndebt under control, we need the President to lead. We cannot have a \nsituation where we spend more and then simply borrow more or try to \nraise taxes to cover that spending. That is making it worse. We need \nthis administration to join us. We need our colleagues to join us, to \nget a grip on this spending, to start by passing this balanced budget \namendment.\n  If we look back to the decade of the 1980s and then into the 1990s \nand we look at President Reagan and his approach and his leadership for \nthis country, he came and said: We have the most dynamic economy in the \nhistory of the world, so we have to create an environment, a pro-jobs, \npro-growth environment that stimulates job creation, that stimulates \nprivate investment, that puts people back to work, that gets this \neconomy growing. As we get that economy growing, we have the resources \nthen to do the things we need to do: to invest in infrastructure, to \nmake sure we take care of those who need help, to make sure we have \nhealth care for our citizens. But at the same time--at the same time--\nwe need to control our spending and live within our means. That is the \nrising tide that lifts all boats. That is how we make sure everybody \nparticipates in the great opportunity that is the very foundation of \nthis country.\n  But to get back to that point, we need this balanced budget \namendment. We need this fiscal discipline in Washington to make sure we \ncontinue to honor the legacy we have, the legacy we have been given, \nand that we continue to make this country the country of opportunity. I \nknow we can do it.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership in this effort, and \nI thank my colleagues for joining together on this balanced budget \namendment. I ask all our colleagues to join with us so we can pass it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 1 additional minute and to give the other side an \nadditional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  I thank my colleagues. They have made some very prescient points on \nhow important this balanced budget amendment is.\n  By the President's own Actuary, by 2020, our national debt will be \nover $20 trillion. The interest alone will be over $1 trillion. We will \nnot have any money for the poor, the sick, and the needy because we \nhave not lived within our means. We simply have to get spending under \ncontrol. The only way to do that is to do what all these 49 States have \nto do every year; that is, balance our budget through a requisite \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Let me make one last point; that is, I do not know why the \nDemocrats--some Democrats--fight against this. Because literally, even \nif we pass it through both Houses of Congress by the requisite two-\nthirds vote, there is still going to be a big battle in the States, and \nif they hate it, they can fight it out there in the States.\n  I think the reason they fight it is they know if we pass it here, it \nis going to pass through the States very fast because almost every \nState knows what we have to do. Almost everybody of intelligence knows \nwhat we have to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4171-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             SHORT MEMORIES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, just listening to my good friend from \nUtah speaking--and he is a good friend of mine--and others who have \nbeen speaking for the last half hour, memories are short, very short--I \nmean very short. Forget about the attention span. Memories are very \nshort. How soon we forget that at the end of the Clinton years, after \nwe had worked with President Clinton to pass measures that brought in \nmore revenues that kept our spending under control, we had 4 years of \nbalanced budgets--4 years--not only of balanced budgets but budget \nsurpluses.\n  When President Clinton left office, he left George W. Bush the \nbiggest surplus ever in our history. CBO said if we just continued on \nwith the policies we had, we would have paid off the national debt by \n2010. But what did the Republicans do? They came riding into town in \n2001. They got the White House. They got the Senate. They got the \nHouse. What did they do? They took that surplus we had and said: Hey, \nwe have to give this to the wealthy. We have to have tax cuts for the \nwealthiest in our society. That is what they did. How did they do it? \nThey snuck it through on something called reconciliation--a budget \nmeasure which means we cannot filibuster it, and it only takes 50 \nvotes. That is what the Republicans did. They squandered it--squandered \nit--to give more to the wealthiest in our society. Look what has \nhappened since then.\n  Then we had two unpaid-for wars. George Bush got us in those wars. \nDon't pay for them; we will just borrow it from China, borrow it from \nother countries. Then a new prescription drug benefit, unpaid for. We \nwill just borrow more money.\n  Now these same Republicans who ran up the deficit, squandered the \nsurplus, are now saying we have to balance the budget on the backs of \nthe middle class. We have to balance the budget on those who already \nare hurting so much. But, no, we cannot raise revenues on the wealthy. \nOh, no. No, no, we cannot do that.\n  As I said, memories are short. They all want a balanced budget \namendment now. Why don't we do what we did under the Clinton years? \nLet's have the same kind of economic policies we had then? Then we will \nhave balanced budgets. But, no, not my Republican friends. No. They say \nthey want to limit government spending to 18 percent of GDP. I would \nlike to ask: Where does that number come from? Why is it 18 percent? \nWhy isn't it 18.5 percent? Why isn't it 17.75 percent? Why isn't it \n19.23 percent? Where does 18 percent come from?\n  Let me tell you where this comes from. The last time the Federal \nGovernment was 18 percent of GDP spending was 1967, before Medicare got \nunderway. So read between the lines what the Republicans are saying: If \nthey could get that down to 18 percent, they can do away with Medicare, \nwhich is what they want to do anyway. The Republicans want to do away \nwith Medicare. If we can get the Federal Government's role of spending \ndown to 18 percent, we are back where we were in 1967. Guess what. We \ncan get rid of Medicare and turn it back over to the private insurance \ncompanies. That is what the Ryan budget did. That is what the \nRepublican budget did. That is what they all voted for.\n  So when they tell us about 18 percent of GDP, think Medicare. Think \nMedicare. Goodbye Medicare. That is what they are after.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4171-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4171-S4173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BOLD VISIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we have reached a point of maximum \ndanger--maximum danger--in our fragile economic recovery. We are mired \nwith the most protracted period of joblessness since the Great \nDepression. Businesses are reluctant to invest and hire for the simple \nreason there is not sufficient demand for goods and services, largely \nbecause--why--so many people are unemployed, 20 million. People are \nmired in debt. Even those who are working are insecure about their \nemployment. So for most Americans in the middle class and lower income, \nthis is still a deep recession.\n  I have come to the floor repeatedly in recent weeks to warn against \nthe folly--the folly--of Washington's current obsession with making \nimmediate Draconian cuts to the Federal budget, something that by its \nvery nature will drain demand, reduce growth, and destroy jobs.\n  The Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Ben Bernanke, warned just last \nweek:\n\n       In light of the weakness of the recovery, it would be best \n     not to have a sudden and sharp fiscal consolidation in the \n     very near term. It would be a negative for growth.\n\n  Here in the Washington bubble, many--especially those on the opposite \nside of the aisle--have persuaded themselves that the biggest issue is \nthe budget deficit. But outside the beltway, outside Washington, \nAmericans are most concerned with a far more urgent deficit: the jobs \ndeficit.\n  I am also concerned about a third deficit that I think we have: a \ndeficit of vision. I am disturbed by our failure to confront the \ncurrent economic crisis with the boldness and the vision that earlier \ngenerations of Americans summoned in times of national challenge.\n  Our Republican friends reject the very possibility that the Federal \nGovernment can act to spur economic growth, boost competitiveness, and \ncreate good middle-class jobs. That is their ideological position, and \nthey are sticking to it, even in the face of contrary facts. It is \nbased on a profound misreading or perhaps nonreading of American \nhistory.\n  As Americans, we pride ourselves on our robust free enterprise \nsystem. But there are some things--big national undertakings--that the \nprivate sector simply is not capable of doing. At critical junctures, \ngoing back to the beginning of our Republic, the Federal Government has \nstepped to the plate. We have acted decisively to spur economic growth, \nfoster innovation, and create jobs.\n  So let's go back. Let's do a little analysis of our history.\n  The Founding Fathers are very much in vogue these days, so let's go \nback to that time. Let's go back to Alexander Hamilton, a hero of the \nRevolutionary War, our first Treasury Secretary. In 1791 Hamilton \npresented the Congress the landmark report on manufacturers, a set of \npolicies designed to strengthen our new economy.\n  His plan was adopted by Congress. It included tariffs to raise \nrevenue and to protect our domestic manufacturing base. Hamilton's plan \nwas a historic success. It was echoed several decades later by \nCongressman Henry Clay's famous ``American System.'' In the burst of \nnationalism following the War of 1812, Clay advocated for major new \nFederal investments in infrastructure. Of course, at that time he did \nnot call it infrastructure, he called it internal improvements.\n  Clay led the Congress in raising new revenues to finance subsidies \nfor roads, canals, bridges, and projects designed to expand commerce \nand knit the Nation together. One of those internal improvements was \nthe Cumberland Road, our first truly national road. It began in \nMaryland and stretched over the Alleghenies more than 600 miles to \nIllinois. It was Henry Clay of Kentucky and other westerners who pushed \nto extend the road from Wheeling, WV, to Columbus, OH.\n  But, again, go back and read your history. Clay was bitterly opposed \nby those who said the Federal Government could not afford to build the \nroads and canals and had no business doing so. It sounds familiar to \nwhat I am hearing on the other side of the aisle today. History shows \nthat the naysayers were wrong on all counts.\n  The Cumberland Road opened the West to settlers and commerce and \ndevelopment. Of course, the most visionary 19th century advocate of \nFederal investments to spur economic growth was a Republican, the first \nRepublican President, Abraham Lincoln.\n  Despite the disruption of the Civil War, Lincoln insisted on moving \nthe Nation forward through bold Federal investments and initiatives. In \n1862 he signed the Pacific Railway Act, authorizing huge Federal land \ngrants to finance construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, one of \nthe great technological feats of the 19th century. To produce the rails \nin America rather than shipping them in from England, he enacted a \nsteep tariff on foreign steel in order to jump-start the American steel \nindustry.\n  Lincoln did much more. He created the Department of Agriculture to do \nmore research, distributed free land to\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nfarmers, and used government agents to promote new farm machinery and \nagricultural techniques. As a proud graduate of Iowa State University, \nI know Lincoln also dramatically increased higher education by creating \nthe land-grant college system.\n  Taken together, these initiatives during Lincoln's Presidency--I \nremind you, he was doing all of this during the Civil War--had a \ntransformative effect on the U.S. economy. We created new industries, \nexpanded opportunity, and created millions of new jobs. He did this \ndespite the fact that the Federal Government was deeply in debt and \nrunning huge deficits. Imagine that. Abraham Lincoln.\n  These Republicans always go to their Lincoln Day dinners. Why do they \nnot start talking about what Abraham Lincoln did to spur economic \ngrowth and create jobs in our country at a time when our Federal \nGovernment was in a deficit? It is almost humorous to imagine how the \nRepublicans of today would have reacted to Lincoln's agenda. They would \nhave attacked him, I am sure, as reckless and irresponsible. They would \nwhine that we are broke; we cannot afford to invest in the future. I am \nsure the tea party contingent in the Republican Party would have \ndemanded that Lincoln be expelled from the Republican Party.\n  Moving into the 20th century, time and again the Federal Government \nhas acted with boldness and vision to accomplish big things that were \nsimply beyond the capacity of the private sector. During the Presidency \nof Franklin Roosevelt, with the private sector paralyzed by the Great \nDepression, the Federal Government responded with an astonishing array \nof initiatives to restart the economy, restore opportunity, and create \njobs.\n  The list is far too long, but I would mention rural electrification, \nthe Civilian Conservation Corps and what they did to plant trees and \ngreenways all over America, the Tennessee Valley Authority, which \nbrought opportunity and power to the deeply impoverished Appalachia, \nHoover Dam, Grand Coulee Dam, bringing power and water across the \nSouthwest and the Northwest.\n  Millions of unemployed Americans, including my father--if you come \nover to my office, I will show you my dad's WPA card, Works Progress \nAdministration. He got a job with dignity, thanks to the Works Progress \nAdministration. They built thousands of infrastructure around our \ncountry: roads and dams and schools, bridges, many of which we are \nstill using today eight decades later.\n  I would point out one project my father worked on: Lake Ahquabi State \nPark in Iowa, which my father worked on with other WPA people to help \nbuild. We are still using it today.\n  By the end of the Second World War, wartime investments by the \nFederal Government had created an industrial colossus. FDR and Truman \nwere followed then by a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower. What \ndid he do? Did he pull the plug on all of this? Well, let's look at \nhistory.\n  Eisenhower, a proud Republican, was determined to move America \nforward. He championed, at a time when the Federal deficits continued \ninto the 1950s from World War II--because the national debt grew so big \nduring World War II, we were still in debt during the 1950s. What did \nEisenhower do? Did he say we have to retrench; we cannot do anything? \nNo. He championed one of the greatest public works projects in American \nhistory, the construction of the Interstate Highway System.\n  The National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 ensured \ndedicated Federal funding to build a network today that encompasses \nover 46,000 miles of highways. A 1996 study of the system concluded:\n\n       The interstate highway system is an engine that has driven \n     40 years of unprecedented prosperity and positioned the \n     United States to remain the world's preeminent power into the \n     21st century.\n\n  Well, you know what. I will bet the tea party contingent of today's \nRepublican Party would probably have tried to run Dwight Eisenhower out \nof the Republican Party.\n  In more recent times, the Federal Government has funded and \nspearheaded scientific discovery and innovation that has had a profound \nimpact on our economy and created millions of high-value jobs.\n  Now, I know my time is limited. I want to mention a couple. It was \nthe Federal Government--specifically the Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency, called DARPA--that created the Internet. No, I am \nsorry, my young friends, it was not Google; and it was not Microsoft, \nalthough Bill Gates built a great empire. It was the Federal Government \nthat created the Internet, making possible everything we get from e-\nmail to social networking. Need I mention tweeting and the World Wide \nWeb? This has revolutionized the way we do business, not only here but \naround the globe, and has created untold millions of jobs. It was not a \nprivate company; it was the Federal Government amassing the money that \npeople pay in taxes to create the Internet.\n  Federal researchers at this same agency also created the global \npositioning satellite system, GPS. When you get in your car, you need \nto know where to go. You follow all of that. You think Garmin invented \nthat? No. But the Garmin company and all of the rest of them--I should \nnot single one out; there are a lot of competitors out there--are \nmaking the instruments. They are hiring people. The private sector is \ndoing what it should do. But it was the Federal Government that created \nthe global positioning satellite. It was taxpayers' dollars that put \nthose 24 satellites in orbit and still keep them operating today.\n  Researchers at NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, have made dozens of technological breakthroughs over \nthe years, everything from microchips to CAT scanner technology. Of \ncourse, in a discussion of the Federal Government's role in stimulating \nthe economy, we have to mention the staggering achievements of the \nNational Institutes of Health. More than 80 Nobel Prizes have been \nawarded for NIH-supported research.\n\n  Bear in mind too that unless basic research in biomedical sciences is \nfunded by the Federal Government, most of it simply will not get done. \nWhy? Because it is basic research. It is basic. It may not lead to \nsomething. A lot of it leads to dead ends. But the basic research is \ndone. The applied research is built on that. The private sector then \ncomes in, adapts it for drugs and interventions, and we spur the \neconomy and we make people healthier.\n  The economic impact of NIH has been profound. Take one example, the \nHuman Genome Project, mapping and sequencing the entire human gene. The \nFederal Government invested $3.8 billion in mapping and sequencing the \nhuman gene. Just last month, the Battelle Memorial Institute issued a \nreport on the economic impact of the genomic revolution launched by \nthis project.\n  Battelle estimates that as of 2010 the return on investment of the \nproject, $3.8 billion; the return on investment total, $796 billion. \nThe project has created an estimated 310,000 jobs and $244 billion in \npersonal income. In 2010 alone, just 1 year, the project generated $67 \nbillion in economic output.\n  The Federal Government, folks; the Federal Government did that. So in \nlight of these statistics and the historical records I have just cited \nto the founding of our Republic, it is absurd to claim that the Federal \nGovernment cannot play a positive and even a profound role in boosting \nthe economy, in spurring innovation, in creating jobs, and improving \nthe standard of living of our people.\n  Republicans protest that Federal investments and innovation and \nresearch are about the government picking winners and losers. I hear \nthat all the time. The truth is, initiatives such as the Human Genome \nProject are not about picking winners and losers. That is making all of \nus winners.\n  It is about the Federal Government stepping to the plate to undertake \nbig, important national projects that the private sector is simply not \nequipped to do. At times of crisis such as during the Great Depression, \nand in the aftermath of the financial meltdown of 2008, the Federal \nGovernment has acted boldly to rescue the economy when the private \nsector was flat on its back and unable to function normally.\n  The Recovery Act passed by Congress soon after President Obama took \noffice has manifestly succeeded in jump-starting economic activity. \nListening to all of my Republican friends, they say the Recovery Act \nfailed. It failed. It failed. Well, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, through the\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nend of 2010 the Recovery Act raised the real inflation-adjusted gross \ndomestic product by as much as 3.5 percent and increased the number of \nemployed Americans by as many as 3.3 million. But today the shot in the \narm provided by the Recovery Act is winding down.\n  Quite frankly, we did not put enough in the Recovery Act to stretch \nit out for a longer period of time. The economy is still struggling. \nOur Democratic majority in this body has brought to the floor a series \nof job-creating bills, but Republicans have filibustered and killed \nevery single one.\n  So I repeat. Yes, we face a large budget deficit. Yes, we have to \naddress it in the intermediate and long term. In the immediate term we \nneed to confront the jobs deficit. But we also face a deficit of a \npositive vision--a positive vision. We have failed to meet the \nchallenges of our day with the boldness and the vision that our \npredecessors summoned in times past.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes remains for the \nDemocratic side collectively.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will just take about 3 more minutes.\n  Many Republicans are demanding that we permanently hobble the Federal \nGovernment, just as our predecessors did not want to build the roads \nand the highways and the canals in the past.\n  My friend from Utah had a chart that said ``broke or balanced.'' They \nclaim our Nation is poor and broke. That is not true. That is not true. \nThat negative, defeatist viewpoint is dead wrong. We remain the \nwealthiest Nation on Earth, with the highest per capita income of any \nmajor country on the face of the globe. But we have to act decisively, \nwith the power of the Federal Government to boost the economy, foster \ninnovation, and create good middle-class jobs. That is the most \nimportant thing.\n\n  Lastly, balanced budget? Let's just do what we did under the Clinton \nyears, in which we had 4 years of balanced budgets and left the biggest \nsurplus in our Nation's history. But the Republicans will not do that \nbecause they have a defeatist attitude. We need a more bold vision than \nwhat the Republicans bring forward to the American people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4173-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4173-S4174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMBATING MILITARY COUNTERFEITS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, our Nation asks a lot of our troops. \nIn return, we must give them the best possible equipment to fulfill \ntheir vital missions and come home safely. We have a powerful \nobligation to them to ensure the proper performance of weapons systems, \nbody armor, aircraft parts, and countless other mission-critical \nproducts.\n  Today, however, America's military faces a significant and growing \nthreat from counterfeit products entering the military supply chain.\n  I rise to speak about a bill I have introduced with Senator McCain, \nSenator Graham, and Senator Coons: the Combating Military Counterfeits \nAct of 2011. This bill will enhance the ability of prosecutors to keep \ncounterfeit goods out of the military supply chain. In so doing it will \nhelp protect America's Armed Forces from the risk of defective \nequipment.\n  These counterfeit products do not meet military standards. As a \nresult, they put troops' lives at risk, compromise military readiness, \nand cost the country enormous sums in replacement costs.\n  In the case of microelectronics, counterfeit parts also provide an \navenue for cybersecurity threats to infiltrate military systems, \npossibly enabling hackers to track or even disable crucial national \nsecurity applications.\n  With troops from Rhode Island and all over the United States serving \noverseas in Iraq and Afghanistan, we cannot accept criminals selling \nfake versions of products used by our troops. Unfortunately, however, \nthis unacceptable threat to troop safety and national security is \ngrowing.\n  A report by the Government Accountability Office provides examples \nthat demand stiff criminal punishment. It explains that the Defense \nDepartment found out in testing that what it thought was Kevlar body \narmor was in fact nothing of the sort and could not protect our troops \nthe way proper Kevlar can. Our troops going out on patrol in fake body \narmor is simply unacceptable.\n  In another example, a supplier sold the Defense Department a part \nthat it falsely claimed was a $7,000 circuit that met the \nspecifications of a missile guidance system. Military grade chips are \ncalled that for a reason: they are required to withstand extreme \ntemperature, force, and vibration. Chips that don't meet those \nspecifications are prone to fail; for example, when a jet is at high \naltitude, when a missile is launching, or when a GPS unit is out in the \nrugged field. The possible consequences of such equipment failing are \ndire.\n  A January 2010 study by the Commerce Department quoted a Defense \nDepartment official as estimating that counterfeit aircraft parts were \n``leading to a 5 to 15 percent annual decrease in weapons system \nreliability.''\n  The Commerce Department study, which surveyed military manufacturers, \ncontractors, and distributors, reported approximately 2\\1/2\\ times as \nmany incidents of counterfeit electronics in 2008 as in 2005. The high \nprice of military grade products is going to attract more and more \ncounterfeiters.\n  On a related matter, one source of the problem has been the often \nillegal dumping of U.S. electronic waste in countries such as China. \nBusiness Week reported in 2010 that used computer chips from old \npersonal computers are fraudulently remarked in China as ``military \ngrade'' chips and sold to U.S. military suppliers. A bill I introduced \nlast week, the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act, would help \naddress that issue by cracking down on the profligate dumping of \nelectronic waste.\n  We should also evaluate this combating military counterfeits bill in \nthe context of the relentless cyber attacks America weathers every day. \nThe chip might not only be counterfeit, it might be the carrier for \ndangerous viruses and malware that may create windows our enemies can \nenter to sabotage our military equipment or to steal our military \nsecrets.\n  I applaud those of my colleagues who have worked with the Department \nof Defense to ensure that it can keep counterfeits out of the supply \nchain.\n  I particularly appreciate the leadership of Chairman Carl Levin and \nRanking Member John McCain of the Armed Services Committee. I am also \npleased that the administration, and particularly its intellectual \nproperty enforcement coordinator, Victoria Espinel, is working hard to \nprotect our military from counterfeits. I am also pleased that the \nNational Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center recently \nbegan Operation Chain Reaction, a new initiative targeting counterfeit \nitems entering the military supply chain.\n  I strongly believe that strengthened criminal provisions should be \npart of our strategy going forward. As a former U.S. attorney I know \nthe significant deterrent effect criminal sanctions can provide.\n  The Department of Justice has a vital role to play in using criminal \ninvestigations and prosecutions to identify and deter trafficking in \ncounterfeit military goods.\n  To that end, the administration has endorsed increasing penalties for \ntrafficking in counterfeit military goods as part of recent \nrecommendations to Congress for better protecting American intellectual \nproperty. I am glad the administration has recognized the need for \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with them to see the \nnecessary changes made.\n  Our laws currently do not impose any special punishment for \ntrafficking in counterfeit military goods. 18 U.S.C, section 2320, the \ncounterfeit trafficking statute, provides heightened penalties for \ntrafficking and counterfeits that result in bodily injury or death. But \nout on the battlefield it is not clear that the part will ever be \nrecovered, and it is impossible sometimes to tell them the counterfeit \ncaused the bodily injury or death.\n  As a result, traffickers in military counterfeits are less likely to \nface penalties that reflect the unacceptable\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nrisk their counterfeits impose on our soldiers, our military readiness, \nour cybersecurity, and our national security.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators McCain, Graham, \nand Coons addresses this inadequacy in our laws. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in seeing it passed into law soon. Traffickers should pay a \nheavy price if they knowingly sell the military a piece of counterfeit \nbody armor that could fail in combat, a counterfeit missile control \nsystem that could short-circuit at launch, or a counterfeit GPS that \ncould fail on the battlefield. Our troops deserve Kevlar that is \nKevlar, and military grade chips that are military grade.\n  By creating an enhanced offense for an individual who traffics in \ncounterfeits and knows that the counterfeit product either is intended \nfor military use or is identified as meeting military standards, this \nbill will help. It doubles the statutory maximum penalty for such \noffenses, and it directs the sentencing commission to update the \nsentencing guidelines as appropriate to reflect Congress's intent that \ntrafficking in counterfeit military items be punished sufficiently to \ndeter this wrongful endangerment of our servicemembers.\n  The bill targets only particularly malicious offenders--those who \nalready are guilty of trafficking in counterfeit goods and know they \nare selling military counterfeits.\n  This approach means the bill will not affect legitimate military \ncontractors who might be unaware that a counterfeit chip has been \nentered into one of their products. It will not apply to makers of \nproducts that unintentionally fall short of military specifications. \nThis bill is intended to help military suppliers by deterring the \ncriminals who sell counterfeits to them or to their subcontractors. \nManufacturers, such as the many high-tech innovators in Rhode Island, \nwill actually benefit from the protection of their intellectual \nproperty.\n  I am grateful to have the support of the Chamber of Commerce, the \nSemiconductor Industry Association, the International Anti-\nCounterfeiting Coalition, and others. I look forward to working with \nthem and other interested stakeholders to make this legislation as \neffective as possible at deterring this particularly reprehensible form \nof criminal activity.\n  Let me close by thanking Senator Graham, Senator McCain, and Senator \nCoons for joining me in introducing this bill today. As my colleagues \nknow, Senator McCain and Senator Graham both have long stood out as \nchampions for our troops. Senator Coons has already become a staunch \ndefender of our national security and our Nation's intellectual \nproperty.\n  I very much look forward to working with them and other colleagues on \nthis important bill.\n  All of us in the Senate have the privilege of visiting with and \nsupporting our troops. We all know the sacrifices they make for our \ncountry. We all want to do everything we can to ensure that their \nequipment functions properly and that counterfeits do not compromise \nour Nation's military readiness or security. Passing the Combating \nMilitary Counterfeits Act of 2011 will be a valuable step toward these \nimportant goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4174-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 679, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 679) to reduce the number of executive positions \n     subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       DeMint amendment No. 501, to repeal the authority to \n     provide certain loans to the International Monetary Fund, the \n     increase in the United States quota to the Fund, and certain \n     other related authorities, and rescind related appropriated \n     amounts.\n       Portman modified amendment No. 509, to strike the \n     provisions relating to the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) \n     of the Navy, the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of the \n     Army, and the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of the Air \n     Force, the chief financial officer positions, and the \n     Controller of the Office of Management and Budget.\n       DeMint amendment No. 511, to enhance accountability and \n     transparency among various Executive agencies.\n       Toomey/Vitter amendment No. 514, to strike the provision \n     relating to the Governors and alternate governors of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order for the votes to begin at 11 a.m., \nthere now be 10 minutes equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees prior to the votes; further, that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided between the votes; finally, that all rollcall votes \nafter the first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will take the 5 minutes on our side.\n  Madam President, I rise and join my colleagues in strong support of \nthe nominations reform package before us today. This bipartisan bill \nand resolution which we will vote on a bit later will effectively \nchange the way the Senate does business, and it is long past time to do \njust that. It is not often that this body voluntarily takes steps to \ncurb its own power. But for the good of our democracy, the Senate must \nbecome more efficient.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Lamar Alexander, who \nhas been a driving force behind this effort and has been steadfast in \nhis resolve to make a change to this body. We have worked in a \nbipartisan way to resolve all the differences in a way that I would \nhope the Senate could work more often on more pieces of legislation.\n  I also thank the chair and ranking members of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, Senators Lieberman and Collins, for their input and \nexpertise in drafting this piece of legislation and moving it quickly \nand productively through committee. Their impact on this process cannot \nbe understated.\n  I thank Senator Reid, the majority leader, and the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell. Back in January, when we were negotiating the \nreforms to the body, they set up our working group to look into the \nproblem of executive nominations, and they supported and were an active \npart of our effort.\n  The Senate has always been known as a cooling saucer, but as of late \nit has become a subzero freezer. Nominees of impeccable qualifications \nand indisputable support have been frozen out of the confirmation \nprocess, and the backup in nominations also gridlocks other important \nlegislative business. That is why the Senate, often known as the \ncooling saucer, is too often now a subzero freezer.\n  Today, we will be taking a meaningful and important step toward \nchanging this. The rapid growth of the executive branch has put \nunanticipated burdens on the Senate, whose job it is to confirm the \nPresident's appointees. There is nothing wrong with the Senate doing a \nlittle prioritizing of its pending business.\n  Today, about one-third of the current Senate confirmable positions \nwill now either not require confirmation at all or will enjoy a \nstreamlined confirmation. By now we all know what S. 679 and S. Res. \n116 do, but what will their impact be?\n  In short, this package of reform will help our government function \nbetter. One example of this is the working group that the bill creates \nto examine a ``smart form'' to streamline the paperwork submitted by a \nnominee. A nominee may now, today, have to complete three separate \nfinancial disclosure forms for the executive and legislative branches. \nHopefully, the idea of not having to fill out mountains of paperwork \nwill be appealing to prospective government servants.\n  Additionally, this bill and resolution we are voting on will help the \nSenate focus more like a laser beam on issues affecting the average \nAmerican, such as jobs. The less time committees have to spend on \nnominees, the more time they can spend on improving the everyday life \nof Americans.\n  Over the last several decades we have seen an amazing increase in the \nnominees we have had to confirm. It has gotten out of hand, and that is \nsomething on which both sides can agree.\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\n  We are not abdicating our advice and consent duty, we are \nstrengthening it. We are focusing on the positions that truly need it \naccording to the Constitution.\n  This package represents the final piece to the reform deal that was \nset forth in January.\n  Last spring, motivated by the good work of Senator Tom Udall of New \nMexico, the Rules Committee undertook a detailed examination of the \nhistory and the application of the Senate rules, especially the \nfilibuster.\n  After six hearings, and many conversations, we reached a historic \npoint in January when something needed to be done.\n  Change happens slowly, we all know that, particularly in the Senate, \nand sometimes it is a product of compromise and deliberation. We all \nknow this institution, as grand and wonderful as it is, could always \nbenefit by change. Today, we have some of that change. Is it everything \nwe want? No, far from it. But it will make a difference in the \ninstitution's effectiveness.\n  I wish, for a minute, to thank the chairs of our Senate committees \nand the ranking members as well. When we first spoke of this back in \nJanuary to the introduction of the bill in March, through markup and \nnow today, the chairmen have had a great impact on our efforts. We have \nlistened to them and made changes they have suggested which, on \nreflection, we thought were worthwhile. We have listened to both the \nchairmen and ranking members, understood their positions, and wanted \ntheir ideas. All the while, however, they understood what we were \nattempting to do, and we appreciate their support.\n  In conclusion, before final passage of this bill, we will be voting \non four amendments. It is our hope we can adopt Senators Portman, \nUdall, and Cornyn's amendment and Senator Toomey's amendment by voice \nvote. At the same time, I encourage my colleagues to vote against the \ntwo amendments offered by Senator DeMint. One of the amendments he has \noffered would have harmful consequences if passed and could disrupt how \nthe IMF does business. The other, while couched in transparency, \nessentially removes legislative affairs and public affairs positions \nfrom the bill. We have already agreed to remove the legislative affairs \npositions. The Senate should have some say in determining who is going \nto give information the Senate and others need, but we don't think the \npublic affairs positions should have to go through Senate confirmation. \nAll of these spokespeople report to Senate-confirmed individuals, where \nwe have oversight. So we don't agree with that half of Senator DeMint's \nproposal.\n  I wish once again to thank my colleague and friend Senator Alexander. \nI wish also to thank Senators Lieberman and Collins. In a few minutes, \nwe will vote on final passage of S. 679 and S. Res. 116, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make a strong statement for \nmore effective government by voting aye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Schumer for his \nleadership, as well as Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman. I will \nmake my full remarks following the vote, but I do want to say this bill \nhelps the Senate do its job under the Constitution. Article 2, section \n2 tells us to designate those persons where we do not give advice and \nconsent. We are reducing that total by 169, we are expediting about 272 \nmore, and we are removing about 2,600 from the officer corps.\n  This is a good example of bipartisan work here, and I want to thank \nmy colleagues for improving the bill, amending it, and pointing out \nthings to us that needed to be changed. One of those individuals has \nbeen Senator DeMint, and I yield the remainder of our time before the \nvote to Senator DeMint to speak on his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 501\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Collins, for their leadership on this issue. It is good to \nsee Democrats and Republicans working together on something.\n  Unfortunately, like many of the things we work on, we are dealing \nwith symptoms of a much deeper problem that we fail to recognize. The \nreason we have gone from a few hundred confirmations during President \nKennedy's time to thousands today is because of the incredible \nexponential growth of the Federal Government--new departments \neverywhere, where we have new positions that have to be filled with \nnominees who are confirmed by the Senate. Rather than look at the \nbehemoth we have created, we are moving to make it somewhat less \naccountable.\n  I appreciate the rationale behind this, but I do think we have to \nrecognize when we are treating symptoms and not solving the problem. \nThe problem has led to much of the debt, the spending and an out-of-\ncontrol Congress and congressional interventions, because all of these \nagencies invade on the private sector. But I do appreciate the \nopportunity to speak and to offer an amendment.\n  The amendment we will be voting on in a few minutes does relate to \nthe International Monetary Fund. This is a fund set up years ago to \nhelp struggling poor nations that get themselves in trouble. The United \nStates has been the largest contributor for years. But the IMF has gone \nfrom being an international agency that helped in a limited number of \ndifficult situations to one that is now huge; that has access to \nAmericans' general fund. That is what I want to talk about today.\n  My amendment would deauthorize what we did in 2009 to open our bank \naccount to bailouts all over the world. Americans have gotten plenty \ntired of our spending and our borrowing, and particularly the bailouts \nthey have seen from Washington and how these bailouts have not worked \nbut often made things worse. The international bailout fund is the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  In 2009, this Congress passed an additional $100 billion credit line \nto the International Monetary Fund. This can be drawn on without any \ncongressional approval, without the President's approval. It is an open \ncheckbook, in effect, that the International Monetary Fund can use, and \nthey will use, during these difficult times, as we see irresponsible \nnations such as Greece that need international funds to continue their \nprofligate spending.\n  We must deauthorize this. Our country is in dire straits--close to \nbankruptcy itself. The President is asking us, for the fourth time, to \nincrease the debt limit of our Nation so we can borrow another $2 \ntrillion on top of the $14 trillion we have already borrowed. We cannot \nafford to let the International Monetary Fund--which we discovered in \nthe last month has some questionable management practices--access $100 \nbillion more than they already have of our money and help bail out \ncountries all over the world that have failed to make the difficult \ndecisions.\n  Don't think for a moment this is helping the poor in other countries. \nThis is a bailout for the big banks around the world that have made \nloans to governments and now expect the International Monetary Fund to \nback them. Americans saw enough of that during our own Wall Street \nbailouts. Yet this Congress approved $100 billion more, which has not \nbeen accessed yet but is available to the International Monetary Fund \nright now without our permission. We can stop that today with this \namendment.\n  There is no excuse for giving away money around the world when we \ncannot even keep our promises here in America--promises we have made to \nour seniors and promises we have made to our veterans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I encourage my colleagues to maybe do \none responsible fiscal thing in this session of Congress and at least \nput this on hold. Let's stop this authorized $100 billion for \ninternational bailouts.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 501, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, this next amendment is about \naccountability and transparency. I thank the leadership teams on both \nsides for accepting most of the positions here for legislative affairs \nthat interface on our behalf with the administration. There are eight \nmore positions and that is all this amendment is about. They are public \naffairs positions that interface on behalf of the public with the \nadministration. Certainly we can give the public the same \naccountability and transparency we ask for ourselves. These are the \npositions within the White House. If Americans have a problem in any \narea, whether it is defense contracting, Health and Human Services, \nHUD, Labor, they call a public affairs officer. These folks need to be \naccountable to us and we need to make sure they respond to the American \npeople. There are only eight positions here that we are asking to go \nthrough the normal confirmation process.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nof Senator DeMint. Yesterday the managers' amendment, which was agreed \nto, retained the Senate confirmation requirement for the legislative \naffairs positions so the only thing we are talking about here is the \npublic affairs positions. Most of these positions in Cabinet level \ndepartments do not require Senate confirmation under our current \nprocess, and heaven help us if these public affairs people are making \npolicy. They are not. They are just the messengers.\n  We need to reserve the Senate's advice and consent process for \npolicymaking positions or those that have control over Federal funds. \nNeither of those criteria apply in this case.\n  I urge the rejection of the DeMint amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

There is 2 minutes, equally \ndivided, on debate for the Toomey amendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I believe there is agreement on this \namendment on both sides. The amendment makes sense, and, therefore, I \nyield back all time on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 514) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to express my concerns \nwith S. 679, the Schumer/Alexander Presidential Appointment Efficiency \nand Streamlining Act. This bill would eliminate the Senate confirmation \nprocess for approximately 200 positions. Many of the positions proposed \nto be eliminated from the Senate process are officers dealing with \ntransparency matters, such as positions dealing with public and \ncongressional affairs, as well as officers dealing with budgetary \nmatters, such as positions dealing with finances and grant \nadministration.\n  In general, I am concerned that the legislation will eliminate the \nSenate's ability to provide its constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent for individuals tasked with performing important government \nfunctions, and would allow these positions to become more like czars \nthat are unaccountable to the people.\n  In addition, I am concerned that the legislation will impede the \nSenate's ability to conduct oversight of certain department programs, \nas well as reduce\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nSenators' ability to compel executive department and agencies to \ntestify before Congress or answer written questions. For example, DOJ \nhas a policy of not allowing line attorneys to testify before Congress, \nand the Obama Administration will not allow its czars to testify--a \npolicy that could potentially apply to these individuals.\n  Further, often the only tactic a Senator has for compelling an agency \nto produce documents or provide answers to questions is to block a \nnominee until documents or answers are produced. This is especially \ntrue when the member seeking to conduct oversight is in the minority \nparty. I have frequently employed this tactic to get documents/\ninformation from agencies, and generally have been successful when I've \nused this method in helping me with my oversight efforts.\n  As the current ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nwould like to address the positions under Judiciary Committee \njurisdiction proposed to be eliminated. Specifically, S, 679 would \neliminate the Senate confirmation process for these 10 positions under \nJudiciary Committee jurisdiction:\n\n     Assistant Attorney General, Legislative Affairs, DOJ\n     Director, Bureau of Justice Assistance, DOJ\n     Director, Bureau of Justice Statistics, DOJ\n     Director, National Institute of Justice, DOJ\n     Administrator, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n         Prevention, DOJ\n     Director, Office for Victims of Crime, DOJ\n     Deputy Director, National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP\n     Deputy Director, Demand Reduction, National Drug Control \n         Policy, ONDCP\n     Deputy Director, State and Local Affairs, National Drug \n         Control Policy, ONDCP\n     Deputy Director, Supply Reduction, National Drug Control \n         Policy, ONDCP\n\n  In addition, the Senate resolution would provide an expedited process \nfor these positions under Judiciary Committee jurisdiction:\n\n     Members (2), Foreign Claims Settlement Commission\n     Members (11), Board of Directors, State Justice Institute\n\n  I believe that all these positions be removed from the legislation. \nSpecifically with respect to the Judiciary Committee positions, I am \nconcerned that several of these positions deal with policy \nimplementation, grant administration and funding, statistics and data \ncollection, as well as transparency and accountability. The DOJ \ninspector general noted that grant management was one of the top 10 \nchallenges at DOJ. Several of these DOJ and ONDCP positions administer \nmillions of dollars in grants. In addition, several groups have raised \nconcerns because some of these positions compile data that can be \nskewed and distorted to support policy goals.\n  Prior nominees for some of these positions were opposed or withdrawn \nbecause they were not qualified. Further, I and others have blocked \nseveral of the nominees for these positions in the past to force \nagencies to comply with document production requests or to compel \nanswers to my questions.\n  In addition to my concerns with the positions under Judiciary \nCommittee jurisdiction, there are other committee jurisdiction \npositions in this legislation that I have a problem relinquishing my \nability to review.\n  The bottom line is that S. 679 would hamper the Senate's ability to \nconduct effective oversight of the executive branch's programs. S. 679 \nwould allow the Senate to relinquish its constitutional \nresponsibilities of advice and consent in filling Federal offices, \ndiminish the Senate's oversight duties, and make the executive branch \nless transparent and accountable to the people. While a few positions \nhave been struck from the bill as reported out of Committee, like the \nAssistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the DOJ, the \nother DOJ and ONDCP positions remain in the legislation and will now \nnot be required to undergo Senate review. For the reasons I have just \ndiscussed, I will oppose this bill.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, at a time of staggering deficits, \ndangerously high debt, and lagging economic growth, I oppose S. 679, \nthe Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011.\n  Our Nation is borrowing $4 billion a day with no end in sight and we \nhave already hit our $14.3 trillion statutory debt limit. Sadly, my \nState of Florida struggles with a 10.6 percent unemployment rate, far \nhigher than the national average of 9.1 percent. At a time when \nfamilies and businesses are hurting, the Senate has not passed a budget \nin over 790 days.\n  The Senate should be focused on legislation that cuts spending and \nreduces our debt, saves entitlement programs for future generations, \nreforms our complex Tax Code, and reduces the crushing weight of \nFederal regulations on job creators. S. 679 does not accomplish any of \nthese goals, and I cannot support it as our Nation careens towards \nbankruptcy and a diminished future.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, we are on the verge of passing \nlegislation that will streamline the executive branch nominations \nprocess and I want to congratulate the bill's authors--Senators Schumer \nand Alexander--for their bipartisan accomplishment and thank them for \ntheir hard work.\n  This bill--S. 679, The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011--removes about 170 non-policymaking positions \nfrom the list of Presidential appointments requiring Senate \nconfirmation--plus over 2800 members of the Public Health Service and \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, Officer Corps, \nwhose appointments and promotions are also subject to the Senate's \nadvice and consent.\n  This is not as many positions as the bill first contemplated. But it \nis a significant achievement nonetheless when you consider that the \nwork that goes into vetting nominees must be multiplied by four because \nthe White House, the Senate, the FBI and the Office of Government \nEthics, OGE, all have to conduct their own thorough background \ninvestigations.\n  So by removing 170 positions we eliminate the need for 680 separate \nbackground investigations.\n  This frees up the Senate, the White House, the FBI and OGE to focus \ntheir efforts on vetting nominations for those critical positions where \npolicy is made. And that should help speed up the vetting and \nconfirmation process for these positions as well.\n  This act also establishes an executive branch working group to study \nand report to the President and Congress on the best ways to streamline \nall the paperwork nominees are required to fill out and consider \nconsolidating it under a single ``smart form.''\n  Most nominees submit to at least four reviews, each represented by a \nseparate packet of government forms, including a White House Personal \nData Statement, questionnaires from the FBI and the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, and at least one questionnaire from the Senate \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  A ``smart form'' would be an electronic system for collecting and \ndistributing background information for nominees requiring Senate \nconfirmation that a nominee would have to fill out just once and the \ninformation would then be transferred to all the other relevant forms.\n  Before we vote, I wanted to stress the bipartisan nature of this \neffort.\n  In January, Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell \ndecided the nomination and confirmation process had become too slow and \ncumbersome and that this posed a serious national and economic security \nproblem when crucial offices go unfilled for months and months.\n  They established a working group on executive nominations and \nappointed Senators Schumer and Alexander--chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Rules Committee--to lead it.\n  Senator Collins and I are also part of that group as chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Senators Schumer and Alexander introduced their carefully crafted \nlegislation on March 30, with a bipartisan group of 15 cosponsors. And \non April 13 the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \non a bipartisan vote, reported the bill favorably to the Senate.\n  The bill was brought to the floor, debated and further changes made \nin the spirit of compromise.\n  This is the Senate at its best. A problem was identified and both \nsides of the aisle worked together to craft a solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so future \nadministrations will be able to get their teams in place more quickly \nand the Senate can focus\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nits energy on the qualifications of just the most important executive \nbranch appointments as was intended by the Constitution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I want to express my strong support \nfor the managers' amendment to S. 679, the Presidential Appointment \nEfficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011. I support this bill to make \nthe conformation process more efficient and more responsive because it \nwill enable many qualified individuals to take government positions \nwithout first going through a sometimes long and arduous confirmation \nprocess here in the Senate. I believe the confirmation process is an \nimportant constitutional duty of the Senate. But it is simply not \nneeded for every position in the U.S. Government. Not every nominee \nrequires the same level of scrutiny and process.\n  The Founders understood this issue well, as the Constitution is \nunusually precise in this regard. It specifically enables the Congress \nto do what we are doing today--to vest the appointment power for \ninferior officers with the President. And we are doing it because the \nconfirmation process has become so cumbersome that the Federal \nGovernment is losing very able and attractive candidates. The \nconfirmation process can take months, from the time the President \nsubmits a candidate's name to full consideration by the Senate. This \nlong, drawn-out process prevents the public sector from attracting some \nof the best and brightest.\n  Although I have supported the goals of S. 679 since its introduction, \na few critical changes were necessary to strengthen the bill. I, as \nwell as several of my fellow committee chairs, shared these concerns \nwith the bill's sponsors.\n  I appreciate the sponsors working to address our concerns in the \nmanagers' amendment. The amendment will still make the appointment \nprocess more efficient by taking hundreds of positions out of the \nconfirmation process. But it will also maintain Senate confirmation for \nsome key positions. The amendment will ensure Senate confirmation is \nrequired for the chief financial officer position in several agencies. \nThe CFO is a critical position, as I am constantly reminded in my own \ninteractions with one of the agencies in the Commerce Committee's \njurisdiction in recent months. The managers' amendment will also retain \nconfirmation for the Assistant Secretaries for Legislative Affairs, who \nare critical in working with Congress.\n  I congratulate Senators Schumer, Alexander, Lieberman, and Collins, \nand their staffs for their hard work on this important bill. We would \nnot be here today without their efforts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment \nand third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this will be on final passage. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Remembering Senator Richard Brevard Russell\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment--and I will be joined \nshortly by my colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia--to pay \ntribute to a great American who passed this Earth 40 years ago on \nJanuary 21, 1971. His name was Richard Brevard Russell, Jr. He was one \nof the handful of Senators everybody and every historian rates as the \nfinest of the Senate. He was a great Georgian with an interesting past.\n  He was elected to the State legislature in the 1920s and rose to be \nthe speaker of the house of representatives in the State of Georgia. He \nthen went on to be Governor of the State of Georgia from 1931 to 1932. \nDuring that time, he served as Governor at the same time another \ngentleman was serving as the Governor of New York, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. They became good friends.\n  President Roosevelt even became a constituent of Senator Russell's \nbecause, with his affliction, the springs of Warm Springs, GA, were \nwhere then-Governor, soon-to-be-President Roosevelt would come to heal \nand get better and thank his good friend, Richard Russell, for his \nsupport. It was that relationship that brought Richard Russell to be \none of the first Governors in the United States to come out and endorse \nFranklin Roosevelt to be President of the United States.\n  In his career in the Senate, Richard Russell served with Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. He served with Harry Truman--8 years side by side \nwith Harry Truman. He served under President Dwight Eisenhower. He \nserved under President John F. Kennedy. He served under Lyndon Johnson. \nIn fact, in just a minute I will explain why he made Lyndon Johnson who \nhe was. He finally passed away under Richard Nixon's first term as \nPresident of the United States. But back for a second to Richard \nRussell and Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  Lyndon Baines Johnson became the President of the Senate and later \nbecame the President of the United States. In his own works, Lyndon \nJohnson credits Richard Russell with being the strength of his career \nas a Senator. In fact, so great was Senator Russell's control of the \nSenate that in a quote by Powell Moore, his press secretary, a few \nyears ago, he said: When President Kennedy gave advice to newly elected \nSenators, he said the following:\n\n       If you want to learn how to be an effective Senator, you \n     should start by going to see Dick Russell.\n\n  That is exactly what Lyndon Johnson did.\n  So good a friend of Lyndon Johnson was Richard Russell that every \nSunday night in their careers in the Senate, Lady Bird would have \nRichard Russell over at the house to cook him dinner just to thank him \nfor what he had done the week before for Lyndon Johnson. As Lyndon \nJohnson grew in power, he kept beside him Richard Brevard Russell of \nGeorgia.\n  Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia is the greatest Senator who ever \nserved from our State. Senator Chambliss and I will be the first to \ntell you, we are way back in the back of the line when you compare our \nrecord to his record. He was a great Georgian. He was a great American.\n  When I was elected to the Senate and was asked to pick an office, I \nsaid: The only requirement I have is it be in the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding because I wanted to serve in the same building, named after \nthe greatest Senator ever to serve from our State.\n  So on the 40th anniversary of his passing, I want to leave this \nSenate floor by reminding America we had a great Senator from Georgia \nwhose lasting contribution to our country is indelible in the hearts \nand minds of our people: Richard Brevard Russell, a great American, a \ngreat Georgian, and one to whom all of us owe a great deal of thanks \nand a great deal of credit.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Isakson and appreciate \nhis eloquent remarks on one of the great American public leaders, \nRichard Russell. I am honored to be in the Russell Office Building \nmyself.\n\n\n                             Budget Crisis\n\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about where we stand now with \nthe budget crisis we are facing. We have no budget action that has been \nundertaken in the Senate. We have not done our bit. The House has \npassed a budget, a 10-year budget that is historic. It is honest. It \nwill actually change the debt trajectory of America. But the Senate has \nnot done anything.\n  Secret meetings are occurring. We are not told what is going on in \nthose meetings. The deficit is clearly the largest issue facing our \ncountry at this time, I believe. Except for matters of war, it is the \nbiggest issue, clearly, in the 14 years I have been here.\n  We are on an unsustainable path. It cannot continue. Every expert has \ntold us that. But we remain not focused in any public way on how to \nsolve it. Just meetings and leaks are occurring. Admiral Mullen, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, said that the debt is the greatest threat \nto our national security. So this extraordinary fiscal crisis is facing \nus. Yet this Chamber has done nothing about it. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every $1 we spend. In 3 months our gross debt will be larger \nthan our entire economy. Our Nation's staggering debt is already \ncosting millions of jobs because when you have a debt that is \nequivalent to 90 percent of your economy, it reduces growth by 1 \npercent. We are now at roughly 95 percent, going to 100 percent before \nthe year is out.\n  More than 22 million Americans are out of work. A majority of \nAmericans now fear the next generation will be worse off than theirs \nhas been. In just 5 weeks, we are told we will reach the firm deadline \non our Nation's $14.3 trillion debt. Then major reductions occur unless \naction is taken.\n  The Republican House has set forth their plan, but the Democratic \nSenate has not done so. This year the Senate has not produced a budget, \nhas not met to work on a budget, and has not passed a budget in 791 \ndays. We have not had a budget in 791 days. During that time we have \nincreased the debt of the United States by $3.2 trillion and have spent \nover $7 trillion.\n  On the Senate floor we spend week after week on bills that have \nlittle or nothing to do with this increasing danger to our economy. We \nname courthouses and post offices, but we do not deal with the \ngathering financial storm. Now the Senate is scheduled to take a week \noff, to go into recess to celebrate the Fourth of July, Independence \nDay. We unite as a nation on that day to celebrate our heritage and way \nof life--a way that has been earned through hard work, responsibility, \nand sacrifice.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess, I presented to the majority leader a \nletter signed by 46 Republican Senators stating that we should not \nrecess for the Memorial Day week but remain to do the work we need to \ndo on our budget and financial plan.\n  Rather than face a vote on adjournment the leader opted for a series \nof pro forma sessions where the Senate gavels in, only to gavel out \nmoments later, having once again not done any work. Rather than vote on \nit, that is what they decided to do.\n  So I renew today my request in that letter. We also owe the American \npeople an honest, open debate on the debt limit, the debt ceiling we \nhave. This should not be talks behind closed doors by only a few \nSenators, Congressmen, maybe the Speaker, the Vice President, or now \nmaybe the President. Are they the ones to decides this? Aren't we all \nelected to do so?\n  Then should we be faced with a situation in which this small group, \nhaving produced what they consider the perfect deal, brings it to the \nCongress and demands, in a period of panic and fear, that it must be \npassed without any significant amendment or the country would have a \ncrisis?\n  We have seen that before. Is that good business? I do not think so.\n  It is astonishing that we are so close now to the deadline we have \nbeen given without the Nation's President, our Chief Executive, having \nset forth a proposal on what he thinks we should do and should be \nincluded in a debt limit bill. Shouldn't the President tell us\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nthat? He presides over the executive branch. All of the Cabinet people \nwork for him. He has a 500-person Office of Management and Budget. We \nhave a small staff on the Budget Committee where I am ranking member. \nShouldn't he be providing some leadership, like Governor Christie, \nGovernor Cuomo, Governor Brown, Governor Bentley in Alabama? Shouldn't \nwe expect that?\n  The only concrete fiscal plan we have from the President is his \nFebruary budget, which proved to be the emptiest promise of all, the \nmost disappointing document. We were told by the President that his \nplan would not add more to the debt. In reality, it would grow the \ndebt, if passed, by $13 trillion, doubling the entire debt of the \nUnited States again in the next 10 years. It would spend more than \ncurrent spending projections. It would tax more and run up the debt \nmore than current expected expenditures. It is an irresponsible budget.\n  So it is this kind of rhetoric that makes those of us in the Senate \nwho are working on these issues concerned. We would need to see what \nthe proposal is and have time to evaluate it. So I am calling on the \nPresident and the Vice President to make public the proposals they \ndiscuss during these secret meetings, including the tax hikes they have \nproposed. If they believe in these tax hikes, let the American people \nsee them. Let's count up what it really means and let's evaluate them. \nMaybe there will be enough votes to pass that. I doubt it. Let the \nCongressional Budget Office provide an estimate of what the spending \nalterations and the tax alterations will be. Let the Budget Committee \nmeet to address the impact of these proposals. It is time to remove the \nblindfold.\n  Since the election in November, the Congress, divided between a \nDemocratic Senate and Republican House, has seen an increasing reliance \non closed-door meetings to resolve our greatest public challenges. In \nso doing, I think Congress has once again ignored the public will. \nUltimately, our challenges can only be solved through the Democratic \nprocess. Let's hold votes--dozens if necessary. Let's hold hearings. \nLet's have an open debate. Democracy may be messy. It may be \ncontentious. But it is the best system we have and the only system that \nworks.\n  The House Republican budget cuts $6 trillion in Federal spending over \nthe next 10 years--$6 trillion. Let's hold votes to see whether the \nDemocratic Senate is willing to reduce the spending that much. If not \n$6 trillion, than what about $5 trillion or $4 trillion?\n  The simple reality is that the American people expect us to reduce \nspending the way their cities, counties, and States are doing this very \nminute. They do not expect us to raise taxes to bail out Washington for \nreckless spending by raising taxes on the American people. Economic \nstudies show again and again that spending cuts, not tax hikes, will \nresult in greater growth and more successful debt reduction to make \nAmerica competitive in the 21st century. We need a smaller, leaner, \nefficient government, not a heavy, more burdensome Tax Code.\n  So let's have the debate. Let's have it out here in the open. And \nlet's allow the American people to participate and help decide. But \nuntil we work on a budget, until we work on the debt limit, until we \nwork on the people's business, we do not have a right to go home and \nadjourn with a looming deadline--supposedly August 2--by which \ndecisions have to be made. I believe to do so would be to fail the \npublic.\n  This debt is the largest challenge of our generation. We have to meet \nthat challenge. I don't believe it can be met by a small group of \npeople meeting in secret. We need a national discussion about the \nthreats we face. I have seen the studies in China, New Zealand. New \nZealand had 22 years of deficits. They have had 16 years of surpluses \nsince they made a national decision to get their finances in order, and \nthe economy has grown far above the world average. That is what we need \nto be doing here. That is what our States, cities, and counties are \ndoing.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. We have to rise \nto the occasion and face the defining issue of our time and put our \nNation on a path to growth and prosperity and job creation, not a path \nto decline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                 remembering senator richard b. russell\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \ncommitment of Senator Richard B. Russell to the State of Georgia and to \nour Nation.\n  Senator Russell died on January 21, 1971, 40 years ago as of this \npast winter.\n  Senator Russell devoted 50 years of his life to public service as a \nstate legislator, as Governor of Georgia, and as U.S. Senator. I take \ngreat pride in recalling before this body the lasting imprint on the \nhistory of Georgia, the U.S. Senate, and our Nation that Senator \nRussell left behind. He was a natural-born leader who had the \npersuasive ability to unite men, a quality which aided in his rapid \nrise to positions of political power. He will be remembered as the most \nprominent of politicians of his time.\n  He began service in public office early in his life, serving in the \nGeorgia House of Representatives at the age of 24. That was in 1921. \nHis composed demeanor and civil nature quickly led to his nomination \nfor Speaker of the Georgia House a few years later. He was the youngest \nSpeaker ever elected in the Georgia House. Under Russell's guidance, \nthe State of Georgia saw drastic improvements in the organization of \nState government. He went on to win the largest majority in the State's \nhistory for the election of Governor in 1931. It was in the midst of \nour Nation's most devastating economic downturn, and he was only 33 \nyears old.\n  Despite all this, he succeeded in guiding Georgia out of the Great \nDepression. Through his tremendous efforts to promote economic \ndevelopment, he was ultimately able to create a balanced budget for the \nState.\n  His time in office is recognized as being one of the most significant \neras in Georgia's history, creating economic relief for the State after \nonly 18 months in office.\n  The powerful economic impact left behind by Senator Russell is still \nfelt in Georgia today through many of the Federal facilities he brought \nto our State, as well as through the piece of legislation closest to \nSenator Russell's heart, and to my own: The National School Lunch Act.\n  He was sent to Washington by Georgians to serve in the U.S. Senate in \n1933, making him then the youngest member ever to serve in the Senate. \nSenator Russell came to be one of this body's most respected members \never. He was looked upon by his colleagues for his leadership, \nintegrity, equality and intellect. His colleague from Mississippi, \nSenator John Stennis, was once approached by a tourist, who told him he \nwould like to see the Senate and asked him how to go about it.\n  At that moment, Stennis spotted Russell walking down the other end of \nthe hall. Stennis told the tourist he could go to the Capitol to see \nthe Senate Chamber, but if he really wanted to see the Senate, he \nshould take a look at the man walking down the hall. ``He represents \nthe living embodiment of United States Senate,'' Senator Stennis said.\n  During his time in office, his powerful position as chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee aptly rendered him the label of ``Mr. \nDefense,'' a role for which he will continue to be remembered. He was \nknown as one of the Nation's leading experts on military and defense \npolicy, acting as adviser to six Presidents, valued for his knowledge \nand judgment. He was called ``a great patriot who never failed to \nfacilitate the United States when its security was an issue'' by \nPresident Nixon.\n  In a dedication speech given on this very floor 15 years ago, Senator \nSam Nunn recalled Senator Russell's ``strong belief in the independence \nand co-equal role of the Congress of the United States'' and his \n``insistence that he had not served under six Presidents, but rather \nserved with six Presidents, a real difference.''\n  Russell later served as this body's senior Senator, becoming \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, putting him fourth in line to the \nsuccession of the Presidency. But beyond all of his accomplishments, \nwhat truly set Senator Russell apart from other men was his commitment \nto civility. He demonstrated his fair and conscientious nature on many \noccasions, most notably a he presided over the 1951 dismissal hearings \nof GEN Douglas McArthur, a\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\ntime in which his judicious handling of such a volatile event did much \nto diffuse an explosive situation. He effectively navigated the \nbipartisan barriers of the Senate through his unrelenting civility and \ntrustworthiness, and, of course, his humor.\n  Once, when he was in need of a tailor, he asked his good friend, \nthen-President Johnson, for a recommendation. Johnson gave him one, so \nRussell sent his suits over to the man. When the bill arrived, he just \nstared at it, dumbfounded. ``No wonder this country is going to hell if \nthe President is willing to spend this much just to fix his suits!'' he \nexclaimed.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate in 2002, the Dean of the \nSenate at that time was Senator Robert Byrd, who sat right on the aisle \nacross the way.\n  I will never forget that the first day, as I was sworn in, I went \nover and introduced myself to Senator Byrd, who was so well respected \nby everybody on both sides of the aisle and is without question the \ngreatest historian within the Senate that the Senate has ever had, and \nhe looked up at me and said, ``You hold Senator Russell's seat.'' I \nsaid, ``Yes, sir. That's right.'' He said, ``My favorite Senator was \nSenator Richard Russell.''\n  From then on, every time I would walk by Senator Byrd's seat when he \nwas there, he would stop me and he would give me another anecdote about \nSenator Russell, about their close relationship, and about what a huge \nimpact Senator Russell had on our Nation and on this institution during \nhis 32 years of service.\n  Senator Russell devoted his life to public service with only one \ndesire: to be remembered as an honorable man. We can all agree that his \nlegacy more than fulfills that objective. His name lives on in our own \nRussell Senate Office Building and throughout the State of Georgia, \ngiving evidence to the amount of honor deservedly bestowed upon this \ngreat man. His leadership skills, his honest dealings, and his fairness \nto both sides in an argument created a remarkable representative for \nthe people he served. He was an unfailing champion in Washington, and a \nrevered statesman of Georgia for more than 38 years.\n  The epitaph on his tombstone, at his home place in Winder, GA, is a \nsimple carving: ``Richard B. Russell, Jr.--Senator from Georgia--1933-\n1971.'' Mr. President, that says it all.\n  There is only one Member of our body today who served with Senator \nRussell; that is, Senator Inouye. Senator Inouye has again, just like \nSenator Byrd, given me very many fond memories of Senator Russell.\n  It is a pleasure to serve with Senator Inouye. I wish I had the \nopportunity to serve with Senator Russell because he truly was a great \npatriot, a great American, and a great champion for this institution.\n  I believe all of us here today can learn from the life of one of the \ngreatest Senators in this body's 200 year history.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Montana Flood Heroes\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who has \nwon more Division I NCAA championships than anyone else, once said, \n``Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.'' It \ntakes teamwork to win 10 championships. I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable teamwork, championship level teamwork, that we are seeing \nback home in Montana during these floods.\n  This is the third time I have come to the Senate floor to share \nstories about the remarkable actions taken by regular folks across \nMontana. Their teamwork is making a huge difference. John Wooden would \nhave been proud to coach this team. This is a championship team. And we \nneed this kind of teamwork. Flooding continues to damage property and \ndisrupt lives across Montana. The President has issued a major disaster \ndeclaration. Warm weather threatens to unlock water stored in record \nlevels of mountain snowpack. The whole time I was at home, I had never \nseen anything like this, so much snow, yet melting so quickly.\n  The chart to my left is part of Wolf Point, MT. Wolf Point sits along \nthe mighty Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. \nFloodwaters hit hard and hit fast, forcing 40 families from their \nhomes. Many are still unable to return.\n  Darrin Falcon, pictured here, is the director of the Roads \nDepartment. He has used his expertise as an engineer to help his \nneighbors on projects of every scale. He constructed berms and dikes to \nprevent floodwaters from damaging more homes. He delivered sandbags to \nresidents to protect major public infrastructure.\n  In one instance, an elderly neighbor was stranded; 300 feet of \nroadway around his home was underwater. Falcon went right to work and \nhelped build a new road so his neighbor could spend that night at home. \nFalcon's work ethic and willingness to help make him a real Montana \nhero and is something to observe.\n  The Milk River has been dumping water into Glasgow for weeks. Floods \nhave washed out roads and damaged bridges all across Valley County. \nCounty roads supervisor Rick Seiler and Wayne Waarvik have worked \nendless hours to keep roads open and residents safe after the Milk \nRiver burst its banks.\n  In a crisis such as this, roads are lifelines. Roads mean access to a \ndoctor. Roads mean groceries and fresh water. Rick and Wayne, teaming \nup with the whole Valley County road crew, went above and beyond to \nkeep these vital lifelines open.\n  Meanwhile, across town, Tanja Fransen, a meteorologist for the \nNational Weather Service, was taking extraordinary steps to help her \nfriends and her neighbors.\n  This is Tanja.\n  She would never abandon her post. She served as the voice of the \nNational Weather Service across northeastern Montana. Tanja knew her \nneighbors; she knew they depended on her for the latest weather \nreports. Beyond that, of all things, Tanja, despite a broken leg in a \ncast, spent hours filling sandbags to protect homes along Cherry Creek. \nShe went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure her friends and \nneighbors were equipped with the information they needed to stay safe \nthroughout the disaster.\n  Tanja, I might say to you: Take some time out and let that broken leg \nheal.\n  Tanja asked that the entire team at the National Weather Service in \nGlasgow be recognized. That is just how generous she is. She did not \nwant recognition for herself--it is her team. Working together, they \nhelped Glasgow weather these difficult floods.\n  In Billings, MT, floods have left dozens of families without homes.\n  In a normal week, Jeff Rosenberry spends his time as assistant \ndirector for housing and student life. He makes sure students at MSU-\nBillings have a safe and comfortable place to stay during the school \nyear.\n  This month, Jeff had extra work--work he very much enjoyed doing. \nJeff stepped to the plate. He converted a resident hall into a home \naway from home for displaced families. I saw it and was very impressed. \nJeff worked 15-hour days to make sure everyone felt welcome. He \ndelivered food and water to hungry families. He also made sure everyone \nhad the latest information about the floods. Ask anyone on the team \nhelping these families, and they will tell you Jeff was the team \ncaptain. His hard work and generosity will long be remembered. The \nfamilies who needed a place to sleep, of course, will never forget Jeff \nand his efforts.\n  Finally, the teamwork between our local disaster and emergency \nservices coordinators and crews has been extraordinary. DES \ncoordinators are the go-to leaders to help their communities respond to \nand recover from floods. They are the first to be called to help and \nthe last to leave.\n  Montana's disaster and emergency services teams have been working \nnonstop. They are a model of public service. I hope Montanans \neverywhere will reach out and shake their hands, e-mail or write a \nletter and thank these heroes for their service. These remarkable \nMontanans remind us that sometimes it is all about teamwork. We are the \nstrongest when we work together.\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\n  I am proud of these stories. I am asking Montanans to share their \nstories of ordinary folks doing extraordinary things for friends and \nneighbors, whether on Facebook, call my office--whatever works. We want \nto hear these inspiring stories because we want to help bring Montanans \neven closer together, showing we are working together.\n  Someone once observed that Montana is a big State, big geography, but \nnot a lot of people. Montana is really one small town. We know each \nother--one or two degrees of separation. We know each other, and we are \nthere to help each other. We are spread out in space but together in \nspirit.\n  In closing, I would like to share a humble thank-you for all Montanan \nheroes back home. I don't know what we would do without you. Thank you \nso much for your service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have a chance to talk about \nthe work I think we should be doing this week and surely will do in the \nweeks to come. We are really discussing who we are going to be as a \ncountry, what model we are going to follow. Are we going to continue to \nbe a country that believes we need to help create opportunity or are we \ngoing to be a country that believes the government needs to continue to \naccept more and more of the challenges of life?\n  Our debt today is over $14 trillion, and apparently that is not \nenough, so every discussion in Washington, including some that you are \nin, is focusing around the idea of how do we get even more ability to \nborrow more money so we can pay off the money we have already borrowed. \nThere are 13 million Americans out of work today, looking for a job, \nand during that process we continue to spend money we don't have for \nthings we don't have to have.\n  I think we ought to be focused totally on two things domestically \nright now. At the top of every list should be what do we do to create \nmore private sector jobs and how do we get Federal spending under \ncontrol. The Federal Government doesn't create private sector jobs in \nvery many instances.\n  By the way, if we are going to have something we are going to be \npaying for 30 years, I hope we are investing in something that will \nlast for 30 years.\n  But the most the Federal Government can do that impacts jobs is \ncreate an atmosphere that takes all the uncertainty out of the \ndecisionmaking process. There are enough risks in creating jobs without \nhaving the additional risks of how fast can the utility bill go up, how \nhigh will the taxes be, and what new unknown regulations are you going \nto have to deal with. Frankly, those are the wrong messages in all \nthree of those areas right now if you hope to be focused on the idea of \nhow do we create jobs for those 13 million Americans who are looking \nfor jobs and better jobs for the Americans who have jobs. What are we \ndoing to encourage private sector job creation for the future?\n  We are now spending at the Federal level almost $1 out of $4, right \nat $1 out of every $4 that the economy can create in goods and \nservices. The number for 40 years, ending in 2008, was $1 out of $5. \nThere is a lot of difference in an economy--who competes for that \ndollar that the Federal Government is now spending that for 40 years \nwas available for somebody else to get their hands on and use to create \nopportunity for somebody else? We have to get that under control.\n  The Cochairs of the President's own fiscal commission say we are \nlooking at the most predictable economic crisis in the history of the \ncountry. There is a train moving down the track to a destination nobody \nwants to go, and it continues to move at that same speed. It is totally \npredictable. It is something we have to do something about, and we \ncannot continue to spend somewhere between $3.7 and $3.8 trillion in \nthis spending year and collect $2.2 trillion.\n  I have said on this floor before that I am not sure anybody really \nhas a good grasp of what $3.8 trillion is. But we do know that if you \nare making $22,000 and you are spending $38,500--oh, and you have \nalready borrowed all the money anybody really should have ever loaned \nyou--you have a problem you cannot deal with for very long without \nchanging behavior.\n  That behavior has to change. It has to change in ways that look at \nthe programs where we, up until now, have just been able to define who \nbenefits from the programs without any real controls over how that \nmoney is spent. This year, the $2.2 trillion that I mentioned the \nFederal Government collected, that all was spent by the programs that \nwe normally do not even appropriate money for because we have defined \nwho gets that money. For the first time ever, those programs exceeded \nall the money that came in.\n  Most of those programs, of course, are the big programs we want to be \nsure are there as safety nets for people who have been told they need \nto rely on them. I think about 80 percent of that side of the budget is \nMedicare and Medicaid and Social Security. We need to see what we can \ndo so those programs continue to work. But if all of that side of the \nbudget spent all of the money, that means every other penny the Federal \nGovernment spent for an air traffic controller; for somebody to open \nthe gates to a national park; sadly, for somebody to put on a military \nuniform or to put a gallon of jet fuel in a plane or to buy a gallon of \npaint for a ship--that was all done with borrowed money. We are \ndefending the country on borrowed money. The No. 1 obligation of the \nFederal Government is just that. We have to figure out what to do to \nstructurally begin to define how we spend the money that comes in and \nto make sure we don't spend more money than comes in.\n\n  That is why I am supporting the balanced budget amendment. I think we \nneed to spend a lot of July talking about what we do to get this budget \nback in balance, how long it takes, and I look forward to that debate \nbeing the principal debate of the next month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been listening very carefully to \nthe remarks of my friend about what we have to do, what is in front of \nus. Of course, he is speaking for the Republican Party for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Let me say this: I want a balanced budget. That is what I want. I \ndon't need an amendment to the Constitution to get me to vote for a \nbalanced budget. What I want is for all sides to come together--that is \nwhat I want--and write a balanced budget. I want us to do it in a way \nthat is responsible and do it in a way that is fair and do it in a way \nthat protects our middle class, protects our kids, and stimulates \neconomic growth by making smart investments and cutting out spending in \nareas we don't need it.\n  So all this yak about a balanced budget amendment--and I call it \nthat, and I apologize if it sounds as though it is a derogatory term--\nit is just so much talk. Let's get to it.\n  I think we ought to go back to the people and the party that was the \nonly party and the only people to balance the budget in 40 years. I \nhate to break it to my Republican friends, but that is the Democratic \nParty. We are the ones who did it. We did it when Bill Clinton came \ninto office. We did it after hard work. We did it after painful cuts. \nWe did it with smart investments. We did it with everybody paying their \nfair share, and we didn't need a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution to do it. It is a gimmick. We need a balanced budget, not \na balanced budget amendment.\n  Let's look at what we did the last time this country ever had a \nbalanced budget. Lucky for us, it wasn't that long ago. Lucky for us, a \nlot of us are still here who made that fateful vote. We didn't have one \nRepublican voting for that budget, and when they came to the floor--I \nhave all the quotes, chapter and verse--they said: This is horrible. It \nwill never balance the budget. This is going to lead to a depression. \nThis is the worst thing. But we know what happened. We not only \nbalanced the budget, but we had a surplus. We not only had a surplus, \nbut the debt\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nwas going down so fast we thought we would never have to have Treasury \nbonds again. On top of that, we created 23 million jobs.\n  So I hope the public understands, when they hear Republican colleague \nafter Republican colleague come to the floor saying we need to stay in \nall through July--fine with me. I will stay here through August. I will \nspend the night in the cloakroom, I don't care. Let's not talk about a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Let's talk about doing \nthe hard work of balancing the budget. The way we do it, again, is to \nfollow the lead of the plan that was laid out by President Clinton and \nwhich worked in the most amazing way beyond our greatest expectations.\n  What did we do? We looked at this deficit and we said: This is \nunacceptable. We went after programs that made no sense and we cut \nthem. We either eliminated them or we cut them back. Then we asked: \nWhat are some investments we could make that would actually stimulate \nthe growth of the private sector? I thought my friend, Senator Blunt, \nwas right. That is what we need to do. We need to stimulate growth in \nthe private sector. At that time, the investments were on the high-tech \nside--high tech, biotech. Today, clearly, it is clean energy. That is \nwhat the whole world wants. That is where we ought to be leading. That \nis what our President knows. So we cut out programs that don't make \nsense. We invest where it makes sense to create jobs and then guess \nwhat we do. We make sure we have enough revenues coming in to pay for \nthe priorities.\n  I have news for my Republican friends. It is not that hard. Go after \nthe billionaires. They can't get themselves to do it, can they? Go \nafter the billionaires and the millionaires, the people who aren't \npaying what they should be paying. But when the House had its chance, \nwhat did it do? It allowed the biggest tax breaks ever to continue for \nthe billionaires and the millionaires and they killed Medicare. \nMedicare is gone. It is becoming some kind of a voucher program, where \nwe can imagine some 90-year-old woman who is suffering from disease has \nto now go out and try to find out where she can buy an insurance plan. \nTell me who is going to cover her, A; and, B, tell me if she has the \nstrength to do that; and, C, her Medicare benefit no longer goes to \nher. Who does it go to? It goes to the insurance company. That is the \nplan the Republicans passed in the House, and they cut everything that \nis near and dear to the hearts of the American people. In addition to \nMedicare, they cut education. They cut funding for clean air, clean \nwater. Highways they cut by a third, and here they talk about jobs on \nthe other side, private sector jobs. The highway bill creates thousands \nand thousands and thousands of jobs in the private sector. They cut \nthat bill by 36 percent.\n  So when I hear my Republican friends talk about the importance of \nbalancing the budget and they are talking about a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution--why don't they show us their balanced \nbudget? Because the one they showed us from the House was such a \ndisaster that they lost a congressional seat they held for eternity. It \nis easy to talk about a balanced budget amendment. It is harder to \nbalance the budget the fair way, and that is what we have to do.\n  My friend, Senator Blunt, also talked about the importance of jobs. \nHe is so right. I just ran for reelection. Jobs, jobs, jobs, the top \nthree issues. Guess what. My Republican friends have filibustered every \nsingle jobs bill we brought to the floor. The last jobs bill is one I \nam very familiar with because it is a bill that came out of my \ncommittee. The whole committee voted, with one dissenting vote, for the \nEconomic Development Administration to give seed money to areas in the \ncountry that need job creation and attract $7 of funds for every $1 of \nFederal money. It would have created 1 million jobs over 5 years. They \nfilibustered it. They added amendments about the prairie chicken. They \nadded amendments about things that had nothing to do with it, just to \nbring it down. They didn't even have--what is the word I am looking \nfor? They didn't even speak against it when they voted against it at \nthe end of the day. They didn't even come to the floor because they had \nnothing to say because it is a jobs bill, because it has passed every \nCongress since the 1960s. The last time it passed, it passed without a \ndissenting vote in the Senate in 2004 because the last President who \nsigned it was George W. Bush. It is a jobs bill. They said no. Why? I \ngo back to what their leader said. His top priority? Beating President \nBarack Obama. So we have to figure they are bringing every jobs bill \ndown so this economy gets worse.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, it is not going to go down easy at home. \nIt is not going to go down easy at home.\n  They killed a bill that Mary Landrieu brought out of her committee \nunanimously, a small business bill. It would have created thousands of \nsmall businesses. They voted it down. That bill was written by Warren \nRudman, a Republican Senator. They voted it down. They filibustered it \nand voted it down. Why? They say jobs are their top priority. Why would \nthey vote down a bill that was written by a Republican, that is passed \nwithout objection year after year after year? Why would they vote down \nanother bill that was last signed by George W. Bush without a \ndissenting vote in the Senate? Why? Two jobs bills. Why? We have to ask \nourselves why. Maybe they are willing to sacrifice jobs for political \nreasons. That is all I can come up with. I put that together with what \nMitch McConnell said.\n  Now their big push is a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution--a lot of talk. Balance the budget, folks. We know how to \ndo it. End the wars. That is $1 trillion over 10 years. Go after the \nmillionaires and the billionaires who don't pay their fair share. That \nis another $1 trillion over 10 years. That is $2 trillion, right there. \nGo after the people who never pay their taxes. Go after the oil \ncompanies that are ripping us off at the pump and taking the highest \nprofits ever. It is not hard to do. Yes, we are willing to cut some \nthings that don't make sense. We could have a $4 trillion package \npretty easily if we are willing to look at it in a fair way.\n  I heard our President today speaking to the Nation through a press \nconference, and he was very sweet about this issue. I was saying to \nSenator Durbin, as I watched him, he is explaining it to the people. \nEverybody has to give up something. If we want bipartisanship, that \ndoesn't mean we all get what we want and somebody gets nothing. It \nmeans I give up some of the things I want and they give up some of the \nthings they want. But we have declarations by the Republicans: We will \nnever ever agree to any new revenues. Why? They just voted to eliminate \nthe ethanol subsidy. That brings revenues. So why would they not take \nthat to the table? How can they believe it is fair that billionaires \nsometimes pay less in terms of the effective tax rate than a secretary \nor a teacher or a nurse?\n  Come on. Come to the table. Don't come to the table with a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. That doesn't do anything to \nbalance the budget. It is a lot of talk. Balance the budget. Put a \nlittle faith in the people who know how to do it who did it before.\n  I was proud to vote to balance the budget. I was proud to vote for a \nfair budget. I was proud to be here when we saw 23 million jobs come. \nThat didn't happen because we just said: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. End \nMedicare as we know it. It came because we were willing to look at what \nwas working, what wasn't working, where to make the investments, where \nto make the cuts. We have to come to the table with everything on it. \nWe have to say we are willing to listen to the other side. We need a \nfair plan. We have that as Democrats. We are not going to end Medicare. \nWe are not going to hurt working people. We are going to do this in a \nfair way.\n  I hope the American people will put this together and connect all the \ndots. We have a Republican leader who has said on more than one \noccasion the most important thing is to defeat Barack Obama. We have a \nRepublican Party that says it is for jobs and filibusters every single \njobs bill that in the past they have broadly supported. We have \nRepublicans walking out on the Vice President, taking their little \nteddy bear and their blankies and walking out of the negotiations \nbecause they didn't like the way the discussions were going. They \nwalked out. Then, my friends on the other side--\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\nand I thought Senator Blunt was very eloquent on the point. He said we \nneed two things. We need to work on job creation in the private \nsector--and I just showed that despite the language, they voted \neverything down--and then we have to take uncertainty out of the \nequation. That was his big point. He is so right. How do we take \nuncertainty out of the equation? Do not play politics with the debt \nceiling. Do not play politics with it. Because I have read what \neconomists say, that if we do not do this right, and we do not agree, \nand the debt ceiling becomes a victim of this partisanship, Treasury \nbonds of the United States of America will be junk bonds--will be junk \nbonds.\n\n  So you want to play games? Go home, go on the corner, and I will play \nyou a game. But do not bring it in here. It is too serious. This is the \ngreatest country there ever was.\n  My parents, one of whom was born outside of this country, told me \nthat I should kiss the ground of America. And how proud I am that I am \nhere. But I will tell you, if I see people who are willing to turn U.S. \nTreasury bonds into junk bonds, I am going to do everything I can in my \nlife to make sure those who have done this will not be nameless or \nfaceless. It is too important.\n  The fact that we are even playing these games is ridiculous. The fact \nthat we cannot come together and shake hands and say this budget \ndeficit is terrible, we are going to deal with it, we are going to deal \nwith the debt, we are going to do what we did under Bill Clinton, we \nare going to balance the budget, we are going to create a surplus--we \ncan do this. You shake hands on it. You have the parameters of the \ndeal. You pass a debt ceiling that is clean. You send a message to the \nmarket.\n  I used to be a stockbroker. When the President would sneeze, the \nmarket would go down 200 points. That is how the market responds to \nthese things. We do not have to be playing with the stock market, with \nthe full faith and credit of the United States of America.\n  It is pretty simple if everything is on the table. If all you want to \ndo is destroy Social Security and Medicare, it is not simple. But if \nyou are willing to talk to us, to have a fair taxation system, where \nthe Warren Buffetts of the world are at least paying as much in an \neffective tax rate as a nurse, there is something to talk about here. \nBut do not go walking out of discussions and going home because you did \nnot get 100 percent of what you want. Life does not work that way.\n  I speak as a mother, a grandmother, a Senator from the largest State \nin the Union when I say this: You do not get everything you want in a \nnegotiation. The Republicans control the House. The Democrats control \nthe Senate. The Democrats control the White House. Correct me if I am \nwrong: two-thirds Democratic. In a fair world, we would get two-thirds \nof what we want. But we are going to give up more. It ought to be a 50-\n50 deal. That is how you negotiate.\n  This is a tough time. If the other side thinks a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution balances the budget, it does not. You \nhave to do the hard work of balancing the budget. You have to sit down \nin this tough time, in a tough, fragile economic recovery.\n  Remember when President Obama took over, we were bleeding 800,000 \njobs a month. He had to handle two wars, unpaid for by George W. and \nhis friends; a tax cut, unpaid for, to the richest people in America. \nHe had to deal with a banking system that was frozen solid. He had to \ndeal with an automobile industry that was going out of business. We had \nto work, and a few brave souls from the other side of the aisle worked \nwith us, thank God, or who knows where we would be today.\n  And now, when we are finally moving out of this nightmarish economy--\nnot quickly enough--we have Republicans filibustering jobs bill, then \ncoming down here and saying how important jobs are, and saying how \nimportant it is there is certainty, when they are playing games with \nthe debt ceiling.\n  I am an optimist. That is why I stay in this world I am in, and I \nthank the people of California for giving me the chance so many times. \nBut there is a saying back home: Are you on the level? Are you on the \nlevel when you are in negotiations? Do you want to have a deal? Do you \nwant to fix it? Do you want to work with us? I do not know when I see \nthem filibustering jobs bills, when I see them walking out on the Vice \nPresident, when I see them saying: Oh, that is off the table, and this \nis off the table, and that is off the table, when they do not run this \ncountry. They run the House. I wonder: Where are we going?\n  When I hear people saying: What is the big deal if we do not pay our \nbills, if we do not lift the debt ceiling and we cannot pay our bills, \nwhat people have to understand is, lifting up the debt ceiling is not \nabout the future payments, it is about payments due.\n  I said we had a balanced budget under Bill Clinton--and a surplus. We \nwent into deficit mode when George Bush took over and did the tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest among us, and did not pay for it, and did a \nprescription drug benefit and never paid for it, did two wars and never \npaid for them, and we got into big trouble.\n  What is the solution of my friends on the other side? We are walking \nout of the negotiations because we cannot talk about taxing \nbillionaires or taking away corporate welfare from oil companies. God \nforbid. It makes me wonder, really, who is on the level.\n  We can do this. We did it before. It is not that hard. We just need \npeople of good will. I will say to my friends on the other side: Forget \nthe reelection of Barack Obama. Forget the next Presidential race. You \nwill have your candidate and we will have ours, and that is for another \nday. Right now we are in this Chamber. We are talking about how to have \na credible plan to get this deficit down, to get this debt down, to \nstrengthen our economy, to strengthen job creation, to keep the middle \nclass vibrant.\n  I hear some Republicans now on the Presidential trail talking about \ndoing away with the minimum wage. Can you imagine going back to the \ndays when the minimum wage was $4 an hour? I remember when it was 50 \ncents an hour. It dates me a bit. That is what we hear from the other \nside. Their vision is not a good vision for the young people of this \ncountry who are looking forward to a life at least as good as that of \ntheir parents.\n  In conclusion, this is not a time to play games or reach for a \npolitical advantage. This is not a time to hold the future of this \ncountry hostage to some ideological agenda or some pledge that somebody \nsigned to some political person outside of this Chamber. Pledges \nsigned--it is not about that. It is about putting America first. It is \nabout putting our families first. It is not about amending the \nConstitution with a balanced budget amendment. It is about balancing \nthe budget in a fair way.\n  The Republican plan that passed the House that started with Paul Ryan \ndid not balance the budget for 40 years. That is not a plan. We have to \ndo better. But when you are willing, as they are, to say to \nmillionaires and billionaires and trillionaires: You do not have pay \nyour fair share, the revenues do not come in. What happens as a result, \nthey have to kill Medicare--which they did in the House budget--they \nhave to hurt education, make the Environmental Protection Agency a \nshadow of its former self.\n  I go out and look at polls. Eighty percent of the people want the EPA \nto stay out there and clean up the air and make sure we have safe \ndrinking water. They want food inspections. They want air traffic \ncontrollers on the job. They want a next-generation air system.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. We do not have to walk \naway from our dreams. We just have to have everybody paying their fair \nshare. If that happens, we can do this. And we need to end those wars \nthat are so costly in so many ways. If we do those two things, we are \non our way to a balanced budget. We are on our way to surpluses.\n  We can do this. The only thing standing in our way is politics. That \nis what it seems to me. If people think that more important than fixing \nthis budget crisis is bringing down a President politically, we have a \nproblem.\n  We take the oath of office, and we raise our right hand, we put our \nhand on the Bible, to be loyal to this country, to do right by this \ncountry. That is what we should be doing now.\n  If people want to stay in July, August, September, October, through \nChristmas, that is fine with me. But we have to have a plan that is \nfair. If we have a plan that is fair, we balance the\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nbudget. We do it over time. We do it wisely. We create jobs. Interest \nrates remain low. We can do it because we did it before. The only \npeople who have ever balanced the budget in the last 40 years have been \nthe Democrats. That is a fact in evidence.\n  We have the path lights showing the way. It is fairness on spending; \ncut the things that do not work; fairness on taxation; make sure \nbillionaires pay their fair share. We follow that path. We bring home \nour troops. We are golden. I think that is a pathway I would like to \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Let me offer a thought or two as I get started today.\n  I had the privilege at one point in my political life to serve as the \nGovernor of a great State, the State of Nebraska. I served in that \ncapacity for 6 years. In that capacity, as in virtually every other \nState, we had a provision in our constitution, and it was not a gimmick \nat all. It was a very serious statement. It said, in a very \nstraightforward way: Thou shalt have a balanced budget. It was as \nsimple and as straightforward as that.\n  The other interesting thing about my State of Nebraska is that in \naddition to having that constitutional provision--and keep in mind, \npart of my oath of office, as Governor, was to uphold that \nconstitution--but part of that was a requirement, a mandate, that we \ncould not borrow money. In fact, I think the limitation, if I am not \nmistaken, was $50,000 or $100,000.\n  I would say to people back home, when I was Governor, that probably \nwas a pretty handsome sum of money more than a century ago when that \nconstitution was passed, but, in effect, today what that meant was that \nwhen we got down to the business of balancing our budget, as required \nby the constitution, I did not have the ability as Governor to issue \nbonded indebtedness to go out and borrow against the full faith and \ncredit of my State to balance that budget.\n  In fact, I will tell you today, I am not even certain the State of \nNebraska has a bond rating because it is unnecessary. Very simply, we \nfollowed a philosophy that we would not spend money we did not have. So \nwe did not issue bonds to build highways. If we did not have the money \nin the bank and planned for where the money would come from in the \nyears ahead--if it was a multiyear project--we did not do it. We did \nnot build them.\n  Many who may be listening to this will say: Well, my goodness, how \nwould that work? Here in this country we have $14 trillion worth of \ndebt. Where would we be without all of that borrowing? In this last \neconomic recession, the unemployment rate of Nebraska never rose over 5 \npercent. Today the unemployment rate in our State is 4.1 percent.\n  It never occurred to me that I should ever argue to the people of \nthat great State that if they were successful, they should be punished \nfor that success. Very much the opposite. I said: I want you to come to \nNebraska, I want you to create your jobs here, and we are going to do \neverything we can to be your partner in that effort.\n  The current Governor has followed that same philosophy, and we often \nhear about those Governors who are doing a great job. I know of one; \nhis name is Dave Heineman. He is the Governor of the State of Nebraska. \nHe has balanced his budget, he has not borrowed money, and he has, \nduring one of the toughest economic times since the Depression, under 5 \npercent. It is 4.1 percent today. He was my Lieutenant Governor.\n  At the national level, we did not follow that philosophy. I believe \nwe are now at a crossroads because for decade after decade Washington \nhas promised too much. It has said over and over again we can be all \nthings to all people. But the real truth of it is, it never said how it \nplanned to pay for it. The result is, we face a financial crisis unlike \nany financial crisis that maybe our Nation has ever seen. Do not \nbelieve my words. This is being studied by the hour, by the minute, by \nthe second.\n  A recent Congressional Budget Office report confirms the assertion. \nLast week the CBO released its latest economic forecast. It is kind of \na report of where we are headed as a nation, and it is grim by even the \nmost liberal economic point of view.\n  The Congressional Budget Office now predicts that debt held by the \npublic will exceed 100 percent of our gross domestic product by 2021, \nif we continue the current policies. Twelve months ago, when they \nreleased the report, it was equally as grim--well, I should not say \nequal because the number I have just cited got worse by 10 percent in \njust 12 months. Our debt is rising exponentially, exceeding 200 percent \nby 2037, and at that point we might as well just stop making the \nprojection. Just think about this: Our great Nation in 25 years will \nhave so much debt that the Congressional Budget Office cannot compute \nit.\n  Erskine Bowles has said many times before that this is a crisis that \nis predictable. He was one of the Chairs of the President's own deficit \ncommission. CBO went on to say that ``growing debt also would increase \nthe probability of a sudden fiscal crisis during which investors would \nlose confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget and \nthe government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at affordable \nrates.''\n  It is Erskine Bowles who has said this crisis is so predictable. CBO \nalso found that in the next 25 years, Federal health spending will \nincrease by 50 percent as a share of GDP while Social Security spending \nwill increase by 20 percent. What is happening is predictable.\n  My generation--I am right in the middle of the baby boomers--is \nstarting to access all of the promises that have been made. It is no \nlonger an option for us to just simply say: A little nip and a little \ntuck here, and we all give a little, and it all works out. There is a \nmountain of debt clearly ahead of us, and we can either do course \ncorrections or, believe me, we will perish.\n  I have no qualms about saying that both parties made mistakes over \nthe years. This is a bipartisan problem. But for some to advocate even \nmore stimulus spending--which we heard in the last couple of weeks, \nrepeating the misguided policies of the last 2 years, adding more debt \non more debt on more debt--defies logic and common sense.\n  If stimulus spending were the answer, our economy would be firing on \nall cylinders today. But, unfortunately, even with that massive \nspending plan, that stimulus plan of $1 trillion when we add the \ninterest, it has not yielded the results.\n  Remember the President's promise: We will keep unemployment under 8 \npercent. We just have to bite the bullet and spend all of this money. \nAnd here we are today with unemployment almost locked down at 9.1 \npercent. Just look at where our country was 2 years ago.\n  In January 2009, the debt was $10.6 trillion. I would argue that was \nfar too much 2 years ago. Today, it is over $14.3 trillion and growing \nexponentially. We are talking about a 35-percent increase in our \nNation's debt in 2 short years.\n  To put these numbers into perspective, today each U.S. citizen would \nhave to pay $46,000 to pay off our national debt. That is $11,000 more \nthan 2 years ago. Each American family--and I hope you are sitting down \nwhen you are listening to this--each American family would need to \nwrite a check for $127,000 just to square up the books, just to get the \ndebt paid off. That is not even addressing the spending that is out of \ncontrol today.\n  Looking at unemployment, in January 2009 the unemployment rate was \nabsolutely unacceptable at 7.8 percent. Today, after almost $1 trillion \nof stimulus spending, unemployment has grown 17 percent, with almost 2 \nmillion more Americans who cannot find work notwithstanding their best \nefforts.\n  Maybe somebody is going to come down here and say: But there is other \nnews you should be looking at. Well, I looked at some other news \nregarding health care costs. Contrary to the proponents of the health \ncare overhaul, health insurance premiums for the average family have \ngone up 19 percent since 2009.\n  Put simply, doubling down on deficit spending has failed our economy. \nIt has failed our American people. In fact, the President's plans have \nmade it worse. So why would we want to repeat the same mistake? I \nthought raising the\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\n$14 trillion debt limit was actually about reducing spending. Why would \nwe arrange for a stimulus plan in order to raise the limit? Why would \nwe be arguing for larding it up with more stimulus spending? When will \nwe learn this hole we have dug for this great country requires us to \nquit digging?\n  There is no doubt that our debt problem is the defining issue of our \ntime. I see two paths. We can continue to run up trillion-dollar \ndeficits, operate the government with no budget--which has been \nstandard fare for the last 790 days--double down on failed policy \nobjectives that did not make any sense 2 years ago and have not \nimproved with time, or we can be frank and candid and honest that we \nhave promised more than our economy can afford to generate.\n  I have heard the arguments: Just tax those rich people some more. In \nfact, I spoke about that soon after I came to the Senate. There was \nthis idea that if a person made over $250,000 a year, then they should \nbe taxed more.\n  So I said: OK, if that is going to be the new mantra around here, \njust to balance the budget for a year, what would the effective tax \nrate have to be for everybody making over $250,000 just to balance the \nbudget? I am not talking about paying off the deficit, just to do what \nNebraska has done for years and years, balance the budget without \nborrowing money.\n  I spoke about this on the Senate floor. The rate would have to be 90 \npercent. That was 2 years ago. It is probably worse now. If does not \nmake any sense. Is that the kind of encouragement upon which our Nation \nwas founded? That is not a pathway to solvency; that is a pathway to \ndestroying a great nation. Only one path will provide future \ngenerations what I grew up with, which was a land of opportunity, an \nAmerica that my parents believed if you just worked hard and stayed out \nof trouble you could do just about anything, two dairy farmers who \ncaused their kids to believe that they could experience greatness in \nthis great country.\n  Well, let's be up front and honest about the road that we need to \ntravel as a nation. We can get there. Our Nation has such a proud \nhistory. It has faced so many challenges. It has looked adversity in \nthe face, and it has forced it down. Each and every time our great \nNation has risen to the challenge.\n  So as we reflect and pay homage to the history of this great country \nin the days ahead, let's use this as an opportunity to work toward a \nsolution to this challenge of our time, our debt crisis.\n  As the CBO report indicated:\n\n       Waiting to address the long-term budgetary imbalance and \n     allowing debt to mount in the meantime would make future \n     generations worse off--\n\n  That is your children and your grandchildren--\n\n     although some current generations could receive a benefit \n     from that delay.\n\n  So am I to tell my children and grandchildren, so that I can benefit \nfrom just pushing this down the road, kicking this can down the road, \nthat my kids and grandkids will pay the price for this? They will have \ntheir own wars to fight. I wish they were not going to, but they will. \nThey will have their own new pandemics to deal with, and on and on.\n  But, you see, I started my adult life with our Nation owing $380 \nbillion. In 5 years our Nation will owe $20 trillion. It will not be \ncanceled at my death. It will be owed by those next generations.\n  My hope is that we can come down here, that we can be honest about \nthe overpromises that have occurred, that we can speak candidly about \nthe need to put in place forever a requirement that says to every \nSenator who follows me that, as hard as it is, we must balance the \nbudget. The only way we can do that is by doing what our States have \nhistorically done--including my great State--and that is what it says \nin the Constitution.\n  It is not accidental that this proposal gets so much support in our \ncountry because, to the average family, it is what they do every day. \nWe in Washington must come to grips with this and do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair what the status \nis on the bill? Are there pending amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently, there are no amendments pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 521\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 521.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mr. \n     Udall of Colorado, Ms. Collins, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Burr, Mr. \n     Paul, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, and Mr. McCain, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 521.\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the creation of duplicative and overlapping \n                           Federal programs)\n\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, about 3 months ago, one of the results of \nthe last time we raised the debt limit was a report by the Government \nAccountability Office. Ninety-seven Senators in this body voted to put \nthat in the last debt limit extension. What was that? That was a \nrequirement for the Government Accountability Office over the next 3 \nyears to list every program for us in every area so that we knew what \nwe were doing.\n  The purpose for that amendment was--and that happened to have been my \namendment. I went to the CRS and the Government Accountability Office \nand I said I want to know every program in defense, education, et \ncetera. They told me: It is impossible; we cannot do it. So \ncollectively, as colleagues, we said that you will do this. It has been \na big job. They have done a fantastic job on it thus far. I cannot wait \nuntil we get the second and third part.\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\n  One of the results in the first report the GAO gave to us showed \nclose to $200 billion worth of duplication. Those are my numbers, not \ntheirs, in terms of looking at it. Let's say I am twice wrong, and say \nit is $100 billion. The fact is, what we found in just the first third \nof looking at the Federal Government is that we have multiple \nduplicative programs that do exactly the same thing; they are just in \ndifferent agencies or across agencies. In a moment, I will talk about \nwhat those are.\n  The response to that report was the greatest response GAO has ever \nhad to any report they have ever listed. The curious thing about that \nis that 95 percent of what they reported was a culmination of reports I \nhad asked for over the last 6 years put together, which means we had \nthe information, as Members of Congress; we just would not use it. In \nother words, it didn't get up to the level of being recognized. When we \nsaw it together, we all of a sudden started seeing the magnitude of the \nproblem of duplication.\n  The purpose of this amendment--it is very straightforward--is that on \naverage the Senate considers, in a session of Congress, in a Congress \nover 2 years, about 700 pieces of legislation. The Congressional \nResearch Service now writes a report on each one of those and advises \nus about the legislation, what it does, what it doesn't do, and what is \nout there. But the one thing they don't do is tell us where it \nduplicates.\n  The purpose of this amendment is that with each of those bills, we \nwould have the knowledge the GAO has put out there, which the CRS will \nthen go and get and say: Here is what is out there, and you need to \nconsider that as you consider, why do we need another program to do \nsomething we are already doing? What is wrong with the programs we have \nnow that are not accomplishing this?\n  This great transparency is not just for us but for the American \npeople. We add duplicative programs every year. It raises the question, \nwhere is the oversight?\n  The motivations here are wonderful. The motivations are to try to \nsolve problems. Too often, we lack the information and the knowledge \nwith which to make a great decision. The reason we lack that is because \nwe fail in our duty to do oversight. So this information which would be \nprovided becomes powerful. More importantly, it creates tremendous \ntransparency for the American public in saying, for example, if we are \ngoing to create another job-training program--we have 47 of them right \nnow that are funded by the Federal Government across 9 different \ngovernment agencies. None of them are coordinated and all but three \noverlap each other. If we create another job-training program, maybe we \nought to know what all these others are and why we need to create \nanother one rather than make the ones we have now work. I would \nactually question why we have 47 job-training programs. But the problem \nis big.\n  Let me spend a moment and put some highlights into the Record. These \nare just highlights. This represents less than 10 percent of what the \nfindings were of the last GAO report.\n  We have 101 programs for surface transportation. They are run across \nfour different agencies.\n  We have 82 teacher quality improvement programs--82 separate programs \nacross 10 different agencies, and they are not in the Department of \nEducation. There are 10 different agencies--9 of which are outside of \nthe Department of Education--that have teacher training programs.\n  We have 88 economic development programs run by 4 agencies costing \n$6.5 billion a year--88 separate economic development programs.\n  We have 80 programs to provide transportation for the disadvantaged, \nacross 8 different agencies. We spend $314 million on it. That is a \ngood cause, and it is something we can do, but 80 different programs?\n  We don't know what we are doing. So the purpose of this amendment--\nand it will require a rules change to have it--is to ask CRS to show \nwhat we are doing and what is there already, just as they analyze every \nother aspect of a bill before it comes to the floor. This won't be \nrequired on emergency legislation or required on committee reports or \nrequired on the filing of bills; it will only be mandated if a bill \ncomes to the floor for consideration by my colleagues.\n  Let me finish.\n  We have 56 programs for financial literacy from 21 different \nagencies. Based on the talk we just heard from the last two Senators, \nwe are the last people who ought to be teaching anybody about financial \nliteracy when we are running the kind of deficit and debt we have and \nhave the kind of duplication we have. Nobody who knows financial \nliteracy would run 88 separate economic development programs and pay \nfor the overhead of all of those through all these different agencies; \nrather, they would have 2 or 3 and have a concentrated program and \ndirect the emphasis of that economic development program.\n  We have 21 programs for homeless assistance.\n  We spend $62 billion on 18 different food and nutrition assistance \nprograms. We only need 2 or 3, not 18. We need to have metrics \nmeasuring whether we are effective in helping people with food and \nnutrition.\n  We have bureaucracy after bureaucracy, and each of them doesn't know \nwhat the other agencies are doing. There is no coordination, and there \nis no measurement of the effectiveness of what we are doing.\n  CRS claims they don't have the manpower to do this. They have 350 \nanalysts who do nothing but analyze legislation. This would require one \nanalyst, one time a year, to look at the duplication on a bill coming \nto the floor--one analyst, over a period of a year, one time, looking \nat it.\n  CRS is a great resource for me, and I want them to have the resources \nthey need because the only way we get out of the bigger problems the \nSenator from Nebraska was talking about is having the knowledge of what \nwe are doing today.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this not as a partisan amendment \nbut one to give us the information that gives us the power to make the \nbest decisions for our country. We need to be making better decisions.\n  The final thing this will do is help us not create duplication again. \nIt will let us know what we need to do; that is, before we pass it into \nlegislation. I am so concerned as I look at bringing forward some \noptions for my colleagues to look at in terms of solving our financial \nproblems because everywhere I go, as we dig deeper into this, we see \nthe duplication and inefficiency, the lack of direction, and the lack \nof pointed purpose to get an end result in program after program in the \nFederal Government. Some of those truly aren't our role, but on those \nthat are our role, that we are responsible for constitutionally, it is \nthe responsibility of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Government--we \nought to know what we are doing, and we ought to know what is being \ndone out there already. We operate in a vacuum when we don't have this \ninformation.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will support this in a way to give \nus information. There is nothing political about it. It is, how do we \nmake better decisions and how do we do this in a way that will cause us \nnot to create more duplication in the future, and it will cause us to \nask the smart questions about legislation. You see, those questions \ndon't get asked unless somebody goes and does the digging now.\n  My hope is that we would all be empowered by having greater knowledge \nover what we are doing. It is very simple and straightforward. It is my \nhope that we can accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nOklahoma on his remarks and participation in this debate.\n  Before long, we should have--whenever the majority leader decides--a \nvote on the Coburn amendment. We are in a position on this resolution \nthat relevant amendments are in order. At the moment, we don't have any \nothers. If we don't have others, then we will proceed to the final bill \nlater this afternoon when the majority leader decides we should do \nthat. We passed the bill this morning with 79 votes. I will have more \nto say about this resolution in a moment.\n  I wish to say something that is directly relevant to what the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma talked about. We keep\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\ntalking about duplication, which is an important part of our oversight \nresponsibilities. Sometimes that leads to the elimination of government \nbureaucracies, which is a rare event.\n  Ronald Reagan once said a government bureau is the nearest thing to \neternal life that we will ever see on this Earth. I had an example of \nthat this morning, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, in a Rules \nCommittee hearing. The purpose of the hearing was to review the \nqualifications of three excellent men and women who were nominated by \nthe President to serve on the Election Assistance Commission. But what \nI said at the hearing and what I would like to say on the floor--with \nall due respect to those excellent nominees--instead of considering the \nnominees, we should be abolishing the Commission because it doesn't \nhave anything to do. It has finished its work and it ought to be \nabolished.\n\n  The Election Assistance Commission was commissioned in 2003. Since \nthen, the Rules Committee didn't have one single oversight hearing on \nthe Commission. My predecessor asked for an oversight hearing, but we \ndidn't have one. I asked for one earlier this spring, and we didn't \nhave one. At a time when we are borrowing 40 cents out of every $1 that \nWashington spends, we should not have been there this morning \nconsidering new appointments to a commission that is out of work. We \nshould have been there considering recommending to this body that the \nCommission cease to exist.\n  This is why. It was created by the Help America Vote Act in 2002. It \nwas authorized for 3 years and given certain tasks. The primary task \nwas to distribute Federal payments to the States to help them upgrade \ntheir voting systems. We appropriated $3.2 billion for these payments. \nThat has been distributed. Given our current financial situation, it is \nvery unlikely that any more Federal payments will be forthcoming. We \ndon't have any more money for that purpose. President Obama seems to \nagree with this, since in his last two budgets he has requested no \nfunds for this purpose.\n  The Commission was also directed to develop voluntary voting system \nguidelines and a testing and certification program for voting machines. \nThe actual work involved in this process is performed by another \nagency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which \ndevelops the guidelines, and the independent laboratories that conduct \nthat testing. So in the spirit of Senator Coburn's comments, we don't \nneed two agencies assigned the same responsibility.\n  Finally, the Commission was to act as a clearinghouse to collect and \ndistribute information on best practices in election administration. \nYet the intended beneficiaries of this service don't seem to have much \nuse for it. The National Association of Secretaries of State--every \nState has one--a bipartisan organization made up of our country's chief \nState elections officials, has twice voted in favor of a resolution \ncalling for abolition of this agency, the Election Assistance \nCommission.\n  So here we have a classic example of: I am the government. I am here \nto give you help you don't want. As a former State official myself--I \nwas Governor of Tennessee--I have a little bit of a bias. I don't see \nthe need for a Federal clearinghouse of best practices for secretaries \nof state. I don't know why the secretaries of state themselves can't do \nthat. When I was a Governor, I didn't need a Federal agency telling me \nthe best practices of the Governor of Oklahoma so I could use them in \nTennessee. We had regular Governors' conferences, and we got to know \neach other pretty well. If Governor Graham of Florida had a good idea \nabout education, I borrowed that. If I had a good idea on education, \nGovernor Clinton borrowed that, and it worked pretty well. We didn't \nhave to fly to Washington to have a clearinghouse.\n  So the tasks of this Commission have either been completed or can be \nperformed by more appropriate entities. This is in the spirit of \nSenator Coburn's amendment. The Commission did its job. We should thank \nthe Commission and their staff for their service.\n  But if the completion of their appointed task isn't enough of a \nreason to close it down, the Commission also appears to have a serious \nmanagement problem or two. Though its mission has dwindled, its staff \nhas grown. It has less to do but has more people doing it. The \nCommission had a staff of 20 in 2004. Last year, it had three times \nthat many. It had 64 people--more staff needed for less work.\n  I am sure there are some very good people there. There must be, \nbecause the average salary--according to Congressman Gregg Harper of \nthe House of Representatives--for all the members of the Election \nAssistance Commission is over $100,000 a year. This year's budget \nsubmission from the Commission proposes spending $5.4 million to manage \n$3.4 million worth of programs. Does that make any sense, when the cost \nof overhead and staff salaries exceeds the programs they have to \nadminister? Clearly, something is wrong.\n  That is precisely the kind of small thing in the big picture we are \ndealing with that adds up and up and up and creates an environment in \nwhich we seem to be content in spending more and more and borrowing 40 \ncents of every $1 we spend.\n  Finally, the Commission has an unfortunate history of hiring \ndiscrimination. The Office of Special Counsel found they engaged in \nillegal discrimination when, during the search for a general counsel, \nan employment offer was made and then withdrawn when the Democratic \nCommissioners discovered the applicant was a Republican. This resulted \nin a substantial financial settlement being awarded to the applicant; \nthereby forcing taxpayers to bear the cost of the illegal acts of \nCommissioners. Amazingly, it has been reported that in a subsequent \ninterview with another applicant for the same position, one of these \nCommissioners again tainted the hiring process by asking the applicant \nwhat the Department of Labor has termed ``inappropriate questions about \nhis military service.''\n  Apparently, the Commissioner didn't want Republicans or members of \nthe military working at the Commission. The Department of Labor has \nreportedly found the applicant's claim of discrimination to be \nmeritorious and, if not resolved, this case may be referred to the \nOffice of Special Counsel.\n  I said this morning that the three men and women whom President Obama \nnominated seem to have exceptional backgrounds, and they are not to \nblame for any of these incidents. But what I also said was, since they \nseem to be exceptionally good nominees, maybe we should find a \ncommission where there is something for them to do, instead of a \ncommission that has finished its job and where we are just perpetuating \nit with employees who, on average, make $100,000 a year in salary, \naccording to Congressman Harper.\n  Even if we were to assume these nominees before us could right the \nship and correct the problems, the question remains: Where would the \nship sail, and why would they make the trip? Do we need the Commission, \nwith its main job completed? Couldn't any remaining duties be better \nperformed somewhere else? Can a government program ever be terminated?\n  As I said at the beginning of these remarks, Ronald Reagan once said: \nA government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life that we will \never see. Shouldn't we try to use this opportunity to prove that Ronald \nReagan was, in that case, wrong?\n  I congratulate the Senator from Oklahoma for his work on duplication. \nThis isn't the first time. This is one of the many times he has spoken \nand acted on the subject. I offer this example of the Election \nAssistance Commission as one small step we could take in the right \ndirection by, in the appropriate way, canceling the Commission instead \nof confirming three new nominees to it.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I failed to mention the cosponsors of this \namendment, and they are Senator Udall of Colorado, Senators Collins, \nMcCaskill, Burr, Paul, Brown of Massachusetts, and Senator McCain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 514\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nToomey amendment No. 514 be considered as having been adopted before \nthe managers' amendment to S. 679.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                         Alleged Passport Fraud\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to quote from a \npublication.\n\n       Days after working at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, a U.S. \n     Navy veteran found himself behind bars--where he could remain \n     for a decade--for alleged passport fraud.\n\n  I had to read that article--from CNN's Web site--twice. I couldn't \nbelieve it. But that is what it said.\n  Former U.S. Army SPC, now Navy reservist, U.S. PO2 Elisha Leo \nDawkins--a 26-year resident of Florida--was arrested in April and has \nspent now more than 2 months behind bars in a Federal detention center \nin Miami, and a Federal indictment says the serviceman failed to \nacknowledge he had once applied for a passport when filling out a new \napplication, something the prosecutors call passport fraud, but his \npublic defender calls an innocent oversight. Petty Officer 2nd Class \nDawkins now faces up to 10 years in prison if he is convicted.\n  Remember John Dillinger? He was sentenced not to 10 years but to 8\\1/\n2\\ years on a conviction for assault and battery with the intent to rob \nand conspiracy to commit a felony.\n  We all recognize that falsifying information on a passport has grave \nimplications for our national security, and we want our government to \nbe vigilant and to crack down hard on those who would attempt to sneak \nin here and do us harm. Zero tolerance. Zero. But according to Petty \nOfficer Dawkins' Guantanamo naval base work evaluations, his superiors \npraised his work ethic and performance. He was a military photographer \nwho, because of what he was photographing, had to have a secret \nclearance. By the way, he had that secret clearance when he was an Army \nphotographer in Iraq. When he went into the Naval Reserves, they--and \nthis is according to the U.S. Navy--gave reciprocity for the secret \nclearance for him to go into the Naval Reserves.\n  As the Miami Herald reports in today's edition, he took 7,500 photos \nduring the 7 months of his service at Guantanamo, and this was after \nhis 8 years in the Army, where he was in Iraq.\n  His evaluation right before this unexpected arrest by the U.S. Navy \nsays that Dawkins ``always'' lived up to the core Navy values of \n``honor, courage, and commitment.'' Honor, courage, and commitment, and \nhe had that secret clearance while he was at Guantanamo. This morning's \nMiami Herald chronicles the sensitive photos he took of detainees at \nGuantanamo.\n  In one evaluation report that was obtained by CNN, a superior lauds \nDawkins as ``a team player with a strong work ethic and a desire to \nlearn'' and recommends him for promotion. It goes on to say:\n\n       Dawkins is eager to tell the military story and to further \n     the image and success of U.S. servicemembers.\n\n  That was written by fellow PO1 Sally Hendricks.\n  Let's see: honor, courage, commitment, and a team player. I have \nsought explanations. I have been on the phone. I have talked to \ngovernment high-ups in person. I have talked to the highest levels in \nthe U.S. Navy, the Army, and Homeland Security. I have just been on the \nphone with very high levels of the U.S. State Department. I want to \nknow: Does the military stand by the evaluations they made of this \nfellow? Is Petty Officer Dawkins suspected of other misdeeds? If so, \nthey better get it out. How did they give him a secret clearance while \nhe was named in an old deportation order? Was this case part of an \nongoing State Department diplomatic service crackdown on passport \nfraud?\n  Does the State Department have any additional information they are \nnot telling us? From time to time they have intimated that there is \nsomething more, but they are not saying. Well, did the U.S. military \nbelieve him to be a citizen during all those years of service in the \nArmy in Iraq and now in the Navy in Guantanamo?\n  This case raises lots of questions, and we need to get to the bottom \nof it. I have taken an interest in this case because when I read these \nstories on CNN, the Miami Herald, the New York Times, and now it has \ngone all over the country on Associated Press, there seems to be a \ndisconnect in government agency coordination. One hand doesn't seem to \nknow what the other hand is doing--and a Floridian, with honorable \nservice in two services of the U.S. military, has been in jail being \nheld on a $100,000 bond. He would have to produce a $10,000 bail, which \nhe obviously doesn't have, and he has been there for over 2 months.\n  I didn't call the U.S. Attorney's Office because I respect the \nindependence of the prosecutorial rule. But let me just quote for you \nthis morning's Miami Herald. Carol Rosenberg is the reporter. She \ndisclosed that a Federal judge has now said that the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice has made a secret offer to resolve this passport prosecution.\n  The judge revealed the offer of a pretrial diversion in a conference \nthat set a July 12 trial date for Petty Officer Dawkins. The idea, \naccording to the Herald, is to give someone facing charges an \nopportunity to avoid prosecution through a program such as doing \ncommunity service or perhaps taking a civics class. The judge was so \ntaken aback by hearing this secret offer that the judge said she was \nleft speechless, and she was quoted in this morning's Herald story as \nsaying it appeared to reflect ``a kinder, gentler'' approach to \nprosecution.\n  So whether the petty officer is released from jail tomorrow or \nwhenever it is, we will have to see, are there further things? If it \nhas to do with his immigration status; according to his public \ndefender, whom we have talked to, he came to this country from the \nBahamas when he was a kid. He still is not a citizen, but he has served \nthis country for years and years.\n  In conclusion, if the facts of this case are, as we have been told in \nthe scratching and scraping, with some reluctance on the part of \nagencies to talk--if it is as it has been reported to us, wouldn't it \nbe interesting if the DREAM Act were in fact law? The DREAM Act would \nhave prevented something like this from happening in the first place \nbecause the DREAM Act says, if a kid has been brought here illegally as \na child but that child grows up and wants to go into the U.S. military, \nas Dawkins has for almost a decade already served, then that \nlegislation would grant legal status through a green card to that \nundocumented young person who wanted to serve the country.\n  We ought to pass the DREAM Act. Every day we have examples of \nchildren who came here through no fault of their own, but who are \nunjustifiably having the law come down on their heads.\n  I want to close by reading a letter to the editor in the Herald from \nSandra Wallace of Miami. This is what she writes.\n\n       Elisha Dawkins served 7 years in the military in both Iraq \n     and Guantanamo, where he was awarded medals for his behavior, \n     yet he's being held in Federal lockup awaiting deportation to \n     the Bahamas. This man thought he was a U.S. citizen because \n     his relatives told him he was when he came here as a young \n     child. Our military was certainly glad to consider him a \n     citizen.\n\n  Mr. President, the DREAM Act would allow the U.S. Government to \nconsider as a citizen someone who, like Elisha Dawkins, was brought \nhere as a child and wants to serve this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Bipartisan Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, millions of Americans are hurt \neconomically. Yet so much of the debate on the Senate floor seems to be \nDemocrats and Republicans fighting with each other or rehashing old \narguments. It seems almost as if there is a default strategy: either \npound on the other party or recycle some of the stale positions that \nhave been repeated again and again.\n  Senator Coats and I believe that none of this really does anything to \nhelp the millions of Americans who are out of work or get the economy \nmoving again. The two of us have been coming to the floor of the \nSenate, and will continue to do so in the days ahead, to talk about \nwhat really works, what really works to get the American economy moving \nagain.\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\n  An example would be tax reform, tax reform like the sort of tax \nreform that was passed when Democrats and Ronald Reagan teamed up. That \ntax reform effort helped to create 6.3 million new jobs in the 2 years \nafter it was enacted. No one can say there is any one factor that alone \ncreates millions of new jobs, but it certainly didn't hurt. Certainly, \nit helped to set the economic climate, Democrats and Republicans coming \ntogether. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the 2 years \nafter that kind of bipartisan effort, the country created 6.3 million \nnew jobs.\n  It is not going to be possible, of course, to pass comprehensive tax \nreform between now and August 2. But Senator Coats and I have said that \nas part of these budget negotiations, as part of the effort to deal \nwith the budget in a comprehensive way and to deal with the debt \nceiling issue, it ought to be possible to lock in for consideration in \nthe fall and in the remainder of this Congress the kind of bipartisan \neffort that we saw a quarter of a century ago that represents an idea \nthat really works; an idea with a proven track record of working to \nboost the economy that has been bipartisan, where Democrats and \nRepublicans, instead of spending their time pounding on each other, \nsay: Let's come together and eliminate some of these ridiculous special \ninterest tax breaks which are limiting our ability to grow and create \nfamily-wage jobs.\n  Senator Coats and I are going to spend a few minutes this afternoon \ntalking about the impact of real tax reform on jobs and economic \ngrowth. I would just like to start by thanking my friend from Indiana. \nHe has been a pleasure to work with. But his reaction to that kind of \napproach, where we focus on really what works, especially between now \nand August 2 in these budget negotiations, Democrats and Republicans \nhaving an opportunity to look at spending and look at growth to make \nsure that out of those negotiations by August 2 there is a way to lock \nin for the fall and the remainder of the Congress the effort to promote \nbipartisan tax reform and get our economy growing again--I would be \ninterested in hearing my colleague's reaction to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon for helping \nto organize this colloquy. We have worked together to try to fashion a \ncomprehensive tax reform package that we think makes a lot of sense. \nJust about every analyst or economist or budget expert that I have \ntalked to and listened to over the past several months has said we are \nnot going to successfully address our current debt and deficit \nsituation unless comprehensive tax reform is part of the package.\n  Senator Wyden and I have had the opportunity to sit down and talk \nabout this. We, obviously, have been encouraging the Congress for \nseveral months to go forward and address this. We realize that such an \neffort cannot successfully take place before we reach the point in \nAugust where we have to make a decision on raising the debt limit and \nwhatever package is brought before us relative to what kind of changes \nwe can make in our financial structure to put us in a better fiscal \nsituation.\n  Nevertheless, knowing the importance of comprehensive tax reform to \ncreate success for what we ultimately want to achieve, we would like to \nencourage all those negotiating these packages and all those Members \nand our colleagues to look carefully at the proposal, as my colleague \nsaid, to lock in to whatever package is before us a commitment--a hard \ncommitment, an enforceable commitment--to take up comprehensive tax \nreform; not to wait until after the next election but take it up this \nfall as a one of the follow-ons to the package that we ultimately will \nhave to address, debate, and vote on coming up in the next several \nweeks.\n  I couldn't agree with my friend more that doing so now can be a very \nimportant component of addressing the serious fiscal situation which is \nfacing our country and which is one of our biggest challenges.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend. We are going to talk \nthrough some of the specifics of why this is important as a way to \nboost the economy. In the beginning, what I would like to just lay out \nis that as we have seen these discussions go forward over the last \ncouple of months about boosting the economy, invariably the fight comes \ndown to the question of whether we ought to spend more in order, \nparticularly in a consumer-driven economy, to create jobs and put our \nfolks back to work.\n  What Senator Coats and I have described is an opportunity and a way \nthat is deficit neutral. As my friend from Indiana knows, this has been \ndemonstrated by our analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation. This \nis a deficit-neutral strategy for putting our people back to work \nbecause by eliminating some of these special interest tax breaks--and \nthousands and thousands of them have gotten into the Tax Code over the \nlast quarter century--we can take those foolish tax breaks off the \nrevenue roles and use those very same dollars to create what we call \nred, white, and blue jobs to put people back to work in the \nmanufacturing sector in Indiana. Of course, the President and I know \nhow deep the hurt is in our home State.\n  I wanted to begin this by way of making sure that folks saw last \nmonth's job report as a wake-up call that would indicate that current \neconomic policies are not creating the jobs our citizens and our \neconomy need and would specifically be willing to look at new \napproaches, new approaches in the sense that they be genuinely \nbipartisan but proven in the sense that they have a track record.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the national unemployment rate at \n9.1 percent in May. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, we \nhave parts of rural Oregon with unemployment that probably, if you were \nto calculate the real rate of unemployment, is over 20 percent. So the \neconomic hurt is enormous. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that of \nalmost 14 million Americans who want to work but cannot find jobs, \nalmost half of them have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Of the \nemployed, 8.5 million have to settle for part-time jobs. Among the \nhardest hit are young people, the people who are trying to get in the \nworkforce, are anxious to show that they have good work habits and \ndiscipline but cannot find work.\n  We lost 8.5 million jobs between the worst of the fiscal crisis and \nthe end of 2010, and only a small portion of those jobs has been \ncreated. Moreover, many of the new jobs that have been created do not \npay as much as the jobs that were lost, in particular, the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs. So many of our citizens, when they can get \nalternative employment, end up with wages far less than what they made \nin manufacturing. In addition, income inequality is growing because \nhigh school graduates have a jobless rate twice that of college \ngraduates.\n  With millions of Americans struggling to find jobs, Senator Coats and \nI wish to spend a few minutes to talk about how we can come together, \nand talk about ways to grow the economy. I have mentioned there is a \nproven track record in terms of tax reform helping. Because of the \nhistoric tax reform in 1986 between populist Democrats such as former \nCongressman Dick Gephardt and the late President Reagan, we had 6.3 \nmillion new nonfarm jobs created in the 2 years after that law was \npassed. I believe it can happen again.\n  The Manufacturers Alliance forecasts that Senator Coats and I, with \nour legislation, might have the opportunity to create nearly 2 million \nnew jobs. The Heritage Foundation came in with the same sort of \nanalysis.\n  We can never lose sight of the need to create jobs in an economy such \nas this. I wish to bring my colleague into the discussion at this point \nbecause he has done so much work, not just in Indiana--where they have, \nto their credit, focused on a manufacturing strategy for our country--\nbut as part of this bipartisan effort, and get his sense of why the \napproach we are advocating today could be an economic boost for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I cannot help but agree with my friend. It \nis a sad situation that we have in this country as our economy is kind \nof limping along, and so many young people graduating from school \nrecently are unable to find meaningful jobs and work; so many middle-\nage Americans trying to raise a family and save money to send their \nchildren to school are out of work and cannot find employment, not only \nat the level they\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nwere previously used to but even at a lower level. It is a situation \nthat requires Congress enacting policies that will do everything we can \nto stimulate this economy and get America back to work.\n  As I said earlier, comprehensive tax reform has been described by \nabout everyone who has looked at this situation as an essential \ncomponent of the kind of reforms necessary to get us back to fiscal \nhealth.\n  As the Senator from Oregon said, one of the components of the tax \nreform plan, the Wyden-Coats plan, is that we want to maintain revenue \nneutrality but at the same time we want to go after those tax \nexclusions and exemptions and subsidies that favor a few but do not \nhave broad application. They have been added over the years, \nparticularly since 1986 when we had our last comprehensive tax reform. \nOver these last 25 years, a number of special breaks, special \nsubsidies, special exemptions have been added totaling hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. What we are trying to do here is look at those in \na comprehensive way, reduce or eliminate many of them, and then use the \nmoney saved from those eliminations to lower tax rates.\n  Let's look at the corporate tax rate. Out of the 36 countries with \nwhich our country competes most directly for sales around the world, \nthe United States ranks 35. We would be 36 except the Japanese deferred \nlowering their rate based on the tsunami and the aftereffects of that, \nbut they already had in place plans to lower their rate. We literally \nare at the highest corporate rate of any major industrialized \ncompetitive country in the world.\n  Senator Wyden and I in our bill agreed that we would take the money \nthat was saved from eliminating a lot of those special breaks for \nspecial interests and lowering the corporate tax rate to make the \nUnited States more competitive, to bring that rate down to the mid-\ntwenties or perhaps even lower. In doing so, it will stimulate our \nindustries here, stimulate our exports, and put our companies in a much \nbetter position to expand and grow and compete across the world and \nultimately that translates into jobs.\n  If we look at small businesses alone, the real job creators, under \nour plan we allow those businesses, almost all small businesses, to \nexpense their equipment and inventory costs in a single year. We also \nincorporate a provision for reciprocity, so those companies that do \nhave overseas sales and entities producing and selling their products, \nwe allow the earnings gained there to be brought back to the United \nStates without being taxed twice, they can be brought back over a 1-\nyear reciprocity period at a very low rate--again to encourage \ninvestment in plant, equipment, and employment here in America.\n  At a time when consumer consumption is very weak--consumers do not \nhave money to spend--we believe comprehensive tax reform and \nparticularly some of the ideas outlined in our plan will help stimulate \nthe economy, will help bring about growth and ultimately put people \nback to work.\n  I would kick this ball back to my colleague, Senator Wyden from \nOregon, for his further thoughts on that as we continue this colloquy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am glad Senator Coats made that last \npoint, especially because it is getting hardly any discussion here in \nthe Senate, and that is with respect to the weak consumption we are \nseeing in our country, particularly middle-class folks who have the \nsense that there is not going to be economic security right now. They \ndo not have as much money in their pockets as they would like. They \nhave suffered huge shocks that have caused them to pull back from some \nof the purchases they would otherwise make.\n  The Presiding Officer of the Senate has done outstanding work with \nrespect to trying to protect middle-class people who lost all this \nequity in their homes. That usually serves as some kind of collateral \nfor folks with a need to get a loan. That has not been there. We have \nhad folks underemployed in much of the workforce.\n  What we see is that in our economy, which has always been consumer \ndriven, as Senator Coats has pointed out, we are not seeing the kind of \ndemand from middle-class folks for goods and services. They are not \ngoing out and buying the refrigerator they might wish to have for their \nfamily. They cannot get a computer for their child. They are not able \nto make the purchases that are so important in a consumer-driven \neconomy.\n  What Senator Coats and I are saying is that as Democrats such as Dick \nGephardt and former President Ronald Reagan said a quarter century ago, \nthey want to come together and put money into people's pockets. They \nwant to make sure the middle-class folks--who are just getting \nclobbered, as we have seen for months now--would be in a position to \nget back into the economy and start demanding some of those goods and \nservices that are so important for long-term economic well-being.\n\n  Senator Coats and I have sought to put more money into people's \npockets by repealing the alternative minimum tax. We had an excellent \nhearing in Chairman Baucus's committee yesterday on simplification.\n  Get this. The middle-class person is now essentially going through \nbureaucratic water torture on this alternative minimum tax. They have \nto fill out their taxes twice on two separate systems. What Senator \nCoats and I have said is let's repeal it. That will put some money back \ninto the pockets of middle-class folks. As Senator Coats has pointed \nout, middle-class folks won't have to spend all that money paying out \nfor accountants and all kinds of other people, trying to fill out all \nthose alternative minimum tax forms. We will put some money into the \npockets of the middle class that way.\n  Senator Coats and I also advocate nearly tripling the standard \ndeduction for all our taxpayers, which again can be a real boon for the \nmiddle-class consumer, which can help us spur consumer demand and, with \nthat, job creation.\n  I am very glad Senator Coats has zeroed in on the question of the \nconsequences of underconsumption by consumers.\n  I think I would next probably like to have my friend go through some \nof the benefits we wish to provide to small business. We all know that \nsmall business is the job creator, the job engine of our economy.\n  If Senator Coats would outline some of the benefits that on a \nbipartisan basis we ought to be zeroing in on with respect to small \nbusinesses, I think that would be very helpful.\n  Mr. COATS. As the Senator from Oregon has said, small business is hit \nparticularly hard these days. Because many choose not to incorporate, \nthere is a passthrough, a passthrough of taxation rates as if these \nsmall businesses were individuals. They are taxed at that rate.\n  As my friend from Oregon knows, at the end of 2012 that tax rate is \nscheduled, under current law, to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. \nSmall businesses, which currently are having trouble getting credit and \nmaking ends meet, are facing a tax increase--within a relatively short \nperiod of time. That is a deterrent to making decisions relative to \nexpanding the business and hiring new people, because they know the \ntaxes they have to pay out of their earnings flow through directly to \nthem so they are going to have to be paid at the highest rate.\n  Again, the Coats-Wyden bill prevents that from happening. It keeps \nthose rates at the current level. Also, as my friend from Oregon has \nsaid, simplification is a major underlying principle of the Wyden-Coats \ntax reform bill. It is a nightmare for individuals, as the Senator from \nOregon said, to try to figure out how to do this. In fact, about $6 \nbillion is spent each year to hire professionals to fill out tax forms \nbecause it is virtually impossible for many individuals to figure it \nout and work through this, as my friend said, bureaucratic water \ntorture of a process.\n  The thousands of hours, hundreds of thousands--millions of hours \nspent filling out tax returns based on the complexity of the current \nTax Code is a detriment to small businessmen who do not have the \nprivilege of having an accountant in the back room or hiring somebody \nwho is an expert in taxes as big businesses can do. They either have to \ngo outside and hire one or they have to spend a great deal of their own \ntime complying with the Tax Code when they ought to be on the floor \nselling their product or running their business. So whether it is tax \nrates or\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nwhether it is simplification or whether it is incentives for small \nbusinesses which provide the bulk of the hiring in the United States--\nin fact, from 1995 to 2005, between 60 and 80 percent of all new jobs \nwere those created by small businesses--our comprehensive tax reform \nbill ensures that not only individuals but small business people will \nhave a much simpler, easier way of reporting their taxes and complying \nwith the Tax Code. They also will not be facing a tax increase under \nour bill because the current law is due to expire at the end of 2012.\n  I will, once again, kick it back to my friend to wrap this up. I \nagree with him that together in 1986 Ronald Reagan and congressional \nDemocrats, including Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman Dick Gephardt, \nand Congressman Jack Kemp, worked on a bipartisan basis to pass \ncomprehensive tax reform. It did many good things and stimulated the \neconomy and brought about a lot of new jobs. It has been 25 years since \nthen. That code has now become evermore complex. I think we need to \nmove ahead.\n  As I said at the beginning of all of this, fundamental tax reform is \none of the best tools in the economic tool shed, and it is time we use \nit. We know it will not be easy, but we know it has been done before \nand we can do it again. Working together, I believe we can take on the \nspecial interests that benefit from the Tax Code and create a much more \nbusiness-friendly tax system.\n  I conclude on that point. I would like my colleague to wrap up. I \nthank him for his inspiration and leadership on this effort. He started \nthis more than 2\\1/2\\ years ago with Senator Gregg, in a bipartisan \nway. Senator Gregg retired at the end of the last Congress. I have the \nprivilege of not only being a close friend of Senator Gregg's and an \nadmirer of his understanding and depth of knowledge about financial \nissues, but I inherited all the hard work that he and Senator Wyden put \ntogether to bring this comprehensive tax bill to fruition.\n  We have made some adjustments in debates and discussions between the \ntwo of us. We think it can be the primary vehicle for moving forward. \nAre we locked in stone? No. Are we open to suggestions to make it \nbetter? Yes. But, clearly, there is an agreement between the two of us \nthat is unbreakable, which is that this is an essential part of dealing \nwith our current fiscal crisis, and without this we will come up short.\n  Just about everybody who has looked at this situation has come to \nthis conclusion, and we are hoping we can in these next few weeks get a \ncommitment from our colleagues and all those engaged in the process of \ntrying to put together the package that can put us back on the right \nfiscal track and get our fiscal situation in order, that they will \nincorporate into this plan, incorporate it into what is brought before \nus, a commitment, locked in, to go forward with comprehensive tax \nreform. And we believe the Wyden-Coats plan is the place to start.\n  I thank my colleague for his efforts, and I will turn it back to him \nto conclude this colloquy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana. He makes a \nnumber of important points we want to make sure are considered as the \ndiscussion about taxes goes forward. For example, Senator Coats pointed \nout on this question of changing just the corporate tax alone--what are \nessentially C corporations--the reality is the vast majority of \nbusinesses in this country are not C corporations; they are \npartnerships, limited liability corporations, sole proprietorships. \nThey are about 80 percent of the businesses in this country. So Senator \nCoats has made the important point that to bring about tax reform, we \ncan't just go with corporate taxation. We have to get at the needs of \nmillions and millions of these small businesses.\n  Chairman Bernanke was asked about this in the Budget Committee, and \nhe said specifically that it was important to do comprehensive reform \nin order to generate the best opportunity for economic growth and job \ncreation rather than corporate reform alone. Senator Coats also makes \nan important point, as we wrap up, about the temporary nature of our \nTax Code and how frustrating that is to American businesses that need \nto have some capacity to predict what is ahead to generate jobs.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported the other day that the only thing \npermanent about the American Tax Code is that it is temporary, and we \nhave more than quadrupled the number of temporary provisions in the Tax \nCode in just the last few years. That uncertainty discourages \nbusinesses from investing in growth and hiring, as Senator Coats has \nnoted, and that is why it is going to be important to look at the Tax \nCode in a comprehensive way, both for individuals and corporations, so \nthat going forward, all our taxpayers have some sense of predictability \nand certainty about what their tax treatment will entail.\n  My last point is, I recently had a chance to talk to one of the \nveterans of the 1986 tax reform debate, and we visited about some of \nthe circumstances involved in that historic reform and some of the \nchallenges ahead. When he was done, he said: What in the world is \nholding people up from getting going on this? What is really holding \neverybody up? We know what we need to do. There have been commissions, \na whole host of them. President Obama had an excellent one that agreed \nwith much of what we have talked about this afternoon. President George \nW. Bush had a commission that was chaired by several of our former \ncolleagues. I thought much of their proposal was on point. That is why \nwhat one of the veterans of that 1986 reform legislation had to say to \nme about ``what is holding people up'' is so important.\n  As Senator Coats noted, we are not going to do comprehensive tax \nreform between now and August 2. Everybody understands that. But there \nis absolutely no reason--in order to come together in the Senate with \nan approach that doesn't add to the Federal deficit, with the proven \ntrack record of helping to advance economic security--that between now \nand August 2, as part of these budget negotiations, there is no reason \nin that agreement we shouldn't lock in a strategy for getting on to tax \nreform in the fall and in the remainder of this Congress.\n  So I thank Senator Coats. He mentioned Senator Gregg. I feel so \nfortunate to have had two colleagues--and we were in the House \ntogether--having an opportunity, Senator Coats and I, to work together \non this in the Senate. I think we have always believed that we ought to \nfocus on what works rather than the default strategy of rehashing old \narguments and just having these partisan fights. So I thank Senator \nCoats. We will have our eye on the effort between now and August 2 to \nmake sure tax reform gets the place it deserves for the fall and the \nremainder of the Congress.\n  I thank my friend from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                      Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, last night, S. Res. 185, a resolution that \nwas cosponsored by about 90 percent of the Senate, passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent. I am very grateful to my colleagues for their help \nin developing this resolution. This resolution expresses the strong \nsupport of the United States for our closest ally in the Middle East: \nIsrael. I was joined in this effort by my good friend, Senator Susan \nCollins from Maine. The two of us worked together to draft this \nresolution, and we are grateful that so many of our colleagues joined \nus in the process and that it has now passed the Senate by a unanimous \nvote.\n  This resolution first and foremost expresses our strong support for \nIsrael. It recognizes that these are extremely challenging times. It \nexpresses our support for peace between the Palestinians and the \nIsraelis and recognizes that the only way we are going to be able to \nmove forward on the peace process is through direct negotiations \nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians. That is the only way we can \nresolve these longstanding issues in order to achieve peace in that \nregion.\n  The resolution also reaffirms our opposition to the inclusion of \nHamas in any Palestinian unity government unless it is willing to \naccept peace with Israel and renounce violence. An entity cannot \nnegotiate with those sworn to bring about its destruction; therefore, \nHamas' inclusion in the Palestinian Government is a nonstarter for any \npossibility for peace.\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n  Any unilateral attempt by the United Nations to establish a \nPalestinian State is detrimental to any final peace agreement. A \npermanent and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \ncan only be achieved through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \nAny Palestinian effort to gain recognition of a state outside of direct \nnegotiations demonstrates their lack of a good-faith commitment to \npeace negotiations. The Senate is now firmly on record that this kind \nof action would be directly counterproductive to peace. If the \nPalestinians pursue this, it may well have implications for the \ncontinued U.S. participation with the Palestinians.\n\n  Israel has always been willing to come to the peace table for direct \nnegotiations. Quite frankly, it has been the Palestinians who have been \ndragging their feet for many months, refusing to have direct \nnegotiations between the parties, which is the only way it can be \naccomplished. Lasting peace can only come through direct negotiations \nthat settle all outstanding issues to the satisfaction of both sides. \nObviously, there is going to be give-and-take. There has to be give-\nand-take. There has to be mutual respect and security, and that \nrequires active participation in the peace talks.\n  The two sides can achieve a peace agreement only when they \nacknowledge each other's right to exist. That is pretty fundamental. \nThis is particularly critical now for the Palestinians and their unity \ngovernment that includes Hamas. Unless Hamas fully renounces violence \nand acknowledges Israel's right to exist, it cannot be a partner of \npeace and their inclusion in the Palestinian Government is a major \nobstacle.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu stated so well in his speech before the \njoint session of Congress in May:\n\n       I will accept a Palestinian state. It is time for President \n     Abbas--\n\n  President Abbas, of course, is the head of the Palestinians--\n\n     to stand before his people and say: ``I will accept a Jewish \n     State.''\n\n  It is clear it is in the interest of all parties for there to be two \nstates--the Jewish State of Israel and the independent Palestinian \nState--living side by side with secure borders in peace.\n  Let me again acknowledge what I think Prime Minister Netanyahu said. \nIsrael is prepared to acknowledge a Palestinian State. It is time for \nthe Palestinians to acknowledge the Jewish State.\n  Difficult negotiations need to take place. There are critical issues \nsuch as security, power, and water concerns, as well as larger issues \nof historical, religious, and territorial matters still to be decided. \nThat must take place through direct negotiations between the Israelis \nand the Palestinians. This is precisely why it is so important to \ndiscuss, negotiate, and ultimately resolve these issues rather than \ntaking unilateral action that would leave them unsettled and \nunsustainable. Real and lasting peace will only occur at the peace \ntable, and I am grateful the Senate has strongly and unanimously gone \non record to affirm this approach.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to join again in the \ndebate occurring in Washington on bringing our Federal budget into \nbalance and facing up to our looming debt limit.\n  Our Nation right now is like an overburdened ship wallowing in the \nseas. We are in danger as a nation of foundering if we don't sort this \nout. As former Comptroller General David Walker testified to us in the \nBudget Committee over a year ago, we face ``large, known and growing \nstructural deficits that could swamp our ship of state.''\n  To get the ship in trim, we need to make adjustments. We need to \nreduce the deficits and ultimately reduce the debt.\n  We agree on a lot. We need to cut spending. Democrats and Republicans \nagree on that. We need to protect ordinary families who enjoy ordinary \nlevels of income from tax increases. Democrats and Republicans agree.\n  The disagreement here in Washington is whether we also need to raise \nsome revenues for our Nation in other areas to help balance our \nnational budget--areas such as oil and gas and ethanol subsidies that \nwe could close and contribute to fixing our budget deficit, closing \ncorporate tax loopholes, bringing to an end high-income, tax-dodge \nschemes.\n  The Republicans are threatening that they would rather sink the boat \nthan raise revenues in those areas. Just this week, Senate Republican \nLeader Mitch McConnell called on President Obama to take any revenue \nraisers ``off the table'' and to focus only on spending cuts. In an \nopinion piece on CNN.com, the Republican Leader, Senator McConnell, \nproclaimed ``tax hikes can't pass the Congress.''\n  Let's start with the fact that, as I said a minute ago, we are not \ntalking about tax hikes on ordinary Americans. When Leader McConnell is \ntalking about tax hikes, he is talking about the rates that the \nwealthiest Americans pay in taxes, often lower than ordinary American \nfamilies, believe it or not, gas and oil and other subsidies that go to \nbig industries, and tax loopholes that generations of corporate \nlobbyists have wangled into the Tax Code. That is what they are talking \nabout when they talk about tax hikes in this context.\n  Let's take a specific look at what the Republicans are fighting so \nhard to protect.\n  Last month, Republicans filibustered a measure that would have ended \n$21 billion in unnecessary tax subsidies for the largest oil companies \nin the Nation--companies that have enjoyed record multibillion-dollar \nprofits and do not need continued support from the American taxpayer. \nWhen we tried to break the Republican filibuster, Republicans voted to \nprotect those big oil subsidies, even though they add to the deficit. \nThat happened right here on the Senate floor a short time ago.\n  To keep our American ship of state afloat, the Republicans are \ndemanding that we cut early childhood education while at the same time \nthey fight to protect big oil subsidies.\n  Here is a building in the Cayman Islands. It is called Ugland House. \nThis nondescript building does not look like much, but over 18,000 \ncorporations claim that this building is their place of business. Mr. \nPresident, 18,000 corporations claim this building is their place of \nbusiness. It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ``small business'' \nto imagine 18,000 corporations fitting into that little building.\n  As Budget Committee Chairman Conrad has pointed out, the only \nbusiness going on down there in the Cayman Islands is funny business, \nmonkey business with the Tax Code. It is corporations getting out of \npaying their responsibilities to this country by hiding behind phony \nshell corporations down in the Cayman Islands. It is estimated to cost \nus as much as $100 billion each year to put up with this offshoring tax \nshelter of income.\n  To keep our ship of state afloat, the Republicans are asking us to \ncut investments in science and technology that will cure disease for \nAmericans and for mankind, and at the same time they are fighting to \nprotect corporations that hide in offshore tax havens so the honest \nAmerican taxpayer has to carry the burden in their place.\n  Here is another building with a story to tell. This is the Helmsley \nBuilding on Park Avenue in New York City. We remember Leona Helmsley \nwho famously said: Taxes are for the little people to pay. Well, we \nknow something about the Helmsley Building and its taxes because this \nbuilding is large enough to have its own ZIP Code. The IRS compiles tax \ninformation by ZIP Code. So we know from IRS actual information what \nthe wealthy and successful individuals and corporations that call this \nbuilding home pay in Federal tax each year.\n  Guess what we know. We know that in the last year that was recorded, \nfor which this has been pulled out--which was 2007--the occupants, \ntogether, of this building--the Helmsley Building--paid a 14.7-percent \ntotal Federal tax rate. They actually paid 14.7 percent. The average \nAmerican taxpayer, the average middle-class American, pays far higher \nthan that.\n  We hear a lot of talk about how high tax rates are for wealthy \nAmericans. In real life, when you go to actual examples--14.7 percent, \nhow does that compare, for instance, to the people who work in that \nbuilding, the average New\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nYork City janitor or doorman or security guard? Well, far, far lower. \nThey all pay tax rates in the 20 to 25-percent range, even higher in \nsome cases, on average--far higher than the high-income occupants of \nthe building.\n  It is not just because this is the Helmsley Building that this is \ntrue. This is not some anomaly. Each year, the Internal Revenue Service \npublishes a report that details the taxes paid by the highest earning \n400 Americans. I spoke earlier this year on last year's report, which \nwas based on that same year's data, 2007. In that year, these superhigh \nincome earners, earning nearly a third of a billion dollars--with a \n``B''--in income in 1 year, 2007, on average--all 400 of them in that \nyear--the superhigh income earners paid a lower tax rate than an \naverage hospital orderly, who is a single filer, pushing a cart down \nthe hallways at midnight, of a Rhode Island hospital. They paid a lower \ntax rate on their income than that hospital orderly.\n  In May, the IRS published data on the top 400 taxpayers for 2008. \nLet's take a look at what happened in this most recent year they have \ncategorized.\n  In 2008, the top 400 took home an average of $270 million each--more \nthan a quarter of a billion dollars each. We can and do applaud the \nsuccess of these individuals. It is the American dream to make more \nthan a quarter of a billion dollars in a single year. But, on average, \nthese 400 extremely wealthy Americans paid an average Federal tax rate \nof 18.2 percent.\n  We spend a lot of time around here debating whether the top income \ntax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent. Folks, that is not what \nthey paid. The Tax Code is filled with special provisions that tend to \nexclusively or disproportionately benefit the wealthy, so the top 400 \nincome earners paid an average of 18.2 percent.\n  A single filer, at $39,350 of income, pays the same tax rate. Mr. \nPresident, $39,350, that is where you hit 18.2 percent and match the \nrate people making a quarter of a billion dollars pay. Those of us who \nare in between the truckdriver and those ``uber'' billionaires pay far, \nfar higher rates. The average truckdriver in Rhode Island, according to \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, is paid $40,200, which means the \naverage truckdriver is paying as high or higher rate than these top 400 \nincome earners earning over a quarter of a billion dollars.\n  To keep our ship of state afloat, the Republicans are asking us to \ncut employment and training support at a time of record joblessness \nwhile they continue to fight to make sure people making a quarter of a \nbillion dollars a year pay lower Federal tax rates than middle-class \nAmerican families.\n  When all is said and done, everyone agrees that there needs to be \ncuts, and everyone agrees there should be no tax increases on middle-\nclass American families making up to $250,000 a year. That is already \nagreed to. Those concerns are not an issue.\n  What is at issue is that the Republicans are willing to sink the ship \nof state to defend tax rates for billionaires that are lower than those \npaid by regular, hard-working Americans.\n  The Republicans are willing to sink the ship of state to defend \nspecial interest loopholes in the Tax Code won by big corporate \nlobbyists, in effect earmarks--earmarks that happen to be in the tax \nside of the budget rather than in the spending side of the budget.\n  The Republicans are willing to sink the ship of state to defend \noffshore havens for corporations and high-income earners to dodge \ntaxes. That is where they have chosen to stand and fight. That is where \nthe disagreement is--not for the middle class that is the backbone of \nour Nation but for the special interests, the big corporations and the \nultrarich. When you say that revenues cannot be on the table, that is \nwho you are protecting. That is just a fact.\n  They say it is tax increases they are protecting against. The \nquestion Americans should ask, when they hear that, is: Tax increases \nfor whom? For the corporate lobbyists who drove down corporate taxes to \nthe point where significant numbers of American corporations do not pay \na dollar in taxes? Yes, there should be tax increases there. We should \nclose those loopholes. Tax increases for people making more than a \nquarter of a billion dollars, who pay less than the average working-\nclass family as a rate? Yes, there should be tax increases there. But \nthat is just in the spirit of fairness.\n  It is simply inexcusable that our tax system permits billionaires to \npay lower tax rates than truckdrivers and allows some of the most \nprofitable companies in the world to pay little or no taxes to support \nour Nation. Even if we had no budget deficits, fairness and equality \nwould demand that we address these inexcusable discrepancies.\n  Our budget crisis, however, brings new urgency to the problem. As we \ncontinue to debate ways to close the budget gap, I hope the Republican \nleadership and the Republican Conference will revisit the potential to \nsignificantly cut the deficit by addressing the tax loopholes, tax \ngimmicks, and, frankly, outright injustice to the ordinary taxpayer \nthat they are now defending.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \na few moments as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Measure Read The First Time--S.J. Res. 23\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if this week has shown us anything at \nall, it is that the American people cannot wait on Democrats to do the \nright thing when it comes to spending and debt and putting us on a path \nto balance. So today Republicans are beginning the rule XIV process on \na balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  A balanced budget amendment would require that lawmakers stop \nspending money we do not have. When we return from the Fourth of July \nbreak, we will fight for an opportunity to vote for it.\n  We have had a chance this week to see how Democrats in Washington \nwant to deal with the fiscal mess they have helped create--by forcing \nthe taxpayers and the job creators to actually bear the burden. Well, \nRepublicans think it is about time Washington bears the burden, for a \nchange. Let Washington find a way to balance the books on its own. The \nAmerican people have paid enough of a price over the past few years for \nWashington's recklessness. Republicans are not going to allow Democrats \nto make them pay even more.\n  Speaker Boehner has already committed to a balanced budget vote in \nJuly, so the Speaker and I are united in this effort. Americans can \nexpect all 47 Republicans in the Senate to support this amendment. It \nis time to put the American people back at the helm of our ship of \nstate. And if that is what the vote achieves, then the debate we are \nhaving will have been well worth it.\n  If Washington is forced to finally reform its ways, then we will all \nlook back and say the American people, indeed, won this debate. And we \nwill say the balanced budget amendment was just the thing we needed to \nget our house in order.\n  Broke or balanced, that is the choice.\n  Mr. President, I am going to rule XIV the proposal. I do not think \nthe Presiding Officer has it yet. The Chair should have it momentarily. \nIt has miraculously appeared.\n  I understand there is a joint resolution at the desk. I ask for its \nfirst reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution by title \nfor the first time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 23) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relative to balancing \n     the budget.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in \norder to place the joint resolution on the calendar under the \nprovisions of rule XIV, I object to my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will be read the \nsecond time on the next legislative day.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come here today to compliment the \nminority leader, Senator McConnell, for his resolution in our effort to \nput a balanced budget amendment onto the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\n  I come here today to tell you a little story about a friend of mine \nfrom Douglas, WY. I was in Douglas on Memorial Day. Every year on \nMemorial Day in Douglas, they have sunrise ceremony services in the \ncemetery where they raise the flag, go through the names of all the \nveterans from Converse County who have passed in the last year, put the \nflag back at halfstaff, 21-gun salute, and a time for people to come \ntogether and think about this great Nation and honor those who have \ngiven their lives.\n  After the ceremony this year, people were leaving the ceremony. My \nfriend Bernie Seebaum stopped me and said: You know, Senator--we have \nknown each other a long time. He is on Medicare now, Social Security, \nhas lived a long life, contributed to the community. He said: I don't \ncare if you do a number of things--if you raise taxes, cut Medicare, \ntake away Social Security--as long as you use it to pay off this debt, \nthis $14 trillion debt.\n  I said: Bernie, the problem is, if Congress ever does something like \nthat, they are going to get the money and they are just going to spend \nit.\n  The first thing we need to do is amend the Constitution so that we \nactually balance the budget. Then you can start talking about ways to \npay off this incredible debt we have.\n  Here in Wyoming, we live within our means, balance the budget every \nyear. It has paid huge dividends for our State.\n  You know, you think about the Constitution, and our Founding Fathers \nproduced the greatest governing document, in my opinion, ever \nconceived. It was written at a time when our country's future was in \nserious doubt, when our country faced countless threats from abroad, \nthreats that were becoming increasingly difficult to confront, and when \nthe Federal Government lacked both the structure and the foundation to \ndo anything about it. But there we had the Constitution, written in \npart as a response to those challenges of the day, and it has endured \ntill this day. So amending the Constitution is not something to be \nundertaken lightly. The Constitution is the highest law of this great \nland. It has been amended, but infrequently and almost always at a time \nof crisis. Now, I support a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution because now is just such a time.\n  When the Constitution was written, they had to decide what the future \nwould bear, so when it was written, as that time came, we now have to \ndecide what sort of future we want for our country. Do we want a future \nwhere our children and grandchildren are overburdened by debt, where \nthe U.S. dollar is backed by nothing more than worthless promises, or \ndo we want a future where the only thing we can afford to spend money \non--what we are facing right now--is entitlements and interest on our \ndebt. Do we want a future where our country goes broke and a future \nwhere Washington lacks the political will to do anything about it or do \nwe want a future with less spending, lower taxes, and more \naccountability?\n  Facts are stubborn, and the numbers do not lie. This month, the \nCongressional Budget Office released a report saying that the outlook \nof America's debt is growing grimmer. The Hill newspaper put it best \nwhen it said that the new CBO report numbers are ``much worse than last \nyear's outlook.'' To anyone who does the math, this is not a surprise. \nEvery day, Washington borrows $4.1 billion more--borrowed over $4 \nbillion yesterday, $4 billion today, and we will do it again tomorrow. \nThat is over $2 million a minute, every minute. Washington did that \nyesterday, it is doing it today, and it will do it tomorrow. Of every \ndollar Washington spends, 41 cents of it is borrowed. Much of it is \nborrowed from China. Every American child born today and tomorrow and \nthe next day is born with an incredible debt of over $45,000. Next \nyear, of every dollar Washington spends, 68 cents will go for Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt.\n  If we as a nation continue down this path, Washington will spend all \nof what it takes in on these items alone. Everything else, from defense \nto education, will be paid for on a budget of borrowed money. So you \nmay ask, where is the money going to come from, and how will we ever \npay it back? Well, a lot of it is going to come from other countries, \ncountries that do not always have our interests, America's best \ninterests, at heart.\n  John Kennedy stood outside this building in 1961, 50 years ago. He \nsaid:\n\n       Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can \n     do for your country.\n\n  Well, a few years from now, that may change. It may change to: Ask \nnot what your country can do for you. Ask what your country must do for \nChina.\n  So consider this. When John Kennedy was President, America's total \ndebt was just over $300 billion, and we only owed 4 percent of our debt \nto foreign countries. Today, our total debt is over $14 trillion. And \ndebt isn't just a disaster for the distant future; our current debt is \nirresponsible and it is unsustainable. Even our military leaders have \ncondemned it. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike \nMullen, has said, ``The biggest threat to our national security is our \ndebt.'' The debt is the threat. We do not and we should not take the \nbiggest threat to our national security lightly.\n  The amount of debt we owe right now, today, is so high that it is \nhurting our employment at home. Experts tell us that our current debt \nis costing us 1 million jobs in America. Spending like this makes it \nharder for the private sector to create new jobs. Because of this, it \nis harder for American families to buy gas, to buy groceries, to buy \ncars, homes, to pay tuition for the kids to go to college. And it is \nharder to create jobs for those kids who will be graduating this year \nand next year and every year until we get the spending under control. \nEveryone in this body claims to understand that the situation is \nirresponsible and is unsustainable.\n  Back in February 2009, the President called experts to the White \nHouse for what he called a fiscal responsibility summit. In his opening \nremarks, this is what the President had to say:\n\n       Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past \n     few years, we cannot simply spend as we please and defer the \n     consequences to the next budget, the next administration, or \n     the next generation.\n\n  Well, I agreed with the President. He was right. So my question to \nthe President is, What have you done about it? Well, one thing he has \ndone is he has called together a debt commission. Late last year, the \ndebt commission released their report on America's fiscal situation, \nand the findings were sobering. According to the report, they said: The \nproblem is real. The solution will be painful. There is no easy way \nout. Everything must be on the table. Do you know what else they said? \nThey also said: Washington must lead.\n  Washington has not led. Instead, this administration has offered \nnothing but empty promises. As the White House makes promise after \npromise and speech after speech with no action--no action to back it \nup--it is clearer than ever that spoken promises have become broken \npromises.\n  This persistent push to put our fiscal crisis off until tomorrow is \nunacceptable and must end now. The first step toward doing that should \nbe to pass an amendment to our Constitution requiring Washington to \nbalance its budget. A balanced budget amendment would require \nWashington to spend no more money than it takes in each and every year. \nSuch an amendment would force Washington to live within its means. We \ncannot afford to continue to mortgage our children's future to pay for \nWashington's fiscal failures. Such an amendment would transform the \nkind of irresponsible spending that goes on today in this very body \ninto an impeachable violation of every legislator's constitutional oath \nof office.\n  The American people have overwhelmingly spoken on the wisdom of this \napproach. A recent poll conducted by Sachs/Mason Dixon showed that 65 \npercent of Americans support a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution, and 45 percent said they would be more likely to vote for \na candidate who did so. Of those, 68 percent of them were Independents, \nbut there is support for this among Republicans, among Independents, \nand among Democrats. When the American people call for Washington to \nlead in numbers this big, it is time for Washington to listen. Every \nsingle member of my party on this side of the aisle agrees. That is why \nall 47 Republican Members of this body have cosponsored the balanced \nbudget amendment. The American people are behind us, and they want us \nto act.\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n  Meanwhile, the administration and its allies on the other side of the \naisle have offered nothing but more empty rhetoric, more of the same \ntax-and-spend policies that made this economic situation worse. You \ntake a look at where we are and where we have been, they have made it \nworse.\n  I am reminded of a quote from Ronald Reagan. He said:\n\n       If the big spenders get their way, they'll charge \n     everything to your taxpayers' express card and believe me, \n     they will never leave home without it.\n\n  The big spenders can get away with charging everything to the \nAmerican people's taxpayer express card because no one--no one is \nforcing them to look at the bills. Now those bills are coming due, and \nthis administration and its liberal allies want a new taxpayer express \ncard and a blank check. They want a blank check to spend as they \ndesire, and they are not going to get it from me, not without specific \nreforms that will introduce accountability into this broken Washington \nprocess.\n  A balanced budget amendment will not solve every problem, but it is a \ncritical step in the right direction. It would ensure that Washington \nis constitutionally obligated to avoid the reckless overspending of the \npast.\n  Our debt crisis did not surface overnight. It certainly will not be \nsolved without a great deal of additional work.\n  Before any of that work can be done, Washington has to learn to live \nwithin its means the way families all across this great country do. It \nis time we show the American people they can trust their government \nwith their money again. It is time we lead today instead of deferring \nleadership until tomorrow. It is time we show the same courage our \nFounding Fathers did when this country was on the verge of financial \ncollapse. It is time for a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Then I can go back to my friend Bernie and his wife Sally, in \nDouglas, WY, and say: Bernie, finally, in Washington, they got it \nright. They realize, as we do in Wyoming, we have to live within our \nmeans. We have to balance our budget every year and then start working \non paying off this incredible debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I believe Senator Harkin is coming in \nthe next few minutes. In the meantime, I thought I would comment on the \nlegislation that has been before the body since late last week--to \nreduce the number of Senate confirmations of Presidential nominations, \nso the Senate can exercise its constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent more effectively.\n  This all goes back to our U.S. Constitution, article II, section 2, \nwhich says that one of the most important duties of the Senate is ``its \nadvice and consent responsibility.'' That is one of the well-known \nfunctions of the Senate. Many have written about advice and consent.\n  The Constitution says the President shall nominate, with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, ambassadors, ministers, judges, and other \nofficers of the United States. Today, there are about 1,400 of those \nofficers. When President Kennedy was President, there were about 286, \nmore or less. Under President Clinton, there were about 914, more or \nless. It continually goes up. This includes a large number of part-time \nadvisory positions, such as the Library Advisory Board and a variety of \nother boards. That is why the Founders put into the Constitution \nanother provision, which says Congress may, by law, vest the \nappointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the \nPresident alone, in the courts of law, and heads of departments.\n  It is up to us to make sure we don't trivialize the constitutional \nresponsibility we have, so we define the number of men and women whom \nthe President nominates, who require advice and consent, and we define \nthe ones who don't. We have not done a good job deciding which ones did \nnot. Over the last few days, the Senate has decided to remove 169 of \nthe 1,400 nominations from the advise and consent requirement. It is \ndebating, right now, removing another 272 full-time or part-time \npositions and putting them in an expedited process, so we will have \naffected 450 or so of the 1,400 nominations, either by removing them \nfrom advice and consent or speeding up the process. This will permit us \nto focus more attention on the job we are sent to do, which is to do a \ngood job of evaluating the most important offices.\n  Just one indication of how we have been trivializing the \nresponsibility to decide who does deserve advice and consent and who \ndoesn't is that only about 3 percent of all the Presidential \nnominations in the last Congress actually were deemed important enough \nto have a rollcall vote on the floor of the Senate. Ninety-seven \npercent were deemed not important enough. Of course, they were not. \nThey were valuable people, but they were part-time advisory board \nmembers who were part of a board where an executive director, for \nexample, already reported to someone who was confirmed by the \nPresident.\n  We had examples of positions being confirmed by the Senate who \nreported to someone, who reported to someone, who reported to someone, \nwho reported to someone else--all of them confirmed by advice and \nconsent. So we made a modest step in the direction of helping us \nexecute and exercise our Constitutional duty under article II, section \n2, in a more effective way.\n  This resolution we are debating, unlike the bill this morning, does \nnot remove one single person from the right of advice and consent. It \nexpedites it in the following way: The President's nomination would \ncome to the desk here--and this is after the President has done all his \nvetting--and then the relevant committee, say, the Finance Committee or \nthe Judiciary Committee, would go through its usual exercise of asking \nthe nominee to answer questions and provide all that information. When \nthat nomination first comes here, that information is listed on the \nSenate Executive Calendar that we Senators and staffers read. Then, \nwhen the information is all gathered by the relevant committee, that is \nindicated. Then there is a full 10 days for all of us to look at that. \nIf a single Senator says he or she would like for this nominee to go on \nto the committee for a hearing and then for the traditional markup, \nthat happens. But if all 100 Senators say they looked at the \ninformation and it is not necessary to go to that extra time, expense, \nand delay, then it moves to the Executive Calendar, and the majority \nleader can bring it up whenever he or she wishes.\n  What we have done is, in approximately 450 cases, we have affected \nthe 1,400 nominations that are subject to advice and consent. We have \neither eliminated the requirement or we have expedited the process and \nmade it possible for us to focus more attention on those deserving the \nmost important attention.\n  One other aspect--and I see the Senator from Oregon here and perhaps \nhe wishes to speak, so I will conclude my remarks with this. There is \none other important aspect that we deal with here. It may be the most \nimportant thing we can do. The first one I discussed was slowing down \nthe trivialization of the Senate's advice and consent constitutional \nduty. That is what the first part of what we are doing does. The bill \ndid that, which we have already passed. The resolution does that, which \nwe are now debating.\n  The second aspect that was dealt with in the bill this morning is \ndealing with the phenomenon of what I call innocent until nominated. We \nhave developed a practice in this town of making or having the \nPresident select an otherwise unsuspecting distinguished citizen from \nSioux City or Nashville or Bangor or Sacramento and after going through \nan FBI check and other things, nominated that person for some position \ndeserving of advice and consent. By the time that person makes his or \nher way through all the executive vetting process, by the time people \npore over the tax returns and answer multiple questions--often the same \nquestion asked in different ways--they have likely got an inaccuracy in \nthere somewhere. Then their name is sent up here and the committee \ninvestigates them and asks them many of the same questions and they \nmight have an inconsistency. Then they show up for a publicized hearing \nwith their family and, all of a sudden, they are made out to be a \ncommon criminal because they made a mistake trying to decipher these \nforms.\n  A former majority leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, and his wife,\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nformer Senator Nancy Kassebaum, went to Japan a few years ago as \nPresident George H.W. Bush's nominee as Ambassador to Japan--Senator \nBaker was. All of us knew Senator Baker. He was voted by the Senate the \nmost admired Senator by the Democrats as well as the Republicans when \nhe was here. All the Senators who were here at the time knew Senator \nKassebaum, his wife. Yet Senator Baker told me he had to spend $250,000 \nin legal and accounting fees just to make his way carefully through the \nnomination process, with all the executive vetting and all the vetting \nthe committees did, just so he would not make a mistake and just so he \nwould not be subject to this ``innocent until nominated'' syndrome.\n  The bill we passed this morning simply establishes a process. If the \nbill should pass the House and be signed by the President, then we \nwould have a working group of people appointed by the Senate--people \nappointed by the executive branch--and we would work together to try to \nsimplify the executive forms and the congressional forms that we use to \nsee if we can have a smart form, a simple form that perhaps we could \nall use; and then at least, for the most part, a nominee, when \nnominated by the President, could fill out a single form, which could \nthen be used by all of us who need to know basic information, such as \nwhat was their income last year. We can ask the question: Do we need to \nknow every single residence address they ever had in their life if they \nare going to be on an advisory board, for example, for the United \nStates?\n  That practice will have to be done with respect to the constitutional \nseparation of powers. The executive branch will have to create its own \ndocuments. The Senate will have to create its own. If we work together \nand create a smart form--and Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have \nmade important contributions to the process of how candidates are \nvetted, and the forms--we will not only have slowed down the \ntrivialization of the Senate's duty of advice and consent by doing a \nbetter job deciding who not to confirm, we will also have reduced the \nphenomenon of innocent until nominated, which has not only made it \ndifficult for Presidents to staff the government, delayed their ability \nto form a government, but unnecessarily harassed otherwise honorable \nmen and women who are asked to serve their government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes and that Senator Collins be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes following my remarks; further, that following \nSenator Collins' remarks, the Senate recess until 5:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, we have had a lot of discussion on the \nfloor of this Chamber about the challenge of our deficit and our debt, \nand these are indeed very important issues.\n  It is important to remember exactly how we got here because it was \nonly one decade ago that we were running large surpluses at the \nconclusion of the Clinton administration. In fact, these surpluses were \nso large that economists were starting to argue over just what would we \ndo if we paid off our entire debt. Didn't there need to be instruments \nof last resort, of great security, such as Treasury bonds? Didn't we \nneed to preserve some deficit or debt in order to have that instrument \navailable to stabilize society?\n  Well, would it not be great to have that debate now? I remember being \nabsolutely thrilled that we were going to turn over a debt-free America \nto our children. But what ensued? President Bush had a different view. \nHe said: You know what. Let's spend these surpluses we are generating \nand do breaks for the best off in our society. Let's take and establish \na new, major program--Medicare Part D--and not pay for it. Let's embark \non wars around this planet and not raise funds to pay for them.\n  The result of that was that those tremendous surpluses were reduced \nto huge deficits in short order.\n  Indeed, the 10-year projection went from a $5 trillion surplus to a \n$5 trillion shortfall. It is why some folks call President Bush the $10 \ntrillion man--because he managed to do $10 trillion worth of damage to \nour economy. But that was only the beginning because then there was \nderegulation of the mortgage industry which resulted in predatory \nlending, liar loans, teaser rates that exploded after 2 years, and \nkickbacks allowed to the originators so that they didn't even have any \nsort of fair presentation to families negotiating the most important \nfinancial instrument in their lives--their home mortgage. The meltdown \nthat came from that extraordinary regulatory abuse resulted in another \n$5 trillion in debt. So that is how we got there.\n  Now we have a certain pattern we see on this floor in which Members \nof this Chamber--many of the Members across the aisle stand up and say: \nWe want to protect the programs for the best off, but we want to cut \nthe basic programs that serve working Americans in our Nation. Quite \nfrankly, I think they have it exactly backward, and if you think I am \nmaking this up, let's just review recent history.\n  The December deal on the continuing resolution--this increased our \ndebt by $\\1/2\\ trillion, and virtually every Member across this aisle \nvoted for it. I voted against a $\\1/2\\ trillion increase. And a big \nchunk of that $\\1/2\\ trillion increase in our debt was there because of \nthe insistence on providing the continuation of the President Bush \nbreaks for the best off in our society. Now, I don't know how one can \nrise and talk about cutting our investment in infrastructure in \nAmerica. I don't know how one can rise and talk about cutting support \nfor those who are needing to get food from food banks and at the same \ntime be defending bonus breaks for the very best off in our society.\n  The December deal wasn't an anomaly because it has happened \nrepeatedly. We had a vote on oil and gas subsidies for the most \npowerful five companies in our economy, five very large oil and gas \ncompanies. Instead of getting rid of an anachronistic provision that \nwas put there when the cost or the value of a barrel of oil was very \nlow and the oil industry said it needed to have some support, instead \nof cutting that, many in this Chamber voted to continue it, continue \nthis break for the most powerful corporations, a break that was \ndesigned for a very different period of time when oil wasn't $100 a \nbarrel but was a fraction of that--$20 a barrel.\n  No, these aren't the only two recent cases. We have the attack on \nMedicare. Indeed, we have the plan that has been widely supported by my \ncolleagues across the aisle, both in this Chamber and across the \nbuilding, in which they say: Let's end Medicare as we know it because \nwe need to save money, and we are going to do it on the backs of \nseniors, but we are not going to take a look at the breaks we voted in \nover the last quarter century for the best off in our society.\n  Well, this systematic plan works like this because these breaks for \nthe best off have been done through the Tax Code, and every American \nunderstands that whether you give somebody $5,000 in the Tax Code or \nyou give them a $5,000 grant, it is exactly the same thing. We had that \ndebate over the ethanol subsidies just recently. Everyone understands \nit is exactly the same thing, but by putting these programs for the \nwealthy and well-connected in the Tax Code, now my colleagues are \nrising to say: We will not touch those programs because they are in the \nTax Code. Now, if they were in the appropriations bill, then we would \nbe willing to talk about it, but because we were clever enough to put \nthem in the Tax Code, no, they are off limits.\n  This is a sophisticated way of saying that the programs for the \nwealthy and well-connected in America are off limits, but the programs \nfor working families are the ones we are going to cut. It is those \nprograms for the hungry, it is those programs for the unemployed, it is \nthat health care program for our seniors, it is the investment in \ninfrastructure that will build America--those are the ones we will cut.\n  My colleagues and citizens of the United States, we must have a \nnational debate, a debate that doesn't employ this type of smoke and \nmirrors to try to protect the programs written for the\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nwealthy and well-connected while attacking the programs for working \nfamilies. That is unacceptable, and I and others will rise on this \nfloor and point it out time and time again, that using that simple ruse \nby saying only the appropriations bills on the table but not the tax \nbill is unacceptable.\n  I am going to tell you that it must not be that we make our kids' \neducation more expensive by diminishing Pell grants, that we make our \nparents' health care more expensive by obliterating Medicare as we know \nit, that we impoverish the future of this Nation by not investing in \nour infrastructure, while continuing to defend the programs that were \ndeveloped for the best off, the wealthy, and the well-connected over \nthe last 25 years and saying those are off the table. They must be on \nthe table. We must fight for an America that works for working \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last night, the Senate unanimously \napproved S. Res. 185, a resolution I introduced with my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Cardin. Our resolution sends a clear message to the \nPalestinian Authority that any effort to seek unilateral recognition at \nthe United Nations will have serious consequences for future American \naid to the Palestinians.\n  The United States provides nearly $550 million each year in bilateral \nassistance to the Palestinians. This aid is not an entitlement, \nparticularly at a time when we have an unsustainable debt of some $14 \ntrillion. Rather, this aid is predicated on a good-faith commitment \nfrom the Palestinians to the peace process.\n  By unanimously passing our resolution last evening, the Senate has \nsent an unmistakable message that efforts by the Palestinians to seek \nindependent statehood outside of direct negotiations with Israel do not \nreflect good-faith actions toward peace.\n  Negotiations have been a fundamental principle of the peace process. \nIt was in September of 1993 when Yasser Arafat committed to Israeli \nPrime Minister Rabin that outstanding issues would be resolved through \nnegotiations. This principle has also underpinned the Oslo Accords, the \nRoad Map for Peace, and other Middle East peace efforts.\n  We want to see a true and lasting peace between two states--a \ndemocratic Jewish State of Israel and a viable democratic Palestinian \nState. Since 2002, it has been the policy of our country to support a \ntwo-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but the road to \npeace is through negotiations, not by subverting them and making a \nunilateral case before the United Nations.\n  Unfortunately, the United Nations has a well-documented record of \nbeing hijacked to chastise Israel, one of America's closest allies. In \ntotal, the United States, under Presidents of both political parties, \nhas been forced to veto 11 different U.N. Security Council resolutions \nregarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n  I am pleased to note that the current U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., \nSusan Rice, has vetoed the latest U.N. resolution regarding \nsettlements, which, like Palestinian statehood, is the key issue in the \npeace process. The resolution passed by the Senate urges the President \nto maintain this strong position and to announce his unwavering intent \nto veto any resolution that is not the result of direct negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians.\n  I wish to thank Senator Cardin for working with me in drafting this \nresolution. When Senator Cardin and I first discussed introducing this \nmeasure, the Palestinian Authority had not yet agreed to establish a \nunity government with Hamas--a truly disastrous decision. That action \nhas made it all that much more critical that the Senate be firmly on \nrecord that aid to the Palestinians is now in jeopardy. If Hamas \ncontinues to reject negotiations or peace with Israel, we must suspend \nthis assistance.\n  During his address before a joint session of Congress in March, \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu succinctly described the \nheart of the matter. He said:\n\n       This conflict has never been about the establishment of a \n     Palestinian state. It has always been about the existence of \n     the Jewish state.\n\n  We must remember those words.\n  We must also never forget that Hamas is responsible for the deaths of \nmore than 500 innocent civilians, including two dozen American \ncitizens. It has been designated by our government as a foreign \nterrorist organization and a specially designated terrorist \norganization.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made it clear that the United \nStates will not fund a Palestinian Government that includes Hamas \nunless and until Hamas renounces violence, recognizes Israel, and \nagrees to abide by the previous obligation of the Palestinian \nAuthority. I urge the administration to suspend aid until such time as \nHamas demonstrates a clear commitment to following these principles.\n  Madam President, let me also thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, for \ndischarging this resolution so that it could be considered and passed \nby the full Senate before our Fourth of July recess. The passage of \nthis resolution could not have been more timely.\n  According to press reports, the Palestinian delegation has made the \nrounds with nearly a dozen delegations in New York this week to build \nsupport for their bid to have a United Nations-recognized state. \nPalestinian Ambassadors from around the world are meeting in July to \ndiscuss their plans in Madrid. They have been instructed to cancel \nvacations because of the importance of this coming period.\n  I submit that if the Palestinians were only willing to invest as much \nenergy into the peace process with Israel as they have into this ill-\nadvised rush to the United Nations, we could see the beginnings of a \ngenuine and lasting peace in the region. I do not know if the \nPalestinians will have the support among the 192 members of the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly. However, the Palestinians must understand that the \ncost of seeking such a vote will seriously jeopardize U.S. financial \nassistance and that is evident from the 88 Members of the Senate who \ncosponsored the important resolution that was unanimously passed last \nevening.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4201-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nRhode Island, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 522\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, because of the heavy fires that are \nblazing in New Mexico, our colleague Senator Udall cannot be here \nbecause he is out there dealing with forest fires. He has an amendment \nhe has filed to S. Res. 116, the bill now before us in the Senate, and \non his behalf, I will be calling it up. It is amendment No. 522, and I \nwant to take a couple of minutes to explain the amendment.\n  Mr. President, basically the amendment is very simple, and I will \nread it in its entirety:\n\n       The second undesignated paragraph of paragraph 2 of rule \n     XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be \n     brought to a close? And if that question shall be decided in \n     the affirmative\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\n     by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn--except \n     on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules, in which \n     case the necessary or affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of \n     the Senators present and voting--then said measure, motion, \n     or other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished \n     business, shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion \n     of all other business until disposed of.\n\n  And this is already rule XXII. Here is the part that Senator Udall \nwould amend:\n\n       On a nomination to an Executive Branch position requiring \n     the advise and consent of the Senate, the necessary \n     affirmative vote shall be a majority of the Senators duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n\n  So the Udall amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor, would \nbasically say on executive branch nominations that come before the \nSenate that when debate is brought to a close there would not need to \nbe 60 votes. You could have an affirmative 51 votes and that measure \nwould pass, that nomination would be passed by the Senate. So, \ntherefore, we would not need the supermajority of 60 votes to pass a \nnominee.\n  Again, it comes as no surprise to Members of the Senate that Senator \nUdall and I have worked together to try to reform the rules to reduce \nto an absolute minimum, if not get rid of entirely, the filibuster. \nWell, it is obvious we never accomplished that, but it seems to me as \nwe are changing the rules here on changing the policy on how we are \ngoing to deal with nominees--and I think this is long overdue--this is \nthe proper time to address this point, that on a nomination to an \nexecutive branch, it ought to be 51 votes, not 60 votes. So that is \nwhat the amendment does. It basically says on a nomination that it only \nrequires 51 votes to pass the nomination and not 60 votes.\n  What is the pending business? Is it Coburn amendment 521?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 522.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Udall of New \n     Mexico, for himself and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 522.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a majority vote threshold for proceeding to \n                              nominations)\n\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. ESTABLISHING MAJORITY VOTE THRESHOLD FOR PROCEEDING \n                   TO NOMINATIONS.\n\n       The second undesignated paragraph of paragraph 2 of rule \n     XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be \n     brought to a close?'' And if that question shall be decided \n     in the affirmative by three-fifths of the Senators duly \n     chosen and sworn--except on a measure or motion to amend the \n     Senate rules, in which case the necessary affirmative vote \n     shall be two-thirds of the Senators present and voting--then \n     said measure, motion, or other matter pending before the \n     Senate, or the unfinished business, shall be the unfinished \n     business to the exclusion of all other business until \n     disposed of. On a nomination to an Executive Branch position \n     requiring the advise and consent of the Senate, the necessary \n     affirmative vote shall be a majority of the Senators duly \n     chosen and sworn.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Basically, again, what it repeats on nominations to the \nexecutive branch is it would not require 60 votes but only 51 votes of \nthe Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa is not relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sustains the point of order. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. This situation recalls the \ndebate we had at the beginning of the year when a number of Senators \nfelt as though we needed to make the Senate a more effective \ninstitution, which is always a noble goal, but we had some differences \nof opinion about how to do that. One group of Senators, including \nSenator Udall, Senator Harkin, and others, renewed the effort to \nbasically say the Senate would be a majoritarian body which would \ndecide questions with 51 votes. To most Americans, that sounds like the \nnormal order of business, and it is. We grow up in the first, second, \nand third grades selecting the class president. If someone gets a \nmajority of the votes, that person wins. But in the Senate, over its \nhistory, we have had a different process because the Senate serves a \ndifferent function.\n  The House is a majoritarian institution. If a party wins a majority \nin the House, a freight train rolls through the House and the bill is \npassed and sent to the Senate. The Senate, throughout its history, has \nbeen the saucer into which the tea is poured to cool it a little bit. \nIn other words, it takes a little more deliberation here to pass \nsomething. That can be very frustrating. It can slow things down, but \nthe process was designed that way. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any \nneed for two different bodies.\n  So we have one body which can change with every election every 2 \nyears and pass something such as the health care law by a majority \nvote. Let's take another example: Ending the secret ballot in union \nelections, which the House of Representatives, under Democratic \ncontrol, did pass. But it didn't pass the Senate, because in the \nSenate, there are rules in which we need 60 votes to pass most \nimportant pieces of legislation. The shoe is on the other foot too. If \nthe Republican House of Representatives were to pass, let's say, a tort \nreform bill that our Democratic friends didn't like, we would have a \nhard time passing it over here. It would take 60 votes, and that would \nmean that we 47 Senate Republicans, even if we were all for it, would \nhave to persuade 13 or 14 of our Democratic friends to join us.\n  The theory of the Senate is that it forces consensus. It doesn't \nalways work that way, but that is the idea. We have had a pretty good \nexample of it with the legislation we have been debating over the last \nfew days. We have a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who agreed \nwe needed to change the Senate nominations process and we had the \nsupport of both the Democratic and Republican leaders. Because of this \ncoalition we were able to move the bill to the floor without the \ncloture motion. We were able to allow any relevant amendment to come to \nthe floor. We were able to pass a bill earlier today and it looks as \nthough we are going to be able to pass a resolution this evening that \nwill complete our work. The bill this morning got 79 votes. I hope the \nresolution this afternoon gets at least that many votes. That is the \nway the Senate should work.\n  I am glad the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, on behalf \nof Senator Udall, is out of order and not relevant to this discussion. \nEven if it were relevant, I think it would be the wrong step for us to \ntake. I think it is better to have a Senate that forces consensus by \nrequiring 60 votes on big issues. That avoids what Alexis de \nTocqueville called the tyranny of the majority in his book ``Democracy \nin America.'' He saw two great threats to the new American democracy at \nthat time; one was Russia, as he said, and he turned out to be \nprescient on that. The other one was the possibility of the tyranny of \nthe majority--that the majority would get control and simply run over \nminority rights. That cannot be done in the Senate because there have \nto be 60 votes on big issues for the issues to pass. That means when \none sets out to pass most pieces of legislation, if one wants to do it \nin a purely partisan way, one is not likely to succeed. If one wants to \ndo it in a way that gets a result, one is going to have to form a \ncoalition of Republicans and Democrats, as we have here with these \nnominations reforms.\n  This discussion by Senator Udall, Senator Harkin, and others wasn't \nfor naught because it initiated a debate that ended up with some \nchanges in Senate procedures which we think are for the better. One of \nthese changes was the abolition of secret holds, which some Senators in \nthis body, including Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley, have been \nadvocating for years--more than a decade. That was done. The \ndiscussions earlier this year with Senator Harkin and Senator Udall \nresulted in\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\nthe legislation we passed earlier today, which helps the Senate \nexercise its constitutional duty to advice and consent by doing a \nbetter job of deciding which nominations do not deserve advice and \nconsent. So we eliminated the requirement for advice and consent on 169 \npositions of the 1,400 that now require Senate confirmation. Most of \nthose were part-time advisory boards. We didn't need those to be \nconfirmed.\n  We eliminated nearly 3,000 advice-and-consent requirements on public \nhealth officers and the NOAA Officer Corps. They are very valuable \nFederal employees, but we were confirming them in groups of 300 \nnominees at times. No Senator knew whom he or she was confirming, and \nthat trivializes the whole constitutional duty of advice and consent, \nwhich is in the Constitution of the United States in article II, \nsection 2.\n  Another reform we are making and will proceed with is reducing the \nphenomenon of innocent until nominated. I have spoken about this \nseveral times on the floor. It is a situation whereby we take an \nunsuspecting citizen of the United States that the President recruits \nto a position in the government. Then that person begins to go through \nthis gauntlet of complicated forms that have built up over the years. \nIt first started with the executive branch, where a person is asked to \nfill out every place they have lived since they were 17 years of age \nand define income three different ways. And by the time they get to the \nSenate committee whose job it is to investigate and confirm that person \nand they fill out all their forms, the person is bound to make some \nmistake. Then they are hauled up in front of the Committee with the \nspotlights on them and they have told a lie inadvertently.\n  I mentioned earlier today the former Senate majority leader, Howard \nBaker, who was voted most admired Senator by Democrats and Republicans. \nHe had to spend $250,000 of his own money on lawyers when President \nBush nominated him to be the Ambassador to Japan--absolutely \nridiculous. Republicans and Democrats who have served in personnel \noffices and Chiefs of Staff to the last several Presidents all have \nsaid this practice of innocent until nominated is a great disservice to \nthe American Government.\n  I see Senator Schumer on the floor. He and I will be meeting with the \nWhite House personnel director as soon as this legislation is approved \nby the House and signed by the President. We hope the working group \nthat will be set up under the legislation will produce what we call a \nsmart form, so that if the President asks a citizen to serve their \ngovernment, that person can fill out a single form for most questions. \nThen, the various offices of the executive branch that need the \ninformation can get the same information. When the nomination is sent \nto the Senate, perhaps even we can take some of that information and \nuse the same form to get it for us. It doesn't interfere with the \nseparation of powers. The executive can do whatever it wishes to do. We \nin the Senate can do whatever we wish to do.\n  We have made some progress as a result of those discussions earlier \nin the year. It is modest progress, but I think any time we eliminate \nconfirmation for 169 positions out of 1,400, any time we expedite about \n270 more, any time we stop the practice of confirming box loads of \nnominees without even knowing who is in there, then we have done \nsomething to avoid the trivialization of our constitutional duty to \nadvice and consent. If we can make a further step with avoiding the \ninnocent until nominated phenomenon, the work Senator Harkin, Senator \nUdall, and others have done will have made some progress. The work of \nSenators Harkin, Udall and other will have made progress even though we \ndidn't adopt their rule to turn the Senate into a majoritarian \ninstitution.\n  I appreciate the spirit with which Senator Harkin offered the \namendment. He and Senator Udall worked on the amendment. I think they \nhelped reduce some steps which will help make the Senate a more \neffective institution. We still have a ways to go and we will continue \nto work on those things.\n  I see Senator Schumer is here. I compliment him for his work on this \nand in the way he has gone about it. He and I, working with the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader, have created an environment \nfor this bill that didn't require enforcement of a cloture motion. An \nenvironment that allowed all relevant amendments to come to the floor, \nthat allowed all the debate Senators seemed to want and that passed the \nbill. We hope we are coming to a point where we can pass the resolution \nand take these steps to improve the effectiveness of the Senate.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:10 \np.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Coburn amendment \nNo. 521; that all other provisions of the previous order with respect \nto the Coburn amendment remain in effect; that upon disposition of the \nCoburn amendment, the managers' amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to; that following the disposition of the managers' amendment, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution, as amended; \nthat there be no other amendments and no other motions or points of \norder in order to the resolution other than budget points of order and \nthe applicable motions to waive; further, that the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that Mr. \nCoburn, the Senator from Oklahoma, be given 5 minutes to speak on his \namendment just before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if my colleague from Tennessee has \nyielded, I will read a brief statement about what we are voting on.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. Res. 116, which streamlines \ncertain nominations through the Senate. Once again, I wish to thank my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Alexander, for his hard work on this \nresolution and his insight into the nomination process. I am grateful \nhe is the ranking member of the Rules Committee. I thank the chairman \nand ranking members of the Homeland Security Committee, Senators \nLieberman and Collins, for their steadfast dedication to the efforts to \nreform the way the Senate conducts business. Additionally, Leader Reid \nand Republican Leader McConnell gave their support in time to work \nthrough this package.\n  Earlier today, we passed the first piece of the nomination reform \npackage, S. 679, which eliminates certain positions from Senate \nconfirmation. It is our hope this package thaws out this institution. \nThe resolution passed through our committee, the Rules Committee, \nunanimously back in May--this resolution did--and it is a bipartisan \neffort. Now we are considering the corresponding resolution which \nstreamlines other nominations. For certain nominations, once received, \nthey will be placed in a new category of the calendar. At that point, \nthe chair will send out the questionnaire. Once he or she certifies it \nhas been returned, the nomination will move to a second new category on \nthe calendar. It will sit there for 10 days. If there are no \nobjections, the nomination will then move directly to the Executive \nCalendar, with the presumption that these noncontroversial positions \nwould be passed by unanimous consent.\n  At any time while the nomination is in either of these two \ncategories, anyone can object, including the chair, and have that \nnomination referred back to the full committee, as with any other \nnominee. We hope this will clear the way for confirmation of these \npositions.\n  Additionally, this resolution will allow committees to turn their \nfocus to issues that affect the American voter. Time spent on \nnomination hearings and markups can now be spent on other nominees or \non other legislation to improve the condition, for instance, of our \nmiddle class. As I said earlier, we are in no way abdicating our advise \nand consent duties, we are enhancing them.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this resolution. I \nencourage them to vote against the amendment of our good friend from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn. With this resolution, the Senate and our \ncommittees can turn our attention to pressing issues that affect us \nall.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, 6 months ago, I joined \nmy colleagues and friends Senator Merkley of Oregon and Senator Harkin \nof Iowa to push for fundamental reforms in how the Senate operates. The \nreason we did that was simple: the Senate was broken. The unprecedented \nabuse of the filibuster and of other procedural tactics was routinely \npreventing the Senate from getting its work done. It was preventing us \nfrom doing the job the American people sent us here to do.\n  Although the reform proposals we offered in January did not pass, I \nthought some good came out of the process. We passed resolutions to \neliminate secret holds and the delaying tactic of forcing the reading \nof amendments. We also agreed to consider legislation in the future \nthat would exempt many executive branch nominees from the Senate \nconfirmation process. Legislation that we are considering on this floor \ntoday.\n  Although these were steps in the right direction, I believe there is \nstill a long way to go before this body can function as our Founders \nintended. The unfortunate reality is that over the last six months, \nthis already broken institution has become even more dysfunctional.\n  Let's consider what the Senate has accomplished this year. A \nBloomberg article from last week notes that, ``just 18 measures have \ncleared Congress and become law this year, and only four of those \noriginated in the Senate--including two that named courthouses.'' That \nis simply unacceptable. At a time when our country needs us to act, we \ndo almost nothing.\n  A Washington Post article from June 9 discusses quorum calls in the \nSenate. It states:\n\n       This year--even as Washington lurches closer to a debt \n     crisis--the Senate has spent a historic amount of time \n     performing this time-killing ritual. Quorum calls have taken \n     up about a third of its time since January.\n\n  That is the equivalent of more than 17 8-hour days wasted in quorum \ncalls. That article goes on to state that there have been just 87 \nrollcall votes as of June 9 compared to 205 in the same period in 2009.\n  I don't blame one party for these problems--both sides are at fault. \nWhile Republicans use delaying tactics to slow down the floor calendar, \nDemocrats repeatedly try to avoid tough votes. It is no wonder \nCongress's approval ratings are at an all-time low. Instead of working \nto solve the major problems our country faces, we engage in partisan \nwarfare for political gain.\n  The Senate confirmation process for executive branch nominees is a \nprime example of how our rules prevent this body from functioning as it \nwas intended. This used to be a fairly straightforward process.\n  When I was a kid, my father served in the Congress and later as \nSecretary of the Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Once I \ngrew up and was elected to the Congress myself, I often talked with him \nabout the differences between his era in Washington and mine.\n  One of my biggest frustrations was the Senate's inability to bring \nexecutive confirmations to an up-or-down vote. I told my dad, ``the \nPresident and Cabinet Secretaries don't have their team. How can they \ndo the job the American people sent them here to do without a team to \nback them up?'' Do you know what he said to me? He said, ``Tom, I had \nvirtually my whole team in place the first 2 weeks.'' Imagine today if \nthe whole team for the Department of the Interior, or any other \ndepartment, was confirmed in the first 2 weeks of the administration.\n  There have been many news articles about how the Senate has dragged \nits feet in confirming President Obama's team. A New York Times article \nfrom August 2009 stated that, ``Seven months into his presidency, fewer \nthan half of his top appointees are in place advancing his agenda.''\n  A February 2010 Washington Post article found that ``46 of Obama's \nnominees have waited at least three months to be confirmed and nine \nhave waited twice that long. . . . Obama's nominee to head the General \nServices Administration was confirmed only last week--by a 96-0 vote, \nno less--after a hold stalled her nomination for nine months.''\n  Perhaps what is most disturbing to me is that many nominees are held \nup purely because of their policy views, and not because they are \nunqualified. I believe that the president has a right to appoint people \nwho share his policy views--it would be ridiculous to expect otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, many well-qualified nominees have been blocked because \nof their policy views, and not because of their qualifications.\n  A perfect example is Dawn Johnson, who was President Obama's nominee \nto head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Johnson was a \nrespected law professor and former top assistant in the Office of Legal \nCounsel in the Clinton administration. But Republican's cited her \nstrong pro-choice views as grounds for blocking her nomination. After \nmore than a year of her nomination being stalled in the Senate, she \ndecided that she had had enough and withdrew from consideration.\n  Yesterday, more than 6 months after she was nominated, the Senate \nconfirmed Virginia Seitz to head the Office of Legal Counsel. Sadly, \nshe is the first Senate-confirmed head of OLC since 2004. For 7 years, \nwe have not confirmed a nominee to this position because of partisan \nbattles over the nominees' policy views. The last Senate-confirmed \nnominee, Jack Goldsmith, recently said that, ``It's important that \nthere be a Senate-confirmed person at the head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel, both because it helps secure the independence of the office \nwhen it's making legal judgments and because it helps give the office \nmore authority, both within the Justice Department and throughout the \ngovernment.'' Yet we let it go 7 years without confirming a nominee to \nlead the office.\n  Another recent example is the nomination of James Cole to be the \nJustice Department Deputy Attorney General. Cole first joined the \ndepartment in 1979 as part of the Attorney General's Honors Program. He \nserved there for 13 years--first as a trial attorney in the Criminal \nDivision, and later as the Deputy Chief of the Division's Public \nIntegrity Section, the office that handles investigation and \nprosecution of corruption cases against both Democratic and Republican \nelected and appointed officials at all levels of government.\n  Although Cole's record is exemplary, his nomination was blocked for \nover a year. Why? Because he believed it made sense to try some \nterrorism suspects in Federal courts, rather than military commissions. \nA view that I, and many legal scholars and constitutional experts, \nhappen to share with Mr. Cole.\n  In May, 353 days after his selection, Democrats forced a cloture vote \non Cole's nomination, but were unable to overcome the Republican \nfilibuster. This was the first time in history that a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral nominee was filibustered. Let's hope it's also the last.\n  After a few more weeks of negotiations, we were finally able to have \nan up or down vote yesterday on the Cole nomination, and he was \nconfirmed 55-42. Because of the forest fires in my State, I \nunfortunately missed this vote, as did two of my Democratic colleagues. \nIf we had all voted for Mr. Cole, he would have been confirmed \noverwhelmingly 58-42, with bipartisan support.\n  How does a nominee get stuck in the Senate confirmation process for \nover a year, only to be finally confirmed by a bipartisan majority? \nSimple--our confirmation process is broken.\n  I will mention one final example, although there are many more.\n  Just this month, Peter Diamond withdrew as President Obama's nominee \nto the Federal Reserve Board. Diamond's nomination was blocked because \na small minority of senators questioned whether he was qualified and \nhad enough experience in conducting monetary policy. I tend to believe \nthat he was qualified, as he won the Nobel Prize in economics last \nyear.\n  I give you all these examples because the bill we are considering \ntoday would not have affected these nominations in any way. While I \nappreciate the effort of the task force that produced this bill, it \ndoes nothing to prevent the abuse of the Senate rules in the \nconfirmation process.\n  In order to have real change in the process, the Senate rules must be\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\namended. As such, I have filed an amendment that will restore the \nproper role of the Senate's advise and consent responsibility.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would make the cloture threshold on \nexecutive branch nominees a majority of Senators chosen and sworn--51 \nif all seats are filled. The result is exactly what our framers \nintended--if the president nominates someone, and a majority of the \nSenate approves, that person is confirmed. Our current rules lead to a \nmuch more perverse result. Now, if the president nominates someone and \n59 Senators approve and 41 object, the nomination fails. How can we \nargue for this result?\n  My amendment only applies to executive branch nominees, so judicial \nnominees are still subject to a 60 vote cloture threshold. While I \ndon't believe judicial nominees should be filibustered either, I know \nmany of my colleagues are reluctant to give up the supermajority \ncloture requirement because judges are appointed for life.\n  I know some will ask me about what happens when we are in the \nminority and the president is a Republican--won't I want to be able to \nblock an extreme nominee? The short answer is no. While I might want to \nblock a nominee, I don't believe the Constitution gives me that right \nif a majority favors his or her confirmation.\n  If the American people elect a Republican president and the \nRepublicans become the majority party in the Senate, I would expect \nsome executive branch nominees that I disagree with on policy grounds. \nBut I believe that we must afford the President a significant degree of \ndeference to shape his Cabinet as he sees fit. If those nominees are \nqualified, I do not believe a minority of the Senate should be able to \nblock them.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have said the same thing in the \npast. When speaking on the floor about the nomination of Alberto \nGonzales to be Attorney General, Senator Kyl said that, ``When someone \nis qualified and has the confidence of the President . . . unless there \nis some highly disqualifying factor brought to our attention--[we] \nshould accede to the President's request for his nomination and confirm \nthe individual.'' Senator Hatch, a highly regarded constitutional \nscholar and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote in 2003:\n\n       The advice and consent clause [of the Constitution] is \n     clearly an up or down vote--a majority vote--on the floor of \n     the Senate. The Founding Fathers knew what a supermajority \n     vote was. . . . If they had wanted it to be a 60-vote margin \n     . . . they would have said so.\n\n  Senator Hatch also said on the floor in 2007:\n\n       Under the Constitution, the President has the primary \n     appointment authority. We check that authority, but we may \n     not hijack it. We may not use our role of advise and consent \n     to undermine the President's authority.\n\n  I hope that we can agree that our confirmation process is broken and \nthat we need significant reforms to restore the democratic process in \nthis body. Many of us have said as much when we are in the majority and \nour president's nominees are being held hostage by a small minority.\n  It's time for us to put partisanship aside and amend our rules so \nthat the President, regardless of his or her party affiliation, can get \na team in place and govern. I'm proud today to join once again with \nSenator Harkin and offer an amendment that will do just that. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. The Senate \nis broken and the only way we are going to fix it--to make it work once \nagain for the American people--is through substantive reform of the \nrules.\n  I ask that the news articles I mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 2011]\n\n           Senate Legislation May Slow, But Quorums Continue\n\n                       (By David A. Fahrenthold)\n\n       In the U.S. Senate, this is what nothing sounds like.\n       ``Mr. Akaka.''\n       At 9:36 a.m. on Thursday, a clerk with a practiced monotone \n     read aloud the name of Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii). The \n     chamber was nearly deserted. The senator wasn't there. Not \n     that she was really looking for him.\n       Instead, the clerk was beginning one of the Capitol's most \n     arcane rituals: the slow-motion roll calls that the Senate \n     uses to bide time.\n       These procedures, called ``quorum calls,'' usually serve no \n     other purpose than to fill up empty minutes on the Senate \n     floor. They are so boring, so quiet that C-SPAN adds in \n     classical music: otherwise, viewers might think their TV was \n     broken.\n       This year--even as Washington lurches closer to a debt \n     crisis--the Senate has spent a historic amount of time \n     performing this time-killing ritual. Quorum calls have taken \n     up about a third of its time since January, according to C-\n     SPAN statistics: more than 17 eight-hour days' worth of dead \n     air.\n       On Thursday, the Senate was at it again. At least on \n     ``Seinfeld,'' doing nothing came with a flunky bass line.\n       ``It's not even gridlock. It's worse than that,'' said \n     Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University \n     who once ran for the Senate himself as a Democrat. He said \n     ``gridlock'' implies that somebody was at least trying to get \n     legislation passed.\n       Instead, he said, this year ``they're not even trying to \n     get something done.''\n       To an outsider, a quorum call looks like a serious--if \n     dull--piece of congressional business. A clerk reads out \n     senators' names slowly, sometimes waiting 10 minutes or more \n     between them.\n       But it's usually a sham. The senators aren't coming. Nobody \n     expects them to. The ritual is a reaction to what the chamber \n     has become: a very fancy place that senators, often, are too \n     busy to visit.\n       This is what happened: Decades ago, senators didn't have \n     offices. They spent their days at their desks on the Senate \n     floor. So clerks really needed to call the roll to see if a \n     majority was ready for business.\n       Now, senators spend much of their time in committee rooms, \n     offices and elsewhere. If no big vote is on the horizon, \n     often nothing at all is happening on the Senate floor.\n       But Senate rules don't allow for nothing to happen. That \n     would require a formal adjournment, which would mean lots of \n     time-consuming parliamentary rigamarole.\n       Instead, the last senator to speak asks clerks to fill the \n     time by calling the roll.\n       ``It's just a matter of keeping the store lights on when \n     the customers aren't there,'' said Donald A. Ritchie the \n     Senate's official historian. The procedures are much less \n     common in the House, where the rules allow for a pause in \n     activity without a formal adjournment.\n       On Thursday morning, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) finished \n     talking about an airman who was killed in Afghanistan. He \n     looked around, realized he was alone, and suggested a quorum \n     call. ``Mr. Akaka,'' the clerk intoned.\n       Hatch left the floor. Minutes passed. It was so quiet that, \n     when a page carried out a glass of water, the clink of the \n     ice cubes could be heard up in the gallery. Tourists watched \n     blank-faced. Ten minutes passed. Some of the visitors got up \n     to leave.\n       After 12 minutes, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) showed up. \n     ``I ask that the proceedings of the quorum be dispensed \n     with,'' he said. That's how quorum calls usually end: The \n     next senator who wants to speak asks for a halt.\n       After Warner gave a brief speech on the value of federal \n     workers, it happened again. ``Mr. Akaka,'' the clerk said. \n     Twenty-one minutes of silence.\n       At a deli in the Senate's basement, it was clear this was \n     wearing on people. One Capitol employee asked another: Where \n     are you working today? ``Senate chamber,'' his buddy replied. \n     ``Shoot myself in the head.''\n       These sham roll calls have been a feature of Senate debate \n     for decades, but this year has been special: According to C-\n     SPAN, the Senate has spent more than 32 percent of its time \n     in quorum calls. That's more than in any comparable period \n     dating to 1997.\n       The main reason seems to be the bare-bones agenda pursued \n     by the Senate's Democratic leaders: There have been just 87 \n     roll-call votes so far, compared with 205 in the same period \n     during 2009. Senate Democrats have not even proposed an \n     official budget; the strategy appears to be to shield \n     vulnerable incumbents from controversial votes on spending.\n       ``Why are we here?'' asked Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), a \n     critic of the large number of quorum calls this year. ``The \n     Senate is not operating the way it was designed, because \n     politicians don't want to be on record.''\n       Democrats, on the other hand, say they haven't brought up \n     much legislation because they think Republicans will just \n     block it.\n       ``You always hope it'll get better,'' said Jon Summers, a \n     spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).\n       It might. There is an upcoming deadline to lift the \n     national debt ceiling, and that could produce major \n     legislation later this summer.\n       But not yet. This year, in fact, C-SPAN worries that its \n     library of classical background music has been over-used. It \n     is trying to expand its options, within a set of strict \n     conditions: The music must be ``calm and benign.'' No cannon-\n     booming ``1812 Overture.'' No funeral marches.\n       And it must not imply any comment on the nothingness \n     happening onscreen. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call \n     recently suggested Lady Gaga's ``Bad Romance.'' Non-starter.\n       C-SPAN has also started using a graphic showing tweets from \n     members of Congress. It's a signal that lawmakers are doing \n     something. Just not here.\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                    [From Bloomberg, June 21, 2011]\n\n  Snail's Pace in U.S. Senate Poses Hurdle to Effort To Reduce Deficit\n\n                   (By Laura Litvan and James Rowley)\n\n       Just 18 measures have cleared Congress and become law this \n     year, and only four of those originated in the Senate--\n     including two that named courthouses.\n       About one-third of the chamber's time has been taken up by \n     inactive ``quorum calls.'' Debate on one small-business \n     measure took a month, and a handful of languishing White \n     House nominees withdrew their names because of delayed Senate \n     action, including Nobel Laureate and Federal Reserve board \n     pick Peter Diamond.\n       ``It looks like the pace has slowed to a crawl,'' said \n     former North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan, a onetime \n     Democratic leader who retired in January. ``Whether it's \n     nominations or legislation, it seems there's very little \n     effort by some to meet in the middle and compromise.''\n       The Senate was devised by the nation's founding fathers to \n     move slowly. This year, its inaction is especially notable, \n     and overcoming Senate dysfunction will be one of the final \n     hurdles confronting lawmakers seeking a deal to lift the \n     ceiling to avoid a default on more than $14 trillion in U.S. \n     debt.\n       Beyond the debt limit, the chamber faces unfinished \n     business on energy, immigration, transportation and \n     education.\n       Senators offer various reasons for their chamber's slow \n     pace, including increased partisanship, re-election politics, \n     and the decline of centrists willing to compromise.\n\n\n                              All in Play\n\n       Each of those elements can play a role in slowing the \n     legislative calendar. The major challenge facing this Senate \n     is that all of them are in play.\n       Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a first-term Republican, said \n     he's surprised to see the Senate spending so much time doing \n     so little. ``It's what someone could perhaps call filler,'' \n     he said. ``I'm not calling all of it that, but it's odd to me \n     that given the enormity of what we're facing that we're not \n     having more debate and discussion focused on the debt.''\n       He rejects the criticism of those who say Tea Party-backed \n     freshmen--including himself--won't bend on policy and are the \n     logjam's chief cause. ``Compromise has two sides,'' he said. \n     ``If the Democrats'' idea of compromise is that we have to \n     move and they don't, that's not going to work for me.''\n\n\n                              Gang Efforts\n\n       In an effort to jumpstart legislation, some senators have \n     formed small, bipartisan ``gangs,'' which tend to begin with \n     vows to reach agreements and end in acrimony. The so-called \n     ``Gang of Six,'' created to broker a deal on lifting the debt \n     ceiling, stalled amid disagreements and has been superseded \n     by the bipartisan group of Senate and House members working \n     with Vice President Joe Biden.\n       Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said both \n     parties bear blame for the Senate's inaction. He also said \n     negotiations over deficit reduction and lifting the debt \n     ceiling are taking ``all of the oxygen'' out of the air. \n     ``Neither side of the aisle really wants there to be a robust \n     debate, tough votes to be taken on where we go as a \n     country,'' Corker said. ``Basically, we are cooling our \n     heels.''\n       In 2010, the Senate's record included passage of a health-\n     care overhaul, a rewrite of financial-services rules and a \n     $60 billion measure funding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n       This January, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada \n     Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a \n     Kentucky Republican, heralded changes designed to speed \n     Senate work and forge a bipartisan truce.\n\n\n                         Gentleman's Agreement\n\n       They hatched a ``gentleman's agreement'' to curb the \n     minority party's use of the filibuster--endless debate--to \n     block legislation. In exchange, Reid agreed to allow more \n     debate on Republican amendments to bills. They also pushed \n     through a measure to abolish the secret ``holds'' that allow \n     a single senator to anonymously block a nominee.\n       Those moves, Republicans said, are being undermined by \n     Reid's decision to embrace a timid agenda.\n       With the seats of 23 Democratic senators up for election \n     next year, and only 10 Republicans, Reid has shielded \n     Democrats from taking tough votes, said Senator Charles \n     Grassley, an Iowa Republican. After criticizing a House-\n     passed budget blueprint that included $6 trillion in spending \n     cuts and a plan to privatize Medicare, Democrats never \n     introduced their own plan, sparing their side criticism over \n     fiscal choices and preventing Republicans from offering \n     amendments that might be used against Democrats, he said.\n\n\n                           It's Irresponsible\n\n       ``The less votes the Democrats cast, the less they can be \n     challenged in the next election,'' Grassley said. ``It's no \n     way to run a railroad and it's irresponsible not to do things \n     that are more beefy.''\n       Democrats say such criticism is unfair. The Senate has \n     approved a $34.6 billion measure for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, an overhaul of patent law and other measures \n     that are awaiting House action. Republicans also continue to \n     obstruct some legislation and slow action on others, said Jon \n     Summers, a Reid spokesman.\n       The Senate ``is not functioning well, the way it should, \n     obviously, when you've got threats of filibuster, preventing, \n     slowing down or obstructing,'' said Senator Carl Levin, a \n     Michigan Democrat.\n       The Reid-McConnell accord on filibusters had limits: It \n     didn't address efforts to block legislation on a final vote \n     and didn't end the ability of a single senator to hold up \n     action.\n\n\n                              Patriot Act\n\n       That happened last month when freshman Senator Rand Paul, a \n     Kentucky Republican, stalled renewal of the Patriot Act, \n     which gives law enforcement powers for terrorism \n     investigations, until Reid and McConnell agreed to allow him \n     to introduce two amendments. Those amendments failed and the \n     new version of the Patriot Act passed just hours before the \n     old law expired.\n       Republican leaders are continuing to thwart a vote on \n     former Edison International Chief Executive Officer John \n     Bryson, Obama's choice for Commerce Department Secretary \n     until the White House forwards pending trade deals for South \n     Korea, Panama and Colombia. They also say they won't approve \n     anyone to head a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \n     part of the financial overhaul, until the bureau's powers are \n     restructured.\n       The stalemate is a relief to some, coming after Democratic \n     passage of major initiatives in 2009 and 2010. ``If the \n     legislature must be in session, be thankful when it doesn't \n     do much,' said David Boaz, executive vice president of the \n     Cato Institute in Washington, which promotes limited \n     government.\n       David Rohde, a political scientist at Duke University in \n     Durham, North Carolina, said Senate inaction is driven in \n     part by the departure in recent elections of political \n     moderates such as Republican Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode \n     Island and Democratic Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana.\n       ``The reason that the Senate has become more polarized is \n     that less extreme members have been replaced by more extreme \n     members,'' Rohde said.\n       The lack of Senate action poses risks for Democrats, said \n     Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University in \n     New York, because they aren't offering policy alternatives, \n     he said.\n       ``The difference between the two parties is that the \n     Republicans have a program--an ambitious and controversial \n     one,'' said Brinkley. ``The Democrats don't really have any \n     goals as far as I can see, besides stopping the \n     Republicans.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I advise the senior Senator from New York \nthat I will ask unanimous consent, if it is agreeable to him, that when \nI finish my few words, we go directly to the vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In the agreement, the vote is to occur at 6:10 p.m.\n  Mr. COBURN. Fine. You do not want to move it up?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No. We need it at 6:10 p.m. So if the Senator wants to \nspeak beyond 5 minutes, that is OK with us.\n  Mr. COBURN. OK. Great. I will withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 521\n\n  Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. The people \nwho vote against this rule change, what they are going to be telling \nyou is they do not want you to know what is going on in the Senate, and \nthey do not want us to know what is going on in the Senate. Because all \nthis rule does is make it a force of habit of the Senate that before we \nlook at legislation, we ought to determine whether it duplicates what \nis already out there in the government, and we ought to determine if it \nis overlapping to other programs.\n  Had this amendment been in effect, a third of what we passed in the \npast would not have passed because we would then have seen--which we \nare ignorant of today--all the other programs that were available and \nout there that accomplished the same purpose for which we passed \nanother new program.\n  In one of my committees last year colleagues offered amendments--well \nintentioned, with good motives--to accomplish a good purpose. But they \nlacked knowledge. What they did not know was--and both amendments were \nultimately withdrawn when it was explained to them--that, in fact, we \nalready had programs that did exactly the same thing.\n  So what we have is, we have over $200 billion worth of duplication \nnow within the Federal Government. This is a simple, straightforward \namendment that says before we consider things on the floor--it is less \nthan 700 bills over 2 years--that the CRS would, in fact, tell us: Here \nis what you are doing, here is what the government is already doing in \nthese areas, so we do not end up with duplication, so we do not end up \nwith overlapping, and that we actually get results from what we are \ndoing.\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n  I remind my colleagues that we have, just in the last GAO report, \nmultitudes of duplicative programs, and I will repeat them so people \nwill know. I also would state, this is a bipartisan amendment in the \nspirit of what the Senator from New York and the Senator from Tennessee \nhave done. This amendment has Senator Udall, Senator McCaskill, Senator \nBurr, and Senator McCain, as well as Senator Collins, Senator Paul, and \nSenator Scott Brown. So this is not a partisan move. This is a move \nabout information and knowledge so we make informed decisions.\n  But for the record, what the GAO told us, less than 5 months ago, is \nthat we have 101 programs across four different agencies for surface \ntransportation. That is 101 sets of bureaucracies. Nobody has ever gone \nand said: Which ones work and which ones do not? Which ones do exactly \nthe same thing versus what somebody else does?\n  We have 82 teacher programs for teacher quality across 10 different \nagencies, 9 of which are not in the Department of Education. We have 88 \neconomic development programs spending $6.5 billion a year across 4 \ndifferent agencies. We have 47 job training programs across 9 different \nagencies, and we are spending $18 billion a year, and the GAO said \nevery one of them overlaps, with the exception of 3. Yet we have not \nhad the first move in the Senate this year in spite of all of our \nproblems economically to streamline, eliminate duplication, eliminate \noverlap, and put metrics on what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis list of duplicative programs identified by GAO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     DUPLICATIVE PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED BY GAO\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Number of       Number of\n                   Purpose                        programs        agencies                    Cost\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSurface Transportation.......................             101               4  not provided\nTeacher Quality..............................              82              10  not provided\nEconomic Development.........................              88               4  $6.5 billion\nTransportation Provided for the Disadvantaged              80               8  $314 million\nFinancial Literacy...........................              56              21  not provided\nEmployment and Training......................              47               9  not provided\nHomeless Assistance..........................              21               7  not provided\nFood and Nutrition Assistance................              18               3  $62.5 billion\nHomeland Security grants.....................              17               1  $2.7 billion\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Again, I will state, if you are against this amendment, \nyou are against eliminating the very cause of our problems in this \ncountry, which is duplication, redundancy, overlap, and you are against \ndoing the proper oversight so we make informed decisions.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Congratulating the University of South Carolina Gamecocks\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in this world. We \nhave a mountain of debt and wars and rumors of wars, and people are \nnervous throughout the country. But I thought I would take a few \nminutes of the time of the Senate to acknowledge something that is a \nvery big deal where I come from.\n  The University of South Carolina has won back-to-back College World \nSeries. They defeated the Florida Gators last night 5 to 2. Florida \nplayed a great series, and they left a lot of men on base. I am sure \nthey are going to look at the tape and talk about next year how to get \nsome runs in.\n  But Coach Tanner and the Gamecock team repeated. They were only the \nsixth team in NCAA history to do this, to win back-to-back titles. It \nwas very rewarding and poetic.\n  The University of South Carolina won the last series in Rosenblatt \nStadium. This was the first series to be held in the TD Ameritrade Park \nin Omaha, NE, in front of 26,000 people. They set a record for the NCAA \nwith 16 consecutive post-season wins, 11 consecutive wins in the \nCollege World Series, dating back to the 2010 season. The pitching \nstaff had a 1.31 ERA. The bullpen was 6-0. Great hitting. Great \ncoaching. More than anything else, big hearts.\n  So to the Gamecock nation, congratulations on back-to-back titles. \nYou make us all proud. And if you are watching Gamecock baseball, and \nyou have a bad heart, you need to turn the channel because they win in \nthe most dramatic fashion. They never give up. They believe in \nthemselves.\n  Michael Roth, the winning pitcher of the last game, said: We don't \nhave the most talented people at every position. But we play together \nwith heart. We believe in each other.\n  Maybe the country could learn something from Gamecock baseball. If we \nall work together for a common purpose and put our differences aside, \nmaybe we could achieve greatness too.\n  So congratulations to Coach Tanner for back-to-back titles. We are \nvery proud of your team. Not only did you win two titles, you did it \nwith style, grace, and dignity. You won with honor. I look forward to \nmeeting the team when they come up to the White House. And I know \nColumbia is rocking tonight.\n  Congratulations to the Gamecocks. You won in fine style, and we are \nall proud of you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to reduce the amount of duplication \nand overlap in federal agencies and I am prepared to vote to eliminate \nduplicative programs. That is my responsibility as a Senator. However, \nI believe this must be done in a responsible manner and not passed off \nto a third party. I opposed the Coburn amendment because it would cause \nneedless delay to the consideration of important legislation by the \nSenate. It would give additional power to the staff of the \nCongressional Research Service. It would increase Congressional \nspending when we are working to reduce our Federal budget deficit and \nour Federal debt.\n  The amendment would change the Standing Rules of the Senate to \nrequire the Congressional Research Service--CRS--to complete a study to \nexamine the potential for duplicative programs for every bill that is \npassed out of committee before it is in order to be considered by the \nfull Senate.\n  This amendment will not end duplication of government programs. But \nit will make it more difficult for the Senate to do the Nation's \nbusiness. The Coburn amendment will allow any Senator to block floor \nconsideration of a bill if the CRS assessment has not been completed. \nThe amendment does not place any time limits on the CRS to make the \nassessment of whether the programs included in legislation are \nduplicative. The amendment does not define key terms such as \n``program'' or ``initiative'' that are crucial to performing the \nassessment.\n  The amendment states that every bill that comes to the floor must \ncontain a full evaluation and report by CRS. The CRS report must \nexamine every potential Federal program that might overlap with the one \nproposed.\n  How long would CRS have to do such a report? I don't know because the \namendment does not include time limits for the CRS to provide these \nreports. Therefore, CRS could block consideration of important \nlegislation by simply not meeting its responsibilities.\n  We have always been very careful in making changes to the Standing \nRules of the Senate. This proposal has not come before the Rules \nCommittee in any way and thus has not been considered or vetted by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. If we are serious about such a change, it \nshould receive the appropriate review before being adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, the bipartisan United States Sentencing \nCommission was created by Congress to establish guidelines that are \nused by Federal judges when they sentence criminal defendants. \nTomorrow, the Sentencing Commission will take an important vote. The \nCommission is considering whether to apply retroactively the sentencing \nguideline amendment implementing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. As \nthe lead sponsor of the Fair Sentencing Act, I urge the Commission to \napply this amendment retroactively.\n  Just last year, Democrats and Republicans joined together to pass the \nFair Sentencing Act, bipartisan legislation that reduced the disparity \nbetween crack and powder cocaine sentencing.\n  For more than 20 years, we had a 100-to-1 crack-powder sentencing \ndisparity. It took 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to \ntrigger the same harsh mandatory minimum sentences. Simply possessing 5 \ngrams of crack carried the same penalty as selling 500 grams of powder.\n  This disparity was one of the most significant causes of unequal \nincarceration rates between African Americans and Caucasians. The \nfollowing statistic\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\nis chilling: In this country, African Americans are incarcerated at \napproximately six times the rate of Caucasians.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act dramatically reduced the 100-to-1 disparity. \nLast November, the Sentencing Commission issued amended sentencing \nguidelines that put into effect the Fair Sentencing Act's reduced crack \nsentences. These guidelines will be used by Federal judges across the \ncountry in every drug sentencing.\n  The Commission is now deciding whether to apply these more equitable \nguidelines retroactively to those who have already been sentenced and \nare in prison. I sent a letter, joined by Judiciary Committee Chairman \nPatrick Leahy, and Senators Franken and Coons, urging the Commission to \nvote for retroactivity.\n  Let's be clear about the bottom line: If the Commission does not make \nits amendment retroactive, thousands of people will continue to serve \nprison sentences that Congress has determined are unfair and \ndisproportionately punitive to African Americans. Thousands of \nindividuals sentenced before November of last year would remain subject \nto our old, racially disparate sentencing scheme. Yet those who \nhappened to be sentenced on or after November 1 could receive \nsignificantly reduced prison terms--even if they engaged in exactly the \nsame conduct.\n  This is inconsistent with the goals of the Fair Sentencing Act--\nreducing disparities in drug sentencing, increasing trust in the \njustice system, and focusing limited resources on serious offenders. In \neffect, it would say: ``The U.S. government is OK with you continuing \nto serve a sentence we've acknowledged is unfair--and most unfair to \nthose with your color of skin.''\n  Now, opponents of retroactivity have made all sorts of arguments in \nan effort to muddy the water and push their own conservative sentencing \nagenda. They have suggested that because the Fair Sentencing Act did \nnot explicitly address retroactivity, the sentencing guidelines \nshouldn't be retroactive. This is an obvious attempt to confuse apples \nand oranges.\n  To be clear: We are not talking about whether the statute itself--the \nFair Sentencing Act--should be applied retroactively. That is a \ndifferent question for a different day--and one that affects many more \nissues and many more inmates. We are talking about the Sentencing \nCommission exercising its own independent, expert authority to make its \nown guideline amendments retroactive.\n  Opponents of retroactivity also claim that the Sentencing Commission \nis overstepping its bounds by considering retroactivity. But this is \nthe standard administrative process, and one that Congress designed to \nbe left to the Sentencing Commission. The Commission has routinely \napplied its amendments retroactively--many, many times before. And it \nhas voted for retroactivity virtually every time it has amended the \nguidelines to reduce drug sentences. In fact, Congress expressly gave \nthe Commission the authority to make amendments to the sentencing \nguidelines apply retroactively.\n  Retroactivity makes practical and economic sense. Our Federal prison \nsystem is 37 percent over capacity. Inmates are being double and even \ntriple bunked. Applying the Fair Sentencing Act guideline amendment \nretroactively could reduce prison overcrowding dramatically and result \nin up to $1 billion in savings for taxpayers. Approximately 12,000 \nindividuals--who are prescreened by judges--would be eligible for an \naverage sentence reduction of 37 months. The average cost to house a \nFederal prisoner is $28,284 per year. Taxpayer savings would be about \n$87,000 for each inmate.\n  History also tells us retroactivity makes sense. In 2007, the \nCommission made retroactive a similar amendment to reduce crack \nsentences. Thousands more defendants were eligible then for reductions \nthan would be eligible now. Yet motions for reduced sentences were \nhandled smoothly.\n  The Department of Justice supports guideline retroactivity and the \nBureau of Prisons has implemented a plan to carry out the logistics. \nThe Criminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, comprised of judges from every Federal circuit, unequivocally \nsupports retroactivity.\n  Opponents simply ignore the history and have used scare tactics to \nraise misleading questions of public safety. Retroactivity does not \nautomatically entitle a defendant to a sentence reduction. A Federal \njudge would have discretion to decide in every single case whether a \nreduction is appropriate. If it is not--because of the facts of a case \nor concerns about an individual defendant--no reduction will be given. \nPeriod. All judges are actually required to consider public safety when \nmaking a decision. Moreover, on the back end, the Bureau of Prisons has \nsaid that it ``is prepared to take measures to ensure that offenders \nreleased due to retroactive application . . . are transitioned \neffectively back into the community.''\n  In short the Sentencing Commission should use the expert discretion \nCongress granted it to apply its amendment retroactively to each \ndefendant subject to a sentencing scheme Congress determined was \nunjust. I hope the Commission does the right thing and applies \nretroactively the sentencing guideline amendment implementing the Fair \nSentencing Act.\n  Retroactivity would bolster respect for our justice system, help \ncorrect the unfairness of a racially disparate sentencing scheme, and \nsave resources for taxpayers while heeding concerns of public safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4210-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4210-S4211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING TRACY T. ``TOM'' ARFLIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to note the loss of an \nhonored and distinguished Kentuckian. Mr. Tracy T. Arflin of Radcliff, \nKY, passed away this June 18. He was 74 years old.\n  Mr. Arflin went by ``Tom,'' but was also known to generations of \nRadcliff-area youth as ``Coach.'' Tom Arflin dedicated the last 32 \nyears of his life to volunteering on behalf of youth sports in his \nhometown. He was the manager of the Rangers in the Radcliff Baseball/\nSoftball Association, and coached two teams, the Eagles and the \nJaguars, in the North Hardin Youth Football League. He had both a \nfootball and a baseball field named after him, and was the North Hardin \nYouth Football League president for the past 21 years.\n  Mr. Arflin's job as coach included the roles of mentor, leader, and \nleague developer. He not only inspired many kids who may not have \nthought they were cut out for sports to stick with it, he also \nencouraged many parents to volunteer their time as coaches. Some of \nthem are still at it even after their children have grown out of youth \nleague play because of Tom Arflin's example.\n  Tom Arflin was also a U.S. Army veteran who proudly served for 27 \nyears, including two tours in Vietnam. For the past 42 years he was a \nmember of Mill Creek Baptist Church in Radcliff.\n  This May Tom was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent radiation \ntreatments. A few weeks before his passing, Tom's son Tracy T. Arflin \nII organized a grand community celebration for his father, and more \nthan 100 family members, friends, and former and current coaches and \nplayers gathered to honor Tom Arflin for his many decades of service.\n  Tom was preceded in death by his wife of 49 years, Louise C. Arflin, \nand by his sister, Anna. Surviving members of his family who are \nmourning Tom's loss include his son and daughter-in-law, Tracy T. \nArflin II and Sharon; his grandson, Matthew T. Arflin; his sister, Lucy \nWebb; and his brother, Billy Arflin. I wish to express my deepest \ncondolences to the family and friends of Tracy T. ``Tom'' Arflin for \nthe loss of this wonderful man.\n  Mr. President, the Hardin County News-Enterprise recently published \nan article about Tom Arflin and the community celebration thrown in his \nhonor. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed, as \nfollows:\n\n                [From the News-Enterprise, June 5, 2011]\n\n          Youth Sports: Arflin Receives Community Celebration\n\n                            (By John Groth)\n\n       Tracy Arflin wanted to give his father, Tom, one more major \n     recognition.\n       His dad has spent decades building up the North Hardin \n     Youth Football League. And now as his father's coaching \n     career winds down, he wanted to hold a special community \n     celebration.\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\n       ``We're celebrating a lifetime of him serving several \n     generations of children, not just serving a community, which \n     could be argued, but serving several generations of \n     children,'' Tracy Arflin said. ``I like to think of my father \n     like that.''\n       That's why around 100 family members, friends, current and \n     former NHYFL coaches, players and officials gathered Sunday \n     at Mill Creek Baptist Church in Radcliff to honor Tom Arflin \n     for more than three decades of service.\n       In May, Tom Arflin was diagnosed with brain cancer and has \n     undergone radiation treatments.\n       They made sure the Jaguars coach felt right at home--with \n     Jaguars items and colors everywhere. Each table was covered \n     in a teal tablecloth with a Jaguar youth helmet, with a white \n     pom-pom attached to each facemask, smack dab in the middle.\n       Tom Arflin has spent 32 years helping develop the NHYFL. \n     He's coached in the league since 1980 and served as its \n     president since 1991. Arflin's grandson, Matt, remembers \n     playing football for him years ago, and the 26-year-old \n     remains amazed at how much the league has grown with his \n     grandfather at the helm.\n       ``It's kind of like the Madden video game where you create \n     your own league. He kind of did that,'' Matt Arflin said.\n       Two weeks ago, Tracy stopped by to talk to Tom after a \n     NHYFL meeting. That's when he told his father about the \n     reception.\n       ``I had tears in my eyes. That surprised me,'' Tom Arflin \n     said. ``He announced it after the meeting. I thought he was \n     going to say something about the reason why he was there. It \n     came out different.''\n       The celebration ended up being special.\n       Radcliff Mayor J.J. Duvall grew up playing youth sports in \n     Radcliff. He knows how much of a fixture Tom Arflin, who \n     still is referred to as just ``Coach,'' has become in the \n     community. And he knows his dedication is unmatched.\n       ``We're here to honor Coach's attention to detail, sense of \n     humor, the smiles he brings to others, and the overall caring \n     he has for kids and our youth,'' Duvall said. ``He set the \n     bar very high.''\n       Trying to come up with a gift to honor him with was just as \n     tough.\n       Tom Arflin already has two fields--the NHYFL and Radcliff \n     Senior League Field--named in his honor. He has football \n     memorabilia galore. So Duvall picked out another unique \n     item--an engraved Louisville Slugger baseball bat. Tom Arflin \n     actually began working with Radcliff youth in 1979 when he \n     took over the Rangers' team in the Radcliff Major League.\n       ``The Louisville Slugger is an icon, and you're an icon of \n     the community,'' Duvall said.\n       Arflin influenced coaches as much as he did the players.\n       Just ask Vine Grove resident Travis McNair.\n       McNair has been with the NHYFL since 2008. He originally \n     only intended to have his son, Tavius, sign up to play. But \n     Tom Arflin convinced him to coach.\n       ``He said we always need coaches. Now I am and I'm addicted \n     to it,'' McNair said. ``He said, `We need coaches and people \n     out to help.' ''\n       McNair has coached his son on the Rams each of the past \n     three years. This year, Tavius will enter high school at \n     North Hardin. But McNair will still lead the Rams because \n     he's having so much fun.\n       So is Isaac Bankhead.\n       The Radcliff resident will coach his third team--the newly \n     formed Chiefs--in nine seasons. He coached the Vikings for \n     the first two years and the Titans, too.\n       Bankhead's children, 12-year-old Isaiah and 10-year-old \n     Jeremiah, have each played for the past seven years. And Tom \n     Arflin helped him get into coaching.\n       ``He's good-hearted, tries to make sure every kid in the \n     league has an opportunity to play. He tells us how to deal \n     with parents and what to do to help the league run better,'' \n     Bankhead said. ``He's been an inspiration. He's been a good \n     guy. You can't help but to like him.''\n       Former players agreed.\n       One of those players Tom Arflin influenced is Jeremy Brown.\n       The 17-year-old North Hardin senior wide receiver shared \n     his unique experience on how Arflin helped him develop foot \n     coordination.\n       ``I didn't want to do football. My parents kind of forced \n     me into it. I remember the first day of practice and they got \n     out the tires for a tire drill. I stepped up, and I was like, \n     `I really didn't want to do it,' and I went through and hit \n     every single tire. As I went and got done, Coach was like, \n     `Dadgumit, Jeremy! Dadgumit!' It went on like that for about \n     a week,'' Brown said. ``That was in the back of my mind. I \n     did it perfect a week later. Since then, any type of drill I \n     have that involves my feet, I don't mess up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4211-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Johnson\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today we honor the life and heroic \nsacrifice of PFC John C. Johnson of Phoenix, AZ. He died on May 27, \n2011, in Bayman Province, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when his \nmounted patrol received small arms fire. He was 28 years old. Private \nJohnson and his wife Jennifer were expecting a baby daughter at the \ntime of his death.\n  Private Johnson's parents remember him as a honest, affectionate son, \nand his wife remembers him as a dedicated husband and loving father. \nGrowing up in Arizona's rugged landscape, he developed hunting and \ntracking skills that would later contribute to his resourcefulness as a \nsoldier. Private Johnson enlisted in the Army in February 2010, \ncommenting that he was committed to providing a better life for his \nfamily.\n  He served in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as a member of C \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, \nbased at Fort Drum, NY. His bravery and outstanding service quickly won \nthe recognition of his commanders. Private Johnson earned, among other \ndistinctions, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Private \nJohnson's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  I stand with people in Colorado and nationwide in profound gratitude \nfor Private Johnson's tremendous sacrifice. At substantial personal \nrisk, he fought in Afghanistan with unwavering courage to protect \nAmerica's citizens and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and \nthe lives he touched, Private Johnson will forever be remembered as one \nof our country's bravest.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Vicki, his mother, John, \nhis father, Jennifer, his wife, and his entire family, who carry on \nPrivate Johnson's memory and will forever remind us of his sacrifice.\n\n\n                        Sergeant William Steele\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Freedom Fighter from \nChicago, IL, an American Hero, SGT William Steele.\n  He is a man who proudly went off to war for his country. On June 25, \n2009, William lost his leg and almost his life after an IED explosion \nin Maili, Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Steele returned home an even stronger soldier, determined to \ncontinue to fulfill his dream with an Army career as a drill sergeant. \nAnd with the support of his mother, who at the age of 17 signed the \npapers so he could enlist in the Army, he will.\n  One of his favorite quotes from his mother that has inspired him is, \n``There is no sense of looking down, hold your head up!'' Sergeant \nSteele has done just that, making us all proud of him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this poem penned in honor \nof him by Albert Caswell, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Cold Steele\n\n\n  IN HONOR OF A REAL AMERICAN HERO, SGT WILLIAM STEELE UNITED STATES \n                  ARMY, HHC 1-178th INFANTRY REGIMENT\n\n     Cold Steele!\n     What is right, what is real!\n     What is strong, all in what a most courageous heart reveals!\n     While, all upon battlefields of honor bright . . . all in \n           these killing fields . . .\n     Dark days and nights . . .\n     As from down within, as how a heart so reaches deep down to \n           begin . . .\n     To begin this fight, whether on battlefields of honor bright \n           . . . or in a hospital to unite . . .\n     Because, only with a most courageous heart of Steele . . . \n           will we so win that night!\n     As all in time revealed . . .\n     When, courage crests . . . as one of America's Finest, The \n           Army's Best . . .\n     For only there, in these the darkest days of all nights . . .\n     As only there, all in life and death . . . all in this fight!\n     Will hearts of strength and Steele, so crest . . . to reveal \n           to bring their light!\n     Your medal, of what you are made . . . so very real!\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\n     All in his strength . . . all in William's Cold Steele!\n     As a Chicago boy, who had it rough . . . trying to lift up \n           himself . . .\n     At seventeen, his Mother signed the papers . . . to insure \n           his future dreams . . .\n     For William was born to be, in The United States Army . . . \n           Hoooah indeed . . .\n     As this was to be, his final casting and molding . . . into a \n           heart of Steele, you see . . .\n     Letting this Chicago Lad, Be All That He Could Be . . .\n     When, all in a moment of truth . . . as an explosion almost \n           took his life, but lies the proof . . .\n     As this young man's medal was to be tested, as where lies the \n           truth . . .\n     While, on the edge of death as he awoke with one leg left . . \n           .\n     As his tears would crest, as he remembered his Mother who him \n           had blessed . . .\n     In his head, the words she said, ``There is no sense of \n           looking down, hold your head up!''\n     As somehow the strength he found . . .\n     As from that moment on, his most gallant heart of Steele so \n           moved on!\n     To fight the good fight, burning bold . . . burning bright!\n     For you see, The Army is William's life!\n     As he would not give up, nor give in . . . until he's back in \n           action again . . .\n     For inside this heart of Steele, such warmth is revealed . . \n           .\n     And if ever I had a son, oh how I wish he could be like this \n           one!\n     Throughout our Country Tis of Thee, all in our nation we have \n           seen . . .\n     Hearts of Steele, Freedom Fighters like Dr. King, and Rosa \n           Parks . . .\n     Because, of all of their courage and sacrifice, and most \n           magnificent hearts . . .\n     Blessing this our country tis of thee!\n     And now a new name to the list, of a young man who for us so \n           much would give . . .\n     With his heart of Freedom Fighter, teaching us all how to \n           live!\n     With but Hearts of Steele!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4212-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 4, the Nation will celebrate the \n45th anniversary of the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA. Now in its fifth decade, FOIA remains an indispensable tool for \nshedding light on government policies and government abuses. This \npremier open government law has helped to guarantee the public's \n``right to know'' for generations of Americans.\n  Today, the U.S. Government is more committed than in any time in our \nhistory to making and keeping government open and accountable to the \npeople. As one of his first official acts, President Obama signed an \nhistoric Presidential Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act, \nwhich restored the presumption of disclosure for all government \ninformation. I applaud President Obama for his commitment to FOIA, and \nI will continue to work closely with his administration to ensure that \nour government fulfills both the letter and spirit of this remarkable \nmemorandum.\n  While the Obama administration has made significant progress in \nimproving the FOIA process, large backlogs remain a major roadblock to \npublic access to information. A report released by the National \nSecurity Archive found that only about half of the Federal agencies \nsurveyed have taken concrete steps to update their FOIA policies in \nlight of the President's reforms. According to the Department of \nJustice's annual FOIA Report for fiscal year 2010, more than 69,000 \nFOIA requests remain backlogged across our government. These delays are \nsimply unacceptable.\n  To address these concerns, in May, the Senate unanimously passed the \nFaster FOIA Act of 2011--a bill to establish a bipartisan commission to \nexamine the root causes of agency delays in processing FOIA requests. \nSenator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005, because we \nwere concerned about the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays \nwithin our Federal agencies. During the intervening years, this problem \nhas not gone away. That is why in 2010, we reintroduced this bill and \nthe Senate unanimously passed it. Unfortunately, the House of \nRepresentatives did not take action. After the Judiciary Committee's \nhearing on FOIA, which was held during the annual Sunshine Week in \nMarch, we reintroduced the Faster FOIA Act yet again--with the hope \nthat the Congress would finally enact this good government legislation. \nI am pleased that the Senate has done its part to achieve this goal. On \nthe occasion of this 45th anniversary of FOIA, I urge the House to act \non this important bill so that the Commission on Freedom of Information \nAct Processing Delays can begin its important work.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for his work on this bill and for his \nleadership on this issue. I also commend and thank the many open \ngovernment and FOIA advocacy groups that have supported our efforts to \nbolster FOIA, including OpenTheGovernment.org, the Project on \nGovernment Oversight and the Sunshine in Government Initiative.\n  The right to know is a cornerstone of our democracy. Without it, \ncitizens are kept in the dark about key policy decisions that directly \naffect their lives. Without open government, citizens cannot make \ninformed choices at the ballot box. And once eroded, the right to know \nis hard to win back.\n  The House Committee Report that accompanied the Freedom of \nInformation Act in 1966 stated:\n\n     it is vital to our way of life to reach a workable balance \n     between the right of the public to know and the need of the \n     Government to keep information in confidence to the extent \n     necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy. The \n     right of the individual to be able to find out how his \n     Government is operating can be just as important to him as \n     his right to privacy and his right to confide in his \n     Government. This bill strikes a balance considering all these \n     interests.\n\n  As we reflect upon the celebration of another FOIA anniversary, we in \nCongress must reaffirm the commitment to open and transparent \ngovernment captured by these time-proven words.\n  Open government is neither a Democratic issue, nor a Republican \nissue--it is truly an American value and virtue that we all must \nuphold. It is in this bipartisan spirit that I join Americans from \nacross the political spectrum in celebrating the 45th anniversary of \nFOIA and all that this law has come to symbolize about our vibrant \ndemocracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4212-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4212-S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FBI EXTENSION OF SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

In response to the President's request, \na bipartisan group of Senators drafted and introduced S. 1103, a bill \nthat would create a one-time exception to the statute limiting the term \nof the FBI Director by allowing the term of the incumbent FBI Director \nto continue for 2 additional years. Given the continuing threats to our \nNation and the need to provide continuity and stability on the \nPresident's national security team, it is important that this critical \nlegislation be enacted without delay.\n  Director Mueller's term expires on August 3, 2011. With the House out \nof session this week and the Senate out of session the next, there is \nrelatively little time left to act. Of the 10 weeks between the \nPresident's request and the expiration of Director Mueller's term, six \nare gone already. More than half the time that we had in which to act \nhas elapsed. If we do not complete action on this matter this week, the \nSenate will then be in recess until July 11. That leaves Congress only \n3 weeks for all necessary action to be completed by the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  We should be acting responsibly and expeditiously. I have worked \ndiligently with Senator Grassley in order to prevent a lapse in the \nterm of the Director of the FBI. We must act on this bill without \nfurther, unnecessary delays. The Senate should take it up, consider it \nand pass it, and then the House will need to consider and pass the bill \nbefore the President has the opportunity to sign it. Each of these \nsteps must be completed prior to the expiration of the Director's \ncurrent 10-year term on August 3, 2011. There is no time to waste.\n  I understand from the Senate cloakroom that all Senate Democrats are \nprepared to take up and pass S. 1103 and send it to the House of \nRepresentatives for it to take final action before August 3. We should \ndo that now, before the Fourth of July recess. There is no good reason \nfor delay.\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\n  The bill responds directly to the President's request to extend Bob \nMueller's term as FBI Director, and was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee on June 16 by a bipartisan majority of the \ncommittee and with the support of the ranking Republican member. I urge \nany Senators who have questions about the bill to read the accompanying \ncommittee report, Report No. 112-23, which was filed on June 21, 2011, \nand is now printed and available online.\n  While I would gladly have included others' views in the final \ncommittee report, none were submitted in a timely manner, nor was there \na request for an extension of time to do so. The draft committee report \non the bill was circulated on June 17, 2011, to all committee members. \nPursuant to longstanding Judiciary Committee practice, Senators had 3 \ncalendar days to submit their views. This practice is modeled after, \nbut more generous than, Senate rule XXVI. The committee report was \nfiled 4 days after majority views were circulated, but no additional, \nsupplemental, or minority views had been submitted. It was filed \npromptly and made publicly available in the hope that the Senate might \nconsider this time-sensitive bill this week.\n  Unlike my Republican predecessors, as chairman I have protected the \nminority on the committee and the rights of all Senators. I have done \nso even while some have chosen to abuse committee rules and practices \nand Senate rules and practices.\n  Senator Coburn inserted his views, also subscribed to by Senators \nHatch, Sessions, Graham and Lee, in the Congressional Record on June \n23. I had offered to include them in the Record on June 22, when they \nwere belatedly submitted to the committee after the committee report \nhad been filed. There is nothing in those views that should prevent the \nSenate from considering the committee-reported bill expeditiously.\n  I do not believe that the views Senator Coburn inserted into the \nCongressional Record contain any new or compelling legal analysis \nsupporting the notion that S. 1103 is somehow unconstitutional. They \nmerely assert without a sound basis that the matter may present a \nconstitutional concern and the risk of ``dangerous litigation.'' As set \nforth in the committee report on S. 1103, and as reaffirmed in a June \n20, 2011, memorandum opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel, however, \nthese assertions are incorrect. The bill before the Senate, S. 1103, is \nconstitutionally sound and a proper response by Congress to the \nPresident's request.\n  At the heart of this issue are two key points that remain undisputed. \nFirst, the Director of the FBI serves ``at will'' and can be removed by \nthe President for any reason. Director Mueller himself testified that \nhe serves ``at the pleasure of the President.''\n  Second, this bill was introduced as a response to the President's \nrequest that Congress provide a one-time exception to the 10-year \nstatutory limit to the term of the FBI Director so that he could extend \nDirector Mueller's service for up to two more years. Indeed, the text \nof the bill plainly states that Director Mueller may continue his term \nof service only ``at the request of the President.''\n  These two points are important because they form core elements for \nany constitutional analysis in connection with the appointments clause. \nThis bill does not seek to impose a legislative appointment on the \nPresident, nor undermine his authority. The committee report describes \nthe constitutional and legal principle that is central to any \nassessment of the constitutionality of this bill: ``Legislation \nextending the term of an officer who serves at will does not violate \nthe Appointments Clause,'' quoting 18 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 166, \n171, 1994. Through four separate legal opinions dating back to 1951, \nand reaffirmed as recently as June 20, 2011, the Department of Justice \nhas recognized this guiding principle. The Constitution's appointments \nclause is not offended ``as long as the President remains free to \nremove the officer at will and make another appointment.'' U.S. Op. \nOff. Legal Counsel 2-3, June 20, 2011. The bill reported by the \ncommittee ensures that the President retains that authority. \nFurthermore, the bill does nothing to diminish the authority of the \nPresident.\n  Senator Coburn's views lack discussion of either the ``at will'' \nstatus of the FBI Director or the President's plenary removal \nauthority. Instead, his views summarily dismiss the extensive legal \nanalysis of the Department of Justice dating back 60 years by arguing \nthat the opinions are ``inconsistent.'' The only inconsistency was an \nanomalous opinion from 1987 that was withdrawn by the Justice \nDepartment in 1994, after the 1987 opinion was determined to be \n``irredeemably unpersuasive.'' Ironically, it is that withdrawn \nopinion, one that has no authority, in which critics of the bill seek \nto find comfort.\n  Beginning with an opinion in 1951, and then again in three more \nrecent legal memoranda, in 1994, in 1996, and most recently on June 20, \n2011, the Department of Justice has endorsed the constitutionality of \nterm extensions like the one provided in the bill for ``at will'' \nexecutive officers.\n  Senator Coburn argues that the value of these Office of Legal Counsel \nopinions should be discounted because very few cases have been \nlitigated concerning these types of term extensions. He fails to \nacknowledge, however, that the lack of litigation on this point could \nbe due to the fact that the constitutional concern on which he relies \nsimply lacks merit. The fact remains that there is no case and no \npersuasive legal authority supporting Senator Coburn's contention that \nthe bill is unconstitutional.\n  Also virtually ignored by Senator Coburn's views is the fact that the \nbill effectively retains the President's appointment authority. The \nPresident could nominate and then appoint a different FBI Director at \nany time before, during, or at the end of the 2-year term extension. \nThe President is not required by the bill to request that Director \nMueller continue to serve for the full 2 years of the extension. That \nis up to the President. These facts are dismissed by Senator Coburn as \n``irrelevant'' or ``immaterial'' to the discussion. In fact, they are \njust the opposite. The fact that this legislation is being considered \nat the behest of the President demonstrates that there is no \nlegislative branch incursion into executive authority. Because S. 1103 \nis in direct response to the President's specific request for \nlegislation creating a one-time exemption to the 10-year term limit of \nthe FBI Director, the bill serves to protect the authority of the \nPresident to choose who he wants to lead this executive agency. That is \nwholly consistent with the purpose of the appointments clause.\n  Senator Coburn's attempts to distinguish the limited, relevant case \nlaw are also unavailing. As noted in the committee report, Judge \nNorris's concurring opinion in the case In re Benny, 812 F. 2d 1133, \n9th Cir. 1987, is not on point, as that case involved officials who \nwere only removable for cause. Senator Coburn's reliance on Justice \nScalia's dissent in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 1988, is similarly \nmisplaced. The lengthy quote of Justice Scalia's in the minority views \nis drawn, for example, from a discussion of the separation of powers \ndoctrine, not from Justice Scalia's discussion of the appointments \nclause. The Morrison decision was about the constitutionality of the \nindependent counsel statute, not a simple extension of a statutory term \nlimit. The Morrison decision held that the statute at issue was \nconstitutional because it did not ``impermissibly undermine the powers \nof the Executive Branch'' or ``prevent[] the Executive Branch from \naccomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.'' That is all \nthe more true for S. 1103, which was requested by the President and \ndoes nothing to impinge upon the President's appointment or removal \npower.\n  In his concluding remarks, Senator Coburn concedes that he is not \nasserting that S. 1103 is unconstitutional. Instead, Senator Coburn \nretreats to a concern with what he characterizes as the ``small \nchance'' of possible litigation. The supposed litigation risk is not a \ngood reason for Senator Coburn's multistage approach when a simple, \none-time term extension will accomplish the goal. This is particularly \ntrue when the committee reported bill is constitutional.\n  The FBI is not troubled by the supposed exposure ``of Director \nMueller's authority to dangerous litigation risk.'' Senator Coburn does \nnot cite any operational concern raised by the FBI or anyone else in \nlaw enforcement\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nconcerning this supposed litigation risk. The FBI Director and the \nDepartment of Justice do not seem concerned about this supposed \nlitigation risk. I am confident that we would have heard from the FBI \nand other law enforcement groups if there was any concern that this \nbill would somehow undermine the law enforcement or intelligence \noperations of the FBI. To the contrary, S. 1103 enjoys the strong \nsupport of the National Fraternal Order of Police, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  The Justice Department does not share Senator Coburn's concerns. The \nOffice of Legal Counsel recently reaffirmed the constitutionality of \nthe bill in a new memorandum dated June 20, which is included in the \nappendix to the Senate committee report and rests upon 60 years of \nconstitutional interpretation. The White House is not concerned. \nNeither am I. The bill that the committee reported and I support is \nconstitutional and does not raise any real risk.\n  Senator Coburn has known since he raised his alternative approach \nthat there are two major problems with it. The first problem I have \nalready discussed. It is wrongly predicated on a constitutional problem \nthat does not exist. The bill reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is a term extension of a limit that Congress imposed on the \nterm of service of the Director of the FBI. Indeed, as the witnesses at \nour June 8 hearing pointed out, the logic of Senator Coburn's concern \ncould mean that the 10-year limit Congress imposed on the term of \nservice of the FBI Director would itself be constitutionally suspect. \nThe supposed justification for Senator Coburn's cumbersome legislative \nplan is just wrong. The reported bill, S. 1103, which was initially \ndrafted by Senator Grassley and made more explicit by the committee, is \nconstitutional.\n  The second major problem with Senator Coburn's approach is that it \nwould necessitate the renomination of Director Mueller, and then his \nreconsideration and reconfirmation by the Senate after enactment of \nSenator Coburn's alternative bill and before August 3. That is an \nadditional, unnecessary and, I might suggest, dangerous complication. I \ndo not want Americans to be approaching the tenth anniversary of 9/11 \nwithout an FBI Director in office. The distractions to Director Mueller \ncreated by the extended proceedings on this legislation are damaging \nenough.\n  The extension of Director Mueller's service leading the FBI should \nnot fall victim to the same objections that have obstructed Senate \naction on other important presidential nominations and appointments. I \nhave spoken often about the unnecessary and inexcusable delays on \njudicial nominations. Even consensus nominees have faced long delays \nbefore Senate Republicans would allow a vote.\n  Since President Obama was elected, we have had to overcome two \nfilibusters on two Circuit Court nominees who were reported unanimously \nby the committee. These judges--Judge Barbara Keenan of the Fourth \nCircuit and Judge Denny Chin of the Second Circuit--were then confirmed \nunanimously once the filibusters were brought to an end. These are \ncurrently 16 judicial nominees who were reported unanimously by all \nRepublicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and yet are stuck \non the Senate Executive Calendar because Senate Republicans will not \nconsent to vote on them. These are consensus nominations that should \nnot have been delayed while the Federal courts are experiencing a \njudicial vacancies crisis.\n  This pattern of delay and obstruction has not been confined to \njudges. President Obama's executive nominations have been subjected to \nthe same unfair treatment. The first five U.S. attorneys appointed by \nPresident Obama were delayed more than 2 months for no good reason in \nthe summer of 2009. These are the top Federal law enforcement officers \nin those districts and yet it took from June 4 to August 7 before \nSenate Republicans would consent to their confirmations. They were then \nconfirmed unanimously. The Chairman of the United States Sentencing \nCommission was similarly delayed unnecessarily for almost 6 months from \nMay 7 until October 21, 2009. He, too, was ultimately confirmed without \nopposition, but after needless delay.\n  Among a slew of other troublesome examples are these: One Republican \nSenator objected to a nominee to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors because, according to that Senator, the nominee lacked the \nnecessary qualifications. The nominee was a Nobel Prize winner and MIT \neconomics professor. Another Republican Senator is blocking the \nconfirmation of two SEC Commissioners until he extracts action from the \nSEC related to a case against the Stanford Financial Group. A group of \nSenate Republicans have sent a letter to President Obama vowing to \noppose any nominee to be Director of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. Republican Senators are vowing to block President Obama's \nnominee to serve as the Secretary of Commerce.\n  In a particularly illustrative case, one Republican Senator lifted \nhis hold on the nomination of the Director of the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service only after the administration acceded to his demands \nand issued 15 offshore oil drilling permits. Shortly thereafter, \nanother Republican Senator placed a hold on the very same nomination to \nforce the Interior Department to release documents on the Department's \n``wild lands'' policy. It did not end there. When that dispute was \nresolved, a third Republican Senator reportedly placed a hold on the \nnominee, demanding a review of the protected status of wolves. That \nnominee has still not been confirmed.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans have ratcheted up the partisanship, \nlimiting the cooperation that used to allow nominations to move forward \nmore quickly. We cannot and should not take risks with this critical \nterm extension for the head of the FBI. I do not want to see another \nimportant nomination subjected to holds and delays. I do not want to \nsee another well-qualified national security nominee used as leverage \nby the Republican Senate minority to extract other unrelated \nconcessions. That is what Senator Coburn's alternative plan invites.\n  I recently outlined the obstruction of key national security-related \nnominations, the Deputy Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General \nfor National Security. I do not want to see that happen, again, with \nthe nomination of an FBI Director, but we have no guarantee that the \nPresident's nomination of an FBI Director would be treated any \ndifferently.\n  Republicans played ``chicken'' with a government shutdown earlier \nthis year. We can see the same dynamic developing on the debt ceiling \nand the budget. Likewise, many Republicans, including their House \nleaders, who contended that the War Powers Act was unconstitutional \nwhen the President was a Republican, are now seeking to use it as a \npartisan cudgel to diminish this President, with little regard for the \ndamage that does to America, NATO and the effort to end the brutal \nrepression of the Libyan people by Moammar Qadhafi.\n  The Senate is finally this week seeking to complete action on a \nbipartisan, leadership-supported legislative approach to reforming \nSenate consideration of presidential nominations. It has taken weeks \nand months to get this far. Senate Republicans undermined their \nleadership and failed to support Senator Alexander and Senator \nMcConnell, who were instrumental in developing the Presidential \nAppointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, S. 679. The Senate has \nbeen stuck trying to complete this bill since June 16, when the \nmajority leader could not even get consent to proceed to the bill. \nBills that used to take 2 hours of floor time now consume 2 weeks. \nRepublican Senators who could not be bothered with conducting oversight \nwhen a Republican was in the White House are now adamant that the \nSenate should not streamline any presidential nominations, arguing that \ndoing so would undercut Senate opportunities to conduct what they call \noversight. This is just another example of how virtually everything is \nviewed through a partisan lens since the American people elected \nPresident Obama.\n  Senator Coburn has known since we began to consider the President's \nrequest to extend the FBI Director's term that his plan could not be \nconsidered a viable alternative unless there was an agreement from \nSenate Republicans to ensure that the Senate would\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\ncomplete its work and have the FBI Director in place at the end of the \nsummer. That agreement would take the form of a unanimous consent \nagreement in the Senate, entered into by all Senators, and locked in on \nthe Record so that it could not be changed without unanimous consent. \nThat has not occurred. That is the only way to ensure Senate action on \na nomination before August 3. The House would also have to agree to \nsuch an approach.\n  Senator Coburn has been unable to convince his leadership and the \nRepublican caucus to agree. It may be because some do not want to \nagree. It may be because some do not want to give up the ``leverage'' \nsuch a nomination might provide to them on other matters. Maybe they \njust do not want to make anything too ``easy'' on this President. \nWhatever the reasons, no such agreement has been forthcoming in the \nweeks it has been under consideration.\n  In fact, at the Judiciary Committee business meeting on the bill, \nwhen Senator Coburn could not offer the assurances required to lock in \nprompt and timely consideration of a subsequent nomination of the FBI \nDirector after enactment of legislation and before August 3, he did \nsuggest that his side of the aisle would forego several steps of the \nstandard process for considering nominees. He offered to waive the \nquestionnaire, the background check, and the confirmation hearing on \nDirector Mueller. But this commitment was illusory, because not even \nall of the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee agreed. \nSenator Cornyn, having questioned Director Mueller's ``management \ncapacity,'' indicated that he wanted confirmation hearings and the \nopportunity to ask questions. Of course, the Senator from Texas was \nwithin his rights to say so. But that shows the practical difficulties \nof following Senator Coburn's complicated, two-part scenario with no \nguarantee of it being completed by August 3.\n  Republican Senators lectured us on the ease with which the majority \nleader should be able to obtain cloture on a new nomination of Director \nMueller. That again makes my point. Without a binding agreement, it \ncould take days to consider the nomination, perhaps a full week.\n  We have just witnessed Senate Republicans filibustering for the first \ntime in American history the nomination of the Deputy Attorney General \nof the United States. They did that just last month. While Senator \nCornyn opined that the renomination of Director Mueller should be able \nto get 60 votes for cloture, and we should be able to end a filibuster \nof the nomination on the Senate floor, he also said that he could not \ncontrol other Republican Senators.\n  To complete action in accordance with Senator Coburn's alternative \nplan would mean not only passing legislation but the Senate receiving, \nconsidering and confirming the renomination of Director Mueller. I was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee back in 2001 when the Senate \nconsidered and confirmed Director Mueller's initial nomination within \ntwo weeks. I worked hard to make that happen. Regrettably, given the \ncurrent practices of Senate Republicans, and their unwillingness to \nagree on expedited treatment for President Obama's nominations, it is \nfoolhardy in my judgment to think that all Senate Republicans will \ncooperate without the binding force of a unanimous consent entered in \nthe Record.\n  Let me mention just one more recent example. Consider the time line \nof the nomination of the Assistant Attorney General for the National \nSecurity Division at the Department of Justice. The nominee was \napproved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee and unanimously \nby the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and approved \nunanimously by the Senate just yesterday. That nomination took 15 weeks \nfor the Senate to consider--and she was approved unanimously. It took \nmore than a month just to schedule the Senate vote after the nomination \nwas reported unanimously by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, and that was 2\\1/2\\ weeks after it was unanimously \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. This was a nominee with \nwhom many of us were familiar and who faced no opposition.\n  Of course, in the case of the FBI Director, there is no necessity to \nrequire a new nomination. The simple one-time extension contained in S. \n1103 does the job. It provides all the authority needed for the \nPresident to ask Director Mueller to stay on and for him to do so \nwithout additional action by the Senate. The separate renomination of \nDirector Mueller is not required.\n  As I have said, all Senate Democrats are prepared to take up and pass \nS. 1103, and send it to the House of Representatives for it to take \nfinal action before August 3. That is what we should be doing. We \nshould do that now, before the Fourth of July recess. There is no good \nreason for delay. All that is lacking is Senate Republicans' consent.\n  So, as they stall in moving legislation to respond to President \nObama's request to extend Director Mueller's term, Senate Republicans \nwill not commit to the unanimous consent request necessary to allow \nSenator Coburn's alternative to become a possibility. Seven of the \neight Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted \nagainst the bill to extend Director Mueller's term. Senator Coburn had \nsaid that if his alternative was not adopted by the committee, he would \nvote for the bill, but then he changed his mind and voted against. He \nthen said that he will vote for the bill, S. 1103, when it is \nconsidered by the Senate, but Senate Republicans--perhaps including \nSenator Coburn himself--are now objecting to considering it. We have \nlost another two weeks since the bill was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Finally, I observe that this is not the only matter the Senate needs \nto consider before August 3. There is the matter of the United States' \ndefault unless the debt ceiling is raised by that time. There is the \nneed to pass the America Invents Act, as passed by the House, to spur \ninnovation and jobs. There are currently 10 executive nominations ready \nfor Senate action reported by the Judiciary Committee and 18 judicial \nnominations ready for final consideration to address the judicial \nvacancies crisis. There is much to do, little time, and even less \ncooperation.\n  This important legislation, S. 1103, would fulfill the President's \nrequest that Congress create a one-time exception to the statutory 10-\nyear term of the FBI Director in order to extend the term of the \nincumbent FBI Director for 2 additional years. Given the continuing \nthreat to our Nation, especially with the tenth anniversary of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks approaching, and the need to provide \ncontinuity and stability on the President's national security team, it \nis important that we respond to the President's request and enact this \nnecessary legislation swiftly. The incumbent FBI Director's term \notherwise expires on August 3, 2011. I urge the Senate to take up this \ncritical legislation and pass it without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4215-S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSULAR NOTIFICATION COMPLIANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 14, 2011, I introduced the Consular \nNotification Compliance Act. This legislation will help bring the \nUnited States into compliance with its obligations under the Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations, VCCR, and is critical to ensuring the \nprotection of Americans traveling overseas.\n  Each year, thousands of Americans are arrested and imprisoned when \nthey are in foreign countries studying, working, serving in the \nmilitary, or traveling. From the moment they are detained, their safety \nand well-being depends, often entirely, on the ability of U.S. consular \nofficials to meet with them, monitor their treatment, help them obtain \nlegal assistance, and connect them to family back home. That access is \nprotected by the consular notification provisions of the VCCR, but it \nonly functions effectively if every country meets its obligations under \nthe treaty--including the United States.\n  As we now know, in some instances, the United States has not been \nmeeting those obligations. There are currently more than 100 foreign \nnationals on death row in the United States, most of whom were never \ntold of their right to contact their consulate, and their consulate was \nnever notified of their arrest, trial, conviction, or sentence. This \nfailure to comply with our treaty obligations undercuts our ability to\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nprotect Americans abroad and deeply damages our image as a country that \nabides by its promises and the rule of law. It would also be completely \nunacceptable to us if our citizens were treated in this manner.\n  The Consular Notification Compliance Act seeks to bring the United \nStates one step closer to compliance with the convention. It is a \nnarrowly crafted solution. It focuses only on the most serious cases--\nthose involving the death penalty--but it is a significant step in the \nright direction and we need to work together to pass it quickly. Texas \nis poised to execute the next foreign national affected by this failure \nto comply with the treaty on July 7, 2011. He was not notified of his \nright to consular assistance, and the Government of Mexico has \nexpressed grave concerns about the case. We do not want this execution \nto be interpreted as a sign that the United States does not take its \ntreaty obligations seriously, or to further damage relations with an \nimportant ally with which we share a border. That message puts American \nlives at risk.\n  Since introduction of the Consular Notification and Compliance Act, \nthe Department of Justice and the Department of State have worked with \nme to explain the importance of the bill, its limited nature, and the \nurgent need to see it passed. On June 28, Attorney General Holder and \nSecretary Clinton wrote to me in support of the ``carefully crafted, \nmeasured, and essential legislative solution'' included in the Consular \nNotification and Compliance Act. I will ask consent to have a copy of \nthe letter printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. We \nhave already had productive discussions with Republicans and Democrats \nfrom both the House and Senate. I appreciate that others are willing to \nwork together to address this critical issue.\n  I also want to note all of the favorable commentary the bill has \ngenerated, including multiple editorials in major newspapers and \nnumerous letters of support from across the political spectrum. I also \nwill ask that a selection of those be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  Everyone agrees that this legislation is not about giving breaks to \ncriminals. It is not about expanding habeas corpus relief. It is not \nabout weakening the death penalty. This bill is about three things \nonly. It is about protecting Americans when they work, travel, and \nserve in the military in foreign countries. It is about fulfilling our \nobligations and upholding the rule of law. And it is about removing a \nsignificant impediment to full and complete cooperation with our \ninternational allies on national security and law enforcement efforts \nthat keep Americans safe.\n  The bottom line is this--our failure to comply with our legal \nobligations places Americans at risk. As chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I am announcing that I intend to hold a hearing on \nthis critical issue in July. We must work together, and we must act \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letters and editorials to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, \n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We thank you for your extraordinary \n     efforts to enact legislation that would facilitate U.S. \n     compliance with its consular notification and access \n     obligations and to express the Administration's strong \n     support for S. 1194, the Consular Notification Compliance Act \n     of 2011 (CNCA).\n       The millions of U.S. citizens who live and travel overseas, \n     including many of the men and women of our Armed Forces, are \n     accorded critical protections by international treaties that \n     ensure that detained foreign nationals have access to their \n     country's consulate. Consular assistance is one of the most \n     important services that the United States provides its \n     citizens abroad. Through our consulates, the United States \n     searches for citizens overseas who are missing, visits \n     citizens in detention overseas to ensure they receive fair \n     and humane treatment, works to secure the release of those \n     unjustly detained, and provides countless other consular \n     services. Such assistance has proven vital time and again, as \n     recent experiences in Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere have \n     shown. For U.S. citizens arrested abroad, the assistance of \n     their consulate is often essential for them to gain knowledge \n     about the foreign country's legal system and how to access a \n     lawyer, to report concerns about treatment in detention, to \n     send messages to their family, or to obtain needed food or \n     medicine. Prompt access to U.S. consular officers prevents \n     U.S. citizen prisoners from being lost in a foreign legal \n     system.\n       The United States is best positioned to demand that foreign \n     governments respect consular rights with respect to U.S. \n     citizens abroad when we comply with these same obligations \n     for foreign nationals in the United States. By sending a \n     strong message about how seriously the United States takes \n     its own consular notification and access obligations, the \n     CNCA will prove enormously helpful to the U.S. Government in \n     ensuring that U.S. citizens detained overseas can receive \n     critical consular assistance.\n       The CNCA will help us ensure that the United States \n     complies fully with our obligations to provide foreign \n     nationals detained in the United States with the opportunity \n     to have their consulate notified and to receive consular \n     assistance. By setting forth the minimal, practical steps \n     that federal, state, and local authorities must take to \n     comply with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations \n     (VCCR) and similar bilateral international agreements, the \n     CNCA will ensure early consular notification and access for \n     foreign national defendants, avoiding future violations and \n     potential claims of prejudice for those who are prosecuted \n     and ultimately convicted. In this regard, the legislation is \n     an invaluable complement to the extensive training efforts \n     each of our Departments conducts in this area.\n       The CNCA appropriately balances the interests in preserving \n     the efficiency of criminal proceedings, protecting the \n     integrity of criminal convictions, and providing remedies for \n     violation of consular notification rights. By allowing \n     defendants facing capital charges to raise timely claims that \n     authorities have failed to provide consular notification and \n     access, and to ensure that notification and access is \n     afforded at that time, the CNCA further minimizes the risk \n     that a violation could later call into question the \n     conviction or sentence. The CNCA provides a limited post-\n     conviction remedy for defendants who were convicted and \n     sentenced to death before the law becomes effective. To \n     obtain relief, such defendants face a high bar: They must \n     establish not only a violation of their consular notification \n     rights but also that the violation resulted in actual \n     prejudice. Going forward, the CNCA permits defendants who \n     claim a violation of their VCCR rights an opportunity for \n     meaningful access to their consulate but does not otherwise \n     create any judicially enforceable rights.\n       After more than seven years and the efforts of two \n     administrations, the CNCA will also finally satisfy U.S. \n     obligations under the judgment of the International Court of \n     Justice (ICJ) in Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican \n     Nationals (Mex. v. US.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (Mar. 31). As we \n     expressed in April 2010 letters to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, this Administration believes that legislation is \n     an optimal way to give domestic legal effect to the Avena \n     judgment and to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision \n     in Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 (2008). The CNCA will \n     remove a long-standing obstacle in our relationship with \n     Mexico and other important allies, and send a strong message \n     to the international community about the U.S. commitment to \n     honoring our international legal obligations.\n       The CNCA unmistakably benefits U.S. foreign policy \n     interests. Many of our important allies and regional \n     institutions with which we work closely--including Mexico, \n     the United Kingdom, the European Union, Brazil and numerous \n     other Latin American countries, and the Council of Europe, \n     among others--have repeatedly and forcefully called upon the \n     United States to fulfill obligations arising from Avena and \n     prior ICJ cases finding notification and access violations. \n     We understand that the Governments of Mexico and the United \n     Kingdom have already written to Congress to express their \n     strong support for this legislation.\n       This legislation is particularly important to our bilateral \n     relationship with Mexico. Our law enforcement partnership \n     with Mexico has reached unprecedented levels of cooperation \n     in recent years. Continued noncompliance with Avena has \n     become a significant irritant that jeopardizes other \n     bilateral initiatives. Mexico considers the resolution of the \n     Avena problem a priority for our bilateral agenda. The CNCA \n     will help ensure that the excellent U.S.-Mexico cooperation \n     in extradition and other judicial proceedings, the fight \n     against drug trafficking and organized crime, and in a host \n     of other areas continues apace.\n       In sum, the CNCA is a carefully crafted, measured, and \n     essential legislative solution to these critical concerns. We \n     thank you again for your work towards finding an appropriate \n     legislative solution to this matter of fundamental importance \n     to our ability to protect Americans overseas and preserve \n     some of our most vital international relationships.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n       Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2011]\n\n    Why the U.S. Should Allow Arrested Foreigners To Contact Their \n                               Consulates\n\n       Humberto Leal Jr. is scheduled to be put to death by the \n     state of Texas next month\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\n     for the 1994 murder of a 16-year-old girl. Like so many cases \n     involving capital punishment, Mr. Leal's has generated \n     controversy, but not for the typical reasons.\n       Mr. Leal is a Mexican national. When he was arrested, Texas \n     officials failed to advise him of his right to communicate \n     with his country's embassy as required by the Vienna \n     Convention on Consular Relations. The United States, Mexico \n     and some 160 other countries are signatories to the \n     convention. Mr. Leal is one of roughly 40 Mexican nationals \n     who were not advised about consular access and who sit on \n     death row in this country.\n       Mexico filed a grievance on behalf of its nationals and \n     prevailed in 2004 before the International Court of Justice \n     (ICJ), the judicial arm of the United Nations. The ICJ \n     concluded that the United States was obligated to comply with \n     the treaty and that it should review these cases to determine \n     whether the defendants had been harmed by the lack of \n     notification.\n       Texas, where the majority of these inmates are held, \n     balked. Three years ago, the state executed Jose Ernesto \n     Medellin, another Mexican national who was not informed of \n     his right to consular access and who was denied additional \n     review. The state is likely to take the same approach in the \n     Leal case. ``Here, in Texas, if you commit terrible and \n     heinous crimes you're going to pay the ultimate price,'' says \n     Katherine Cesinger, press secretary to Gov. Rick Perry.\n       This misses the point entirely. This is not about coddling \n     criminals nor is it a referendum on the death penalty. It is \n     about a country's obligation to honor its treaty commitments. \n     The United States must comply with the Vienna Convention--and \n     demonstrate good faith in addressing past mistakes--if U.S. \n     citizens abroad are to be afforded the same rights and \n     protections.\n       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is expected to introduce \n     legislation as soon as this week to provide meaningful review \n     in federal court for those denied consular access. The \n     legislation should be narrowly tailored and mandate that the \n     legal proceedings focus solely on whether denial of access \n     seriously prejudiced an inmate's ability to defend against \n     charges. The bar for success should be high, and only those \n     who can provide compelling evidence of such harm should be \n     allowed a new trial or benefit from a reduced sentence.\n       To avoid this problem in the future, federal and state \n     governments should be diligent about abiding by the treaty's \n     mandates. The State Department should continue its outreach \n     to state and local governments to impress upon law \n     enforcement officials the importance of the consular \n     notification. Complying with the treaty is not only the right \n     thing to do; it is the smart and self-interested thing to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 17, 2011]\n\n                         The Treaty and the Law\n\n       Humberto Leal Garcia Jr., a Mexican citizen who faces \n     execution in Texas next month, has petitioned Gov. Rick Perry \n     for a six-month reprieve. He is asking for a stay under a \n     vital international law, the Vienna Convention on Consular \n     Relations, which requires that foreign nationals who are \n     arrested be told of their right to have their embassy \n     notified of that arrest and to ask for help.\n       In recent years, the treaty has provided important \n     protection for Americans who have been detained in Iran, \n     North Korea and elsewhere. Mr. Leal was not notified after \n     his arrest of his right to contact his embassy. But the \n     Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that Texas did not need to comply \n     with the treaty because there is no federal law requiring \n     that states do so.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont on Tuesday introduced a \n     bill that makes clear that federal law requires that states \n     tell foreign nationals who have been arrested that they can \n     contact their consulates for help.\n       For those who were convicted and sentenced without being \n     told, the bill would let them ask a federal court to review \n     their case and decide whether the outcome would have been \n     different if they had had diplomatic help. After the bill was \n     introduced, Mr. Leal petitioned Federal District Court for a \n     stay to keep Texas from ``rushing to execute'' him before \n     Congress has time to act.\n       Mr. Leal, convicted of murder during a sexual assault, had \n     grossly incompetent legal representation. If he had been \n     given access to a Mexican diplomat, he would have had a \n     chance at better counsel and likely the opportunity to strike \n     a plea deal, avoiding the death penalty.\n       For the sake of justice, the governor and court should \n     grant the stays. For the protection of foreigners arrested \n     here, and American citizens arrested abroad, Congress should \n     pass Senator Leahy's bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Austin American-Statesman, June 10, 2011]\n\n          Execution Case Important to International Relations\n\n       The Golden Rule of life also applies to the tricky business \n     of international relations. What we do to non-Americans in \n     our country we can reasonably expect to be done unto \n     Americans in other countries.\n       It is for that reason that Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas \n     Board of Pardons and Paroles--both in the uncommon position \n     of making a decision with international impact--should \n     commute or postpone the death sentence of Humberto Leal, a \n     Mexican raised in Texas, scheduled to die July 7 for the 1994 \n     murder of Adria Sauceda, 16, in Bexar County.\n       The key issue in this case at this point is not whether \n     Leal committed the crime. Also not central now are the \n     circumstances involving Leal, including sexual abuse by a \n     priest, a challenging family history and other factors that, \n     though significant, fail to add up to justification for \n     murder. They could, however, count as mitigating factors that \n     argue for a life sentence.\n       It's what happened after Sauceda was killed that is at \n     issue. More specifically, it's what didn't happen. Despite \n     the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requirements, \n     Leal was not informed of his right to contact Mexican \n     officials to seek legal assistance. Records indicate that he \n     was not aware of that right until told about it by a fellow \n     death row inmate.\n       Instead of getting legal help from Mexican consular \n     officials, who have a track record of providing quality legal \n     representation for Mexicans facing the death penalty in the \n     U.S., Leal was represented by a court-\n     appointed team that included a lawyer who twice had his \n     license suspended.\n       Back in 2004, the International Court of Justice said Leal \n     was entitled to a hearing to determine the extent of harm he \n     suffered as a result of the lack of consular access. A U.S. \n     Supreme Court ruling has said the U.S. must comply with the \n     decision by the international court. Texas, citing state law, \n     said no such hearing could take place. Congress now is poised \n     to consider legislation, to be filed in coming weeks, that \n     would establish a procedure for a federal court hearing on \n     the extent of harm caused to Leal because he was not advised \n     of his right to contact Mexican officials.\n       In a clemency petition filed this week, an impressive list \n     of former U.S. diplomats, retired military leaders and others \n     concerned about international matters urged a stay of \n     execution to grant Congress time to deal with this case.\n       At stake, they said, are the consular rights of Americans \n     who become entangled in legal problems while out of the \n     country.\n       ``For Texas to proceed with (Leal's) execution prior to \n     full compliance with these treaty obligations would endanger \n     the interests of American citizens and the United States \n     around the world,'' John B. Bellinger III, a State Department \n     legal adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said in a \n     letter signed by others and delivered to Perry.\n       The former military leaders told Perry that ``improving \n     U.S. enforcement of its consular notification and legal \n     access obligations will help protect American citizens \n     detained abroad, including U.S. military personnel and the \n     families stationed overseas.''\n       Sandra L. Babcock, a Northwestern University law professor \n     representing Leal, said he would not have been convicted if \n     he had received proper consular assistance. We have no way of \n     knowing that. But there is no arguing with Babcock's \n     contention that ``with consular access, Mr. Leal would have \n     had competent lawyers and expert assistance that would have \n     transformed the quality of his defense.''\n       And, as she noted, Mexican officials have developed \n     expertise in helping Mexicans facing the death penalty in the \n     U.S.\n       ``It really is a very modest remedy we are talking about,'' \n     Babcock said.\n       Modest, indeed, but with important international \n     ramifications.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, June 22, 2011]\n\n    Keeping Our Word: Scheduled Texas Execution Violates Treaty and \n                       Endangers Americans Abroad\n\n       Americans traveling abroad are protected, whether they are \n     aware of it or not, by a treaty called the Vienna Convention \n     on Consular Relations, ratified by about 170 countries, which \n     guarantees them access to U.S. consular assistance if they \n     are detained or arrested in a foreign country. In 2010, more \n     than 6,600 Americans were arrested abroad, and more than \n     3,000 were incarcerated. Many of them benefited from the \n     protections of this treaty.\n       But unfortunately, the U.S. has repeatedly failed to offer \n     those same protections to foreigners on U.S. soil. The most \n     egregious of these violations is the denial of consular \n     assistance to foreign nationals convicted and sentenced to \n     death. (Currently, about 100 foreign nationals are on U.S. \n     death rows.) And in a particularly urgent case, one of those \n     individuals whose rights were violated, a Mexican national \n     named Humberto Leal Garcia, is scheduled to be executed on \n     July 7 in Huntsville.\n       Because a bill has been introduced to bring the U.S. into \n     compliance with the treaty, Leal's attorneys have filed a \n     federal petition and a motion for a stay of execution so that \n     Leal will be alive and eligible for the remedies of this \n     legislation when it becomes law.\n       There are compelling reasons why these petitions should be \n     granted. Chief among them is the fact that this pending \n     legislation will allow for review of cases like Leal's, said \n     his attorney Sandra Babcock, ``where lack of consular \n     assistance may well have made the difference between life and \n     death. That's why the consular access really matters.'' \n     Mexico provides top-flight legal assistance to its nationals \n     under such circumstances.\n       Leal's court-appointed attorneys were ineffective and \n     inexperienced, Babcock told the Chronicle, resulting in harm \n     to Leal in both the guilt-or-innocence and the penalty phases \n     of his trial. According to Babcock,\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n     they failed to challenge the prosecution's ``junk science'' \n     and flawed DNA evidence or to present expert testimony on \n     Leal's learning disabilities and brain damage. Leal, \n     sentenced to death for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16-year-\n     old girl, was then 21 and had no criminal record.\n       Also, there is no dispute that this treaty is the law: In \n     2003, Mexico filed suit against the U.S., claiming that 51 \n     Mexican nationals sentenced to death in U.S. courts had been \n     denied consular access. (Leal was one of them.) In 2004, the \n     International Court of Justice ruled that the U.S. must \n     review those individuals' cases. The issue was finally \n     resolved, in 2008, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which \n     unanimously supported the ICJ decision but ruled that it was \n     up to Congress to implement it.\n       That is what Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick \n     Leahy addressed last week, when he introduced legislation to \n     allow federal courts to review such cases, and to increase \n     compliance and provide remedies.\n       And finally, as Leahy eloquently stated, the U.S. failure \n     to honor its treaty obligations ``undercuts our ability to \n     protect Americans abroad and deeply damages our image as a \n     country that abides by its promises and the rule of law. It \n     would also be completely unacceptable to us if our citizens \n     were treated in this manner.''\n       For all of these reasons, we urge Congress to act swiftly \n     to pass this legislation, and we urge Gov. Perry to give \n     Leal, and others in his situation, the time to benefit from \n     its remedies if they are shown to have been harmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4218-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PERRY, UTAH\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the great \ncity of Perry, UT, on the 100th anniversary of its incorporation.\n  Today, Perry is a beautiful city of nearly 4,000 residents nestled at \nthe foot of northern Utah's majestic Wasatch Mountains. Its fame and \nacclaim are extensive for a variety of reasons.\n  First, it is the apple of many a person's eye because of its location \non Utah's famed Fruit Way. Its fruit stands along highway 89 are laden \nwith apples, cherries, apricots, peaches, pears and other produce. I \nhave never found any fruit nearly so sweet in all my travels.\n  Perry is also home to the legendary Maddox Ranch House, where \nsucculent steaks, fried chicken, homemade rolls and other fare have \nbeen food for thought and the palate for locals and many a weary \ntraveler--this Senator, included--for more than six decades.\n  Best of all, though, are the wonderful residents of Perry. I have \nalways been unfailingly impressed with their work ethic and civic-\nmindedness their eagerness and willingness to pitch in and build a \nbetter future and community for their children and grandchildren.\n  They also are warm and welcoming. Whenever people pop in, they never \nseem to be put out. It has been my experience that they are always \neager to lend a hand or extend the hand of friendship. I always feel \nbetter for being there. It doesn't hurt that my wife Elaine hails from \nnearby Newton. Little wonder that every time I am in Perry I feel right \nat home.\n  Great places like Perry don't just happen. It takes vision and hard \nwork--a trait Orrin Porter Rockwell and his brother Merritt undoubtedly \nhad in abundance when they laid claim to a piece of land in the area \nadjacent Porter Spring. They were followed in 1851 by the Mormon \npioneers, settlers of faith and fortitude who befriended the Native \nAmericans there and founded what became known as Three Mile Creek.\n  Many milestones have come and gone since then. In 1861 the first \nschool was built, followed by the groundbreaking for the Northern Utah \nRailroad 10 years later. And the settlers also weathered some \nadversity, including harsh winters and the Great Flood of 1896. Two \nyears later, Three Mile Creek was renamed Perry in honor of Orrin \nAlonzo Perry, who served as an LDS bishop there for more than two \ndecades.\n  June 19, 1911, the date of Perry's incorporation, was another major \nevent and marked a new beginning. Over the ensuing years, the people of \nPerry, under the guidance of some remarkable and visionary leaders, \nkept right on building, bringing electricity, drinking water, a town \nhall and more schools to the city. Just this year, Perry added a \nwastewater treatment plant and a soccer park to the mix. And I trust \nmany more chapters remain to be written in Perry's illustrious history.\n  As Perry celebrates its centennial over the Fourth of July weekend, I \nsalute its visionary and hardworking citizens, both past and present, \nwho have made the city what it is today. I am sure Orrin Porter \nRockwell and Orrin Alonzo Perry would be proud. You can be certain that \nthis Orrin is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4218-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXPLOITING GAPS IN U.S. GUN LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have long sought to bring attention to \nthe dangerous gaps in U.S. gun laws, hoping the exposure would lead to \nthe passage of commonsense firearm legislation. To those of us who feel \nthat Congress can and should play a role in protecting American \nneighborhoods from the scourge of gun violence, enacting laws to ensure \nfirearms stay out of the hands of dangerous people seems like a no-\nbrainer. Unfortunately, the National Rifle Association, despite broad \nsupport for sensible gun safety laws among Americans across the \npolitical spectrum, has successfully blocked much-needed legislative \nchanges.\n  Recently a startling new voice joined the discussion highlighting the \nweaknesses in our gun laws, most notably how we administer firearm \nbackground checks. Consider the following quote describing the so-\ncalled gun show loophole:\n\n       America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable \n     firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local \n     convention center and come away with a fully automatic \n     assault rifle without a background check and, most likely, \n     without having to show an identification card.\n\n  While this quote does not break any new ground regarding the dangers \nof the gun show loophole, it is noteworthy because of the person who \nsaid it. These were not the words of a Member of Congress, advocating \nfor legislation, nor were they the words of a spokesperson of groups \nlike Mayors Against Illegal Guns or the Brady Campaign. This quote is \ntaken from an Internet video message recorded by Adam Gadahn, an \nAmerican-born, confirmed al-Qaida operative.\n  In the video, Gadahn speaks to al-Qaida followers and sympathizers, \ndescribing the ease with which a person can purchase a firearm from a \nprivate seller without a background check, often with no questions \nasked. In fact, this video is not merely a description of the loopholes \nin U.S. gun laws, it is an exhortation to would-be terrorists to \nexploit these loopholes and kill innocent Americans. To wit, the video \nends with Gadahn asking his viewers, ``What are you waiting for?''\n  This video is a chilling reminder that dangerous loopholes exist in \nU.S. gun laws, weaknesses that terrorists are actively trying to \nexploit. While Gadahn is not entirely accurate--a person cannot \npurchase a ``fully automatic assault'' rifle at a gun show without \ngovernment knowledge--he correctly describes just how simple it is for \ndangerous individuals to acquire deadly weapons in the United States, \nincluding semi-automatic assault rifles.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up and pass two gun safety bills \nintroduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg: the Gun Show Background Check \nAct, S. 35, which would close the loophole that makes it easy for \ncriminals, terrorists and other prohibited buyers to evade background \nchecks and buy guns from private citizens at gun shows; and the Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, S. 34, which would \nclose the loophole in Federal law that hinders the ability of law \nenforcement to keep firearms out of the hands of terrorists by \nauthorizing the Attorney General to deny the sale of a firearm when a \nbackground check reveals that the prospective purchaser is a known or \nsuspected terrorist.\n  Congressional action should not require such stark evidence that al-\nQaida and like-minded criminals are trying to use weak U.S. gun laws to \ncarry out terrorist attacks against Americans. But the evidence--clear, \nexplicit and terrifying--is here nonetheless. The time to act is long \noverdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4218-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4218-S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UTAH SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the Utah \nShakespeare Festival, the Nation's premier regional theater and one of \nour State's crown jewels, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\n  Great things often evolve from small or modest beginnings. That was \ncertainly the case in 1961 when Fred C. Adams and his late wife, \nBarbara, founded the event in Cedar City with lofty goals, a bargain-\nbasement budget of $1,000, and 21 volunteers. They envisioned what few \nothers could see--that the 150,000 tourists who flocked to the area \neach summer might also be gathered for a theater festival.\n  Today, the Utah Shakespeare Festival is the proud recipient of a Tony \nAward for being the ``outstanding regional theatre in America.'' It \noperates year-round, boasts a $6.6 million budget, employs 26 Equity \nactors and has another 300 community volunteers. Its repertoire has \nalso expanded. Yes, Shakespeare is still the main attraction, but the \nfestival also stages plays from three centuries of playwrights from all \nacross Europe and the United States.\n  Not bad for a festival that is 250 miles from Salt Lake City, the \nState's largest metropolitan area.\n  Geography, though, can hardly be the sole consideration for theatre \naficionados who wish to attend the festival. It is simply too good and \ntoo glorious to miss, for mileage's sake. That is why I and millions of \nothers have eagerly gone the distance many times to take in \nShakespeare's plays at the open-air Adams Memorial Theatre--modeled \nafter the playwright's famed Globe Theatre in London--and other \nofferings at the indoor Randall L. Jones Theatre. Every time I have \ngone, I have been thoroughly entertained and richly rewarded.\n  But the past is past, or, as Shakespeare put it, ``What is past is \nprologue.'' I look forward to many more productions there, and for the \nevent to capture ever-more acclaim and captivate ever-larger and more \nappreciative audiences. Perhaps the Bard of Avon's words best sum up \nthe festival's future: ``The golden age is before us, not behind us.'' \nI firmly believe that to be true.\n  On this, the 50th anniversary of the Utah Shakespeare Festival, I \nsalute the visionaries like Fred and Barbara Adams, Executive Director \nR. Scott Phillips, and the scores of organizers, performers, and \nvolunteers who have and continue to make this wonderful event possible.\n  I commend them for a wonderful 50 years and wish them well as they \nembark on the next 50 and continue to carry out the festival's mission \nto ``entertain, enrich and educate.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4219-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                REMEMBERING DR. WALTER A. SOBOLEFF, SR.\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize Dr. \nWalter A. Soboleff, Sr., who died at his home on May 22, 2011. During a \nlife which spanned more than 102 years, Dr. Soboleff was revered as one \nof Alaska's greatest teachers. A Presbyterian minister, Tlingit scholar \nand elder, his quiet wisdom, wry humor, and loving leadership bridged \ncultures to change attitudes and lives.\n  Born November 14, 1908, in Killisnoo, AK, to a Tlingit mother and the \nson of a Russian Orthodox priest, Walter was a member of the Yeil \nmoiety, Raven; L'eeneidi clan, Dog Salmon; and Aanx'aakhittaan House. \nHis Tlingit names included T'aaw Chan and Kaajaakwti.\n  From fifth grade through high school, Dr. Soboleff emerged as an \nacademic talent at Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian mission school in \nSitka, AK. Though baptized by his Russian Orthodox grandfather, his \nexperience at Sheldon Jackson led him to the Presbyterian ministry. Few \nAlaska Natives had access to college in the 1930s, but Dr. Soboleff was \nhungry to learn. He attended a term at Oregon State University, fished \ncommercially, and worked the canneries before receiving a full \nscholarship to the theological seminary at the University of Dubuque, \nIowa. He completed his graduate degree there in 1940.\n  With many offers to fill pulpits around the country, Dr. Soboleff \nchose to return to Alaska. As the first ordained Alaska Native, he led \nJuneau's Memorial Presbyterian Church, a struggling mission to the \nTlingits. For many at that time, an integrated church was \ninconceivable, but Dr. Soboleff's inspired fusion of Tlingit and \nChristian spirituality attracted a diverse and growing congregation. \nHis teachings were so resonant that part of his service was broadcast \non the radio, and he even had a weekly news program which was broadcast \nin the Tlingit language.\n  Although Memorial Church closed in 1962, Dr. Soboleff maintained his \nspirit, relocating his ministry to the mission boats Anna Jackman and \nPrinceton Hall. On them, he traveled southeast Alaska to serve remote \nvillages, logging camps, and lighthouse stations.\n  A man who walked his talk, Dr. Soboleff was an activist of quiet \nstrength who dedicated himself to humanitarian service and the \npreservation of his culture. He exemplified caring, understanding, and \nmutual respect. When denied housing because he and his wife Genevieve \nwere Native, and when the Presbyterians closed his church without \nexplanation, he chose the high road and subsequently opened doors. He \nresponded to conflict with benevolence and racial bias with equanimity, \nand his unexpected kindness softened difficult situations to invite \nopen relationships and understanding.\n  A worker rather than a joiner, Dr. Soboleff belonged to many diverse \norganizations, all dedicated to human understanding and, for him, the \npreservation of his culture.\n  As a member of the Alaska Native Brotherhood, he served in all \noffices including seven terms as grand president. Through ANB he worked \nto empower Alaska Natives and develop collaborations with other \norganizations to shape antidiscrimination and land claims legislation. \nAfter passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971, Dr. \nSoboleff served as a director of the Sealaska Corporation, president of \nKootznoowoo, Inc., and chair of the Sealaska Heritage Institute's Board \nof Trustees.\n  As a member of the Lions Club, he helped to found the Gold Medal \nBasketball Tournament, an event which continues to unite southeast \nAlaska communities in sport.\n  As a member of the Alaska National Guard, he served 20 years as \nchaplain and retired as a lieutenant colonel.\n  In recognition of his many outstanding achievements, the University \nof Dubuque awarded Dr. Soboleff an honorary doctorate in divinity in \n1952; the University of Alaska would follow suit with an honorary \ndoctorate of humanities in 1968.\n  Widely recognized as one who understood the value of education, Dr. \nSoboleff was appointed by Governor Walter J. Hickel to the State board \nof education. The first Alaska Native to serve, he became chair in \n1967. In 1970, he became the first director of Native Studies at UAF. \nThere, he taught Tlingit history, language, and literature. Fluent both \nin Tlingit and English, he translated stories to revive the Tlingit \nlanguage and restore his people's pride in themselves and their \nheritage. Cross-cultural understanding and human respect were so \nimportant to Dr. Soboleff, that he stayed active until the end of his \nlong life, addressing a rally against domestic violence just weeks \nbefore his death. His presence and his words, as always, made a \ndifference.\n  To Dr. Soboleff's four children, Janet, Sasha, Walter, and Ross, and \nto his extended family, we send deep condolences along with joy for the \ngift of his longevity. While Alaska has lost one of the greatest of her \nleaders, the teachings of Walter A. Soboleff have shaped how we view \nourselves and how we treat one another. Those touched by his spirit \nhave been changed for the better, and his legacy lives on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4219-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4219-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4219-S4220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the first time:\n\n       S.J.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee memorializing Congress to continue \n     to support career and technical education programs, including \n     the Perkins Tech Prep program; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 111\n\n       Whereas, the career and technical education programs \n     available to our students here in Tennessee and across this \n     great Nation are a most vital tool for the economic future \n     and advancement of the United States; and\n       Whereas, on February 11, the House Appropriations Committee \n     in Washington, D.C., introduced legislation, H.R. 1, \n     legislation which completely eliminates funding for the \n     Perkins Tech Prep program for the 2011-2012 school year and \n     makes drastic cuts across other education and workforce \n     development programs; and\n       Whereas, career and technical education programs play an \n     integral role in providing our students with the experience \n     and training necessary to compete in the modern economy and a \n     reduction in funding will harm Tennessee's students and \n     communities, both big and small, as well as the economic \n     well-being of America: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Seventh General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to continue to \n     support career and technical education programs, including \n     the Perkins Tech Prep program. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a certified copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the President and the Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of Tennessee's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to sustain home energy assistance for at-risk \n     Louisianians and to declare June 2011 as ``Save LIHEAP'' \n     Month; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, the federal home energy assistance program is of \n     vital interest to the state of Louisiana and to low to \n     moderate income households, especially the elderly, disabled, \n     or young citizens, who struggle disproportionately to afford \n     heating and cooling costs; and\n       Whereas, Congress is considering the proposed budget to \n     reduce the fiscal year 2012 Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program (LIHEAP) formula grant funding by fifty-seven percent \n     nationally; and\n       Whereas, this reduction is disproportionately more damaging \n     in Louisiana, triggering a sixty-seven percent loss, \n     resulting in the life-threatening decrease of 34.7 million \n     dollars to Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, due to the loss of these funds, tens of thousands \n     of vulnerable Louisiana citizens will lose access to the \n     LIHEAP's vital energy services; and\n       Whereas, more than four hundred and seventy-six thousand \n     Louisiana households meet LIHEAP's stringent income \n     eligibility requirements; and\n       Whereas, of these households, one hundred eighty-four \n     thousand shelter someone over the age of sixty, ninety-six \n     thousand are children under the age of six, and one hundred \n     and fifty-four thousand are handicapped individuals, \n     including disabled veterans; and\n       Whereas, for a Louisiana family of four to be eligible for \n     LIHEAP, the family must earn no more than twenty-seven \n     dollars per day, per capita; and\n       Whereas, although nearly a half-million Louisiana \n     households meet LIHEAP's federal income criteria, only a \n     small fraction of eligible households are actually helped due \n     to already limited federal funding; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's ability to reach at-risk families \n     through LIHEAP is entirely dependent upon the provision of \n     adequate funding from Congress; and\n       Whereas, home energy assistance is particularly important \n     in Louisiana due to intermittent intense heat and humidity, \n     which is especially threatening to the elderly, disabled, and \n     young citizens; and\n       Whereas, if the program's core block grants were reduced as \n     proposed, Louisianians would be disproportionately affected, \n     because the national program would be statutorily precluded \n     from considering current population, poverty, and energy \n     price data and mirroring outdated needs of twenty-five years \n     ago; and\n       Whereas, unless Congress sustains LIHEAP, Louisiana's most \n     vulnerable citizens will be placed at an unnecessarily \n     greater risk. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature hereby declares \n     June, 2011 to be ``Save LIHEAP Month'' and encourages public \n     and private citizens to join in by encouraging their \n     respective congressional delegation to sustain this vital \n     program at its long-standing national appropriation of five \n     point one billion dollars during federal Fiscal Year 2012. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to sustain \n     home energy assistance for at-risk Louisianians and to \n     declare June 2011 as ``Save LIHEAP'' Month. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2012 to \n2015 for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, to enhance \nmeasures to combat trafficking in persons, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with Senators \nScott Brown, John Kerry, and others to introduce the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2011, which will reaffirm and \nexpand our commitment to fighting human trafficking. Since it was first \nenacted with strong bipartisan support more than a decade ago, the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act has played a central role in our \ncountry's efforts to combat human trafficking both abroad and at home.\n  Championed by the late Senator Wellstone and Senator Brownback, the \noriginal Trafficking Victims Protection Act drew upon the work and \nsupport of a broad coalition of advocacy organizations from across the \npolitical and social spectrum groups dedicated to children's rights, \nhuman rights, and women's rights, as well as religious organizations \nincluding Evangelical, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish groups. It was \nsigned by President Clinton and reauthorized twice under President \nBush. I am pleased that today we continue the tradition of bipartisan \ncooperation as we seek the fourth reauthorization of this critical law.\n  Earlier this week, the State Department released its annual \nTrafficking in Persons Report, which documents the continuing \nsignificant human trafficking crisis worldwide. The report has received \nconsiderable attention, as The Washington Post editorialized yesterday, \nthe United States has made significant strides on this issue, both \nthrough the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and through important \ninitiatives from this administration. But much work remains to be done \ndomestically and around the world.\n  Human trafficking is a modern-day form of slavery, involving victims \nwho are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual \nexploitation. Millions of children, women, and men throughout the world \nare trafficked every year, including here in the United States. \nAccording to recent Government estimates, between 15,000 and 20,000 \npeople are trafficked to the United States annually for the purpose of \nlabor and sexual exploitation. Thousands more of our own children are \nbought and sold in the commercial sex industry every year.\n  It is no surprise that border states are at a particularly high risk \nfor human trafficking. I am proud that my home state of Vermont is \ntaking significant steps to address the issue. State legislators in \nVermont recently passed a comprehensive anti-trafficking law that \nincludes criminal penalties, prevention programs, and services for \nhuman trafficking victims. I commend the Vermont legislature for taking \non this important issue.\n  Trafficking is an affront to human dignity that we cannot ignore. The \nUnited States offers a beacon of hope to so many who face human rights \nabuses abroad, so we cannot sit back idly while this injustice \ncontinues not only elsewhere in the world, but also here at home. \nThanks to the tools provided by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nwe have made progress in combating this major human rights abuse, but \nthere is more work to be done.\n  This reauthorization reflects Congress's ongoing commitment to \nabolishing human trafficking. It strengthens the government's ability \nto combat trafficking by expanding enforcement tools, and by \nencouraging further inter-agency cooperation to identify victims, \ninvestigate offenses, and provide victim services.\n  Strengthening our response to human trafficking in the United States \nwill help this country serve as a model for the world as we work with \nother nations to confront this complicated problem. An important tool \nin that international effort is the annual Trafficking in Persons \nReport established in the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act. \nThat report has come to serve as an important diplomatic tool to \nencourage foreign governments to increase efforts against modern-day \nslavery. This legislation will require that the United States include \nitself in the report, a step already initiated by Secretary of State \nClinton last year.\n  Fighting human trafficking was a priority of the Bush administration, \nand the Obama administration is continuing that commitment. I applaud \nthe hard work of Secretary of State Clinton, Attorney General Holder, \nSecretary of Labor Solis, and Secretary of Health and Human Services \nSebelius to find new ways to work together to indentify and support \nvictims of trafficking while bringing the full force of the United \nStates down on those who seek to profit from the exploitation of \nothers. Nowhere on Earth should it be acceptable to deceive, abuse, and \nforce a person into a life of enslavement, least of all here in the \nUnited States. We must do all we can to end this scourge.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Brown and Senator Kerry to \ncontinue the bipartisan work started by Senators Wellstone and \nBrownback more than a decade ago. I hope that Senators from both \nparties will join us to quickly pass this critical reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make funds available to reimburse certain \nfishermen for legal fees and costs incurred in connection with improper \nfines and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, Federal regulations developed to \nlimit fishing have forced some fishermen out of business and pushed \nmany more to the brink. Too many Massachusetts fishermen are doing all \nthey can every day to keep a roof over their head and to feed their \nfamilies. They are extremely frustrated that the Department of Commerce \nhas made a series of decisions that seem to make it more difficult for \nthem to take care of their families.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  In May 2009, I sent a letter to Administrator Lubchenco requesting \nthat NOAA investigate allegations of excessive penalties and \nretaliatory actions. These charges have been confirmed both by the \nInspector General and by Special Master Swartwood appointed by \nSecretary Locke. This has led to NOAA personnel being reassigned and \nsome fines being rescinded by Secretary Locke. There continues to be a \njustified distrust of the Federal Government by the fishermen, this \nrelationship must be repaired and trust must be restored.\n  I have been working in the Senate to make sure that our fishermen \nwill be treated fairly by federal regulators.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Fisheries Fee Fairness Act of \n2011. This legislation will give the Secretary of Commerce the option \nto take funds from the Asset Forfeiture Fund, AFF, and use them to \nreimburse the legal fees and costs incurred by fishermen and businesses \nwhose fines were remitted by the Secretary of Commerce at the \nrecommendation of Special Master Swartwood. Under my legislation, the \nSecretary of Commerce would have 90 days to determine whether to \nprovide a reimbursement and the amount of the reimbursement and \nreimbursements would be capped at $200,000 per person or business. The \nSpecial Master is currently reviewing a second round of cases brought \nforth by fishermen who believed they were inappropriately penalized by \nNOAA enforcement agents. Under my legislation, the fishermen in this \ngroup will also qualify to have their legal fees and costs reimbursed \nif the Secretary of Commerce remits their fines.\n  We have made progress in rebuilding the relationship between our \nfishermen and the Federal Government, but we still have a distance to \ntravel. This legislation ensures our fishermen are made whole and can \nkeep what they have earned, and those are principles I intend to keep \nfighting for. I ask all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lee, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Kyl, Mr. Toomey, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Risch, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \n        DeMint, Mr. Paul, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Thune, \n        Mr. Alexander, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Burr, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Coburn, Mr. Moran, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Isakson, \n        Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Sessions, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Boozman, Mr. Roberts, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Corker, Mr. \n        Johanns, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Portman, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. \n        Heller):\n  S.J.

Res. 219\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of the skin and \n     other organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2011, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4236-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 220--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nJUNE 30, 2011, OPENING OF THE TOM LANTOS INSTITUTE IN BUDAPEST, HUNGARY\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Reed of Nevada) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Edmonds;\n       Whereas the founders of Kappa Alpha Psi were God-fearing, \n     high-achieving, serious-minded young men who possessed the \n     imagination, ambition, courage, and determination to defy \n     custom and cultural challenges in pursuit of college \n     educations and careers during a period in United States \n     history in which such opportunities were not broadly \n     available to African-Americans;\n       Whereas since its founding Kappa Alpha Psi has stressed \n     high ideals and the importance of achievement in every field \n     of human endeavor by instilling in African-American youth the \n     noble aspiration of serving others and by training its \n     members to positively influence their communities and \n     society;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi membership has grown to include \n     more than 150,000 college-educated men, with undergraduate \n     chapters located on more than 360 college and university \n     campuses and with alumni chapters located in more than 340 \n     cities in the United States and in 5 foreign countries;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi hosts a biennial Undergraduate \n     Leadership Institute, a comprehensive training- and skills-\n     enhancement program for the top student leaders of Kappa \n     Alpha Psi, to inspire them to become positive role models and \n     to serve the good of society;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi partners with Habitat for Humanity \n     and assists in building homes for local families in \n     conjunction with each of its biennial national conventions;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi partners with St. Jude Children's \n     Research Hospital, based in Memphis, Tennessee, and, with the \n     help of local communities and churches, has raised more than \n     $1,000,000 for the continuation of the mission of that \n     hospital;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi designated St. Jude Children's \n     Research Hospital as the primary benefactor of its national \n     fundraising efforts;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi sponsors Kappas on Capitol Hill, a \n     4-day conference in Washington, District of Columbia, that \n     seeks to increase member awareness of the political process \n     through workshops, seminars, and lectures, and that seeks to \n     inform its members of the importance of the political process \n     in bettering society;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi emphasizes financial literacy in \n     its community-based outreach by partnering with the National \n     Association of Bankruptcy Trustees, the National Foundation \n     for Credit Counseling, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council \n     to implement 2 major programs, Credit Abuse Resistance \n     Education and Greeks Learning to Avoid Debt;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi, through its Kappa League and \n     National Guide Right programs, matches thousands of at-risk \n     youths throughout the United States with role models and \n     mentors that encourage the youths to positively contribute to \n     and become leaders in their communities;\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\n       Whereas, since 1990, the Kappa Alpha Psi Kappa Scholarship \n     Fund has provided scholarship grants to more than 10,000 high \n     school graduates to assist in furthering their education and \n     has encouraged its undergraduate and alumni chapters to \n     support similar endeavors to broaden the ability of \n     economically disadvantaged youth to aspire to obtain a \n     college education;\n       Whereas the oldest formal program of Kappa Alpha Psi, the \n     Holiday Food Drive, provides food, clothing, and toys to \n     thousands of low income individuals in many metropolitan and \n     rural communities throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the national theme of Kappa Alpha Psi, ``One Kappa, \n     Creating Inspiration: A Call to Service'', has mobilized \n     Kappa Alpha Psi members across the United States who are \n     leaders in business, education, government, the humanities, \n     arts and entertainment, science, and medicine to become \n     better servant leaders for their families and communities, \n     the United States, and the fraternity at large;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi partners with the United Negro \n     College Fund, the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People, and the National Urban League;\n       Whereas Kappa Alpha Psi supports the National Education \n     Association, the National Association of State Boards of \n     Education, the Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors, \n     the North-American Interfraternity Conference, and the \n     National Pan-Hellenic Council;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 222.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 222) recognizing the American \n     Revolution Center for its role in telling the story of the \n     American Revolution and the continuing impact on struggles \n     for freedom, self-government, and the rule of law throughout \n     the world, and encouraging the Center in its efforts to build \n     a new Museum of the American Revolution.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, it goes without saying that the history of \nthe American evolution is a major chapter of our Nation's history, of \nAmerican history. Yet currently there is no single place where a person \ncan go which tells the American story from its colonial past through \npresent day. I believe that there should be a place where visitors can \ncome to learn more about the revolution and can see artifacts, \nmanuscripts, and artwork from this period. I believe there should be an \ninstitution dedicated to telling this important story.\n  Today, I am very happy to submit a resolution which not only \nexpresses how important it is to tell the story of the American \nRevolution and the continuing impact on struggles for freedom, self-\ngovernment and the rule of law throughout the world, but also to \nencourage the American Revolution Center in its efforts to build a new \nMuseum of the American Revolution.\n  The American Revolution Center plans to open the Nation's first \nmuseum dedicated to this period. When built, the museum will house such \nitems as General George Washington's original sleeping and office tent \nand an original Revolutionary-era 13-star flag known as the Commander-\nin-Chief's Standard. By educating Americans and visitors from abroad, \nthe museum will honor the sacrifices of the Founding generation by \nkeeping the story alive.\n  I am particularly pleased that the American Revolution Center has \ndecided to build this museum in Philadelphia, PA, just steps from \nIndependence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Carpenter's Hall, and Christ \nChurch. It is fitting that a museum dedicated to telling the rich, \ndetailed story of America's founding should make its home in \nPhiladelphia, the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence and the \nU.S. Constitution. Nearly 1 million people are expected to visit the \nmuseum, which will be located among the streets and buildings where \narmies once marched and where people debated powerful ideas about \ndemocracy and equality.\n  As someone who believes that there is much to learn from history, I \nstrongly support the American Revolution Center and its effort to build \na Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements relating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 222) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 222\n\n       Whereas the American Revolution secured the independence of \n     the United States of America, and made possible a vibrant \n     system of self-government based on liberty and equality;\n       Whereas the history and ideas of the American Revolution \n     have sustained the Nation through its moments of greatest \n     peril and inspired many of the greatest achievements;\n       Whereas the American Revolution Center (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``Center'') is the steward of a nationally \n     significant collection of artifacts, manuscripts, and artwork \n     from the period of the American Revolution;\n       Whereas the Center is actively working to be a \n     ``connector'' to other American Revolution organizations and \n     sites through its website and with collaborative programming;\n       Whereas the Center has committed itself to the \n     establishment of a new ``Museum of the American Revolution'' \n     that is to be built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, just steps \n     from Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Carpenter's Hall, \n     and Christ Church;\n       Whereas the Museum of the American Revolution will be built \n     in one of our Nation's most historic neighborhoods, visited \n     by many millions of people from around the world each year;\n       Whereas the Museum of the American Revolution will tell the \n     entire story of the American Revolution, providing a context \n     for heritage tourists as they travel to other Revolutionary-\n     era sites in Philadelphia and throughout the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas the Center and the proposed Museum of the American \n     Revolution will provide future generations with both a \n     physical and a virtual venue to learn the story of the \n     American Revolution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contribution of the American Revolution \n     Center to the preservation of the story of the founding of \n     the United States; and\n       (2) expresses support for the Center's efforts to establish \n     an appropriate museum to tell such story to future \n     generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4240-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4240-S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at noon \nThursday, June 30, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nCalendar No. 197; there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of that time the Senate \nproceed to vote, without intervening action or debate, on Calendar No. \n197; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; there be no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I may not have the opportunity tomorrow to \nspeak on this nomination of David Petraeus. In the last 50 years, he is \nthe most noted soldier that we have had in the U.S. military. This man \ncould retire and go off into the business community and make millions \nand millions of dollars.\n  This man has a Ph.D. from Princeton. He is a highly decorated member \nof the Army. He is just such a fine man, and he is walking away from \nthat money because--as he told me--he thinks he owes his country more \npublic service. This is one of the finest people we have ever had as a \npublic servant in our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/29/senate-section/article/S4241-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n  Mr. REID.
