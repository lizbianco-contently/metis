Mr. President, today the Senate will consider legislation \ncalling on millionaires and billionaires to contribute to this \ncountry's effort to reduce our deficit. The poor, the middle class, \nchildren, and seniors have already been asked to make sacrifices to \nhelp get our fiscal house in order. This legislation would reaffirm the \nSenate's commitment to ensuring the extremely wealthy are asked to make \nsimilar sacrifices. This principle that all Americans should contribute \ntheir fair share as we work together to reduce the deficit is so common \nsense it should go without saying. Yet Republicans boast of their \nopposition of having the very affluent not pay their fair share. This \nis the simple, straightforward statement by my Republican colleagues. \nListen to this:\n\n       . . . any agreement to reduce the budget deficit should \n     require that those earning $1,000,000 or more per year make a \n     more meaningful contribution to the deficit reduction effort.\n\n  My Republican colleagues reject that. Democrats believe all \nAmericans, even those who can afford private jets and yachts, should \ncontribute to the collective effort to reduce the deficit. The question \nis, Why aren't Republicans willing to do the same? They say it is \nbecause they are looking out for the people. That claim is ridiculous. \nThis claim is without foundation, which is preposterous. Let's talk \nabout the millionaires and billionaires Republicans are determined to \nprotect above all else. Less than one-quarter of 1 percent of tax \nreturns filed in the United States each year belong to the people \nmaking more than $1 million--25 percent of 1 percent, one-quarter \npercent of 1 percent. These same people are the 1 percent of Americans \nwho control 50 percent of this country's wealth. We are speaking of the \nWarren Buffetts of the world. Warren Buffett is my friend. I have great \nrespect and admiration for him, but he is extremely wealthy. What does \nWarren Buffett, who is the second or third richest man in the world, \nsay about contributing his fair share? He welcomes it. In fact, Mr. \nBuffett criticized the system in which his secretary gives a greater \nshare of her income to the government each year than a man worth more \nthan $50 billion. Here he says: ``If you're the luckiest 1 percent of \nhumanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other \n99 percent.''\n  That is what he said. That is what Warren Buffett said about \ncontributing his fair share.\n  Since the late 1970s, incomes for the lucky 1 percent of America have \nrisen by 281 percent. The last three decades have been very good to the \nvery wealthy. President George W. Bush called these people the haves \nand have-mores. He also called them his base. Right now, the Republican \nParty is\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nputting what is good for this very small base ahead of what is very \ngood for this great Nation.\n  The legislation before us asks only this: that each American be part \nof the solution rather than part of the problem. In poll after poll, \nAmericans have endorsed this principle. They have said they believe we \nmust address our deficit both by reducing spending and by ending tax \nbreaks to the wealthiest citizens and corporations. We have heard them. \nDemocrats have heard them. If Warren Buffett chooses to buy a private \njet or a whole fleet of them, that is OK, but the American taxpayer \nshould not give him a special tax break for buying his own jet \nairplane.\n  Our country is facing a crisis. We face mounting debt brought on by a \ndecade of war and tax breaks for the wealthy. We face the prospect that \nRepublicans will force us to default on our financial obligations for \nthe first time in our Nation's history. Difficult choices must be made. \nTogether, we should consider cutting programs to help real people in \nvery real ways. Eliminating tax breaks for oil companies making record \nprofits, corporations that ship jobs overseas, and the owners of \nprivate jets and yachts should be an easy part of this problem to \nsolve. Yet Republicans walked away from the negotiating table when a \nsolution was in sight because they said no to fairness. Democrats had \nalready agreed to trillions in difficult cuts in order to prevent a \ndefault crisis and avert a worldwide depression. Then Republicans \nwalked away from the table to help the 1 percent of Americans fortunate \nenough to not need any extra help.\n  How do Republicans explain that to their constituents back home? Very \ncarefully. Why? Because as middle-class families struggle to make ends \nmeet, my Republican colleagues are risking the financial future of this \ncountry and the world for the sake of people who can afford private \njets and yachts. I cannot imagine that conversation. Asking \nmillionaires and billionaires to contribute to solving this Nation's \ndeficit crisis is not unreasonable. It is just plain common sense and \nsimple fairness.\n  We are going to have a vote in just 20 minutes or so, and probably \nwhat my Republican colleagues will do is to vote to allow us to \nproceed. That would be great if there was some sense that they agreed \nwith what we are trying to do; that is, that they want the millionaires \nand billionaires to contribute their fair share. But as we know, the \nrules will only allow us to move to the next step and actually be on \nthe bill. So when we get on the bill, I would tell everyone here, if we \ncan work on an agreement to have some fixed amendments and work on it, \nI would be happy to do that. It is how we used to do things around \nhere.\n  But if this means a free-for-all and offering amendments on abortion \nand war fighting and all this kind of stuff, we can't do that. We need \nto devote these next few weeks to debate dealing with the deficit \nproblems we have in this country, and they are significant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4404-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this morning, we will have a vote \nwhether to proceed to a nonbinding resolution on whether to raise taxes \nat a time when 14 million Americans are out of work. I oppose the \nresolution, but I will vote to move to it so we can finally have a real \ndebate about the economic crisis we face. That is what we were supposed \nto be doing this week, and that is what we will do. This is an \nimportant debate to have as discussions continue over at the White \nHouse this morning in connection with the President's request to raise \nthe debt ceiling.\n  Americans want to know where their elected representatives stand on \nthese issues. Today we will have an opportunity to show them where we \nstand on entitlement reform, where we stand on government spending, \nwhere we stand on balancing the budget, where we stand on our \nunsustainable deficits and debt.\n  For too long, Democrats have tried to evade these questions. It has \nbeen 799 days since Democrats passed a budget. They have presented no \nplan to reduce our debt. So today is an opportunity to offer real ideas \nfor addressing our debt and job crisis, to make our positions clear, \nand, for our part, Republicans intend to offer more than a vague, \nnonbinding resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4404-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1323, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1323) to express the \n     sense of the Senate on shared sacrifice in resolving the \n     budget deficit.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending is S. 1323, which is the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. For those who follow the Senate, this is not a \nlaw. It will not be a law, if passed. It is merely an expression of \nsentiment by the Senate on an issue. It can be summarized very quickly \nwith the sense-of-the-Senate clause, which reads:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any agreement to reduce \n     the budget deficit should require that those earning \n     $1,000,000 or more per year make a more meaningful \n     contribution to the deficit reduction effort.\n\n  Why are we even talking about this? Wouldn't everyone in America \nconcede that everyone needs to make a sacrifice if we are going to make \nthis country stronger? Those who can make a greater sacrifice, those \nwho are well-off, with an income of $1 million or more each year, \nshould do a little more. Why is that such a bold and controversial \nsuggestion? Because, in fact, when we look at the actions taken by \nCongress over the last 10 years, we have found a political sentiment, \nprimarily from the other side of the aisle--not exclusively, \nprimarily--which says we cannot ask sacrifice of the wealthiest people \nin America.\n  I can tell those who are students of American history know when we \nhave had a challenge in this Nation, particularly during wars when our \nvery existence was being challenged, people stepped up from every \nincome level in America and said: I am willing to fight for this \ncountry. I am willing to die for this country. I am willing to \nsacrifice for this country. So why would this be a matter to be debated \non the floor of the Senate? Because, in fact, the policies of this \ncountry over the last 10 years have said that the wealthiest among us \nshould be spared, time and again, from sacrifice when it comes to the \nfuture of our Nation.\n  That is just plain wrong. Those who are fortunate enough to be well-\noff, to have a strong income, to enjoy the blessings of liberty, to \nlive in what I feel is the greatest Nation on Earth should be prepared \nto give back something.\n  I have spoken to some in our walk of life here in the Senate. We \nspend time with those who are well-off who finance our campaigns. That \nis a reality I am not happy with, but a reality. So many of them have \nsaid, for goodness sake, Senator, why do you even hesitate to ask me \nfor more taxes? I am prepared to pay those taxes because I feel blessed \nto live in this country.\n\n  So the idea of raising taxes on the wealthiest among us won't change \ntheir lifestyle a bit but will help to solve some of our problems. If \nwe don't change the tax cuts that were put in under President George W. \nBush, people making $1 million-plus a year will get a $200,000 tax \nbreak--a $200,000 tax break--every year. In order to pay for\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nthat tax break, some other Americans have to sacrifice. For example, it \nmeans about 33 seniors will have to pay $600 more a year for Medicare \nunder one proposal in the House Republican budget so that we will \ngenerate enough money to give a tax break to a person who is a \nmillionaire. Thirty-three seniors will pay $600 more a year so a \nmillionaire can get a tax break. That is wrong. It is just plain wrong.\n  I believe we need to ask for shared sacrifice, and that is what this \nresolution says. Senator McConnell, who was here a few moments ago, \nsaid this week:\n\n       It's about making Washington make tough choices. It's about \n     Washington taking the hit this time.\n\n  Well, the people who are taking the hit in America are not in \nWashington, they are all across this country. It is low and middle-\nincome Americans who are taking a hit in the current economy. There are \nstill almost 14 million Americans out of work and those who are working \nhave seen the bulk of income growth go to the highest income \ncategories. We have the greatest income disparity in the history of the \nUnited States since the Great Depression. Over the past 10 years, the \nmedian family income has declined by more than $2,500. What that means, \nwhether it is New Mexico or Illinois, is that people who are working \nhard, going to work every single day, making sacrifices, fall further \nand further behind and live paycheck to paycheck. That is the reality \nof life for hard-working, middle-income Americans.\n  So those of us who come to the floor and say spare them--if you are \ngoing to spare anyone from further taxation, give them a helping hand--\nunderstand the reality of it so they can keep their heads above water, \nbarely. So many Americans live paycheck to paycheck. It is the only way \nthey survive, and that is the reality.\n  My colleague from Kentucky is right. In Washington we need to make \nthe tough choices and we need to face them with a sense of consensus \nand compromise. An all-or-nothing approach to the budget isn't going to \nwork. In about an hour and 15 minutes, I am going to be honored to \nrepresent, with Senator Reid, our majority leader, the Senate Democrats \nin a meeting with President Obama. We will sit down in the Cabinet \nRoom, as I have before, and we will talk about what we are going to do \nwith this deficit crisis. I will say to the President and those \nassembled that we have plenty to work with. It was 6 or 7 months ago \nwhen the Bowles-Simpson commission, the President's commission on the \ndeficit, gave us a blueprint and said: Here is a way to reach $4.5 \ntrillion of deficit reduction in a fair way: Put everything on the \ntable. Democrats, suck it up. Put entitlements on the table. Make sure \nthat at the end of the day, these are still programs that serve the \npublic, Social Security is still there making its promised payments. \nMake sure Medicare covers the health care of elderly Americans. Do it \nin a fiscally responsible way, but don't run away from it. Don't ignore \nthe problems we face.\n  Similarly, the Bowles-Simpson commission said to those on the other \nside of the aisle: Be honest about revenue. We are facing the lowest \nFederal revenue against our gross domestic product we have seen in 60 \nyears. Is it any wonder we are in deficit? Fifteen percent of our gross \ndomestic product comes to the Federal Government revenue share and we \nspend 25 percent. So the 10-percent difference is our deficit. It is \ntime to bring the spending down and the revenue up.\n  Critics will say we can't raise taxes in the midst of a recession. \nWell, we need to be careful, I agree. Raising taxes in the wrong places \ncould hurt our recovery. Here are some places where it won't hurt, as \nthis resolution says, at the highest income categories. These Americans \ncan afford to pay a little more. They certainly don't need a tax break.\n  Secondly, take a look at the Tax Code. We have up to $1.2 trillion a \nyear in tax spending, tax earmarks, credits and deductions that the \nspecial interest lobbyists put in the Tax Code. Many of them are \nabsolutely indefensible, and we can't afford them anymore. If we are \nasking sacrifice across the board from America, we should ask sacrifice \nfrom those who are benefiting from these tax loopholes and tax \nbenefits. We can do that. In fact, we may be able to do it if we follow \nBowles-Simpson and at the same time reduce the marginal tax rates for \nall Americans. It can be done.\n  Let's take a hard look at the Tax Code and remember that 70 percent \nof Americans do not itemize, which means they do not take advantage of \nthe Tax Code, except in a rare situation where they have a refundable \ntax credit. These people are not using the Tax Code. Those who use it \nare in higher income categories. They are using it, they are following \nthe law, and they are avoiding their taxes.\n  Warren Buffett had a great quote which we should remember while we \ndebate this. November 26, 2006:\n\n       There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the \n     rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\n\n  Warren Buffett is a man of few words and is listened to carefully \nbecause of his wisdom in business and in life, and he hits the nail on \nthe head. He said to me and to many others--and publicly--it is \nunconscionable that using our Tax Code today, he, Warren Buffett, pays \na lower marginal tax rate than the secretaries in his office. That is \nabsolutely wrong. Why should a hard-working person in a business, at a \nlower level, pay a higher marginal tax rate than the person owning the \nbusiness, making millions of dollars each year? That is where the Tax \nCode is wrong, and that is where we can change it, save money, use it \nto reduce the deficit and reduce marginal income tax rates.\n  That is what this resolution is all about. It is nothing short of \namazing we are debating the question of whether those who make $1 \nmillion or more each year should pony up and contribute more when it \ncomes to deficit reduction.\n  The newspapers this morning talk about what may be included in any \nfinal agreement. I don't know what will be included. I hope there is an \nagreement. There is one thing I wish to make clear. I just left a \nmeeting with people who do forecasting--Standard & Poor's, Moody's, \nFitch, and the like. They talked about what is going to happen if we do \nnot extend the debt ceiling. Let me lay my cards on the table. The debt \nceiling vote every year is a political football. Those who are not in \nthe President's party don't want to vote for it. Why should they, and \ngo home and get slapped around for having voted to extend America's \ndebt. In years gone by, there have been times I didn't vote for it but, \nin all honesty, I knew in the back of my mind it was going to pass.\n  Here is the reality: If we reach a stalemate on the debt ceiling now \nbecause the President's party doesn't control the Congress--certainly \nnot the House and barely in the Senate--if we don't extend the debt \nceiling, what is going to happen is very obvious. The full faith and \ncredit of the United States is going to be called into question, and \nthat has never happened. We have never in our history failed to extend \nthe debt ceiling and to say we stand behind our debts and will make \ngood on payments. If there is any question about that, we know what \nhappens. It is the same thing that happens when a person defaults on \ntheir home mortgage. It becomes increasingly difficult to ever get \nanother mortgage and if that person does, he or she faces higher \ninterest rates than ever. That is what America will face if we don't \nextend the debt ceiling. So these people from these rating agencies \ncame to us and said it will be disastrous if you allow the debt ceiling \nnot to be extended on August 2. That is the reality of the world we \nlive in.\n  So I would say, as we go into these important and difficult \nnegotiations, as we move toward the moment when we are going to have, I \nhope, an agreement, let's make it very clear to the world that the \nUnited States understands its obligations, will pay its debts, and that \nwe won't face the dire consequences of the opposite being true. That is \nthe reality of what we face today.\n\n  I will say one last thing before I yield the floor.\n  As we structure this deficit rescue or deficit project, let's \nremember two things are essential. There are vulnerable people in the \nUnited States of America who, through no fault of their own, struggle \neach day to live. Some of them suffer from physical and mental \ndisabilities. Some of them have been poor their entire lives and come \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\npoor families and have a difficult time and limited education. Some of \nthem are elderly and in nursing homes. These people--the most \nvulnerable among us--need a helping hand. We have never failed to do \nthat in modern times and we shouldn't in this time of trouble, time of \ndeficit. We can keep our word to the poor among us that we are going to \nstand by them because we are caring people. We can do it by making \ncertain the Medicaid Program, which provides health insurance for one-\nthird of the children in America and which covers the medical costs of \nbirth of more than 40 percent of children in America and literally \nprovides for millions of seniors to be able to stay in nursing homes \nand in senior settings, these are the things we need to take care of in \nthe midst of this deficit reduction.\n  I see my colleague from Tennessee on the Republican side has come to \nthe floor, and there is time available on his side. I didn't know if \nanyone was coming. I am wrapping up, so I thank my colleague from \nTennessee.\n  I will wrap up by saying we can take care to make sure the safety net \nis protected, and to make sure as well that we address all levels of \nspending in our government--every one of them--to make certain that \nwhether it is the defense budget or the budget for programs not related \nto defense or whether it is entitlement programs, all of these need to \nbe carefully scrutinized. We can cut spending in a responsible, \nbipartisan way and show we can bring our deficit down, strengthen this \neconomy and, I think in the process, if we do it on a bipartisan basis, \nwe are going to launch an economic recovery that inures to the benefit \nof all of us. If we don't and this ends up in finger pointing, I don't \nknow who will take the fall for it. No one does. But the best thing we \ncan do is to ignore the political aspect and deal with the reality of \nthe challenge we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nIllinois said and I congratulate him not necessarily for the specifics \nof what he said but for his general demeanor and attitude throughout \nthis entire discussion about the deficit and the debt. He has been one \nof those Senators--there have been some on both sides of the aisle--who \nhave made some difficult choices and some difficult decisions and \nrecognizes that at a time when Washington is borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend, we have a serious problem and we have to look at \nour entire fiscal condition in order to solve the problem. The people \nof this country expect us to do that. So Senator Durbin has, by his \nwillingness to make some hard decisions, set a pretty good example for \nall of us in the Senate.\n  Today, my hope is the meeting the President has with our \ncongressional leaders of both sides succeeds, because if they succeed, \nour country succeeds. The country expects us to do that. I hope they \nthink big. I hope they swing for the fences and get a result and bring \nit back to us and let us consider it and hopefully enact it and get on \nto other business. The debt is a major long-term problem, not just for \nour grandchildren but for us today. We have a bigger issue facing us \nwhich is the fact that we have had persistent unemployment in an \neconomy that is not growing, and that is hurting too many people. So \nthe sooner we swing for the fences and get a result and get our debt \nunder control and deal with it in a bipartisan way, the better for the \ncountry and the quicker we will be able to get on to the larger \nquestion of jobs.\n  Of course, economists have made clear to us getting the debt under \ncontrol has a lot to do with jobs. When our total debt is as high as it \nis today--nearly 100 percent of our gross domestic product--that \nprobably costs us 1 million jobs a year. We can't solve all of that in \n1 day or 1 month, but we can take a big step in the right direction, \nand that is what our countrymen and women want us to do.\n  I am glad I was able to be here to hear part of the Senator's speech \nand I am glad I have a chance to commend him for his leadership on this \nvexing and important problem we need to deal with.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if it meets with the approval of the \nSenator from Tennessee in leadership on the Republican side, I suggest \nwe yield back all time, and I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the \nvote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Texas, I am just wondering if a view \nthat she might have might be that we have been terribly overworked this \nweek. I understand we cancelled our Fourth of July recess in order to \nget back here and get to work and do the people's business.\n  Is it correct that was the second vote that we have taken? One was an \ninstruction of the Sergeant at Arms, and this one, another highly \ncontroversial issue that was taken up.\n  I guess my question to the Senator from Texas is, Has this week been \na worthwhile expenditure of the taxpayers' dollars?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, I will respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona that the resolution that was just passed was to go to a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, which, of course, has no force of law. \nIt is, indeed, our second vote this week.\n  I will say that there is one thing on the minds of the people today, \none thing on the minds of the people of America today, and it is, What \non Earth is Congress doing? What on Earth is the President doing? What \nare they doing to address the looming debt crisis? And we were called \nback in not to recess but so that we could do something meaningful.\n  When I saw the Senator from Arizona on the Senate floor, he was ready \nto talk about our international situation and the commitments that we \nare making certainly. Many people said: No, wait a minute. We have a \ndebt crisis, and we can't wait until August 2 to fulfill it.\n  So I would just respond to the Senator from Arizona and say, when do \nthe American people get the answer they deserve, which is that Congress \nand the President are working together, and we are being productive, \nand we have a budget resolution on the floor, and we are debating it \nand we are talking about our differences on taxes and spending? I don't \nthink we can tax our way out of a recession. I don't think we can tax \nour way out of the budget deficit.\n  I would just ask the Senator from Arizona if he thinks that we can \nmake meaningful progress staying in session and debating, and if, in \nfact, that might be an option in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I see the distinguished majority leader waiting, so I \nwill make my comments brief. I know that his agenda is very busy.\n  I would just say to my friend from Texas that I understand a lot of \nthe inner mechanisms and hidden workings are going on behind the \nscenes. But when I go back and tell my constituents that we cancelled a \nweek of recess and we had two votes--one to instruct the Sergeant at \nArms and the other on a sense-of-the Senate resolution--I would have \nliked to have taken up other business that was rejected by Members on \nthis side because they wanted to focus on the deficit. But if we are \nfocusing on that, maybe we should have taken up some issues that \ndirectly affect the deficit, such as ethanol subsidies, such as some of \nthe other tax breaks and loopholes and other issues that surround the \nwhole bankruptcy of this country.\n  I see the majority leader is waiting, so I will yield to my friend \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would just ask unanimous consent that following the \nmajority leader I regain the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Texas will have the floor. I just have a \nbrief comment.\n  I have known my friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, since 1982 \nwhen we were both elected to Congress. His record of public service \nspeaks for itself. But I would say to him, and to everyone within the \nsound of my voice, we didn't vote on Libya, this important resolution \nthat had been worked on so hard by the distinguished Senator from \nArizona and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, because I \nwas told we wouldn't get any votes from the Republicans because they \nwanted to focus on the deficit.\n  My friend also recognizes, as he said, that there is work going on \nbehind the scenes, and that is true. There has been a lot of work this \nweek that took place as a result of our being here that would not have \ntaken place but for the fact that we are in session.\n  We know a lot of the work we accomplish here is not with votes. One \nreason we have not been having a lot of votes in recent months is \nbecause we can't get things on the Senate floor. We have been stopped \nby my Republican friends. There are meetings going on with the White \nHouse and with the Speaker, a multitude of meetings there, meetings \ngoing on between Members of the Senate and Democrats and Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives. So I would say to everyone here it is \ngood we were in session this week. I haven't heard a single person who \nis not in Congress complain about our being here. It is important we \nare here. As a result of that, we have been able to move down the road \nmuch further on the problems we have with the debt than we would have \nhad we not been in session because there are all kinds of meetings \ngoing on around town dealing with how we do this.\n  We had a meeting right behind us today that started at 9 where we had \nthe head of the Chamber of Commerce in. We had people from Moody's \nFinancial Services. They were here to tell us what they are doing to \nfocus on Republicans being able to help us get through this problem \ndealing with the debt.\n  We have to do something about the staggering debt that faces us, and \nwhat this resolution we voted on earlier today is all about is making \nsure there is equal sacrifice in our country; that is, we know we are \ngoing to have to make some cuts. We also recognize that we need to do \nsomething about equalizing revenue, and that is what is going on.\n  While what we do in the Senate every week isn't like solving a math \nproblem--there is no perfection--that is the way the Founding Fathers \nset up this great government of ours. So we are going to continue to \nwork in the next 4 weeks of this work period to solve some of the \nNation's problems.\n  No. 1 on the list is doing something about our staggering debt.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the majority leader \nhas said.\n  There is a lot going on, and there is the beginning, perhaps, of \ncoming together, hopefully, with the President and the leadership of \nthe House and the Senate. I just hope that we can establish why it is \nthat there is such a divide on how we accomplish the issue of raising \nthe debt ceiling with real reforms that will assure that we will not \nhave to raise the debt ceiling again; that we will cut deficits so the \ndebt will also be cut in this country. We cannot sustain the level of \ndebt we have now. It is the highest we have ever had in the history of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, let's face it. We have two basic problems. We have \nthis looming $14 trillion debt that is about to hit the ceiling, and we \nhave to raise the ceiling. It would be irresponsible to do that without \nsignificant reforms that will assure that we are not going to hit it \nagain. But the second problem we have is 9.1 percent unemployment.\n  So it is not like we are in a vacuum and we can just start taxing our \nsmall businesses, when small business has already had the looming hit \nof the health care plan that was passed that is going to cause every \nbusiness in this country significant increases in their cost of doing \nbusiness.\n  So when people are out there saying: Why is unemployment still so \nhigh? Why is hiring lagging? I think it is because businesses are \ntrying to prepare for this big hit they are going to get in 2014 when \nthe Obama health care plan takes full effect. They are trying to figure \nout if they are going to pay more for insurance or if they are going to \ntake the fine and pay fines for every\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nemployee who doesn't have insurance, which is going to cause chaos in \nthis country. So they are trying to decide.\n  On top of that, people on the other side of the aisle in Washington, \nDC, keep talking about increasing taxes, and the President keeps \ntalking about increasing taxes. So no wonder our employers are not \nsaying: Oh, yes, let's just open the floodgates and bring people back \nto work. They don't know what to expect.\n  We must generate economic growth, not stifle it. We need businesses \nto feel confident in the future that they are going to be able to make \na profit on top of all the added costs of new taxes and health care \nreform that is going to hit businesses the hardest.\n  So we don't have a tax problem in this country. We are not being \ntaxed too little. This government is spending too much. That is the \nproblem we are facing right now. That is why we have a $14 trillion \ndebt. We have a $1.6 trillion shortfall between spending and revenue \nthis year.\n  So I am reminded of what Ronald Reagan once said: We don't have a $1 \ntrillion debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a $1 trillion \ndebt because we spend too much.\n  Let's look at the spending side of the equation. We cannot continue \nbusiness as usual in Washington and fix this problem. When President \nObama was sworn into office, the national debt was $10.6 trillion. It \nwas too much then. I think we all agree. Now it is $14.3 trillion. We \nare weeks away from officially hitting that $14.3 trillion debt \nceiling.\n  We have had a monumental addition to the unprecedented number of \nspending dollars that was the stimulus that passed in February of 2009. \nToday, the President's Council of Economic Advisers said that 2.4 \nmillion jobs were created at a cost of $666 billion. That is about \nthree-quarters of the stimulus. That is a cost to taxpayers of $278,000 \nper job. That is just not reasonable. This is the kind of spending we \ncannot continue in this country.\n  I think they say they want to increase taxes, and I hear the \nPresident say we must increase taxes on the oil companies, increase \ntaxes on corporate jets. I think if we are fair and across-the-board \nand we tax oil companies like we tax every business--sure. Let's even \nthe playing field. If we are going to take away the business deductions \nevery business gets in this country, then, sure, let's take them from \nevery business, including oil. But it is not going to help the deficit \nbecause it is not enough to help the deficit.\n  They say they want to increase taxes in order to reduce the deficit, \nbut what they really want is to increase taxes to permanently increase \nspending so the big government we have seen grow in the last 2 years, \n2\\1/2\\ years will be permanent. That is why they want to increase \ntaxes.\n  I say there is a way to fix this. First of all, we could pass a \nbalanced budget amendment. A balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution would put us on a budget that we would have to meet like \nmost States in this Nation and every business and every family. We \nwould set the limits. I believe the appropriate limit would be that \ntotal Federal expenditures would be limited to 18 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. Then Congress would also have to have caps on \nspending--about the same, 18 percent of gross domestic product. This \nwould be a spending reform we could adopt that I believe the States \nwould also agree to ratify that would give us a trajectory that would \neliminate this deficit and the debt in this country, and we would be on \na fiscally responsible path.\n  Second, if we are going to do this, we have to look at entitlements. \nThat is the reality. We have a nearly bankrupt entitlement system that \nis ongoing regardless of what the revenue coming in is. The debt limit \nand the ongoing deficit reduction negotiations need to put entitlement \nreform on the table. Until yesterday they had refused to do it, but now \nit seems that perhaps some entitlement reform might be on the table. \nFor instance, one that I have introduced a bill to correct is the \nSocial Security system. Social Security will account for one-fifth of \nall Federal spending this year. The time for reform is now, and we can \ndo it in a reasonable way.\n  The amount of Social Security benefits being paid out exceeds the \nrevenue the Social Security payroll is collecting, and we are starting \nto draw down on the Social Security reserves. When the reserves run out \nin 2036, Social Security will only be able to pay out 77 percent of the \nbenefits to current and future retirees. That is the law today. It \nwould force a 23-percent cut in benefits. That is the law today.\n  The Social Security Board of Trustees reported earlier this year that \none way to shore up Social Security's assets is to immediately and \npermanently increase the combined payroll tax on employees and \nemployers from 12.4 to 14.5 percent--in other words, increase payroll \ntaxes by one-sixth during our jobless economic nonrecovery. I do not \nthink that is really feasible.\n  The trustees also noted that the shortfall could be eliminated by an \nimmediate 13.8 percent cut in core benefits retirees are getting right \nnow--an immediate $150-per-month cut in every Social Security benefit \ncheck right now. That was what the Social Security trustees suggested \nwas a possibility. That is something I think we would unanimously, in \nthis Senate, reject. No one is going to cut benefits $150 per month \nright now--nobody. Nobody would do it.\n  If we are going to address this, I have proposed a plan. Senator Kyl \nand I introduced S. 1213, the Defend and Save Social Security Act. \nFirst, everyone knows we are living longer than when the Social \nSecurity Act passed. We have a higher quality of life. People want to \nwork longer in most areas. So why not gradually raise the retirement \nage without impacting those who are about to retire?\n  Under my bill, anyone who is 58 years of age or older will see no \nchange by the gradual increase of the retirement age. For everyone \nelse, starting in 2016 the normal and early retirement age would \nincrease by 3 months a year, so the normal retirement age would reach \n67 by 2019, 68 by 2023, and 69 at 2027, and it stops there. Early \nretirement would be gradual--3 months a year, increased to 63 by 2019 \nand 64 by 2023, and it would stop.\n  Currently, Social Security recipients receive an annual cost-of-\nliving adjustment, a COLA. Under my plan, the COLA would be computed as \nit is in current law but reduced 1 percent. So the average rate of \ninflation and COLA has been 2.2 percent every year of an increase. So \nif we have a 2.2-percent rate of inflation COLA, it would be a 1.2-\npercent increase in Social Security benefits. What I am saying is that \na 1-percent decrease in the COLA is just a 1-percent decrease in the \nincrease.\n  You would have the gradual raising of the age that would be much more \nin line with our actuarial table and the reality today, where people \nare living much longer, and you would also have a slight decrease in \nthe increase in Social Security benefits according to inflation. If we \nhave rampant inflation, then you would have the COLA, just 1 percent \nless. So if it is 2.2 percent inflation, then you would get a 1.2-\npercent COLA. Doing that saves the Social Security system, and it \ncloses the 75-year gap. It does not raise taxes on anyone, and it does \nnot cut a core benefit for anyone. That is the way we could fix Social \nSecurity right now.\n  What would that do for our deficit? Here is what it would do. It \nwould achieve a $416 billion reduction over the next 10 years of our \ndeficit and a $7.2 trillion savings by 2085. That means we are on the \ntrack. That means that over the next 75 years Social Security will be \nsolid and secure without a tax increase on anyone and without a cut in \ncore benefits to anyone, and no one who is 58 years of age or older \nwill be affected by the adjustment in the retirement age.\n  We have a chance to do some things. I have gone out and said: Here is \na proposal. My colleague, Senator Corker, has proposed a limit, a cap \non spending that is a reasonable limit. Other colleagues--Senator Lee, \nSenator Paul, and Senator Toomey have suggested other ways to cut \nspending across the board, just a level goal. They are not cutting \nspecific things, but they are cutting the discretionary spending at \nreasonable levels. Many Republicans are offering ways to cut back on \nspending. My colleague, Senator Cornyn from Texas, has put forward a \ncap on spending and a balanced budget amendment. There are proposals \nout there that are responsible ways to deal with this deficit that \ninclude entitlements and discretionary spending both.\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\n  It is time for the President of the United States to sit down at the \ntable and understand that tax increases for kind of a photo-op PR are \nnot going to fill the void. The public relations of cutting back on \ncorporate jet benefits, whatever they are--I don't know what they are; \nI don't have one--but I think we would probably all agree, if you can \nafford a corporate jet or a private jet, fine. Whatever the President \nwants to do, we will do it, and it will do nothing to help the deficit. \nSo why don't we do the meaningful things, which is make meaningful cuts \nin discretionary spending. Let's attack what everybody knows is the \ncase; that is, Social Security is going bankrupt as we speak. If \nCongress and the President will speak responsibly about it, we can put \nthat on a glidepath that is within the reasonable actuarial table \nestimate so that people will work longer, and very gradually increase \nit--starting in 2016, ending in 2027 at 69. That is gradual.\n  We cannot procrastinate. We cannot wait. We cannot hope the crisis \nwill pass. And we cannot delay the inevitable. This is the Senate. We \nwere elected to make the tough choices. It is time for us to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                         Trade with South Korea\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Senate's \nupcoming trade agenda and its impact on Pennsylvania workers and \nPennsylvania jobs.\n  Like so many of our States, Pennsylvania has always played a \ncritically important role in America's manufacturing and commercial \nheritage. The coal and waterways of our State helped make the \nCommonwealth legendary for steelmaking and helped turn the United \nStates into an industrial powerhouse. During its heyday, 60 percent of \nthe domestic steel production in the United States came from \nPennsylvania.\n  During World War II, almost one-third of the Nation's steel came from \nPennsylvania, which was a full 20 percent of global production at the \ntime. The then-Governor of Pennsylvania, Arthur James, put it this way: \n``Pennsylvania was truly the arsenal of democracy and the arsenal of \nAmerica.''\n  Given its dominance in the steel industry, it is no surprise that the \nCommonwealth was sixth in the Nation in total war production during the \nSecond World War, leading in shipbuilding and munitions production. \nMore money was spent to expand production capacity in Pennsylvania than \nin any other State during the war.\n  We know at the time it did not stop there. It did not stop at the end \nof the war. After the war was over, these manufacturing facilities were \nused to make American products and fuel the growth of a thriving middle \nclass.\n  Today, so many of these plants have gone away, due in part to our \nfailed trade policies. Over the last 30 years, we have seen trade \ndeficits soar, currency manipulation go unchecked, lavish subsidies by \nforeign governments go ignored, and exploitation of workers in other \ncountries overlooked. That is why I am very concerned that today the \nFinance Committee is moving forward the pending agreements with South \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama. For the last several weeks, the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Brown, and I have persistently asked the tough, \ncritical questions about the impact of these agreements before they are \nconsidered. A review of the impact of past trade agreements offers very \nlittle comfort. In 1994, Congress passed the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. We know it as NAFTA. Since NAFTA's passage, U.S. Trade \npolicies have steadily chipped away at Pennsylvania's manufacturing \nbase.\n\n  It is a critical sector for our State and so many others. According \nto a recent study--and the chart on my left depicts it--from the \nIndustrial Resource Centers, from 1997 to 2010, just 13 years, \nmanufacturing went from 16.4 percent of our gross State product to 12.1 \npercent, a remarkable drop in just 13 years. What does that mean for \nthe total number of jobs? In total, Pennsylvania lost nearly 300,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. You can see it from the chart, starting in 1997, \nthe drop to 12.1 percent in just those 13 years--300,000 jobs in 13 \nyears.\n  Despite these alarming numbers and statistics, advocates for the \ntrade deals, including the pending agreement with South Korea, promised \nsignificant economic benefits from exploding export potential to job \ncreation. Proponents argue a significant net positive from these \nagreements every time they are considered. In reality, instead of \ncreating opportunities for Pennsylvania, our trade policies did little \nmore than offshore good-paying jobs, while giving our trading partners \nunlimited access to our markets.\n  So we must take the time now to ask the tough questions. \nSpecifically, as a Senator from Pennsylvania, I must ask three basic \nquestions about any trade deal. No. 1, will the agreement protect \ncurrent Pennsylvania jobs and create new jobs in Pennsylvania and \nacross America? No. 2, will the agreement help create a level playing \nfield for American businesses and workers? No. 3, does the agreement \nprovide new opportunities for American manufacturers to export?\n  I will focus on the South Korean Free Trade Agreement in the context \nof each question. First, will the agreement protect and create jobs in \nPennsylvania and across the Nation? In these uncertain times, job \ncreation must be our top priority. In Pennsylvania, the manufacturing \nsector is critical. Manufacturing remains the Commonwealth's largest \nsource of good-paying jobs, with chemical primary metal products, \nfabricated metal products, food products, and machinery making up the \ntop five manufacturing sectors supporting Pennsylvania families. These \nbenefits extend beyond individual manufacturing businesses in our \nState--in fact, the economic benefits of a strong manufacturing sector \nexperienced throughout Pennsylvania's economy. According to research \ncommissioned by the Pennsylvania Industrial Resource Centers, every $1 \nincrease in demand for products manufactured in our State leads to an \nincrease in growth value of $2.52 across all industries. So one buck in \nactivity can lead to $2.52 in value.\n  The manufacturing jobs that are created support middle-income \nfamilies, and the creation of those jobs and the support they provided \nfor those families in 2008 meant the following: The average annual \ncompensation of a worker in the manufacturing sector was over $65,000. \nThe average pay for the rest of the workforce was $10,000 less. Each \ngood-paying job in this country allows for more money to flow back into \nthe economy. Given the importance of manufacturing jobs in \nPennsylvania, we must ask ourselves: Will the Korea trade agreement \ncreate jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector? I believe it will \nnot create a substantial number of new jobs in this critical sector.\n  Looking back over the last 20 years, trade-related job expansion has \nbeen an unfulfilled promise for Pennsylvania and the Nation. We need to \nlook no further than NAFTA. In 1993, when the agreement was signed, \nNAFTA promised to deliver hundreds of thousands of jobs across the \nUnited States. Leading economists at the time projected NAFTA would \nbring 170,000 new jobs in the near term alone. These gains were not \nrealized. Instead, since NAFTA was signed into law through 2002, \n525,094 workers were certified as displaced under NAFTA, according to \nthe Department of Labor. I am sure that number has grown since that \n2002 data point. Furthermore, when NAFTA was negotiated, leaders \nsuggested that American exports would expand greatly to meet the new-\nfound demands of the open Mexican market with all its new customers. \nThe opposite has occurred.\n  In 1993, the United States had a small trade surplus. We had a \nsurplus with Mexico. According to the official Census Bureau \nstatistics, by 2010, 17 years later, we were running a trade deficit \nwith Mexico of $66.4 billion. So a surplus in trade with Mexico became \na huge deficit. Trade with Canada also saw a widening trade deficit \nfrom $10 billion in 1993 to $28 billion in 2010. So there a deficit got \nbigger; whereas, in the case of Mexico, it went from a surplus to a \nmassive deficit of $66 billion. The impact of these policies is plainly \nseen in employment data. Pennsylvania has seen a dramatic decline in \nmanufacturing employment since NAFTA was implemented, losing a total of \nover 300,000 jobs. With this rosy prediction of NAFTA in mind, a close\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nlook at the government's projections of the South Korea agreement \nshould be viewed with great skepticism. While the International Trade \nCommission predicts our bilateral trade with Korea will improve, the \ntotal U.S. trade deficit is predicted to get larger. While proponents \nof the agreement argue U.S. exports to Korea will increase, they are \nneglecting to tell the whole truth. Companies will simply shift from \nexporting to Korea, to creating current customers in other places, \nrather than increasing total exports.\n  The second question I ask is, Will this agreement help create a level \nplaying field after enactment? I believe this agreement, South Korea \nagreement, will fail to create a level playing field for our workers \nand our companies. Modern trade agreements do more than cut tariffs. \nThese agreements contain hundreds of provisions that make substantial \nchanges to nontrade policies, and the Korea agreement is no exception. \nAccording to the group Public Citizen, these nontrade provisions limit \nthe authority granted to elected representatives of the American people \nover product and food safety, financial regulations, health care and \nenergy regulations, patent terms, and even our tax dollars that can be \nspent by the government. The agreement allows Korean exporters to take \ninvestment disputes out of courts and into unaccountable and secretive \ninternational tribunals through a process known as investor-to-state \ndispute system that is similar to NAFTA.\n  Additionally, the investment chapters were signed prior to the \ncurrent financial crisis back in 2007. These specific chapters include \nrules that prohibit either country from imposing firewalls between the \nsorts of financial services one firm may offer to limit the spread of \nrisk, for example. Important protections put in place after the \nfinancial crisis of 2007 and 2008 could potentially be challenged under \nthe pending agreement. Even more troubling is the issue of Korea's \ncurrency. South Korean currency manipulation remains an unaddressed \nproblem. As we have seen in China, an intentionally weakened currency \nleads to a fundamentally unbalanced trade relationship and brutal \nconditions for U.S. companies. In a June 17 report, the Economic Policy \nInstitute calculated that if Asian currencies were strengthened to \nappropriate market-determined levels, if that were done, U.S. gross \ndomestic product would increase by as much as $285.7 billion or 1.9 \npercent, creating up to 2.25 million U.S. jobs; that is, if Asian \ncurrencies were strengthened to those appropriate levels. \nUnfortunately, as with other NAFTA-style free-trade agreements, this \nSouth Korea agreement is silent on currency. This is unacceptable \nbecause South Korea devalued their currency twice, once in 1988, once \nin 1998. Both interventions devalued their currency by 50 percent or \nmore. South Korea was one of the first countries cited as a currency \nmanipulator by the Treasury Department in 1988. South Korea continues \ntheir long history of manipulating their currency. In fact, the most \nrecent Treasury report to Congress on international economic and \nexchange rate policies, from May 27, 2011, noted that South Korea \nintervened ``heavily'' in its currency market during the financial \ncrisis and has continued uninterrupted since. Treasury urged South \nKorea to ``adopt a greater degree of exchange rate flexibility and less \nintervention.'' Currency policy has played a central role in China's \nmercantilist trade policies and has cost the United States thousands of \njobs. We should not be cutting tariffs for the country, with South \nKorea's heavy history on currency manipulation, without language to \ndeal with protecting us in a competitive environment in the \ndevaluations that they have undertaken before.\n\n  Additionally, several groups raised the possibility that the \nagreement could be used to weaken U.S. trade laws. The free trade \nagreement creates a bilateral commission on trade laws. While our Trade \nRepresentative argues that this will not change any existing U.S. trade \nlaws, this avenue could be used by advocates of weaker enforcement in \nthe future.\n  Finally, I turn to the last question. Does the agreement provide new \nopportunities for Pennsylvania manufacturers to export their goods? \nSimilar to NAFTA, the benefits of the South Korea deal have been, in my \njudgment, overstated, while the risks have been largely ignored. Rather \nthan opening a new market for Pennsylvania farmers and manufacturers, I \nam concerned that the benefits to the United States are minimal, at \nbest. There are specific reasons this deal fails to deliver for \nPennsylvania exporters. First, most of the benefits are based on an \noverly optimistic projection for agriculture. These projections, \ncompiled by supporters of the agreement, assume that a cut in tariffs \nwill immediately equal a growth in market share.\n  We know from past experience that Asian markets, including South \nKorea, have come up with a host of unjustified nontariff restrictions \nto keep U.S. beef out of their country. These barriers to free trade \nare likely to limit export potential and are largely unaddressed in the \nagreement. There are other troubling clauses dealing with the beef \nindustry. The South Korea agreement will allow American beef packagers \nto use Canadian or Mexican cattle and then export the packaged Mexican \nor Canadian beef as ``American'' beef. This policy, while great for \nbeef packagers, undercuts the U.S. ranchers. Given our difficulties in \ngaining a foothold in these markets, we should rely solely on U.S. \ncattle, which we know are safe.\n  Second, one of Pennsylvania's most important sectors--dairy--the \ncompeting European Union Free Trade Agreement with South Korea could \ninhibit our ability to compete in the South Korean market. The text of \nthe European Union agreement specifies that certain types of cheese, \nincluding mozzarella, must come from specific regions. As a result, \nEuropean exporters could challenge U.S. producers selling cheese in \nSouth Korea as ``mozzarella'' or ``parmesan.'' In this sense, the \nEuropeans have negotiated a better agreement, giving European companies \nan advantage over American companies.\n  Another problem with the agreement is which goods qualify for the \n``Made in South Korea'' designation--the sticker, so to speak--and are \nallowed to, therefore, enter the United States duty free. Under the \nrules of origin in annex 6-A of the agreement, 65 percent of the value \nof many goods, including automobiles shipped duty free to the United \nStates can come from South Korea and still be considered ``Made in \nSouth Korea.''\n  This standard is lower than the European Union agreement. The \nEuropean Union agreement has a 55-percent content standard where \ncontent can be foreign and, once again, places our companies at a \ncomparative disadvantage in international competition. Just as the \nchart depicts, 35 percent Korea plus 65 percent China will equal ``Made \nin Korea.'' I don't think that is what the American people bargain for \nwhen they expect us to get trade policies right. In a sense, this opens \nthe door--a back door--for products primarily made in places such as \nNorth Korea or China to enter the United States of America duty free. \nThat is wrong. It should be changed. We should not broker an agreement \nthat has that in it.\n  Let me conclude with the three questions I started with. First, will \nthe agreement create a substantial number of new jobs? I am concerned \nit will not. In previous agreements such as NAFTA, if they are any \nindication, the U.S.-Korea agreement will lead to job losses, \nespecially in the critical manufacturing sector.\n  Second, will the agreement help create a level playing field? It will \nnot. The agreement fails to address critical issues such as currency \nmanipulation that have already hurt American businesses and cost us \njobs.\n  Third, does the agreement provide new opportunities for American \nmanufacturers to export? Proponents have overstated the benefits. \nCertainly industries and firms are likely to benefit, while many others \nwill not. What is clear is that in its failure to address nontariff \nbarriers to trade, the agreement leaves American firms unprotected and \non a playing field that is not level.\n  Instead of moving ahead with a broken model, we need to focus on the \nbigger picture--formulating a strategy that helps American \nmanufacturers, that leads to job creation to help middle-income \nfamilies, helping us create the jobs of the future.\n  To make real sustained progress, Washington needs to have a plan, a\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nstrategy. We must develop and commit ourselves to a national \nmanufacturing strategy that includes job-creating trade policies as \nwell.\n  Recently I convened a roundtable in Pennsylvania with leaders of \nseveral southwestern Pennsylvania companies at the Universal Electric \nCorporation in Canonsburg, Washington County, to listen to their ideas \nand bring them to Washington, DC, to keep a focus on supporting \nmanufacturing. I heard a number of common themes. First of all, we \nshould develop a national strategy, as I mentioned, for manufacturing. \nSecond, we should make the R tax credit permanent. Third, we should \ncrack down--really crack down--on China's currency manipulation and \nother unfair trade policies so that Pennsylvania companies and their \nworkers have at least a fair shot. Legislation I recently introduced \ngives us those tools to hold countries accountable for manipulating \ncurrencies.\n  We also need to extend trade adjustment assistance to help workers \nwho have lost their jobs to overseas unfair foreign competition so they \ncan build new skills and find new employment.\n  Finally, we need to invest in science, technology, engineering, and \nmath, the so-called STEM discipline, which we know will create many \njobs in the future.\n  Manufacturing is the heart and soul of Pennsylvania and our Nation's \neconomy. Our future depends on developing policies that help our \nworkers and our businesses compete in the global production of goods. \nOur workers and our businesses can outcompete anyone in the world--any \ncountry in the world. We just need to give them a fair shot. We need to \ngive them a strategy. These agreements don't do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President I would observe the current Presiding \nOfficer has had the misfortune of being in the chair whenever I am \ncoming down to speak, so I appreciate his patience.\n  Today, congressional leaders are meeting with the President of the \nUnited States to discuss what can be done to reduce the Nation's out-\nof-control deficit, to deal with our unsustainable debt, to get America \nback to work and help grow our economy. I congratulate the President \nfor convening this meeting, which will probably be one of the last \nchances we will have to deal with this deadline of August 2 to deal \nwith the debt limit--a situation wherein we have maxed out our Nation's \ncredit card. Forty-three cents out of every dollar the Federal \nGovernment spends today is borrowed money, making the deficit worse and \nnot better and making the debt worse and not better. This is the chance \nto kick the habit of out-of-control spending here in Washington.\n  I appreciate the fact the President has moved from his initial \nposition wherein he advocated for Congress to simply raise the debt \nlimit without putting Washington and Congress on a spending diet. I \nappreciate the fact he has moved in his position. I read today in the \ndaily newspapers that he is putting a lot of things, including Social \nSecurity reform, on the table, together with other entitlements. I hope \nthis represents a change of position, a change of attitude, and the \nPresident and our negotiators will seize this opportunity to do the \nkind of grand bargain that will put America back on to a more solid \nfiscal path. Every child born in the United States today--while being \none of the luckiest people in the world being born in the United States \nof America, but at the same time being burdened--every child born today \nwill be burdened with $46,000 for their share of the national debt. \nThat is simply wrong and we all know it.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a lot of discussion about the White \nHouse and some of our Democratic colleagues wanting to raise taxes as \npart of this grand bargain. Indeed, I think that is the notion behind \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution the majority leader has introduced, \nwhich is targeted at millionaires and billionaires. The sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution the majority leader wants us to vote on says it is \nthe sense of the Senate that any agreement to reduce the budget deficit \nshould require that those earning $1 million or more per year make a \nmore meaningful contribution to deficit reduction.\n  Unfortunately, this is not real legislation. This won't change \nanything. This is a sense of the Senate. This is a resolution, which I \nthink is a missed opportunity to actually deal with the issue rather \nthan pretend as though we are treating it seriously.\n  When the White House proposes that working families and small \nbusinesses, among others, suffer a $400 billion tax increase over the \nnext 10 years, it strikes me that in one sense this is like a diet \nwhere a person says, I am going to give up dessert. I am not going to \neat dessert. But then that person binges on the buffet. In other words, \nit is not real. It is not going to work.\n  To put this in perspective, the Federal Government is currently \nborrowing $4 billion every day this year. So actually raising taxes in \nthis amount--while this only amounts to 10 days of what Washington \nspends--raising taxes by $400 billion over 10 years, as we can see, \nwon't make a serious dent in the deficit and the debt, and they are \nvery serious job-killing proposals as well. It strikes me as common \nsense to say if we want more jobs, we make it easier to create jobs. If \nwe want less jobs, we make it harder to create jobs by raising taxes, \nby excessive regulation, and other obstacles to job creation. The irony \nis that I am not confident our friends on the other side who propose \ntax increases as part of this grand bargain actually want to use that \nincreased revenue to pay down the deficit and the debt. To the \ncontrary, I fear what they want to do is continue spending at the \ncurrent levels. So it is kind of a shell game, saying we are going to \ncut $2 trillion but we are going to raise taxes by $2 trillion. What \ndoes that mean? Unless that $2 trillion in additional revenue is used \nto pay down the debt, it means it is a wash and government and \nWashington continue business as usual. I don't think the American \npeople want us to continue doing business as usual. I think they want \nus to listen to them and to mend our ways.\n\n  Let me give a context for how nonserious some of the proposals are, \nincluding out of the President of the United States. All of a sudden he \nfocused last week on this depreciation schedule for corporate jets. \nDepreciation is a normal part of the Tax Code which says if one uses \nsomething in a business, one can basically write it down over time. It \nwon't surprise us to find that if a person did that, if a person did \nwhat the President said--eliminate depreciation of corporate jets--it \nwould generate about $3 billion in revenue to the Federal Treasury over \n10 years--$3 billion over 10 years. But to get a sense of what a \nminuscule contribution that would make to solving the problem, consider \nwhat our annual deficit is. This is in 1 year. This is what $1.5 \ntrillion looks like. It has 12 zeroes; a 1, a 5, and 11 zeroes after \nthe 5. That is our annual deficit.\n  The President says to solve this annual deficit, we need to raise $3 \nbillion in additional revenue from corporate jet owners. Obviously, it \nis a drop in the bucket. But it is even worse when we look at the debt. \nThe deficit, of course, is the difference between what the Federal \nGovernment brings in and what it spends. Right now it is spending about \n$1.5 trillion more each year than it brings in, in revenue. That is the \ndeficit. But the accumulation of those deficits represents the debt. \nThis is how much red ink our Federal Government is spending--or where \nwe find ourselves--and that is $14 trillion. This is the number the \nPresident wants us to raise--$14 trillion. That is like the max on a \ncredit card. If a person is spending too much money, that person bumps \nup against the credit card limit. The President, in essence, rather \nthan cutting back on spending and making sure we are paying our bills \nwe already owe, wants to raise it so the Federal Government can spend \nmore money.\n  As I mentioned, this $14 trillion in debt boils down to $46,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child in the country. So when the President gives \na press conference--and I can't remember how many times he mentions \nchartered jets--but he talks about $3 billion in revenue over 10 years, \nit is a drop in the bucket when dealing with a 1-year deficit, or a \ndeficit each year, currently of $1.5 trillion, or a $14 trillion debt. \nSo the fact is we cannot get there from here, even if we did what the \nPresident said. It is not serious. It is not honest. It is not candid \nin terms of\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nwhat we need to do to get our country back on a solid fiscal pathway.\n  So let's talk about Federal tax reform. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about that, where we want to take the Tax Code with all of \nits multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it \nto make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer, and simpler. But right \nnow, the fact of that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 \npercent--that is a majority of American households--paid no income tax \nin 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada. No income tax was paid by 51 percent of the \nhouseholds in America in 2009. Actually, to show how out of whack \nthings have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made \nmoney from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits, the earned \nincome tax credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households \npaid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under \nthe current system. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the top \n10 percent of wage earners in America paid 70 percent of total income \ntaxes. The top 5 percent of income earners in America paid nearly 60 \npercent of income taxes, and the top 1 percent paid 38 percent of \nincome taxes.\n\n  So what is the President talking about and what is the majority \nleader trying to--what point are they trying to make when they suggest \nwe pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying that millionaires \nshould ``make a more meaningful contribution to the deficit reduction \neffort''? What is their point? Is their point that we ought to raise \ntaxes on people who are already paying taxes? Is their point that we \nshould expand the pool of people who do not pay any income tax or \nshould we perhaps expand the pool of people who actually benefit from \ncash transfers, payments as a result of a refundable tax credit?\n  Well, I think it is pretty obvious we need tax reform. I am skeptical \nthat we have time between now and Secretary Geithner's stated deadline \nof August 2 to do what we need to do and to repair and fix our broken \ntax system. But I think this helps put in context the frankly cynical \nsuggestion that somehow we could solve the problem if we just go after \nthe fat cats and the corporate jet owners. If we just make the \nmillionaires and billionaires pay more money, it will all be all right. \nWell, I think the American people are smarter than that. When \nconfronted with the facts, I think they can readily conclude and will \nreadily conclude that the system is broken and needs to be fixed. We do \nnot need a bunch of smoke and mirrors and phony arguments about class \nwarfare. That is not going to solve the problem. We need to solve the \nproblem.\n  Well, let's look at the President's economic record. I know there \nhave been some press reports about that the President said we are \nmaking a comeback. I think he called this summer ``the summer of \nrecovery,'' if I am not mistaken. But, in fact, we know the President's \npolicies are actually making things worse.\n  All you need to do is look at the number of people who are unemployed \nin America. There were 12 million people unemployed on his inauguration \nday. Now it is almost 14 million. Almost 2 million more Americans are \nunemployed. Is that making things better? No. It is making things \nworse. And we know there are a lot of people who are taking minimum-\nwage jobs and other jobs not up to their full potential because they \nwant to provide for their families, so we call those people \nunderemployed. That would make that number even higher. When the \nPresident was inaugurated in January of 2009, the unemployment rate was \n7.8 percent. Today, it is 9.1 percent. That is a 17-percent increase. \nIn other words, unemployment is worse today than it was when the \nPresident was sworn in.\n  Gas prices. We all know what has happened to gas prices. They have \ngone through the roof. People are having to deny themselves other \ndiscretionary expenditures because they simply have to have the \ngasoline to be able to drive to work, drive the kids to school, or take \ncare of their daily business. The fact is, when the President was sworn \nin, gasoline prices were $1.85. Well, wouldn't it be great if gas \nprices were $1.85 today? Instead, they average $3.58. That is almost a \n100-percent increase in gasoline prices since President Obama put his \nhand on the Bible and was sworn in as President of the United States. \nIt is a 94-percent increase.\n  Then we were talking about the Federal debt. The Federal debt when \nthe President was sworn in--some people will tell you: Oh, it is all \nabout President Bush and fighting two wars that were not paid for. It \nis about the Bush tax cuts and other things. Well, I agree there is \nbipartisan blame when it comes to our national debt, but we ought to \nlink arms and work together to try to solve the problem rather than \ncontinue to make it worse. The Federal debt when President Obama was \nsworn in was $10.6 trillion. Today, it is $14.3 trillion. It is 35 \npercent worse. The debt has gone up by 35 percent since President Obama \nwas sworn in.\n  I mentioned this factor earlier. As shown on this chart, this is what \nevery American citizen owes in terms of their share of the national \ndebt. When President Obama was sworn in, it was $34,000. Today, it is \n46,000. So, congratulations, everyone within the sound of my voice owes \n$11,000 more to the national debt since President Obama became \nPresident of the United States.\n  Then there is health insurance. We have had a lot of debate about \nhealth insurance costs. We were told that if we just passed this giant \nhealth care bill, health insurance costs would go down, we would fix \nproblems, and we would make sure more people had access to health care. \nWell, since President Obama became President, health insurance premiums \nhave gone up by 19 percent--19 percent. Did he make it better or did he \nmake it worse?\n  Well, we need to unburden the economy from higher taxes, excessive \nregulation, and all the sorts of obstacles that get in the way of small \nbusinesses--the primary job-creating engine in our economy--doing what \nthey do best; that is, growing the economy, creating jobs. If our \nfriends across the aisle want more tax revenue, well, the best way to \nget more revenue is to get more Americans back to work so they pay \ntaxes rather than remain unemployed, losing their homes because they \ncannot pay their mortgages. That is how we ought to increase revenue, \nnot by raising rates, not by some of these silly class-warfare \narguments that seem to target unpopular sectors of the economy.\n  And, yes, we need to increase exports to create more jobs. We can do \nthat by ratifying the outstanding trade agreements without adding \nunnecessary spending to them.\n  And, yes, when it comes to energy policy, the high price of \ngasoline--which has gone up 94 percent since President Obama became \nPresident of the United States--we can open more domestic energy \nreserves, more American natural resources, rather than continue to have \nto import it from places abroad that are not necessarily our friends or \nwhich may be in political turmoil or even war, such as Libya. So if we \nhad a rational national energy policy where the EPA, rather than \nlooking for excuses to deny us access to things such as the natural gas \ndiscoveries we have found in Texas and around the country--if we had a \nway to take advantage of and did, in fact, take advantage of more \ndomestic energy production, it could help us put more Americans back to \nwork and help us reduce our dependency on energy from abroad and help \nbring down this price to one that does not break the backs of the \naverage working families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have a correction. My staff told me I \nundercounted $14 trillion. I asked ahead of time, but we actually got \nthe number wrong. The number I have on the chart is actually three \nzeros too few. So just to make sure the record is correct, that is 12 \nzeros after the ``14.'' That reflects our national debt. I would like \nto say I made the mistake and it was actually lower, but it actually is \nmuch higher, which I think reinforces my point.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, while the Senator is still here, I \nrecall--Senator Cornyn is a member of the Budget\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nCommittee and knowledgeable about these issues--that we have had one \nbudget actually presented to the Senate, and that was the President's \nbudget. It was scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which shows \nthat under the President's budget, the debt of the United States would \nincrease by $13 trillion in 10 years.\n  I do not know if the Senator is aware, but I would ask him is he \naware of how much additional revenue would come to the government if \nthe President's proposal on corporate jet taxation were to be imposed, \nand would that make a difference in the $13,000 trillion that would be \nadded to the debt in the next 10 years?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, Mr. President, responding to my friend from \nAlabama, the number, I am advised, is roughly $3 billion in additional \nrevenue to the Treasury, and that would be over 10 years. But, as you \ncan see, it is a drop in the bucket when it comes to the deficit for 1 \nyear, which is $1.5 trillion, and the national debt of $14 trillion.\n  I apologize, I am not used to dealing with numbers that big, which \ndemonstrates that these numbers really have kind of lost their meaning \nhere. I remember Everett Dirksen being quoted as saying: A million \nhere, a million there, and pretty soon you are talking about real \nmoney.\n  The fact is we are not talking about millions, we are not talking \nabout billions, we are talking about trillions. I think most people's \nminds have a very difficult time conceiving of how big a number that \nis.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to enter \ninto a colloquy with my Republican colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If Senator Cornyn could join us, we would be pleased.\n  Mr. President, the debt situation we are in today is the most serious \nour Nation has ever faced. A lot of people do not understand it and do \nnot understand how serious it is. Even after World War II, we had \ngrowth. We had the baby boomers just coming of age, we had more young \npeople and fewer older people, and the situation was more positive than \nit is today, even though we had debt after the war. That is just a \nfact.\n  I have tried to look at the creation of a budget that would balance \nin 10 years, bring us into balance in 10 years. It is hard to do. It \nabsolutely can be done. It takes some real effort, but it can be done. \nWe can do it, and we have to do it. But President Obama, during his \nyears as President, is on track to have four consecutive trillion-\ndollar deficits--the highest deficit we have had previously was the \n$450 billion deficit that President Bush had. We have had $1.2 trillion \nand $1.3 trillion.\n\n  This September 30, when the fiscal year ends, it is estimated to be \n$1.5 trillion for 2011. We take in $2.2 trillion, we are spending $3.7 \ntrillion, and 40 cents of every dollar we spend this year is borrowed. \nIt is an unsustainable course.\n  President Obama appointed a deficit commission. He appointed Erskine \nBowles, a former Chief of Staff of President Clinton, as co-chair. He \nalso chose Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator. They submitted a \nstatement to the Budget Committee that this country faces the most \npredictable economic crisis in its history. We have to act, they told \nus.\n  They were asked when could this crisis happen. Mr. Bowles said it \ncould happen within 2 years--not for our children and grandchildren; he \nsaid 2 years, maybe a little sooner or maybe a little later. Alan \nSimpson popped up and said he thought it could be 1 year; in other \nwords, some sort of economic crisis like we had in 2007 and 2008 or \nsomething that could put our economy in a tailspin. It is that serious. \nThe debt trajectory path we are on is unsustainable.\n  Tomorrow, I have to say, will mark the 800th day this Senate has not \nhad a budget. We are borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we spend, \nand we have gone this long without a budget. There is no plan, \napparently, to present one. The chairman of the Budget Committee, on \nwhich I am ranking Republican, tells us he has one, and he talked to \nhis colleagues and they have agreed on it. But it remains secret.\n  The Congressional Budget Act explicitly says we should have a budget \nby April 15. It says the committee should report a budget resolution on \nApril 1. Well, we have not had a markup. Apparently, there is no plan \nto have one. We are just going to wait and see if secret negotiations \ncan produce something. That is not acceptable at a time in which the \ndebt is the primary threat to the health, security, and welfare of our \nNation, and there is no doubt about it.\n  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the \ngreatest threat to our national security is our debt. Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton made a very similar statement. They are exactly \nright. There is no dispute about it.\n  We have had nothing on the floor of the Senate except a resolution \nsaying we should tax the rich--a sense of the Senate, that has no \npower, no binding authority, no numbers, not how much we are going to \nattack the rich.\n  We are in serious condition. I think the American people, if they \nunderstood how little has been done in this body this year on the most \nimportant issue facing this country, would be even more dissatisfied \nwith the U.S. Congress than they are--more dissatisfied at least with \nthe Senate. I knew the Senator from Missouri before, who is not new to \nCongress. He was a Republican whip in the House of Representatives. The \nHouse has passed a budget this year--an honest budget that changes the \ndebt trajectory of America in a solid way, and it would put us on a new \npath for prosperity. Everybody doesn't have to agree with everything in \nit, but they met their responsibility by April 15.\n  It is great to be here with Senator Blunt. We are so pleased to have \nhim in the Senate. I ask him if he would share his thoughts at this \ntime about this situation.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I will. I also asked the Senator about his view of this \nbudget situation. The Presiding Officer and I were secretaries of state \ntogether some time ago and have known each other a long time. I am glad \nto have him in the chair as we have this discussion.\n  I don't think the House, until the last Congress, ever failed to pass \na budget. I am not sure the Senate didn't always pass a budget until \nthe last Congress, though there were times when the House and Senate \ncould not agree. But at least each side had a plan.\n  There is an old adage that when you fail to plan, you plan to fail. \nIt sure looks to me that is the trajectory we are on now. Members are \nmore and more talking about maybe we will have another continuing \nresolution this year. That will be the appropriations process because \nwe have no plan. Of course, as the Senator pointed out, as a person who \nknows as much about the budget process as anybody in Washington, we \npassed the April 1 deadline, then we passed a May 1 date, and then a \nJune 1 date, and now we passed the July 1 date. We are up to that 800th \nday since the Senate passed a plan or had a plan of any kind. We are \nwaiting for a plan to move forward with the work of just funding the \ngovernment. Clearly, that is not acceptable.\n  We see the economy continuing to wait for some signs of certainty \nfrom the Federal Government, certainty about where our budget is going \nto be, certainty about our tax structure, certainty about regulations \nand utility bills. We are just not seeing that happen. In fact, things \nare getting progressively worse and worse. Gas prices have almost \ndoubled now in the last 30 months. Unemployment is up 17 percent. In \nfact, there is no statistic I know of that is better than it was in \nJanuary of 2009.\n  Has the Senate, in the past, until the last 3 years--has there ever \nbeen a time when the Senate didn't even attempt to have a budget?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To my knowledge, at no time since I have been here did \nthe Senate not attempt to pass a budget. In the last 2 years, even when \nour Democratic colleagues had 60 votes--the largest majority in recent \nmemory in the Senate--they only attempted to bring a budget to the \nfloor once. Last year a budget did go to committee. It was marked up by \nSenator Conrad. It came to the floor, but the majority leader decided \nnot to bring it up. This year, it seems that Senator Conrad was told \nnot to have a markup, not to even produce a budget in committee.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  It seems to me to indicate a lack of willingness to lead because--\nwould the Senator not agree?--a budget sets the priorities, \ndemonstrates the vision for the future of the country and what we \nshould spend, what we should tax, and how much debt we can afford to \nrun up. Those are fundamental responsibilities. How would he evaluate \nthe fact that tomorrow we are 800 days without a budget? What does that \nsay about the leadership we have seen in the Senate?\n  Mr. BLUNT. It shows we have been 800 days without a budget, and \nbasically 800 days without any structure or process of how we spend the \npeople's money. It has been 800 days since the last time we could come \nup with an appropriations process, so maybe they will suggest we will \nmodify that a little bit and move forward. But that clearly is not good \nenough. In that 800 days, as the Senator pointed out, we have gone to \nwhere we are--we have added 35 percent in a little over 800 days, in \n2\\1/2\\ years, to the Federal deficit.\n  This is not defending anybody else's effort to make the revenue and \nthe expenditures of the Federal Government balance, but we can't \ncontinue to spend more than we have. If we don't have a plan, a \nblueprint, or if we don't have a budget like families have to have--if \nwe don't have a budget at the very least, and we are managing our \nmoney, we write checks until the money runs out, and we can't do much \nmore than that.\n  We are at a point now that we are spending $3.7 trillion or $3.8 \ntrillion and collecting $2.2 trillion. I am like Senator Cornyn on this \ntopic--by the way, everybody else is too, including the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. Nobody knows how much money this is, but we all know if \nsomeone is making $22,000 a year and spending $37,000 a year, and they \nhave already borrowed more money than anybody should have ever lent \nthem, they can't continue to do that.\n  There has to be a point where they say: We are going to have to get \nreal. We are making $22,000, so we better start spending no more than \n$22,000, and that includes paying off the money that we have already \nborrowed when we were spending $37,000.\n  There are so many zeros and numbers that if any of us really \nunderstood how much money we are talking about and how long it will \ntake to pay it back, we would all be more scared than we are. \nCertainly, the people we work for would be more scared than they are \nbecause we are doing irresponsible things, and as irresponsible as any \nof those things is not having a plan.\n  In all those years the Senator spent on the Budget Committee and his \nleadership there now, he knows if we don't have a plan--the \nappropriations process doesn't move forward unless we agree first how \nmuch money we are going to spend in that process. So, eventually, we \njust go back and say: Let's go back to last year and modify slightly \nthe terrible job we did last year, and let's borrow that much more \nmoney again.\n  That is not acceptable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Before the Senator shares his thoughts about the \nappropriations process from his extensive experience in the leadership \nof the Congress, just briefly, I want to make sure the American people \nand our colleagues know what happened.\n  I see our newly elected colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Ron \nJohnson. He won election, you could say, in an upset--a popular, big \nvictory. He campaigned all over his State and talked about the issues \nwe are talking about today.\n  As a new Member of the Senate, I would love to hear Senator Johnson's \ncomments about where he thinks we are today.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. First of all, I thank the Senator for his \nleadership. He has been talking loudly and clearly about the fact that \nwe should not have recessed this week. I know President Obama tried to \nclaim credit for that. It is because of the Senator's leadership and \nthe members of the Republican conference in the Senate who said: No, we \nare bankrupting America and we need to stay here and start debating \nthis issue.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what we have been doing this week. It is \nsad. One word I have used all the time now that I have come to \nWashington is ``unbelievable.'' It is simply unbelievable that tomorrow \nwill mark 800 days that we haven't passed a budget.\n  My background is in business for the last 34 years. I have had to \nproduce budgets on time. I have had people produce budgets for me on \ntime. In business--even a small business--it is inconceivable that if \nyou tell a colleague to make sure to have the budget on your desk by \nApril 15 that it wouldn't be there; 99.9 percent of those accountants \nand controllers would have a budget on time, on April 15.\n  We are dealing with the United States of America. We are talking \nabout our financial future, the fate of America. The Democrats in the \nSenate have failed to meet that obligation for 2 years in a row. That \nis simply unbelievable, and it is so incredibly irresponsible. Really, \nI think the Senate has been guilty of willful neglect. The phrase I \nhave used is that the Senate has been ``fiddling'' while America is \ngoing broke. That is sad.\n  As the Senator pointed out as well, what does the financial future of \nAmerica rest on? Some secret talks--talks between a few individuals \ngoing out behind closed doors far from the view of the American public \nrather than in an orderly process where a plan is presented that can be \nviewed by the American public, that can be debated openly the way our \nFounders envisioned on the floor of this Senate, this historic floor; \ninstead of using the process that we should have been using, what is \ngoing to happen? Are we going to have a result, a negotiated settlement \ndrop in our laps a couple days before this deadline date? Is that what \nis going to happen? Is that really how the financial fate of America is \ngoing to be decided?\n\n  I personally find that process disgusting. That is why I stood last \nTuesday on the floor of the Senate and said unless we start seriously \naddressing this problem, the bankrupting of America, in the open, in \nthe bright light of day, I was going to begin to object. I was going to \nbegin to withhold my consent.\n  I was heartened by the support I got from my Republican colleagues \nbecause, let's face it, we understand how urgent the situation is. We \nunderstand how dire our financial situation is. We are willing to sit \ndown and work with anybody who will seriously address the fact that we \nare driving America toward bankruptcy. But we need a willing partner, \nand up to this point in time I haven't seen one.\n  The fact that the only plan we have seen is the President's budget, \n4.25 inches thick, 2,400 pages long--how many thousands of manhours did \nthat document take to produce? It was so unserious it would have added \nmore than $12 trillion to our Nation's debt in the next 10 years. It \nwould have continued the bankrupting of America. It would have made us \ngo broke. It was so unserious, it failed in the Senate by a vote of 0-\n97. Not one Democratic Senator found that bill serious enough to give \nit a vote. That is the only plan I have seen.\n  I woke up this morning to a couple of news reports, and there was \nmore detail about what the administration might plan to do fed to \nreporters than fed to a Member of Congress.\n  I am sorry to be so blunt about this, but that is a disgusting \nprocess. The American people deserve far better. I guess today what I \nam standing here saying is, I want to see a plan, and I want to see a \nbudget, and I want to see it to give us enough time so we can actually \nanalyze it and debate it and pass the real structural reforms so that \nwe can actually solve this problem. I am calling on the President and I \nam calling on the Democrats in this Senate to produce that plan so we \ncan have an open debate on it. That is kind of how I am thinking.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would like to say to both Senator Sessions and Senator \nJohnson, who were primary leaders in this idea that we shouldn't go \nhome, that Republicans shouldn't vote to adjourn, that you were going \nto object to things that didn't relate to the business we need to do, \nand, of course, that is right.\n  As Senator Johnson was talking, I was thinking the other deadline, \nthe other April 15 deadline, every American had better comply with that \none. It is in the law just like the one that we are supposed to comply \nwith.\n  What if everybody in America decided they were going to miss their\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nlegal deadline as well? OK, we are not going to have a budget, and we \nare not going to pay our taxes. Of course, they would be in trouble. \nThe Senate is not in trouble, but the country is in trouble because the \nSenate is not doing its job. Neither the House nor the Senate did their \njobs in the last Congress, for the first time ever. So that is how we \ngo now into 3 years of no budget, 3 years since we had a working \ndocument that we should have to work with. That is important.\n  What did we do this week? The disappointment to all three of us is we \nsaid we wanted to stay this week and deal with these issues, and what \ndid we deal with? We started out by trying to deal with a Libya \nresolution that apparently wasn't important enough to deal with last \nThursday when we were going to take a week to be working in our States, \nbut we will debate the Libya resolution. Then when people on the \nRepublican side said they thought we ought to be debating the reason we \nwere supposed to stay, we still didn't do that. We have this amendment \nthat I think was supposed to be a sense of the Senate, and is a sense \nof the Senate that millionaires aren't paying enough taxes.\n  We all understand the politics of that, just like we understand the \npolitics of no accelerated depreciation for business airplanes. \nWhenever that was done, it was done to try to create more American jobs \nquicker by a little more demand. I think how that works is that plane \nis depreciated in 5 years instead of 7 to encourage people to go ahead \nand buy a plane and keep people who make planes at work. But what is \nthat $3 billion over 10 years? We are borrowing $4 billion today, and \nwe try to have this debate as if it is about $3 billion over 10 years. \nWe are borrowing $4 billion today, and we want to have this false \ndebate about who is not paying their share.\n  We are spending too much money is the problem. The problem is not \nthat we are not taxing enough. We are spending almost 25 percent of the \ncapacity of the country to produce goods and services. Until the \nbeginning of 2009, for 40 years the average was 20.6; $1 out of $5 was \ngoing to the Federal Government, not $1 out of $4.\n  I was asked by some reporters yesterday: Why is this so different \nthan other times when the debt limit has been increased? You mentioned \none of them earlier. One of the differences is we have added 35 percent \nto the debt in about 30 months--35 percent to the debt in 30 months.\n  Another one is the Federal Government is suffocating the economy by \nspending too much money. There is no money left for people to borrow \nand take a risk and create a job and create an opportunity for somebody \nelse.\n  On the millionaire tax, 1 percent of all the taxpayers pay 38 percent \nof all the taxes now. Maybe we ought to get to where 1 or 2 percent \njust pay all the taxes. We already have 47 percent of the individuals \nin the country paying no income tax.\n  By the way, you value what you pay for. If you don't pay any income \ntax, you don't care about the income tax as much as if you did. So \nthere aren't as many people out there fighting excessive taxation \nbecause they have less of a stake in it. But 1 percent of the people in \nthe country already pay 38 percent of the income taxes, and 10 percent \npay 70 percent. Maybe we just ought to let that 10 percent pay 100 \npercent. I guess that would get all the millionaires and billionaires.\n  And, oh, I remember the tax. Do you remember the millionaires' tax, \nbut only like 155 people would pay or something? It was the alternative \nminimum tax; 155 people were going to pay that millionaire tax, and now \nsome huge percentage of all Americans pay it because, eventually, once \nwe start down this path, everybody is impacted by higher tax rates.\n  The frustration of being here and not doing anything all week--we had \none vote to compel the Members who didn't come, to come to the Senate, \nand another vote was cloture on a bill that doesn't matter. The \nfrustration of your leadership and then that result is pretty \nincredible to me.\n  But thanks to both Senators for insisting for weeks before last week \nthat we should stay and have a discussion, a debate, a vote on the \nthings that matter. I am sorry that we didn't have that, particularly \nbased on the intensity on the part of both Senators of insisting that \nwe have that kind of debate this week, and we didn't have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I would like to pick up on Senator Blunt's \npoint about just how unserious this week has been.\n  Just in comparison to business, about 5 years ago I bought a business \nout of bankruptcy. I watched those business owners over the course of 2 \nor 3 years struggle to make a go of that business. You would not \nbelieve the number of hours those people, those hard-working Americans \nput in to save that business. It didn't work. They went into \nreorganization under the bankruptcy laws. I bought that business out of \nbankruptcy. I saw how incredibly hard my team worked to make that \nbusiness survive, and it did survive. These are individuals putting in \n16, 17, 18, 20 hours a day to make a product, to build a good life for \nthemselves and their families, to provide employment, jobs.\n  This is the American spirit. That is the entrepreneurial spirit. That \nis what Americans do day in and day out, whether they own a business or \nwhether they contribute their effort: their labor to make their \nbusiness successful, the one they work for successful. That is what \nAmericans do.\n\n  What has this President done? What has this Congress done? What has \nthis Senate done?\n  In the last 6 months since I have been here, we passed six laws, six \nbills that have become law. Three of those had to do with the \ncontinuing resolutions of last year's business: funding the government \nfor this year. Those were laws that should have been passed 1 year ago, \nbut it was left over for us to do that.\n  We had two bills to extend the PATRIOT Act. If we take a look at how \nthat was even done, it was last minute, rush-rush, very little time for \ndebate. We couldn't even get amendments in there.\n  Then, of course, the other one is we kind of cleaned up a little bit \na little part of the health care law that dealt with 1099s, which would \nhave been a nightmare. It would have cost billions of dollars to comply \nwith and not brought in any revenue. So we finally got that off the \nbooks, thankfully.\n  The other bills we have debated, we spent 16 weeks debating three \nbills. The total dollar amount of those bills is $20 billion. That is \nabout \\1/2\\ percent of what this Federal Government will spend this \nyear. So we have spent 16 weeks debating \\1/2\\ percent of our $3.6-\ntrillion-a-year budget. That, in my mind, is the definition of being \nnot serious.\n  Of course, we have said it has been 799--tomorrow it will be 800--\ndays since we actually passed a budget. This week we spent 15 hours of \ndebate. We call it a sense-of-the-Senate resolution? It should be \ncalled the nonsense of the Senate. That is what has been occurring this \nweek, and it is a tragedy. It is a tragedy.\n  But, again, that is why I stood up and started to object. I will \ncontinue to do that until we actually start getting serious, until we \nactually see a plan, a budget that we can start debating.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, let me just note that we had a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on the floor, and we had a cloture vote on it that I \nthink everybody voted to go to the bill. That is what the leader wanted \nto do. We go to the bill. But it is really nothing because if it passes \nit has no impact and makes no change whatsoever. It basically says we \nshould tax the rich more.\n  Well, we can debate these issues, but I will just note that the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, which is \nan organization for the development of world businesses has concluded \nthat the United States has the most progressive tax system in the \nworld. We always thought the Europeans were more hostile to wealth and \nmore socialistic than we were, but that is their analysis.\n  As Senator Blunt said, how much more do we want them to pay? Maybe \nthey should pay more. Let's debate it and let's talk about it. But that \nis not going to fix our problems.\n  Senator Johnson was a successful businessman, an accountant. I have \nseen his work. I am so glad he is on the Budget Committee. I guess he \nand Senator Enzi are the only accountants around here, and we are glad \nthe Senator is here. I have seen his work.\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\n  He actually adds up numbers and makes spending charts. He showed me \none this morning, trying to figure out a way to change America.\n  But my first question is--the Senator was a successful businessman \nand he had never been a politician before, so why did the Senator run?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Well, the reason I ran is because we are \nbankrupting the Nation. I love America. We love America. When I watch \nwhat is happening, and when I saw how broken Washington was, when I saw \nthem pass the health care law, from my standpoint that was the straw \nthat broke the camel's back.\n  Our first child, my daughter Carey, was born with a very serious \ncongenital heart defect. Dedicated doctors and surgeons saved her life \nthe first day. Then 8 months later, when her heart was the size of a \nplum, another dedicated surgical team of dedicated professionals \ntotally reconstructed the upper chamber of her heart. Her heart \noperates backwards now. But she is 28 years old, and she is a nurse \nherself in a neonatal intensive care unit.\n  When I heard President Obama say these doctors, that they will take \nout a set of tonsils for a few extra bucks, I found that outrageous. \nThen when this Congress and this President signed the health care law, \nI know the result of that. It is designed to lead to a government \ntakeover of our health care system.\n  All we have to do is take a look at Canada and Britain. We don't have \nto theorize what that is going to result in. It will lower the quality \nof care. It will result in rationing, and the medical innovation to \nsave my daughter's life and millions of others--it really is America \nwhere medical miracles are created. I think that innovation is going to \ncome to a grinding halt.\n  So that is just the quality aspect of the health care bill, but it is \ngoing to destroy our budget.\n  I wrote a piece with Douglas Holtz-Eakin, ex-CBO Director. Rather \nthan $93 billion a year, when this bill kicks in, as it is designed to \ndo, and a large percentage of Americans lose their health care employer \ncoverage and get dumped into the exchanges, we are talking about a $\\1/\n2\\ trillion or maybe $900 billion.\n  I see we are running out of time, but that is why I ran, because we \nare bankrupting America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senators have used 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 additional \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just want to say we have in this \ncolloquy Senator Blunt, who was the second ranking Republican leader in \nthe House and who has dealt with these issues for many years. We are so \nglad to have him in the Senate--and Senator Johnson, a new Senator, \npassionate and concerned about the future of America, both of them. I \nthink the American people should be proud of the service they have \nrendered.\n  We have to change. I believe we can, and we are going to keep \nfighting toward that end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the Presiding Officer \nrecognizing me. I kind of switched places with him earlier. I was in \nthe chair and listened to some comments from a number of Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle. I did not come to the floor to talk about \nthis, but I just cannot help myself sometimes.\n  I heard these comparisons. When they talked about the economy, it all \nstarted January 20 of 2009, and they compared that day with today. What \nthey left out of that picture is when Barack Obama became President, \nthis economy was going like this. It was not like: He is President. Now \nthings will get better. The 30 days after he was sworn in on January \n20, 2009, we lost 700,000 jobs in this country. The next 30 days we \nlost somewhere in excess of, I believe, 600,000 jobs.\n  The point is, what happened for the first several months, almost \nbefore President Obama could take a breath, before Congress, the House \nand Senate, controlled by Democrats then, could actually put a program \nin place and put policies in place that would respond to this terrible \neconomy bequeathed to them and to us by this sort of Republican \neconomic policy. The Republican economic policy was tax cuts for the \nrich, two wars not paid for, a giveaway to the drug and insurance \nindustry, a bailout to the drug and insurance industry in the name of \nMedicare privatization, privatization/deregulation of Wall Street, and \ntax cuts that went overwhelmingly to the richest Americans. That is \nwhat got us into this.\n  For them to say look at the number of jobs today, look at the number \nof jobs in January, 2009--they know that is a specious argument. They \nare disingenuous. They are not especially honest when they make that \nargument.\n  The fact is, we have seen in the last 14 months--and I wish it were \nbetter. I went to Barberton, OH, this week and was at a plant expansion \nwith 30 jobs. It is not enough, I wish it were 300. It is an Alcoa \nplant. They are hiring people. They are paying OK wages. I wish they \nwere paying better wages. I wish they could hire more people. But we \nare seeing progress.\n  In the last 14 months--they forgot to tell us this--we are seeing job \ngrowth every month, including manufacturing job growth, the lifeblood \nof the economy in my State. We are the third leading manufacturing \nState, only behind the States of Senator Cornyn and Senator Boxer and \nSenator Feinstein in the number of manufacturing jobs and their output.\n  The point is, let's be honest when we have this discussion. We know \nour policies are not working as fast as we would like. But we know what \ntheir policies brought us--21 million private sector jobs created \nduring the 8 years of Bill Clinton; then when they put in the Bush \neconomic policies: tax cuts for the wealthy, twice; two wars, not \npaying for them; partial privatization of Medicare; deregulation of \nWall Street--1 million private sector jobs created in 8 years; 21 \nmillion versus 1 million. Tell that story too.\n  I am not saying we have every answer--we don't--but we are making \nprogress in spite of their saying no to everything we are trying to do.\n  We have to look at the future. The biggest problem we have in this \ncountry is the decline of the middle class and we have to address that. \nThat is why I came to the floor, because even though we are in the \nmidst of this budget debate as everyone is talking about, the focus has \nto stay on jobs creation. It has to be: How do we create jobs in this \ncountry?\n  One way not to create jobs is what Senator Casey talked about an hour \nor so ago, and that would be three new trade agreements that too many \npeople on both sides of the aisle want to foist on the American people.\n  This morning, the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means \nCommittee were both having what are called mock markups of free-trade \ndeals with three countries: South Korea in Asia, Colombia and Panama in \nour hemisphere.\n  The Senate Finance committee is including trade adjustment \nassistance. The House does not even care to take care of workers who \nlose their jobs because of these trade agreements. They are expendable. \nThey are a bunch of 50-year-olds who do not have much education and, if \nthey lose their jobs, who cares? That is what they are saying in the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee. We will pass this legislation. When \npeople lose their jobs, there is nothing we can do to help them. But \nthere is, and we have had something called trade adjustment assistance \nfor 50 years and it has been bipartisan, until this group of radicals \nwho run the House of Representatives decided we don't want trade \nassistance adjustment anymore.\n  In the last decade alone, 6 million manufacturing jobs, 55,000 \nmanufacturing plants have been lost.\n  Multinational companies are too easily setting up companies overseas \nand exporting products back into the U.S. market. Is there any time in \nworld history where the most compelling business plan for a company is \nshut down what they do in their home country, move production far away \nto another country where they have lower wages, fewer regulations, a \ngovernment that is not exactly free, make those products there, and \nsell them back to the home\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\ncountry? This business plan that so many American companies follow is \nmove production overseas where they can get cheap labor and weak \nregulations in a totalitarian government and then sell the products \nback to the home country. That is a business plan that far too many \nAmerican companies have, obviously, followed.\n  Manufacturing now accounts for less than 10 percent of employment in \nour country. That is partly because of NAFTA, partly because of the \nCAFTA, partly because of the China permanent normal trade relations. \nThey only accelerate our decline and the country pays for it today. The \npublic has heard promises of job creation from trade deals before--\nevery single time: NAFTA would create this many jobs, CAFTA would \ncreate this many jobs, PNTR would mean more prosperity and jobs for \nAmericans.\n  The Korean deal is more of the same. The International Trade \nCommission projects the Korean Free Trade Agreement would increase the \nU.S. trade deficit. The Economic Policy Institute estimates the loss of \nat least 150,000 jobs from this agreement. The Korea pact has unusually \nlow rules of origin, allowing manufactured goods containing up to 65 \npercent of components from China or any other country to obtain the \nbenefits of the agreement.\n  What happens is a company in Seoul, South Korea--after this trade \nagreement would pass, if it does--would contract with the Chinese; 65 \npercent of the product would come from China, be sold into South Korea, \nSouth Korea puts its value added on it, sends it to the United States \nduty free, tariff free, even though 65 percent of it was made in China.\n  Pundits and the editorial boards say agreements such as these are no-\nbrainers. They say trade adjustment assistance is just a payoff to \nworkers for passing more job-killing trade agreements. The Washington \nPost editorial board--always a creative thinker of the future and wrong \nin their predictions on war, wrong in their predictions on trade, wrong \nin their predictions on labor law, but nonetheless the Washington Post \neditorial board called TAA a consolation prize.\n  Once again, they get it wrong. Not many editorial writers in the \nWashington Post, frankly, have lost their jobs in trade agreements. \nThey don't seem all that interested in people in Steubenville and Lima \nand Zanesville who actually have lost their jobs because of these trade \nagreements which the Washington Post editorial board always supports.\n  We need to focus on retraining workers who are displaced because of \npast free-trade deals. But even this historically bipartisan program, \nas I said earlier, is suddenly becoming controversial. It was operated \nthrough numerous administrations, supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, and ensures workers who lose their jobs and financial \nsecurity as a result of globalization have an opportunity to transition \nto new jobs in emerging sectors of the economy. It helps retrain \nworkers for new opportunities.\n\n  In the 2010 fiscal year alone, more than 225,000 workers participated \nin the TAA program, receiving training for jobs employers are looking \nto fill. It is common sense. Senator Casey stood on this floor--he in \nthat row, I in this row--and asked repeatedly for his colleagues to \nextend this vital job training program. Under the rules of the Senate, \none of them stands and objects, time and time again. We did get a 6-\nweek extension, but since mid-February, this part of trade adjustment \nassistance is simply not available to so many people in New Mexico and \nin Ohio and in Pennsylvania and across the country.\n  Senator Casey and I introduced the TAA bill last week that would \nextend TAA for 5 years. We paid for it. We know it is no panacea for \nbad trade agreements. It is not the price workers in my State want to \npay while Congress passes more trade deals. We must stand for workers \nbefore even considering new trade agreements. We must focus on real job \ncreation. A big part of that is standing against China's unfair \ncurrency regime that they have inflicted on this world trade regimen \nfor a number of years.\n  With our trade deficit, also comes trading partners manipulating \ntheir currency to undermine our manufacturers. They have repeatedly \nfound ways to circumvent trade laws to gain an unfair advantage. In \n2010, our trade deficit was $634 billion. That means every single day, \n7 days a week, 52 weeks a year--every single day we buy more than $1.5 \nbillion more in goods than they sell internationally.\n  With China, our trade deficit was $273 billion. That means several \nhundred million dollars every day we purchase from China more than we \nsell to China, every single day.\n  President Bush once said that a $1 billion trade surplus or a $1 \nbillion trade deficit translates into 13,000 jobs. Think about that. If \nwe have a trade deficit of $1 billion, according to President Bush--\nthese are not my numbers--both President Bushes, by and large, \nsupported both of these trade agreements--by and large, we lost 13,000 \njobs, mostly manufacturing, in Indiana and Ohio and New Mexico and \naround the country.\n  Do the math. If our trade deficit is $200 billion with China, we know \nwhat that means.\n  Ten years ago, our trade deficit in goods with China was $68 billion. \nThese geniuses who come up with these trade agreements, supported by \nthe editorial boards, supported by Harvard economists, supported by \nPresidents, supported by pundits who are in Washington and probably do \nnot get outside of Washington much--we had a $68 billion trade deficit \nwith China when the most effective corporate lobbyists in the history \nof the world came to this institution, came to the House and Senate, \nand sold a majority of House and Senate Members that PNTR with China \nwas a good idea. We had a $68 billion trade deficit with China then. \nNow it is $273 billion. They told us: We are going to sell more goods. \nWe are going to do better with our deals with China when we have this.\n  In the last couple minutes, I would point out Senator Snowe and I \nproposed bipartisan currency reform for the Fair Trade Act to ensure \nour trade deficit is not further increased when countries such as China \nmanipulate their currency to make their exports less expensive so they \ncan break into our market and keep us out of their market. The \nlegislation passed overwhelmingly in the House last year. Our bill \nwould strengthen countervailing duty laws to consider undervalued \ncurrency as an unfair trade subsidy in determining duty rates.\n  When an Ohio industry such as coated paper in Hamilton, OH, or steel \nin Lorain or aluminum in Sidney, when they petition the International \nTrade Commission for relief against unfair subsidies, they can talk \nabout--include in that petition--the charge of currency manipulation. \nThe bill sends a signal to our trading partners we are not going to sit \nthere while countries gain the unfair advantage over Americans workers \nand businesses. Before pursuing more free-trade agreements, lets focus \non enforcement and focus on addressing currency manipulation. Let's \nlevel the playing field so we can fight back and stop this terrible \nhemorrhaging of American manufacturing jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today Congressional leadership on both \nsides of the aisle is meeting with the President to try to break the \ncurrent impasse on the debt talks. As the President said in a press \nconference earlier this week: ``Right now, we've got a unique \nopportunity to do something big.'' I completely agree with that \nstatement. I am glad and pleased that, finally, after months of concern \nand months of urging, we are dealing with this impending debt crisis.\n  Time is running out. The leadership is now meeting. We will be \ngetting reports on what has come from this meeting. I was encouraged by \ninitial reports today indicating the President has agreed to address \nthe issue of entitlement spending as well as defining the amount of \nspending cuts that are necessary to put together a credible plan that \nmove our country into a better financial position.\n  I have been discussing the necessity of a comprehensive solution to \nour problem ever since day one of this session and my return to the \nSenate, and I've indicated that the current process of spending way \nbeyond our means simply cannot be maintained and sustained and that we \nhave to address it--\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nnot after 2012 but we need to address it now. So I am encouraged by the \ntalks that are now going on, and that are beginning to incorporate the \nelements of a growing consensus, if not almost total consensus, that \nexists and is necessary for this initiative to be successful, for it to \nbe deemed credible, and for it to avoid the potentially catastrophic \nconsequences of defaulting on our debt and losing our credibility as \nthe place to invest your money for the best safety you can get.\n\n  I don't have to go through the math again, but I will just briefly. \nSpending $3.7 trillion a year when you are only taking in $2.2 trillion \na year is unsustainable and is driving us toward the cliff of \nbankruptcy--an inability to pay our debts. A big driver of that and the \nbiggest driver of that debt is clearly the mandatory spending that \ncomes with entitlements.\n  It is no secret that we have seen the baby boom generation move \nthrough the economy from birth now to retirement. The programs that \nwere put in place and the promises that were made in terms of benefits \nto those beneficiaries are not going to be available if we don't \naddress the pending bankruptcy of these programs. Those who have \nanalyzed this have basically said: Look, you have to do something now \nto keep these programs from going broke in the future.\n  So all of those who say, don't touch my Medicare, don't touch my \nSocial Security, don't do anything, they are essentially saying we are \nwilling to ride it out for 2 or 3 more years and then see the whole \nthing collapse. Then there are those of us who are saying, let's do \nsomething sensible and rational now--not taking away any benefits from \ncurrent beneficiaries, by the way, but doing something to preserve \nthese programs in the future is absolutely essential. We are trying to \nsave Social Security, we are trying to save Medicare, and we are trying \nto do the kinds of things that are necessary with our mandatory \nspending to address the total imbalance in place that is driving these \nprograms into insolvency.\n  I would hope today that what we hear back from this meeting at the \nWhite House is a commitment to go forward with a comprehensive approach \nincluding necessary cuts, the elimination of duplications of programs, \nredundancies, fraud and abuse--things we simply cannot afford anymore--\ncombined with addressing mandatory spending and entitlements in a \nresponsible way, and the mandatory spending, putting the right \nenforcement mechanisms in place so we don't renege on our commitments, \nand also incorporating comprehensive tax reform.\n  For months, the focus has been on cutting spending and tax increases. \nI think another growing consensus is that without comprehensive tax \nreform, we are not going to be able to address and solve this problem. \nI believe the administration has also begun to recognize this and \nacknowledge that comprehensive tax reform is necessary.\n  Yesterday, Senator Wyden and I sent a letter to President Obama and \nto the congressional leaders who are participating in today's debt \nceiling talks urging them to include a timeline for comprehensive tax \nreform.\n  The bill Senator Wyden and former Senator Gregg put together after 2 \npainstaking years of negotiations--which I have joined now in Senator \nGregg's place after he retired from the Senate, after we made some \nmodifications to the original bill--is a bipartisan effort to deal with \ncomprehensive tax reform. We need to go after the 10,000 special breaks \nand interests and credits and exceptions that exist and take the \nsavings from that to lower rates and make the private sector more \ncompetitive, which we know will bring about growth and ultimately jobs \nfor the American people.\n  The President's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform found \nthat resolving the Nation's debt crisis demands comprehensive, \nstructural change, including, they said, tax reform. There is no better \nway to raise revenue and reduce the deficit than by growing the economy \nand putting Americans back to work. If done right, tax reform will \ncreate those good-paying jobs and provide businesses and families with \nthe certainty they need to plan for the future.\n  Any revenues raised by closing tax loopholes should be part of a \ncomprehensive plan that reduces tax rates for American families and \nbusinesses and creates jobs. I want to repeat that. The whole purpose \nof this is to take those special interests and exemptions that have \nbeen incorporated into the Tax Code over a 15-, 20-year period of time, \nwhich now total 10,000 special exemptions, to take a selective portion \nof that and a significant portion of that and eliminate or reduce those \nto gain the revenues, allowing us to reduce tax rates on American \nfamilies and on American businesses so that those businesses can be \nmore competitive and those families will have more discretionary \nspending.\n  Our businesses currently rank 35 out of 36 in terms of the highest \ncorporate tax rates imposed--some of the highest in the world. We \ncompete around the world with those countries that are producing the \nsame products, yet their tax rates are significantly lower than ours, \nand that puts us at a competitive disadvantage. We can make the best \nproducts in the world and we can outsell anybody in the world if we put \nour companies and our businesses on a level playing field. The whole \nstructure and purpose behind the Wyden-Coats tax reform bill is to do \njust that--to put us on a competitive basis with our competitors by \nlowering rates and gaining the revenue to pay for our debt.\n  We know this won't be easy, and we know it requires Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together to take on the special interests that \ncurrently benefit from the broken tax system. We know that right now \nthat seems very difficult and very challenging, but it has been done \nbefore. We had tax reform in 1986 that stimulated the economy in ways \nno stimulus had ever done before. It brought in significant additional \nrevenues to the Treasury and put Americans back to work.\n  This is a bipartisan bill--a Democrat from Oregon and a Republican \nfrom Indiana--have joined forces on this. We want to signal that this \nis something that can be done aside from political gotchas, aside from \npolitical gain for the 2012 election, and something we can work \ntogether on that will make a commitment to a substantial portion of the \nnecessary action that needs to be taking place to deal with this \npending debt crisis and deficit crisis that has to be resolved by \nAugust 2 or close to that. Some say it can't be done in the time that \nis left. Well, we are in extraordinary times, and I think we have to \nset aside the conventional thinking and work toward what can and must \nbe done.\n  To the extent it can't be fully incorporated into the law, at the \nvery least, I believe the package we are ultimately going to be voting \non needs a rock-hard, firm commitment and instructions to the tax-\nwriting committees that this must be done and presented to the Congress \nin this session so we can address it and so we eliminate the \nuncertainty on whether we are going to go forward. It needs an \nenforcement backup mechanism so that if Congress doesn't act in a \ntimely manner, there will be an automatic process in place that \npresents this to us for a vote.\n  We have a unique opportunity to do something big, to quote the \nPresident again. I commend him for saying that, and I commend him for \ncoming forward and saying we will get off this cut-only, tax-only \nstalemate by beginning to address this on a comprehensive basis and put \nin place those elements we all know are necessary to achieve success. \nIt will require the House and the Senate and the White House to cast \naside political posturing in the 2012 elections, to transcend the \npolitics, to do what is necessary for the future of America, for the \nfuture of Americans, to do what is necessary to get our finances and \nour economy moving again and to get people back to work. We need to \ntranscend that and do what is right for the future of our country.\n  I hope we have taken a positive step in that direction today. I look \nforward to participating, as I know all of us do, in that process and \nhopefully assuring the American people and assuring the world that \nAmerica is not at a stalemate, that America can address a challenge--a \nbig challenge--and we can come forward with a sensible solution that \nputs us on the path to prosperity and guarantees a better future for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I understand we are debating a \nspecific resolution. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nNASA's STS-135 mission. As the Presiding Officer knows, at \napproximately 11:30 a.m. tomorrow, Space Shuttle Atlantis is scheduled \nto lift off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with a crew of \nfour on board. The 12-day mission will deliver supplies, logistics, and \nspare parts to the International Space Station. This will be the final \nmission of the space shuttle era that began just over 30 years ago.\n  A Senator from Colorado may not seem like the most likely person to \ncome to the floor today to speak about the space shuttle, but NASA and \nspace exploration actually have quite a bit to do with Colorado, and it \nis something I care deeply about.\n  Colorado has one of the three top aerospace economies in the country, \nwith a hand in every aspect of space--government, commercial and \nacademic, civil and military. We helped develop the space shuttle and \nmany of the missions that flew on it, and we are playing a major role \nin the development of the shuttle's successors.\n  NASA has been a source of pride for all Americans from its very \nbeginnings. We have cheered their triumphs and suffered with them \nduring their tragedies. All the while, we have been inspired by their \nmission of exploration.\n  The shuttle era is no exception. Ever since the first launch in April \nof 1981, the names of the space shuttles--the Columbia, Challenger, \nDiscovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour--have become familiar to even casual \nobservers. This is a testament to the vehicle itself and those behind \nit.\n  I would like to acknowledge all of those who have flown on the \nshuttle, the thousands of unseen heroes at NASA who support them, and \nthe contractors at too many companies to name who make it all possible. \nFlying the shuttle is a true team effort. Everyone who has been a part \nof that team should be proud of what they have accomplished.\n  I see my colleague from Florida across the Chamber, and I know he is \nalso very aware that this has been a team effort across the board.\n  I know I would be remiss at this point if I didn't mention those who \npaid the ultimate price for their service. We will never forget the \nimages of the horrible tragedies that befell the shuttle, one occurring \nmerely seconds after leaving the pull of Earth's gravity, the other \njust minutes away from being home again. We will always remember the \ncrews of the Space Shuttles Challenger and Columbia.\n  This milestone in the history of space flight forces us to reflect on \nwhat we have learned and where we are going. America is now in the \nunenviable position of having no U.S.-derived means of sending humans \ninto space, including to vital assets like the International Space \nStation. For the near future, we will have to rely on our international \npartners, namely Russia. But that position will change. It must change, \nI would add. NASA is developing a successor to the shuttle based on \nimportant work done during the Constellation Program, and the \nburgeoning commercial sector is literally changing the way we access \nspace as we speak. These complementary development tracks will build a \nmore robust space exploration enterprise.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I have an interest in climbing \nmountains, as does he, and I have had the great good fortune to stand \non the top of some of the world's highest mountains. I believe it is in \nour nature as humans to explore and understand the world around us, to \nkeep stretching to achieve goals just beyond our grasp.\n  The shuttle has allowed us to reach farther than many ever dreamed \npossible. But the end of the shuttle era is by no means the end of \nexploration. At its heart, NASA is not about parts, it is about people. \nEven after the shuttle assumes its rightful place in history, legions \nof engineers, scientists, pilots, and other adventurers will carry its \nmission forward into the next phase of exploration. Keeping that spirit \nintact will be a fitting tribute to the space shuttle.\n  I wish the crew of STS-135 a smooth and productive journey and, above \nall, a safe return.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to add an additional note. In \nColorado, of course, we have 54 mountains that are over 14,000 feet. We \nhave countless peaks below that lofty elevation. But among the 100 \nhighest peaks in Colorado, we have Columbia Point, which is named to \ncommemorate the astronauts and the mission that ended tragically. We \nalso have Challenger Point. Both peaks are in the top 100, both peaks \nare linked by a high ridge, and in the middle of that high ridge is Kit \nCarson Peak which is a 14,000-foot mountain. I have had the good \nfortune to stand on the summit of both of those peaks, most recently \nColumbia Peak in April, and the view is one that is worthy of us as \nAmericans. As we go forward, let's remember the great successes of the \nshuttle program and build on them as we move forward as Americans \nexploring the world and exploring the universe.\n  I know my colleague from Florida shares those sentiments. I don't \nknow that he is on the floor to speak on this particular topic, but I \nlook forward to working with him, given the importance of the space \nindustry and the space mission in the great State of Florida.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, as I pick up where he left off on the space \nprogram.\n  Thirty years ago, the United States launched the first space shuttle \nmission from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n  It marked a new era of American leadership in space and showed, once \nagain, that Americans would continue to be committed to being first in \nspace and on the cutting edge of scientific progress to improve our \nlives.\n  It also showed what free people--committed to discovery, to \ninnovation, to improving the lives of their fellow man--can accomplish.\n  President Ronald Reagan said it best when he kicked off the space \nstation program in 1984 . . . ``We are first; we are the best; and we \nare so because we're free.''\n  Over these 30 years, we have been witness to many heroic triumphs in \nspace that have served as a testament to America's unparalleled \ningenuity and imagination.\n  Over time, the shuttle program would make household names out of \nsome. Sally Ride became the first American woman to travel into space. \nOne shuttle alum even serves with us in the Senate today--our \ncolleague, Bill Nelson.\n  Of course, space exploration has always entailed risk-taking. It has \nalways required putting one's life on the line. And because of this, \nthe space shuttle program's history also gave us moments of great pain \nas we lost Christa McAuliffe and the Challenger crew in 1986, and the \nColumbia crew in 2003.\n  Each time these tragedies forced us to ask ourselves: Is space \nexploration worth it?\n  And thank God, time and time again, America answered with an \nemphatic: Yes.\n  Today, on this eve of the final space shuttle launch, we celebrate \nthe shuttle program's remarkable feats, which exhibited many of the \nqualities that make America exceptional--courage, ingenuity, risk-\ntaking, and an ability to accomplish what once seemed unthinkable.\n  Space exploration speaks volumes about America--who we are as a \npeople and a nation.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n  When America was born 235 years ago, surely our Founding Fathers \ncould not fathom that one day our people would fly among the stars. But \nthe truth is, it has always been our destiny.\n  In the 19th century, it became our manifest destiny to explore and \npush westward until the American land stretched from sea to shining \nsea. And once we reached as far west as we could, Americans had no \nchoice but to gaze up to the sky and settle on the stars as our next \nfrontier.\n  Almost 42 years ago to the day, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike \nCollins made that giant leap for mankind and left their indelible \nfootprints on the Moon's surface and on human history. And on that \nnight in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle \nfirsthand.\n  Even today, that moment serves as a poignant reminder about the \nlimitless capacity that Americans possess in space and every aspect of \nour lives.\n  Even as we face a host of domestic and international challenges, \nAmerica possesses a remarkable capacity to meet them by setting \nambitious goals as President Kennedy did in his Moon speech, \npersevering in the face of setbacks and rising to the occasion to do \nwhat history demands of us.\n  Our space program inspired younger generations of Americans to pursue \ncareers in the aerospace industry and other related fields. Satellite \ntechnologies developed and improved by NASA now connect the world in \nunprecedented ways, support our military's reconnaissance efforts, and \nfacilitate travel through GPS devices.\n  For others, it got them hooked on math and science, and led them to \nother fields whose innovations make our lives better every day.\n  And then there were the lucky few who would actually go on to fly our \nspace shuttles.\n  For the rest of us who did not pursue careers in science, math and \nengineering, our journeys into space have meant a lot--in different \nways.\n  For many of us, Kennedy Space Center elicits memories as the place \nwhere imaginations are awakened and where dreams have been born.\n  And it is also where many children think fondly to their visits for \nfield trips or space camps, and, in my case, of the time my parents \ntook me there for my eighth birthday party before we moved to Las \nVegas.\n  But these types of feelings did not just happen in America. The \nimpact of our space program is a global phenomenon.\n  One needs to look no further than the various foreign currencies in \nthe donation box at Washington's National Air and Space Museum to \nunderstand what our space program means not only for Florida and our \ncountry but for all of humanity.\n  This brings me to my other reason for speaking today.\n  When this final shuttle mission draws to a close, many Americans will \nbe startled by the realization that we don't have an answer to the \nquestion: What is next for NASA?\n  NASA has no answer. President Obama has no answer. And as we \ntransition to the next generation of space exploration, Florida's \naerospace workers are left with only questions about their future.\n  We know that for the next few years, we will have to rely on the \nRussians to get to space.\n  Just a few weeks ago, that only cost $50 million an astronaut. Now \nthe price tag is up to $63 million per astronaut. We can only imagine \nit will go higher.\n  Whereas America once led the way to the Moon, we now face the \nunacceptable prospect of limited options to simply get a human into \norbit.\n  We know that our commercial space partners are working to fill some \nof the gap in our human spaceflight capabilities. But we need NASA to \nlead.\n  And, as I say this, I fully recognize that our Nation faces a debt \ncrisis because politicians in both parties have spent recklessly for \nmany decades. It will require Washington to finally live within its \nmeans and for leaders to make tough choices about what our Nation's \npriorities are. NASA is no exception. It will not be about spending \nmore--it will be about spending wisely.\n  Tomorrow, Americans will proudly watch as Atlantis takes off for its \nlast flight. It will be a poignant opportunity to recall the entire 30-\nyear history of the shuttle program and all that has been achieved in \n50 years of NASA's existence.\n  And it will be another opportunity to thank the thousands of men and \nwomen in Florida who have made this program possible and who take such \npride in the shuttle and what it has accomplished.\n  For NASA, just like our Nation, is at its best when it is looking \nforward, not looking back.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair what my remaining time is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In postcloture status, the Senator \nhas 53 minutes remaining. So 8 minutes of the 15 minutes is remaining.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Fifty-three sounded like too much, even for a Senator.\n  I briefly wish to use the second half of my time to talk about the \nissue of the day and that is the issue that is being discussed here in \ntown about the debt--an important issue. It is happening at a time when \nmany Americans from all across the country are traveling here on their \nvacations to show their children and their families how government \nworks--or maybe in the case of this issue, how government does not \nwork--in any event, how our Republic is trying to work its way through \nthis issue, an important one.\n  I know that a few moments ago there was a meeting at the White House \nthat concluded, and we wait with great anticipation--I see my \ncolleague, the Senator from Illinois, has arrived and perhaps he will \nupdate us here on the floor in a few moments. But we are all interested \nin this issue because it goes well beyond partisanship or party \npolitics; it is about the future of our country.\n  I think there is growing consensus on some of the outlines of what it \nwill take to solve this issue. I think it will take two things, because \nI have heard this terminology we use about a balanced approach. It will \ntake two things. First, it will take reductions in spending and it will \ntake cuts, but we cannot simply cut our way out of this process. We \nmust also grow our way out of this process.\n  My point is there is no way we can simply reduce spending enough to \nget America out of the predicament it is facing. We must also grow our \neconomy at the same time. And growing our economy leads us to the No. 1 \nissue facing our country. For America, for the government, for us here \nin Washington, the national debt is the No. 1 issue on our minds, and \nrightfully so. It is a serious issue. But for the rest of our country, \nthe No. 1 issue is joblessness. It is the fact that people are \nstruggling to find a job.\n  These people did everything that was asked of them. They went to \nschool, got a degree, worked hard, and now they have lost their job and \ntheir homes. If they did find a job, maybe they are making half as much \nand working twice as long. So we have to grow our economy. The logic \nbehind it is very straightforward. If we have more people working, we \nhave more people paying into our tax system. If we have more people \npaying into our tax system, that is more money available for our \ngovernment to pay down its debt.\n  So I want to focus on the growth aspect and what we can do to grow \nour economy and help job creators create jobs. Don't ask the \npoliticians, ask the job creators. They will tell us there are two \nthings standing in the way of job creation in America. No. 1 is a \nbroken Tax Code that is uncertain, complicated, difficult to navigate \nand, in many instances, unaffordable for them. No. 2, it is runaway \nregulations. So any deal that deals with the debt in a serious way has \nto encompass growth policies that involve, in my mind, both regulatory \nreform and tax reform. I hope that is what they are working toward--tax \nreform. Because what we need in America is not more taxes, we need more \ntaxpayers.\n  The other part of the deal, of course, is going to have to involve \nsome spending reductions. That is why I proudly stood with my \ncolleagues to point out three things we have to clearly do to bring it \nunder control. The first is we have to reduce spending this year. \nObviously, we can't solve the budget deficit and debt in 1 year, but we \nhave to begin to address it this year, so meaningful cuts this year.\n  The second thing we need to do is a spending cap that limits the \namount of money this government can spend in\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nthe future or the growth in the amount of money the government can \nspend in the future. Our government should not grow faster than our \neconomy.\n  Finally, we need some sort of balanced budget amendment.\n  To top it all off, we have to save Social Security and Medicare. I \nwas encouraged this morning to read that the President is interested in \nthis issue. It is important. It is not about balancing the budget on \nthe backs of anyone. It is about saving Social Security and Medicare so \nthat there will never have to be benefit reductions for current \nbeneficiaries, and so that these programs exist for me when I retire \nand for my children when they retire, and so they will never grow \ninsolvent.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our debt \ncrisis, our short-term debt crisis and our long-term debt crisis. I \ncome here today to discuss ways to address them and ways not to address \nthem.\n  Our most immediate debt crisis is now upon us. In order to maintain \nthe full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, Congress will have to \nvote to raise the debt ceiling within a matter of weeks. This is \nsomething Congress has done as a matter of course many times over the \nyears as our national debt has grown.\n  Let us be clear about what exactly it means to raise the debt ceiling \nand why it is necessary. As a nation, we have accumulated $14.3 \ntrillion in debt. This in and of itself is a very bad and dangerous \nthing. That means our national debt is currently 93 percent of our \ngross national product. Again, this is a very bad and dangerous thing. \nWe have been in this situation before. Actually, it has been worse. \nAfter World War II, our national debt was at 121.7 percent of our gross \nnational product. We certainly had something to show for it. We had won \nWorld War II.\n  Through the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, we worked our way to a \npoint where our national debt fell to 32.5 percent of GDP in 1981. We \ndid this through a combination of growth and some inflation. Our debt \nwas in pretty good shape until we hit the 1980s, during which we \nquadrupled our national debt under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George \nH.W. Bush.\n  We have hashed over time and again who is to blame for the situation \nwe find ourselves in. But let me leave that alone for the moment and \nget back to what it means to raise the debt ceiling. As I said, our \ndebt currently stands at $14.3 trillion. I think we can agree on this: \nThat number reflects past choices, not current ones.\n  The debt ceiling also stands at $14.3 trillion. We have to raise the \ndebt ceiling because we as a nation have certain obligations we must \nmeet. We have to pay for the wars we are currently engaged in. We have \nobligations to veterans who have served our Nation. We have obligations \nto have the dedicated men and women at FEMA who have been responding to \nthe many floods and fires our Nation has been facing.\n  We have obligations to seniors who have paid into Social Security all \ntheir working lives and have a right to expect a check every month of \ntheir retirement.\n  We have obligations under Medicare, not just to seniors, who again \nhave paid in, but to clinics and hospitals and health care providers \nand to those who supply medicine and medical equipment.\n  We have contractual obligations of all kinds to many different \nbusinesses, whether they are building roads or water towers or \nproviding IT services to the VA or the Park Service or the Senate. I \nthink almost everyone would agree it is good to have guards in our \nFederal prisons, except maybe the prisoners. The list of obligations \ngoes on and on, and one of our most fundamental obligations is to pay \nprincipal and interest to bondholders who have invested in what has \nbeen for decades and decades considered the safest investment in the \nworld: the U.S. Treasury bond.\n  Currently, we simply are not taking in enough revenues to meet all \nthese obligations, so we must borrow more. Of course, we must pay \ninterest on our debt, at an interest rate that is now actually quite \nlow.\n  The surest way to increase the interest on our debt would be to \ndefault on our debt obligations. And make no mistake, that is exactly \nwhat will happen if we fail to raise the debt ceiling. Even an increase \nin interest rates of just 1 percent would add $1.3 trillion to our \ninterest payments over the next decade. So, as you can see, defaulting \non our debt to make a point about the seriousness of our current \nposition would, to say the least, be counterproductive. Yet some of my \ncolleagues are willing to do just that, and that is irresponsible.\n  As to the notion that bondholders could be paid while other \nobligations were postponed, Scott Elmendorf, Chair of the Congressional \nBudget Office, said:\n\n       Defaulting on any government obligation is a dangerous \n     gamble.\n\n  We are not absolutely certain what exactly will happen if we default, \nbut we have a pretty good idea. We know it would roil the international \nfinancial markets, induce rating downgrades of our Treasury notes, \ncreate fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United \nStates, and force us to pay higher interest rates to induce people to \nbuy our bonds. It would damage the dollar and the special role of \nTreasury securities in global markets for decades to come--a dangerous \ngamble, one we cannot afford to take.\n  Defaulting on our debt would also be, as David Brooks so aptly put \nit, a stain upon our national honor. Are we actually going to become a \ncountry that cannot be relied on to pay its debts?\n  Yet we have Members of the House and Members of this body threatening \nto vote against raising the debt ceiling unless the President and \nDemocrats in Congress meet their demands on how to address the deficit \ngoing forward.\n  Are my friends suggesting we act like a deadbeat who buys a new car \nand then, some time down the line, decides: ``You know, I just don't \nfeel like making the payments''?\n  I think these Members are doing an enormous disservice by holding our \nNation's economy and, indeed, the entire global economy hostage to \ntheir demands. Because the U.S. Treasury bond has been the foundation \nof the world financial system, it is not an overstatement to say that \ndefaulting on our debt at this fragile point in the global economic \nrecovery could throw us into a worldwide depression.\n  I am hardly alone in this regard. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce shares \nmy alarm. It is no small secret that the Wall Street backers of the \nRepublican Party are beseeching their allies in Congress to come to \ntheir senses.\n  Yet Republican leaders know there are also those in their party who \nbelieve this is their chance. This is their opportunity to exact \nconcessions from the White House and Democrats in Congress precisely \nbecause the situation is so fraught with peril. They know the President \nof the United States cannot play a game of chicken with the full faith \nand credit of the United States of America. And in a game of chicken, \nthe irrational and irresponsible player holds a distinct strategic \nadvantage over the rational and responsible player.\n  So we find ourselves in this place at this time.\n  What are the demands?\n  Well, Republican leaders here in the Senate are holding the debt \nceiling hostage so they can end Medicare as we know it. Democrats are \ntrying to protect Medicare and ensure its solvency, and the Affordable \nCare Act is already doing that. Not only does the Affordable Care Act \nprovide more benefits to Medicare recipients, it also extends the \nsolvency of Medicare by 7 years. That is the conclusion of the most \nrecent report of the Medicare trustees.\n  Of course, the first big idea from our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle this Congress was to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they \nall voted to do that. So please understand that one of their first \nvotes this Congress would\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nhave had the effect of diminishing the solvency of Medicare, shrinking \nthe solvency of Medicare by 7 years.\n  Not only that, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nAffordable Care Act will reduce the debt over the next decade by $210 \nbillion, and over the decade following that by more than $1 trillion. \nSo rather than saving money by making our health care system stronger, \nmaking our delivery of care more efficient, and keeping our \nconstituents healthy, Republicans voted to repeal the health reform \nlaw. So the big Republican contribution to the sustainability of \nMedicare and our national debt was to vote to shorten Medicare's life \nexpectancy by 7 years and to add well over $1 trillion to the debt in \nthe next two decades.\n  There is no doubt that the biggest threat to the sustainability of \nour long-term debt is the cost of health care. That is why so much of \nthe Affordable Care Act is designed to address the cost of the delivery \nof medical care.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. First, the value index. The \nvalue index will direct that health care providers be reimbursed by the \nvalue of the care they provide rather than by the volume--the quality \nof the care rather than the quantity of care. In Minnesota, for \ninstance, we do health care a lot better than most other States. We \nprovide higher quality care at a lower cost than almost any other \nState. There is room for improvement in Minnesota, of course. As a \nhealth care economist told me: In Minnesota, we get an A, but that is \nbecause we grade on a curve.\n  In Texas, they get reimbursed 50 percent more per patient in Medicare \nthan we do in Minnesota and yet we have better outcomes.\n  Why? Well, we have a different health care culture in Minnesota. We \ntend to do more coordinated, fully integrated care. We tend to see \npatients as people who we want to keep healthy and out of the hospital. \nIn Texas, patients are more often viewed as profit centers. There are \nsome excellent, high-value centers of health care in Texas, such as \nBaylor University. Then, there are some egregiously low-value ones, \nlike some in McAllen, TX. And, by and large, Texas doctors order more \nprocedures than Minnesota doctors so they can bill for more procedures.\n  But the idea here isn't to pit Minnesota against Texas. The idea is \nto incentivize low-value States to do health care more like high-value \nStates. Imagine if we could bring down the cost of health care in Texas \nby one-third. Imagine the savings to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  One more example. Senator Lugar and I wrote a provision into the bill \ncalled the Diabetes Prevention Program. It is based on a CDC program \npiloted in Indianapolis and in St. Paul. They took folks that had been \ndiagnosed with ``prediabetes'' and gave them 16 weeks of nutritional \ntraining and 16 weeks of physical exercise at the YMCA, all at a cost \nof only about $300 per person.\n  The number of people with prediabetes who later developed full-blown \ntype 2 diabetes was reduced by almost 60 percent--60 percent! Caring \nfor chronic disease is the most expensive piece of our health care \nsystem in this country. One of the most common chronic illnesses is \ndiabetes. It costs our Nation $218 billion a year to treat diabetes.\n  A couple weeks after the Affordable Care Act passed, I brought the \nUnder Secretary of Health and Human Services into my office to meet \nwith diabetes experts from the CDC and with United Health Group, the \ncountry's largest insurance company. The goal of the meeting was to get \nHHS on board to bring the piloted Diabetes Prevention Program up to \nscale nationwide. The executive from United Health said she would \ndefinitely reimburse their policy holders for going through the 16-week \nprogram. She said, ``You know why? Because for every dollar we spend, \nwe'll save four dollars.''\n  The value index and the Diabetes Prevention Program are but two of \nthe many programs in the Affordable Care Act that have been written \ninto the law. Jonathan Gruber, the MIT professor who helped put \ntogether the health reform system in Massachusetts when Mitt Romney was \nGovernor there, has said of the Affordable Care Act, ``It's really hard \nto figure out how to bend the cost curve, but I can't think of a thing \nto try that they didn't try . . . You couldn't have done better than \nthey are doing.''\n  Since then, in the House, Representative Paul Ryan and the \nRepublicans in Congress have taken an entirely different approach. \nInstead of putting in the long, hard hours of consulting with health \ncare providers, health care economists, patient groups, hospitals, \nrural health groups, and medical researchers to actually try to build \non protocols that have been proven to bring down the cost of delivering \nquality medicine, Representative Ryan decided just to slash the funding \nof Medicare, give the money left over to seniors, and let them fend for \nthemselves to buy their own health care from insurance companies.\n  Now, we know there was no functional market for health insurance for \nfolks 65 and over before Medicare and Medicaid started in 1965. It is \ndoubtful that there would be one now. Under the Republican plan, \nseniors would essentially get a voucher for a significantly lower \namount than their Medicare is worth now. Remember that the cost to \nMedicare for administering its program is less than 2 percent. \nInsurance companies, on the other hand, spend around 11 percent on \nadministration. The CBO estimates that under the Ryan plan, out-of-\npocket cost for health care for each senior will more than double to \nover $12,500 a year.\n  This is not Medicare as we know it. It is not Medicare. So, \nunderstand this: the Republican plan to end Medicare would make huge \ncuts in Medicare benefits and put insurance companies in charge of \nseniors' health care. This would double the out-of-pocket costs for \nseniors and toss aside all the new benefits offered by the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  There is no question which vision of Medicare holds more hope for \nseniors and which takes a scientific, evidence-based, best practices \napproach to addressing the long-range cost of delivering health care to \nall Americans.\n  And yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are telling us \nthat they are willing to risk throwing the global economy into \ndepression if Democrats don't act more responsibly on Medicare.\n  Well, ok. Here is an idea. Allow Medicare to negotiate with the \npharmaceutical companies on drugs for Medicare Part D. The VA does it. \nAnd guess what. The VA pays an average of 48 percent less than Medicare \ndoes for the top 10 most prescribed drugs. Now the pharmaceutical \nindustry tells us they need us to pay the higher price because they \nneed the money for research. But, in fact, they spend more money on \nadvertising and marketing than they do on research.\n  Almost every other developed country uses its size to negotiate with \nthe pharmaceutical companies. Why does the American taxpayer have to be \nthe chump who pays full price? I say we negotiate with the \npharmaceutical companies and bring down the cost to Medicare by as much \nas $24 billion a year, or $240 billion over the next 10 years. That \ncould go straight to paying off the debt. There. I got you a $240 \nbillion cut to Medicare. Now can we please vote to raise the debt \nceiling and avert a worldwide economic catastrophe?\n  If my friends on the other side are really serious about getting our \ndeficit under control, couldn't we start by getting rid of a measly $2 \nbillion a year in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies--the companies \nthat are getting record profits because the price of oil is so high? \nUnfortunately, according to my Republican colleagues, this would be a \ntax hike.\n  In order for us to agree to balance the budget, everyone has to pay. \nWho is in a better position to give? Exxon or a little girl in \nMinnesota named Evelyn. You see, Evelyn was born with cystic fibrosis. \nWhen she was 10, her liver failed, and her own toxins started to poison \nher. But Medicaid helped her get the care she needed. That is what this \nis about. Exxon or Evelyn. Frankly, it makes me kind of sad.\n  So there are some more billions for deficit reduction. Get rid of the \nsubsidies to the five biggest oil companies--$21 billion over the next \n10 years. And you know what? If we are seriously going to address our \ndebt crisis, we have to increase revenues.\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\n  Now under the Republican plan, the cuts to end Medicare as we know it \nand to slash Medicaid all go to pay for tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans. That's right. The Republican plan cuts taxes on the top \nmarginal rates for millionaires and billionaires from 35 percent to 25 \npercent.\n  Now my Republican friends like to say that tax cuts always produce \nrevenue increases. Besides the fact that that is simply not true, it \nalso contradicts the other argument Republicans use for not raising \ntaxes. Raising taxes, Republicans often argue, would just give the \ngovernment more money to spend. According to that oft-repeated \nRepublican argument, cutting taxes will lower revenue and ``starve the \nbeast.''\n  Here is President Ronald Reagan making this exact point in 1981:\n\n       There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can \n     lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of \n     voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance by simply \n     reducing their allowance.\n\n  In other words, cutting taxes cuts revenues and forces the children, \nin this case, the government, to cut spending.\n  So, at the heart of my friends' argument on why we must cut taxes are \ntwo completely contradictory, mutually exclusive arguments. On the one \nhand, according to my friends, lowering taxes always increases revenues \nand therefore brings down the deficit. On the other hand, they argue, \nlowering taxes decreases revenues. Which is it? Because you can't have \nit both ways.\n  I will try to provide some context for my friends. After President \nReagan cut taxes in 1981, we immediately started amassing enormous \ndeficits. They were so bad that President Reagan felt compelled to \nraise taxes in 1982 and then again in 1983. In fact, President Ronald \nReagan, the supply-side icon, raised taxes 11 times. If President \nReagan did that today, the Tea Party and, in fact, the entire \nRepublican Party would run him out of town on a rail.\n  But, you see, President Reagan knew that to raise revenue, you have \nto either raise marginal tax rates, or get rid of tax loopholes for the \nwealthy and for big corporations. Which is what he did repeatedly.\n  Even so, our national debt nearly tripled during the Reagan \nPresidency. The national debt continued to grow rapidly during the \nGeorge H. W. Bush administration. In fact, in 1993, he handed President \nBill Clinton what at that point was the largest deficit in history.\n  So what did President Clinton do? Well, in his 1993 deficit reduction \npackage, he added two new marginal tax rates at the top end--36 percent \nfor those making over $180,000 and 39.6 percent for those making over \n$250,000. Every Republican voted against the package. They said that \nraising the top marginal tax rate would cause a recession. Former \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich said:\n\n       I believe this will lead to a recession next year. This is \n     the Democrat machine's recession, and each one of them will \n     be held personally accountable.\n\n  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said:\n\n       The Clinton plan is a one-way ticket to recession. This \n     plan does not reduce the deficit. But it raises taxes and it \n     puts people out of work.\n\n  Representative John Kasich, then ranking member of the House Budget \nCommittee, said:\n\n       This plan will not work. If it was to work, I'd have to \n     become a Democrat.\n\n  Well, it worked. Not only did we have an unprecedented expansion of \nour economy for 8 years, creating more than 22 million new net jobs, \nbut we balanced the budget and Bill Clinton handed George W. Bush a \nrecord surplus. I call that ``working.''\n  Now President Clinton, and especially the Democrats in Congress, paid \na political price for the 1993 deficit reduction package. The Democrats \nwent down to defeat in 1994, losing control of the House for the first \ntime in 40 years. You could say that Democrats took a shellacking.\n  Nevertheless, between 1993 and 2001 the Nation created an \nunprecedented number of jobs benefiting every quartile of our economy, \ndecreasing the number of Americans in poverty, increasing median \nincome, and creating more millionaires than ever--to which my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle might say, ``Sure, it worked \nin practice. But does it work in theory?''\n  President Clinton's deficit reduction plan not only reduced the \ndeficit as planned, it eliminated it entirely and gave incoming \nPresident George W. Bush a record surplus. In fact, when President Bush \ntook office, we were on track to completely pay off our national debt \nwith $5 trillion of surpluses projected over the next 10 years. In \nother words, we would have zeroed out our national debt this year.\n  Five days after President Bush took office--again, after President \nBush took office--Alan Greenspan testified to the Senate Budget \nCommittee that we were in danger of paying off the national debt too \nquickly and entering uncharted territory in which the Federal \nGovernment would have too much money. The Federal Government, Greenspan \nwarned, would have to put its excess money into private equities, \nthereby distorting and decreasing the efficiency of our markets.\n  President Bush told the country that a surplus meant that Americans \nwere paying too much in taxes. This was our money, he told us, and so \nwe all deserved a tax cut. Then after the economy went into recession, \nBush told us that what we needed was another tax cut to stimulate the \neconomy. So, in other words, ``when the economy is going strong, tax \ncuts are in order.'' And ``when the economy is weak, tax cuts are in \norder.'' Combine those with the aforementioned contradictory ``tax cuts \nreduce revenues forcing government to spend less of our money'' and \n``tax cuts always increase revenues'' and you have an exquisitely \nincomprehensible economic theory.\n  But that exquisitely incomprehensible theory needed just one more \nelement to make it downright dangerous. And that element would be \nprovided by Vice President Richard Cheney.\n  By late 2002, the surplus President George W. Bush had inherited from \nBill Clinton was turning once again into huge deficits. According to \nthen-Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, he tried to warn Vice President \nCheney that budget deficits were growing at an alarming rate, posing a \nthreat to the economy. Vice President Cheney cut O'Neill off, saying, \n``You know, Paul, Reagan proved deficits don't matter.''\n  By the end of his Presidency, George W. Bush left President Obama a \nbudget deficit projected at $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2009. \nMeanwhile, President Bush had doubled our national debt.\n  What was to blame? Could it have had anything to do with the fact \nthat for the first time in history we cut taxes while we were at war?\n  Well, not according to the Republican leader. In July of last year \nSenator McConnell said: ``There's no evidence whatsoever that the Bush \ntax cuts actually diminished revenue.''\n  But adjusting for inflation, since the Bush tax cuts were enacted, \nrevenues have fallen 17 percent. And that is not even taking into \naccount growth in our population, which was 9 percent over this period. \nWhen you add the effect of population growth, revenues declined by \nabout 24 percent per capita. I think this clearly constitutes evidence \nthat the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue.\n  So it should be no surprise that reduced revenues are responsible for \na lot of our deficit, as you can see here. This chart by the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities is based on CBO data and shows that the \nBush tax cuts were responsible for 25 percent of the deficit in 2010. \nAnd that is only going to grow. By 2019, the tax cuts will account for \nalmost 60 percent of our deficit.\n  And the fact is that not only did the national debt double during the \nBush administration, we also had a dismal record of job creation. And \nduring the Bush years, for the first time since we started keeping \nrecords, median income fell in America. And more Americans fell into \npoverty. One in five children in America now lives in poverty. It is \neven higher in rural America.\n  There is one group that did very well during the Bush years, and \ncontinues to do very well: The extremely wealthy.\n  We now have in this country the greatest disparity in income and \nwealth that we have had since the 1920s.\n  So the one thing that there is no evidence whatsoever of is that \ncutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans can\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\ncreate jobs and keep the deficit under control.\n  So why would we do it, when the evidence is so stark that the Bush \ntax cuts coincided with a huge spike in both the debt and unemployment?\n  Why not look back on what has worked in the past and learn from it?\n  As I said earlier, after World War II our debt as a percentage of GDP \nwas, in fact, significantly larger than it is today. But what did we \ndo? Well, we passed the G.I. bill so that our troops returning from the \nwar could go to college.\n  Truman started the Marshall plan to help Europe get on its feet.\n  And it is not as if we had smooth sailing as far as Defense spending. \nWe went to war in Korea, losing nearly 35,000 Americans. After that war \nended, we found ourselves in an extended Cold War. We built the largest \ninfrastructure project in our history, the Interstate Highway System--\nit added enormously to our economic development, because now we could \ntransport our goods around the country so much more efficiently.\n  When the Soviets launched Sputnik into space, we jump-started our \nspace program and our investment in science and math education. My \nbrother and I were Sputnik kids. He was 11 and I was 6 when it was \nlaunched. My parents took us into our living room in Minnesota and told \nus that we had to study math and science in order to beat the Soviets. \nI thought that was a big burden to place on an 11-year-old and a 6-\nyear-old. But we were obedient sons, and so we studied math and \nscience. And wouldn't you know it, my parents were right. We beat the \nSoviets.\n  The space program created all kinds of dividends in technology and to \nour economic development. I watched a Senate debate last fall in which \nthe Republican candidate said that government had never created a job. \nThe debate, of course, was broadcast by satellite.\n  I think you get the idea. The fact is the investments we made in the \n1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in science and technology, in our State \nuniversities, in infrastructure that was the envy of the world brought \nour debt as a percentage of GDP from 121 percent in 1945 to 33 percent \nin 1980.\n  Erskine Bowles is right. We can't get out of our current debt crisis \nwith growth alone. But I will tell you most certainly that we will not \nget out of it without growth.\n  And so we have to choose wisely in what we invest in, in when we \ninvest, and in how we invest; and in what we cut, and when we cut, and \nhow we cut--which we must do--and in how we increase revenues, when we \nincrease revenues, and from whom we get those revenues.\n  Why not invest in retrofitting our buildings when we have so many in \nthe building trades out of work, sitting on the sidelines, and knowing \nthat we can recoup that investment in energy savings within 3 to 5 \nyears? Let's find creative ways of financing that, such as PACE \nfinancing, which lets families get a loan from their local government \nand pay it back on their property taxes. This is how cities pay for \nstreetlights and sidewalks. It adds value to homes; and when the family \nmoves, the loan stays with the property. We should also create \nincentives for banks to lend to small businesses for retrofitting \ncommercial buildings.\n  There is a company in Minnesota called McQuay that makes heating and \nair conditioning systems for commercial buildings. They are actually \nsupplying the system for the new World Trade Center, and their systems \nare so energy efficient that they pay for themselves in 3 to 5 years \nthrough energy savings.\n  They have been taking out loans from banks since they are a large \ncreditworthy company, but then they give out loans to customers who \ninstall their systems. It is a win-win, because they are selling more \nunits and putting people back to work, and their customers are actually \nmaking money in the long run through energy savings. McQuay has a good \nmodel, and we should be figuring out how to encourage others to do the \nsame thing.\n  Why not cut our Defense spending when $100 billion in cuts have been \nidentified by our service chiefs at Secretary Gates' request, and when \ncost overruns on our weapons systems are absurdly high? The GAO \nrecently revealed that when you add up the growth in costs of major \nDefense weapons systems over their original estimates, the total is \nover $402 billion.\n  Why not raise revenue by increasing taxes on the wealthiest in this \nNation--those who have benefited the most from the economy in recent \nyears--especially when we can look to the recent past and see that \ntheir tax cuts created virtually no jobs and contributed mightily to \nour deficit?\n  Only when the middle class is strong does our economy grow, because \nthe middle class has always been the part of our society that creates \ndemand. There are just not enough rich people to buy enough stuff. The \nmiddle class spends its money. But today, companies are sitting on \ntrillions of dollars because there is just not enough demand. And that \nis because there is a lot of unemployment and because wages for the \nmiddle class have gone down over the last decade.\n  Creating a middle class is not an end unto itself. A strong middle \nclass leads to strong consumer spending, and therefore to a strong \neconomy and to national prosperity. The middle class is also where you \nget entrepreneurs and small businesses--it is the engine of our \neconomy.\n  Why not invest in early childhood education when we know that the \nreturn on quality early childhood education is up to $16 for every $1 \nspent? We know that children who have had quality early childhood \neducation are less likely to need special education, less likely to \nrepeat grades, they have better health outcomes, and that the girls are \nless likely to get pregnant as teenagers. We know children who have \nquality early childhood education are more likely to graduate from high \nschool, more likely to go to college, more likely to get a good job and \npay taxes, and much less likely to go to prison.\n  My friends on the other side say that we must cut the deficit for our \nchildren's sake, and I agree. But why then are such a disproportionate \namount of the cuts aimed at programs that help kids? As I said, one of \nevery five children in America lives in poverty, and even more in rural \nareas.\n  But the Republicans want to cut Head Start and Early Head Start. We \ncurrently serve about 40 percent of children who qualify for Head Start \nand less than 4 percent of children who qualify for Early Head Start. \nDo we really want to cut that? Do we really want to cut Pell grants? \nThe Republican budget slashes Medicaid. About 50 percent of the \nrecipients of Medicaid are children. We know we are going to have to \nmake shared sacrifices to get the budget under control, but do we \nreally think that sick kids should make those sacrifices?\n  You know, immediately after this last election, Republican leadership \nsaid that their No. 1 priority was seeing to it that Barack Obama is a \none-term President. They didn't say their No. 1 priority was getting \nAmericans back to work, or educating our kids, or even balancing the \nbudget.\n  Their No. 1 priority was winning the next election. But I don't think \nthat is what Americans want. The American people want us to get to work \nto solve problems, to improve their lives. We don't have to agree on \nhow to do that but they sent us here to work together. If the time \nbetween elections just becomes about jockeying for the next election, \nthen what in the world is the point of getting elected in the first \nplace? I thought we were here to work together constructively in the \ninterest of the American people.\n  Now the Senate Republican leader is saying that raising any new \nrevenues is off the table; that he will not vote to raise the debt \nceiling if part of our compromise on the budget going forward involves \nany tax increase on anyone, no matter how wealthy they are, no matter \nwhat their income.\n  I ask all my colleagues, for the good of the country, to step back \nfrom the brink, to step back from brinksmanship on this debt ceiling. \nLet's not panic. We are going to be on this planet for a while. Let's \nhave some confidence in ourselves to do this in a smart thoughtful way \nso that our children will say, ``Well, they might not have been the \nGreatest Generation, but they were a Pretty Good Generation.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kirk and I speak in \nsuccession for up to 15 minutes and that the Democratic side then have \ntwo speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                        AHMED ABDULKADIR WARSAME\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, we have just learned that Ahmed Abdulkadir \nWarsame was arrested by the U.S. military in April. This news has just \ncome to us, learning that this man who fought for no country and wore \nno uniform and under an international law is considered an enemy \ncombatant and therefore not a prisoner of war or an American civilian \ncriminal, has been taken to a U.S. criminal court to be granted full \nU.S. constitutional rights in a prosecution in the civilian courts of \nthe United States, located in the Southern District of New York.\n  This man was taken outside American territory for attacks outside \nU.S. jurisdiction for acts against non-U.S. citizens. Yet he has been \ncharged with a U.S. civilian crime and has been given the full rights \nof an American citizen or a nationalized individual. I think we have \nmade a grievous mistake.\n  We have made a significant change just this week. We have violated \nthe principles set forth by President Lincoln and President Roosevelt, \nwho well used military commissions to handle enemy combatants and not \nproviding them full U.S. constitutional rights for actions taken \noutside the United States against non-U.S. citizens in the war on \nterror.\n  I am very worried this foreign terrorist, who was taken abroad for \nattacks committed abroad, is now going to have the full constitutional \nright to confront his accuser and have all information used in his \ntrial exposed. This means that, under the new policy, the United States \nmay be forced to reveal intelligence information critical in the war on \nterror, especially against al Qaida, al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, \nand Al-Shabaab, when otherwise a military commission could have kept \nthat information confidential, leading to further success by the United \nStates.\n  We should ask at what cost this prosecution will come. The previous \nproposal by the President, which he backed away from, was to bring the \nauthor of the 9/11 attack, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, to central New York, \nat a cost of an estimated $75 million to protect the court, the judge, \nthe prosecutor, the jury, and their families. The President backed away \nfrom that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed decision, but apparently he has now \nmade that decision again with regard to Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame.\n  My question is this: What threat is now being posed to the people of \nNew York? What threat is being posed to the Federal judge? What will \nthe prosecutor fear for the rest of his or her life in participating in \nthis unnecessary civilian prosecution--and especially for the jurors \nand their families who now will be subject to scrutiny throughout the \njihadist world by al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and Al-Shabaab. Why \nis this unnecessary threat now going to be posed to these Americans?\n  That is why 39 Republicans and Democrats joined me in a letter to \nAttorney General Eric Holder, saying this decision was a mistake and \nshould not be repeated; that we have now created undue attention to the \npeople of New York by al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaida \nitself, and Al-Shabaab.\n  Remember, following our successful attack against bin Laden, we now \nestimate that al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and Al-Shabaab are the \nmost dangerous and heavily armed subsidiaries of al Qaida. Al-Shabaab \nalone has over 8,000 men under training and, as one intelligence expert \nsaid, some of them at the level of training equivalent to the U.S. Army \nRangers.\n  How are we going to protect the judge in this case for the rest of \nhis or her life? How are we going to protect the prosecutor for the \nrest of his or her life? How are we going to protect the jury and their \nfamilies for the rest of their lives because of this mistake made by \nthe Attorney General of the United States?\n  At what cost will this prosecution come? Will it be paid by the city \nof New York, already heavily strained in finances, a New York State \nfamously short of funds, or the Federal Government, which is also short \nof money?\n  What happens if Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame is found innocent? We \nalready know many released terrorists have already returned to jihad, \nas he proudly indicates he surely will.\n  In the wake of the debate on deficits and debt on a famous criminal \ntrial in New York, we may have overlooked a fundamental decision, a \nmistake made by the Attorney General of the United States. The 9/11 \nCommission taught us a critical lesson, that terrorism is not a law \nenforcement problem; it is an intelligence and military problem. Well-\nestablished principles under Roosevelt, Lincoln, Bush, and, yes, \nPresident Obama, using military commissions, should be used instead of \nsubjecting the American people to the increased threats, the increased \ncosts, and the terrible precedent we have just set in giving an \ninternational terrorist, for acts committed overseas against \nforeigners, full constitutional rights. I think it is a decision we \nwill regret. Many of us may quote the 9/11 Commission report in its \nclear findings in highlighting the error that was made.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again to urge all of us, Democrats \nand Republicans, to come together and put serious deficit reduction \nproposals on the floor for full debate, an open amendment process, a \nconstructive debate and votes and action. That is the way we can move \nforward and resolve this greatest threat we face as a country, out-of-\ncontrol Washington spending and debt.\n  We are making a little bit of progress in that regard. After months \nand months of the distinguished majority leader putting every other \nissue under the Sun on the floor but spending and debt, we finally \nforced this central issue to come and be debated.\n  Last week, many of us banded together, conservatives who were pushing \nfor this debate, and said: Enough is enough. We should cancel the July \n4 recess, we should block it so we stay and debate the central issue. \nThat is what we did, and we successfully did that. Unfortunately, the \nmajority leader then proposed that we stay here--yes, because we had \nblocked the recess--but did not put the central issue on the floor and \nmoved yet another topic. We said: No; we are staying to get to this \ndebate, this important issue, the greatest challenge we face right now \nas a country, and we successfully defeated his move to another topic.\n  Finally, with this little bit of progress, we are on the floor at \nleast talking about the right issue. But we don't yet have a strong, \nmeaningful, underlying proposal to act on. We have a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. That is a good basis for debate, I suppose. But, of \ncourse, we need more than that. We need serious proposals to debate and \namend and vote on and act on. That is the important next step.\n  When I made these remarks yesterday, the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, Senator Schumer, was in the Chamber and suggested that \nRepublicans, including myself, had not gotten behind a serious, \ncredible proposal. Specifically, he said: Wait a minute. The Ryan \nbudget, which you voted for, doesn't reduce the deficit at all. I said \nat the time that is incorrect, but I didn't have the numbers in front \nof me. In fact, I looked it up, and the Ryan budget does significantly \nreduce the deficit from $1.4 trillion this year to $391 billion at the \nend of 10 years. That is a major reduction.\n  As I said to the Senator from New York at the time, my preference \neven ahead of that is the Toomey budget, which we produced on the \nRepublican side in the Senate. That reduces the deficit from $1.4 \ntrillion right now to zero over 10 years. It balances the budget over \n10 years--obviously, major progress.\n  Again, going back to the Ryan budget, which Senator Schumer brought \nup, it contains $6.2 trillion in spending reductions compared to \nspending in President Obama's budget. It adds\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\ntotal deficits that are $4.4 trillion lower than that in the \nPresident's budget. It brings total Federal spending to below 20 \npercent of the economy. The President's budget is always above 23 \npercent in that figure. So it puts us on a path to balance. Again, the \nToomey budget, my first choice, actually achieves that balance within \nthe 10-year budget window.\n  In contrast to that, I have to say it is very unsettling that the \ndistinguished majority leader and the majority in this Chamber have not \neven tried to meet our mandated budget responsibilities. Section 300 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which is the Federal law that \ncontrols the budget process, says that by April 15 of every year, a \nbudget resolution is supposed to be passed. We are 83 days and counting \npast that deadline and no serious attempt to even try to meet that \nlegal mandate has been made by the majority or by the distinguished \nmajority leader. We have had a few budget votes, three Republican \nbudget proposals, and President Obama's budget. The Obama budget got \nzero votes on the Senate floor. The majority, the majority leader \nproduced no budget proposal. The Finance Committee, led by the \nmajority, produced no budget proposal, not even trying to meet our \nresponsibility, an actual legal mandate under the law.\n  Through the Chair, I would ask Senator Schumer: Where is your \nproposal? Where is your attempt? Yes, we have put forth specific \nproposals that dramatically cut the deficit. When is the majority going \nto even try? Again, 83 days and counting this year past that deadline. \nOf course, last year this body, under the same leadership, produced no \nbudget. So we are 448 days and counting in total under the Budget Act. \nIn that time, by the way, our debt has increased $3.2 trillion.\n\n  That is why we need serious proposals on this Senate floor to debate, \nto amend if necessary, to vote on, to act on. At least we are to the \ntopic, but we need serious proposals before us to act on.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues to embrace a three-tier approach, \ncut and cap and balance: passing a budget resolution which we are \nmandated to do that includes immediate meaningful real cuts--that is \ncut; cap, structural budget reform to cap spending in every major \ncategory of the budget to ensure we stay on that path to a balanced \nbudget; and balance, a requirement in the U.S. Constitution that we \nhave a balanced Federal budget through the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. I support that. All Republicans in this body have \ncoauthored that. That is the third crucial tier of this three-tier \napproach: cut, cap, and balance.\n  I hope we get to consideration of those and other important \nproposals. I hope we not only have a debate around a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, I hope we have real meaningful proposals on the \nfloor, an open amendment process, an open debate and votes and action \non this most critical issue. I have endorsed specific proposals. I \nmentioned two of them. They dramatically reduce the deficit. I have \ncoauthored the balanced budget constitutional amendment that enforces \ndiscipline, the straitjacket we need. I support the cap concept for the \nmedium term to get us on that path. But we need to act on that on the \nfloor in a bipartisan way. I urge that as the next necessary step.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I thank my good friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Franken, for leading this debate here \ntoday, the subject of course being the potential of default by the U.S. \nGovernment, a subject many of us thought we would never have to \ndiscuss. I hope people who did not get a chance to see his speech--I am \nsorry, I had hoped to be here but we had the final vote on the free \ntrade agreements in the Finance Committee, but I hope people will look \nat the speech. It is a very erudite, thoughtful, and compelling \ndocument. It is on a subject that deserves that kind of attention, \nwhich is the danger of default. In our entire history we have never \ndefaulted on our debt. America has always kept its promises. But some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are threatening to make \nus the first generation of Americans that does not pay its debts, that \ndoes not keep its promise. Earlier this week the President said we \nshould reach a deal within 2 weeks in order to avoid roiling the \nfinancial markets. We Democrats are working in good faith. We are \ncommitted to making sure our Nation does not fail in meeting its \nobligations. My colleagues and I on this side of the aisle are working \ndiligently to find spending cuts, many of which come from programs we \nstrongly believe help this country, in order to come to a final \nagreement. We are also identifying tax loopholes to close.\n  But I must ask, what exactly are my Republican colleagues doing? They \nare stalling, they are demagoging. They walked out on bipartisan budget \nnegotiations and are continuing to insist that we cannot raise a single \ndollar in revenue, no matter how wasteful the tax breaks or how \ngenerous the subsidy. The shocking truth is that our Republican \ncolleagues seem to be willing to tank the economy simply to help out \nthe very most privileged, who are already doing well.\n  Let's face it, middle-class people, poor people, depend on government \nprograms. But if you are wealthy you do not need government spending. \nYou don't need help to send your kid to college. You don't need to go \nto a clinic to have your teeth looked at in case they are falling apart \nand you cannot afford high-priced, fancy dentists. But if you are \nwealthy, how do you get breaks? You look into the Tax Code and lobby \nCongress, whether you are a corporation or individual, to get those \nbreaks. That is how the high-end folks benefit, in terms of this \ngovernment.\n  To say all those are off limits is not class warfare, it is a simple \nfact of life. It is a fact of life that the well-to-do, whether they be \ncorporate or individuals, benefit from tax expenditures, whereas \nmiddle-class and poorer people benefit from spending expenditures. Yet \nour Republican colleagues say one whole side is off limits. That is \nputting politics over the economy.\n  In fact, these actions seem to indicate they might be deliberately \ntanking, or want to deliberately tank, the economy to harm the \nPresident's reelection chances. That is a tough thought. I shudder to \nbelieve it. But when you look at the evidence, it leads in that \ndirection.\n  These are not actions of leaders. Forcing the United States into \ndefault to score political points is playing with fire. You risk \nundermining the future credit of the United States and do enough damage \nto the global economy that it could cause another financial crisis not \nunlike the one we saw in 2008 from which we still have not recovered, \nall to score political points, all to help those, the one segment of \nsociety which, God bless them, has done very well in the last decade.\n  I also want to talk today about a subject that is often ignored in \ndebates over the debt ceiling. These debates can seem very abstract and \nthe potential consequences very remote. That is why my colleague from \nMinnesota decided to lead a debate in this regard. In fact, the \nconsequences would affect every American who wants to take out a \nmortgage; every parent who needs to take out student loans to send \ntheir kids to college; every American with a credit card. It would even \naffect the price of gasoline and the price of food. The impact of a \ndefault will not just be felt on Wall Street or in the mythical world \nof bond markets, but in every town, every household in the Nation.\n  The consequences will not be short lived. The repercussions of a \ndefault will stay with us for years or even decades. J.P. Morgan \nestimates that even a technical default, the failure to pay interest on \nour debt for a few days, would result in the cost of U.S. treasuries \nincreasing by 50 basis points.\n  What does that mean to the average household? Most households do not \nspeak in terms of basis points. Mortgage rates are often set at 150 \npoints above U.S. Treasury. That means 1.5 percent above U.S. \ntreasuries. If the rate on treasuries goes up 50 basis points, it goes \nup another half percent. So the cost of a mortgage for a family with a \n30-year fixed rate mortgage\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nworth $172,000, just that alone, that little few days where the United \nStates does not pay its debt, costs $19,000 to that family.\n  The cost of interest on a credit card would also increase. A family \ncarrying a modest balance, $3,300, would pay an estimated $250 more in \ninterest every year.\n  In total, a default or even a near default could end up costing \nAmerican households $10 billion in increased borrowing costs every \nyear.\n  The same J.P. Morgan study tells us that a 50-percent increase in the \ncost of U.S. treasuries will decrease our GDP by 1 percent. Leading \neconomists estimate a 1-percent contraction in the GDP would result in \n640,000 jobs lost. These are jobs we cannot afford to lose.\n  In addition, the stock market would also go down significantly, \ncosting all Americans who are investing for their retirement or saving \nto send a child to college. The typical American would lose $8,000 to \n$12,000 in his or her retirement account.\n  J.P. Morgan also estimates that the value of the dollar would decline \n5 percent to 10 percent as a result of a default.\n  There are significant consequences for the future of the dollar if \nthis happens. We should all be asking ourselves, what happens if the \ndollar ceases to be the global reserve currency? But even if my \ncolleagues across the aisle do not want to consider that, they should \ncertainly think about the impact of a depreciated dollar on their \nconstituents. Higher borrowing costs to the government would also \nincrease the deficit, exactly the opposite of what we are trying to do.\n  So when they cavalierly say ``let's default because we have a huge \ndeficit,'' it is actually an internal contradiction. The defaulting \nwill make the deficit worse. According to a J.P. Morgan analysis, the \ndeficit would increase by $10 billion a year in the short term, $75 \nbillion in the long term.\n  The worst part is this: All of these costs would be self-inflicted \nwounds. We are fully capable of paying our debt, as we always have. But \nsome are threatening to intentionally default. To borrow a phrase from \nthe President's economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, ``This would be the \nfirst default in history caused entirely by insanity.''\n  Let me say this. Every American family has debt, just about. Most of \nus have mortgages. Let's say we have a mortgage on our house, we have a \nhouse and we are living in it. If all of a sudden we say to our bank I \nam not going to pay my mortgage unless you do A, B, and C--you have \nalready signed to pay that mortgage--what happens? You are not living \nup to an agreement you made. Your house is foreclosed upon and you lose \nit.\n  The analogy is the same here. For the U.S. Government to default on \npurpose would be cutting off our nose to spite our face, and hurt the \ncitizens of this country.\n  I say to my Republican colleague, how do you plan to explain this to \nyour constituents? Do you think they will believe the political games \nare worth the increased costs? I sincerely doubt it. I want to say to \nmy Republican colleagues, because so many of you have trifled with the \nidea of not paying our debts, if, God forbid, it happens--I hope it \ndoesn't, for the good of the country, but if it does, you will bear the \nblame. Not a single Democrat I am aware of has said we want to default. \nMany Republicans have said they want to default. So you do not have to \nbe Albert Einstein or a Ph.D. in biophysics to know who is risking \ndefault, who is trifling with default, and who would cause default if, \nGod forbid, we cannot come to an agreement.\n  Many on our side have said we are willing, if it comes to it, to \nraise the debt ceiling if we cannot come to an agreement because the \nconsequences are so horrible. Not the other side--no. They are \nleveraging the default as a means to assert their beliefs, sincerely \nheld. That is so wrong. But the good news is that the American people, \nand certainly the people who are following this issue, realize that. As \nwe get closer and closer to the day of August 2 they will know who is \nwilling to risk default to achieve political goals. They will know it \nis not the people from our side of the aisle. They will know it is the \npeople from the other side of the aisle, and that will make problems \nNewt Gingrich faced in 1995--I believe it was when he shut down the \ngovernment--look like child's play. I would urge my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to rethink their position. The time has come \nfor a little soul searching on the other side of the aisle. You must \ndecide if you are willing to create another economic crisis to mollify \nan extreme wing of your party and score political points against the \nPresident. You must decide if you want to go down in history as the \nfirst generation of American leaders to renege on promises already made \nby Presidents and Congresses, Democratic and Republican alike. In the \ncoming weeks my Republican friends will have to make a very serious \ndecision. Are they going to get serious about working with us to find a \nbipartisan solution to our debt crisis or are they going to put \npartisan politics above the good of the country? Are they going to say \nit has to be our way, all the way, 100 percent, no revenues, or we are \ngoing to force the country to default? Or will they put the good of the \ncountry and compromise above narrow, ideological, often fear-driven \npolitics?\n\n  In conclusion, I am an optimist. I believe my colleagues will come \naround and join us in finding a bipartisan way forward. I don't base \nthat on anything that has been said. I wish I could. I base it on my \ninnate optimism that Americans, at the end of the day, are practical, \nproblem-solving people, not people who look for self-destructive \nsolutions. I ask my colleagues to come around, join us in a bipartisan \nsolution. We are willing to give some. You should be willing to give \nsome, but I can tell you, my friends, time is running out. I can only \nhope, the American people can only hope, you don't wait too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to talk \nabout the issue not only of the day, the week, the month, the year, it \nis the issue about what to do about the deficit. Everyone around here \nknows that if we fail to raise the debt ceiling by the August 2 \ndeadline, the United States will default on its loan payments. \nDefaulting could have catastrophic consequences on our economy as we \nattempt to recover from the worst economic recession since the Great \nDepression. Failing to raise the debt limit could send our economy into \na tailspin with unthinkable results for the American people. With the \nstakes so high, we must ask ourselves: How did we get into this \nposition? Or as my constituents back home in Alaska say: How did you \nget into this mess? Over the last decade, both sides of the aisle have \nplayed a role in this irresponsible spending that resulted in our \ncurrent fiscal crisis. At the beginning of the last decade, we had a \nbudget surplus--let me say that again--a budget surplus of $200 \nbillion, with a projected surplus of $5 trillion for the next 10 years. \nBy the time I took office in 2009, not only had our budget surplus \ndisappeared, we faced a budget deficit of over $1 trillion.\n  The creditworthiness of the United States is in jeopardy. Some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose raising the debt \nceiling, citing the need to rein in reckless spending. While I support \nbroad deficit reduction measures, I strongly disagree with those who \nfail to recognize consequences of failing to raise the debt limit and \ndefaulting on our financial obligations. Everyone around here knows \nwhat will happen if we do not. For the first time ever the \ncreditworthiness of the United States would be put in jeopardy. I want \nto step back for a second and remind everyone Congress has enacted \nmeasures on the Federal debt limit 74 times. So they obviously \nunderstand what will happen if the American government defaults on its \npayments. The ceiling has been increased by both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations and Congress. George W. Bush's first term in \nMay of 2003 would increase the limit by $984 billion. In fact, Congress \nraised the debt ceiling seven times during his administration. The \nSenate Republicans provided the votes to raise the debt ceiling in \n2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006. To keep a good credit rating is something \nthe American people understand, and they are doing their very best \nduring these hard times. I hear this all the time when we are back \nhome.\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n  While the American people understand that defaulting on our loans \nwould only make matters worse, some Members of Congress insist on \nplaying politics even during this economically uncertain time. If the \nU.S. Government defaults on its financial obligations, it would be the \nfirst time in history our credit would be downgraded. Let me repeat--\nnever before have we let our creditworthiness be called into question. \nThe consequences are large and somewhat unknown.\n  Let me take a little bit from what the Senator from New York talked \nabout and expand on that, and that is: How does it affect the \nindividual, the person working hard every day, paying their mortgage, \ndriving to work, pumping gas in their car, going on a vacation, doing \neveryday things that Americans do in my State of Alaska, especially now \nthey are out fishing, enjoying the summer. The kids are out of school, \nand the State fair is getting geared up in another month. What happens? \nWell, first off, if we default on our loans that are due, our \nobligations, some immediate things will probably happen.\n  First off, individuals who have credit cards will have their rates go \nup, because if you read the fine print of those great credit card bills \nwe get every month, which are very small and very detailed, they talk \nabout how the rate is structured. The rate is structured around what \nhappens in the market. Obviously a lot of people today may have a good \nrate, 9 percent, 10 percent, but average is around 15 percent, 18 \npercent. That interest rate will go up. Home mortgage rates--if you \nhave an adjustable rate mortgage, it will be adjusted up. If you are a \nsmall business person--as I have been, and am still today, my wife--\nthere are many businesses that borrow on a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year loan, \nadjustable rate, maybe monthly, maybe it is an inventory loan because \nit is a seasonable business--all those rates will go up, assuming you \ncan get a loan. When you drive your car and pump that gas and fill up \nyour tank and you think prices are high now, oil commodities are traded \nin U.S. dollars. So the net effect is going to be that dollar is going \nto have less value, which means the price of the fuel will go up and \nwhat you pump into your car will increase.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of world markets, transactions across this \nworld are done in U.S. dollars. If you impact the creditworthiness of \nthe country, the dollar has less credit behind it, which, of course, \ncosts money, which means things we import such as fuel to operate our \ncars, energy to heat this building, to turn on these lights, go up. It \nhas a real impact to individuals. It is not some global discussion here \nin the halls of Congress. It is not about just debt limit and GDP and \nall these other phrases that people kind of wonder what it means to \nthem in their individual life, but it has a direct impact in their \nlives. What happens to their retirement funds? Their funds are invested \nin maybe U.S. Government securities. Well, they are going to see a \nchange, a dramatic change. The American people, Alaskans, are already \nstruggling. To add this additional burden because we are unable to sit \ndown and work together and solve this problem in a cohesive, \ncomprehensive way is irresponsible.\n  To my friends across the aisle, let me remind you of what President \nReagan said in 1983 in a letter to then-Senate Majority Leader Howard \nBaker. He said it better than I think any of us could say, and this is \ndirectly from his letter:\n\n       The full consequences of default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of \n     the dollar in exchange markets.\n       The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result. The risk, \n     the costs, the disruptions and incalculable damage lead me to \n     but one conclusion: the Senate must pass this legislation \n     before Congress adjourns.\n\n  It is amazing I can take a quote such as this from history and \ntransplant it today and it is the same situation.\n  At the same time as we deal with this, I feel strongly we must pass a \ndeficit reduction measure. I have supported the deficit commission, the \ndebt commission, and their efforts. I didn't agree with it all, but I \nagreed the $4 trillion mark should be it. We should try to do our best. \nIn order to solve this problem, this challenge--and we all have our \nsides where we are kind of hunkered down. Every time I go back home--\nand I was back home this last weekend for my short 48 hours. I spend \nmore time on the plane than staying at home at times. But when I get \nhome, people say very simply to me, it is a combination. We are going \nto have to reduce the spending. I don't object to that. We are going to \nhave to create a more fair tax system, which I don't object to. Along \nwith Senator Wyden and Senator Coats, I have introduced tax legislation \nthat does that, simplifies individual rates, focuses on a growth agenda \nwith our tax policy. It gets rid of the loopholes, tax havens that \npeople take advantage of who pay no taxes but enjoy the great bounties \nof our country.\n  We also have to invest. We have to invest in a growth agenda. That \nmeans investing in infrastructure, in education. Because as you reduce \nyour budget, which I don't disagree with, and as we create a more fair, \nbalanced tax system, we have to do one of the most principled things \nand that is to continue to help grow this economy and we have to invest \nin our infrastructure, and invest in a variety of things that grow our \neconomy.\n  This is an opportunity for us to put our country on sound financial \nfooting by passing a broad deficit reduction measure that includes cost \nsavings and increased revenues. When it comes to protecting America's \neconomic security and improving fiscal responsibility, the time to act \nis now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I rise today to talk about some of the enormous \nchallenges facing our economy, about Washington's failure to address \nthose challenges and a way forward. Today there are nearly 23 million \nAmericans looking for full-time jobs. This includes people among those \n9 percent of Americans on the unemployment rolls, but also includes a \nlot of Americans who want to work but have given up looking for work or \nare scraping by on part-time jobs when they want a full-time job. What \nmakes it more troubling is that, among the Americans being counted in \nthat 9 percent, the average length of time on the unemployment rolls is \nnow nearly 10 months. That is the longest ever recorded. These folks \nare looking for help, looking to us for leadership and looking for us \nto help get the economy back on track by creating a better environment \nfor job creation and economic growth. As we have heard from the two \nprevious speakers, the government faces serious, unprecedented \nbudgetary challenges. Washington is borrowing nearly 40 cents of every \ndollar it spends. It looks as if we may have another record deficit \nthis year, and we will have the highest debt ever. Government spending \nhas gone from $25,000 per household to more than $31,000 per household \nin the last 4 years. The national debt has doubled over the 2008 \nlevels--doubled since 2008. We have hit this $14.3 trillion debt limit, \nand if we do nothing about it, we are going to end up with an economic \ncrisis much like Greece is facing today.\n\n  I just listened to the comments of my colleague from New York and my \nfriend from Alaska, and they are talking about the fact that interest \nrates might go up unless we vote to extend the debt limit. I am talking \nto a lot of economists and thinking about the impact it will have on \nOhio if we don't do something about the deficit and debt. When we \nextend the debt limit again, interest rates will go up. The value of \nthe dollar will continue to go down. Inflation will go up.\n  The point is not that we want to go into default--I hope nobody does \nin this Chamber. Despite what my friend and colleague from New York \nsaid, there is no Republican interest in defaulting on the debt. No one \nwants to default on the debt. But it is just the same as when we have a \ncredit card in our families. Once we max out on the credit card, before \nwe try to get a higher line of credit, we ought to look at the \nunderlying problem, otherwise we will fall right back into the same \nfinancial problems. That is what Republicans are saying.\n  It is this: If we do not deal with the underlying problem, which is \nthis huge fiscal imbalance we just talked about--a $14.3 trillion debt \nthat has doubled\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\nsince 2008--then we are going to find ourselves with a financial and \neconomic problem that will result in a spike in interest rates and will \nresult in this negative impact on all Americans via car loans, \nmortgages, and student loans.\n  So this is why it is so critical over the next few weeks as we work \nthrough this; That we deal with not just extending the debt limit--I \nguess that is a pretty easy thing to do, to just say let's go borrow \nmore; we are already borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar--but we \nhave to deal with the underlying problem.\n  So what are we doing in the Senate to deal with that underlying \nproblem? Very little. This week we are debating a meaningless sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. It is what is called a nonbinding resolution. It \nwill not create a single job or reform a single part of our tax code. \nIt will not save $1 of government spending. It does nothing to address \nthe debt limit. It is a distraction, and that is why earlier today I \nvoted against proceeding to it. Serious times demand serious work.\n  I was pleased when the Senate came together to cancel this week's \nscheduled recess because we should be here. We pledged to return to \nWashington and to confront these economic challenges we talked about \nand the budget problems we face. I supported doing that, but this has \nnot been a serious effort.\n  By the way, the Senate has not even passed a basic budget for this \nyear. There is no budget, which is highly unusual. It also never passed \na budget last year. So instead of talking about nonbinding resolutions, \nwe should be talking about a budget. We should have a budget on the \nfloor. We should be debating it. The other side will have their issues, \nand we will have issues to talk about. None of us will necessarily \nagree with one another on the precise provisions of a budget, and that \nis fine. Let's have the debate and end up with a blueprint for our \nspending going forward.\n  President Obama talks about getting involved and showing true \nleadership but, to be honest, he hasn't stepped to the plate. The best \nexample would be his own budget. He is required by law to submit one \nevery year. He did submit a budget. That budget was voted on by this \nSenate. Because we didn't have our own budget, we voted on his budget. \nIt was unanimously rejected 97 to 0 partly because, as Democrats will \nsay, a few weeks after he submitted the budget, he gave a speech where \nhe said: My budget wasn't really adequate to the task. So he rejected \nhis own budget, in a sense, but he offered no alternatives, no \nspecifics.\n  His own budget, by the way, was so unserious that it doubled the debt \nover the next decade, and that is why, again, it was voted down by this \nSenate.\n  What is our budget? What do we believe in? We should have that \ndebate.\n  We need to know what the numbers are; and what vision the President \nhas for the next 10 years. That is what the budget is supposed to do. \nAnd, of course, we need to know what he will do to help grow the \neconomy. In my view, getting the budget under control is a matter of \nrestraining spending, but it is also a matter of growing the economy. \nIf we don't grow the economy--and that will increase revenues, by \ngrowing the economy--we will not be able to get out of this deep fiscal \nhole we are in with record deficits, record debt, and, again, an \nincreasing negative impact on our economy.\n  The lack of a true debate is not from a lack of ideas, by the way. \nSenate Republicans have developed a commonsense jobs plan, much of \nwhich I think should be and can be bipartisan. It includes a lot of \ncommonsense ideas. One is to reform the Tax Code. Senator Begich from \nAlaska talked about that earlier. That is to make sure that our Tax \nCode works better for our economy; that it is simpler, that it \nencourages investment and job creation. Economists across the board \nwould agree that our current code is inefficient. We should do that as \na body. That will help develop the economy and jobs and economic \nactivity which will increase revenue.\n  We need to rein in regulations. When I am home talking to small \nbusinesses, the first thing they talk to me about is the latest Federal \nregulation. A new one out today from the Environmental Protection \nAgency which is affecting my home State of Ohio is going to cost jobs \nat a time when we need jobs desperately. These are very specific \nproposals. Maybe they are not proposals everyone can agree to. What are \nthe other side's proposals? Let's debate this issue. Let's pass \nlegislation that forces a cost-benefit analysis of regulations. Let's \nbe sure the regulators are using the least burdensome and least costly \nalternatives.\n  These are commonsense ideas: creating a competitive workforce to make \nsure we are competitive for the 21st century. This is incredibly \nimportant. Expanding exports to create more jobs. On energy, being sure \nwe have the ability to get away from our dangerous dependence on \nforeign oil by developing more resources right here in this country. \nThese are all commonsense proposals we should work on because they \nrelate to the very issue we should be talking about this week, which is \nhow to deal with our budget imbalance.\n  The proposal, by the way, also caps government spending. It says we \nneed to have a balance between revenues and expenditures, which is only \ncommon sense because until we get the fiscal house in order it is going \nto be very difficult to get our economy moving. It is like a wet \nblanket over the economy creating uncertainty and unpredictability.\n  On the budget, let's be clear. The long-term problem is from soaring \nspending, not falling revenues. This is from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It is a nonpartisan group. Their job is to give us the data to \ntell us what is going to happen with spending and with revenues. This \nis what they tell us.\n  Even if we keep current tax rates for everybody--in other words, \ndon't get rid of the so-called Bush tax cuts--revenues are still \nexpected to rebound above the historical average of 18 percent of the \neconomy. If, in fact, the Bush tax cuts do not get extended, which is \ncurrent law--right now they are expected to end at the end of next \nyear--those tax revenues will be well above the historic average. \nInstead of 18 percent, they get up over the next several years to about \n20 percent. Over the last 50 years, it has been about 18 percent. The \ndeficit is rising not because of lack of revenue but because spending \nis now at 24.5 to 25 percent of our economy as compared to its \nhistorical level over the last 50 years of 20.3 percent of the economy.\n  What is going to happen? Well, CBO has it right there. It is \nprojected to rise on the spending side to 26 percent of the economy \nover the next several years; then 30, then 40, then 50 percent of the \neconomy on spending alone. We talked earlier about the fact that we \nhave gone from $25,000 per household government spending to $31,000 per \nhousehold in the last 4 years alone. That spending is projected to grow \nand grow. If we don't deal with that spending we will never be able to \nget the budget in balance. That is the top issue. Again, we have to \nface this before we extend the debt limit again. If we don't, there \nwill be major economic problems.\n\n  Look at what Standard & Poor's and Moody's and Fitch--the so-called \ncredit agencies--are telling us. They are saying: Yes, default would be \na terrible thing. Let's not default. But they are also saying: If we \ndon't deal with the fiscal imbalance, if we don't deal with the record \ndeficits and debts, there will be major and negative impacts on the \neconomy, and they will be in a position where they may downgrade our \ndebt, which means higher interest rates.\n  Having tax rates chase spending is not the solution. It will not \nbalance the budget. Moreover, it will not spur this sputtering economy \nto grow and to create the jobs we talk about today. It will not work to \nget us back to work. In fact, virtually all economic theories agree \nthat tax increases harm economic growth. When we tax something, people \ndo less of it. That is why we tax smoking. So if we want economic \ngrowth, the last thing we should do is to raise taxes on working, raise \ntaxes on savings, raise taxes on investment. These are not the ways to \nget the economy moving again. Instead, we should be unleashing American \nentrepreneurs, not putting more taxes on them.\n  Some suggest we must choose between creating jobs and reining in \ngovernment. My view is that the opposite is true. Reining in government \ncan help create jobs. The less the government spends, the more money \nremains\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nin the private sector for families and entrepreneurs to spend. The less \nthe government borrows, the more savings are available for businesses \nto borrow in order to expand, as well as for families to borrow for a \nnew home, a new car, or a student loan. Think about it. The government \nborrowing all this money is like a big sponge soaking up our savings. \nToday, we are borrowing, again, more than 40 cents of every dollar the \ngovernment spends. That is harming the economy. Reducing the deficit \nalso reduces the risk of a debt-induced financial crisis that might \notherwise dwarf what we have seen happening in Greece today.\n  But don't take my word for it. Lots of economists have looked at \nthis. There is a great study out there that I encourage people to look \nat. It is done by the economists Ken Rogoff and Carman Reinhart. Rogoff \nand Reinhart do something very simple. They go around the world and \nlook at different economies and determine what happens when their debt \ngets too big for their economy. Their view is that when the debt gets \nto 90 percent of the size of a nation's economy, it has a substantial \nnegative impact on the economic growth and jobs in that country.\n  Their data suggests that when the debt gets to 90 percent of the \neconomy, there is a 1-percent reduction in economic growth rates. So \ninstead of our economy growing at 1.8 percent in the first quarter, it \nshould have grown at 2.8 percent. What does that mean? That 1-percent \ngrowth would otherwise mean 1 million jobs.\n  So if we didn't have this huge debt--and right now it is about 93 \npercent of our economy; it will be at 100 percent of the economy this \nyear--then we would have more jobs. If we look at what Rogoff and \nReinhart have said, it means we would have about 1 million more jobs in \nthis country. Could we use those jobs? Yes. We need them desperately.\n  So there is a connection between this overspending--and this huge gap \nwe have between revenues and spending--and our ability to get this \neconomy back on track.\n  Over 25 years, by the way, annual growth rates 1 percent lower would \nleave the economy nearly one-fourth smaller than it would otherwise be. \nThink about that: a 25-percent reduction in the size of the economy as \na result of this debt.\n  In order to create jobs and growth, we have to balance the budget, \nand we have to reduce that debt that is now over 90 percent of our \neconomy. There are two ways to reduce the debt's share of the economy: \nOne is to make the debt smaller, and the other is to make the economy \nlarger. We know raising taxes will shrink the economy. Instead, we have \nto keep tax rates low to create jobs and expand the economy, and we \nhave to reform the Tax Code so it works better.\n  Again, economists across the spectrum will tell us we can have a \nbetter economy if we have a more sensible Tax Code. We must also \nresponsibly reduce government spending, of course, to rein in the debt. \nLow tax rates and spending restraint will bring prosperity and \nalleviate this immoral avalanche of debt that we are otherwise leaving \nin the laps of our children and grandchildren.\n  I understand some of my colleagues have their own approaches to \nthis--to jobs, to the economy, to the budget deficit. That is fine. \nLet's have the debate. There are numerous proposals in Congress to \nreduce spending, balance the budget, and reform entitlements. Instead \nof voting on political nonbinding resolutions as we have done this week \nin the Senate, let's have that debate. We have too many important \nissues. Let's stop fiddling while Rome burns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we discuss the need to bring down the \ndeficit, we should acknowledge a few basics. First is cannot achieve \nthe deficit reduction we need with spending cuts to nondefense \ndiscretionary programs alone. They simply aren't large enough to make \nthe difference we need, and the damage we would do to American families \nfrom drastic cuts in those programs is simply too great.\n  Second is that in light of those facts and in the interest of basic \nfairness, a balanced solution to deficit spending must include revenues \nas well as spending cuts. If we ask college students relying on Federal \naid, workers in need of Federal job training, seniors in need of health \ncare to sacrifice in the name of deficit reduction, so, too, should \nthose who benefit from loopholes and handouts in the Tax Code, \nincluding loopholes that often benefit only highly profitable \ncorporations, one of those huge loopholes that benefits corporations \nthat dole out large stock option pay to their executives.\n  Current law provides an unwarranted tax subsidy to executive stock \noption compensation thereby increasing the tax burden on working \nfamilies and increasing our deficit. According to the Joint Committee \non Taxation, closing this loophole would reduce the deficit by about \n$25 billion.\n  Today, under tax rules for reporting stock options, corporations \nreport stock option expenses on their books when those stock options \nare granted but use another method to claim a different and a typically \nmuch higher expense on their tax returns when the stock options are \nexercised. The result is, corporations can claim larger tax deductions \nfor options on their tax returns than the actual expense they show on \ntheir books for those same options.\n  Stock options are the only type of compensation where the Tax Code \nallows a corporation to deduct more than the expense shown on their \nbooks. For all other types of compensation--cash, stock, bonuses, and \nothers--the tax return deduction equals the book expense. In fact, if \ncorporations deducted on their tax returns more than their books showed \nas compensation, it could constitute tax fraud. The sole exception to \nthat rule is stock options. It is an exception we can no longer afford.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held a \nhearing in June of 2007, when we examined the stock option tax gap in \ndetail at nine companies. We found that those nine companies claimed \ntax deductions that were a combined $1 billion greater than the \nexpenses shown on their books. Let me repeat, just nine companies, $1 \nbillion in excess tax deductions.\n  We were shocked by that finding, and we asked the IRS to calculate \nthe stock option tax gap for the country as a whole. Using actual data \nfrom tax returns, the IRS found that for the first full year in which \ndata was available, U.S. companies claimed an excess of $61 billion in \nstock option tax deductions compared to their book expenses. Since \nthen, IRS data shows that the stock option tax gap has persisted for 5 \nyears. They looked at 2005 to 2009, which was the latest year for which \ndata was available, with the size of the excess tax deductions varying \nfrom $11 billion to $52 billion per year. These excessive deductions \nmean billions of dollars in reduced taxes for corporations wealthy \nenough to provide substantial stock option compensation to their \nalready well-paid executives and all at the expense of ordinary \ntaxpayers and an increase in the deficit.\n  It is a tax loophole that is fueling excessive executive pay, \nincreasing the pay gap between millionaires and the middle class, and \nenabling profitable corporations to avoid paying their fair share to \nreduce the deficit.\n  I will soon be reintroducing the same legislation I have introduced \nin past years to end this misalignment of the Tax Code.\n  The bill would cure the problem simply by requiring the corporate \nstock option tax deduction to equal the stock option expense shown on \nthe corporate books. It would not affect the taxes paid by individuals \nwho receive the stock options. It would not affect so-called incentive \nstock options which receive favored tax treatment under section 422 of \nthe Tax Code and are often used by startup companies.\n  In addition, the bill would make stock options pay subject to the \nsame $1 million cap on corporate tax deductions that applies to other \nforms of executive pay. Congress established that $1 million cap so \nthat taxpayers would not have to subsidize enormous paychecks for \nexecutives. But the cap can't end that tax subsidy without including \nstock options. Even if included under the cap, stock options could \nstill be awarded in excess of $1 million, but not at the expense of \nordinary taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\n  I do not know of any Senator who does not want to reduce the budget \ndeficit. I do not know of any Senator who believes it is wise to \nsubsidize executive paychecks at the expense of working families. But \nas it now stands, the excessive corporate tax deduction for stock \noption pay widens the deficit while increasing the tax burden on \nordinary taxpayers. By closing this tax gap, by ending the illogical \ntreatment of corporate stock options in current law, we can reduce the \nbudget deficit and bring much-needed fairness to the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nas in morning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Ahmed Warsame\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Department of Justice announced earlier \nthis week that Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, an accused member of the \nterrorist group Al-Shabaab, has been indicted on charges of providing \nmaterial support to Al-Shabaab and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, \nconspiring to teach and demonstrate the making of explosives, \npossessing firearms and explosives in furtherance of crimes of \nviolence, and other violations of Federal law. He will be tried for \nthese offenses in Federal court in New York.\n  Warsame is a Somali national who was captured in the gulf region in \nlate April and taken to a U.S. Navy vessel for detention and \ninterrogation. The Department of Defense has stated that the \ninterrogation was conducted by an interagency team comprised of U.S. \nmilitary personnel, with assistance from the High-Value Detainee \nInterrogation Group. After the completion of this interrogation and a \nhiatus of several days, Warsame was turned over to a team of FBI \nofficials for law enforcement questioning, and in that he waived his \nMiranda rights and continued to talk.\n  This case appears to be an example of our national security and law \nenforcement teams working together in the manner we would hope they \nwould toward the twin objectives of collecting critical intelligence \ninformation and ensuring a successful criminal prosecution of the \ndetainee.\n  Published reports indicate that Warsame was captured by American \nmilitary forces on a boat in international waters between Yemen and \nSomalia after the United States acquired intelligence indicating that a \nsignificant terrorist figure was on board the vessel. Under these \ncircumstances, it was appropriate for the military to detain and \ninterrogate Warsame to obtain actionable intelligence. The United \nStates is currently engaged in military operations pursuant to the 2001 \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force. As the Supreme Court held 7 \nyears ago in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the capture and detention \nof both lawful and unlawful combatants is a ``fundamental and accepted \n. . . incident to war.'' I understand these interrogations were \nconducted in a manner fully consistent with the interrogation \ntechniques authorized under the Army Field Manual on interrogations.\n  Once our national security team determined that the collection of \nactionable intelligence had been completed, a separate decision was \nmade, on the basis of the specific facts of this case, as to the best \nforum in which to prosecute Warsame for his alleged crimes.\n  The indictment sets forth evidence that Warsame violated a number of \nFederal statutes, including sections of the Criminal Code prohibiting \ntrafficking in explosives, use of dangerous weapons, acts of \ninternational terrorism, providing material support to foreign \nterrorist organizations, and receiving military-type training from \nforeign terrorist organizations--making him a candidate for prosecution \nin a Federal court with jurisdiction over such violations.\n  Warsame also appears to have engaged in acts of terrorism and \nmaterial support to terrorism, both of which are crimes under the \nMilitary Commissions Act, if they are committed ``in the context of and \nassociated with hostilities'' against the United States. What has not \nbeen resolved is whether Warsame meets the jurisdictional threshold in \nthe Military Commissions Act of having acted in the context of \nhostilities against the United States and having engaged in or \nmaterially supported such hostilities.\n  The administration's national security team unanimously agreed that \nprosecution in Federal court was the better option and the one most \nlikely to lead to a conviction under the facts of this case. Our \nFederal prosecutors and Federal courts have a proven track record in \nprosecuting terrorists. Two years ago, the Justice Department informed \nus that there were 208 inmates in Federal prisons who had been \nsentenced for crimes related to international terrorism and an \nadditional 139 inmates who had been sentenced for crimes related to \ndomestic terrorism. By contrast, prosecution of the Warsame case before \na military commission would have raised a difficult jurisdictional \nissue that could have resulted in dismissal or even acquittal.\n\n  Critics of the decision to try Warsame in Federal court apparently \nwould prefer that he be tried before a military commission, even though \nhe might be less likely to be convicted there due to the jurisdictional \nissue. I disagree with that position. In my view, the most appropriate \nforum for trial should be determined, as it was here, on the basis of \nthe nature of the offense, the nature of the evidence, and the \nlikelihood of successful prosecution. The executive branch officials \nwho made the determination in this case are in a much better position \nto weigh those factors and make that judgment than is the Congress.\n  By the way, the approach taken by the administration in this case is \nconsistent with the bipartisan detainee provisions included in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, as reported by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last month.\n  Those provisions would authorize military detention for enemy \nbelligerents captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the \n2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. That authority \nappropriately encompasses the detention of an individual like Warsame, \nwho is suspected of participation in such hostilities, until such time \nas the military has been able to interrogate the detainee and make an \nappropriate status determination. While we may not have enough evidence \nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Warsame participated in \nhostilities against the United States, we undoubtedly had sufficient \nevidence to hold him for the time required to interrogate him and \nobtain the intelligence that our military needs.\n  The provisions in the Senate Armed Services Committee-reported bill \nwould also expressly authorize the transfer of such a detainee ``for \ntrial by an alternative court or competent tribunal having lawful \njurisdiction.'' Indeed, an amendment to delete this authority was \ndefeated in committee by a bipartisan vote of 7 to 19. We decided, in \nother words, to leave it up to executive branch officials to determine \non a case-by-case basis, as they did here, the most appropriate forum \nfor prosecution, whether it be a Federal court or a military \ncommission.\n  By contrast, the House version of the defense authorization bill \nincludes a provision that would expressly prohibit the trial in Federal \ncourt of any alleged foreign terrorist who might be subject to trial by \na military commission--even if he is arrested inside the United States. \nThis provision may well be unconstitutional, given that article III of \nthe U.S. Constitution expressly states that:\n\n       The judicial power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and \n     Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the \n     United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, \n     under their Authority.\n\n  Under the plain language of this provision, Congress would appear to \nlack the authority to exclude the prosecution of violations of the laws \nof the United States in the Federal courts.\n  The effort to direct all terrorist cases to military commissions \ncould also be highly counterproductive, providing jurisdictional \narguments that defendants could use to seek the dismissal of charges \nagainst them. If the House language were adopted, a case in Federal \ncourt on a terrorism charge would be at risk of being dismissed on the \ngrounds that it could only have been brought before a military \ncommission, while at the same time, because of the limited jurisdiction \nof military commissions, the military commission might not have \njurisdiction either. In such a case, it would be impossible to \nprosecute an alleged terrorist in any\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nforum. The critics of the Department of Justice decision should end \ntheir effort to score political points here. The stakes are too high, \nand if the critics get their way, we might not be able to try some \nterrorists at all--anywhere.\n  Some may contend that holding alleged terrorists in the United States \nfor trial could needlessly subject Americans to retaliatory attacks by \nterrorist organizations. There is no basis for that argument. We have \ntried hundreds of alleged terrorists in our Federal courts over the \nlast decade. We are currently holding many more--including the \nChristmas Day bomber, who is being held in my hometown of Detroit. So \nfar as I know, none of these cases have led to retaliatory attacks by \nterrorist organizations. In any event, we know that al-Qaida and its \nallies are already seeking avenues to attack us on American soil and \nwould do so if they could. Moving the location of a trial to Guantanamo \nor some other foreign location is unlikely to deter such an attack.\n  Last month, ADM William McRaven--the President's nominee to be \ncommander of U.S. Special Operations Command--testified before our \nArmed Services Committee that a suspected enemy belligerent detained \noutside the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq would likely be put on a \nnaval vessel until ``we can prosecute that individual in a U.S. court \nor we can return him to a third party country.'' Admiral McRaven made \nit clear later in his testimony that such an individual could also be \ntransferred for trial by a military commission. In other words, we have \na choice. We should preserve that choice.\n  In summary, the Warsame case demonstrates that we do have the \ncapacity to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists in military \ncustody for the purpose of obtaining actionable intelligence, and then \nto transfer them to an appropriate forum for trial--whether it be a \nFederal court or a military commission. This case demonstrates that we \ndo not have to sacrifice actionable intelligence for law enforcement \npurposes, and that we do not have to sacrifice criminal prosecution in \norder to collect intelligence information. And it demonstrates that we \ncan pursue both of these objectives without being pushed to what \nAdmiral McRaven described as the ``unenviable option'' of having to \nrelease the detainee.\n  The only ``unenviable'' outcome is the one that the critics of the \nDepartment of Justice decision would lead us to--prohibiting the \ncriminal trial of suspected foreign terrorists in Federal court and \nrequiring them to be tried by military commissions, even in cases like \nthe Warsame case, where a jurisdictional problem might lead a military \ncommission to dismiss the case.\n  The action of the administration in the Warsame case is sound. The \nprosecutorial discretion they exercised as to the best forum for the \ntrial should be preserved and should not be interfered with by the \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise, along with my fellow colleagues, \nto again address the need to reduce our deficit and our debt. The \nUnited States is the strongest country in the world--in the history of \nthe world--but that will not be the case for long if we do not solve \nour deficit and our debt crisis. It is vital we solve it now for our \ngeneration, but it is vital we solve it for future generations as well.\n  The wealth, the economic activity of this country, is created by the \nprivate sector, by hard-working men and women, not by the government. \nThe government creates the forum, the environment, if you will, that \nfosters or allows economic activity. But the key is, the government \nshould not just allow economic activity, the government needs to create \nan environment that truly empowers, that promotes economic activity, \nthat encourages private investment, that encourages entrepreneurship, \nbusiness expansion and job growth, innovation--the very entrepreneurial \nactivity that has built this country. That is the success of America, \nthat is the strength of our country, that is how America has become the \ngreatest economic powerhouse in the history of the world. That is why \nour people enjoy the highest standard of living.\n  But our current administration believes more government is the \nanswer--more spending, more regulation, and more taxes. It is not the \nanswer. That is the problem, and it is making the situation worse.\n  Let's go through just some of the economic statistics.\n  Today, we have 13.9 million--almost 14 million--people unemployed. \nThe unemployment rate is over 9 percent. Gas prices, since the current \nadministration took office, are up to more than $3.50 a gallon. That is \nalmost a 100-percent increase in the cost of gasoline. Our Federal debt \nis closing in on $14.5 trillion. For every man, woman, and child in \nthis country, that is almost $50,000 for every single person. We have \n45 million people on food stamps today. Health insurance. In spite of \nthe health insurance legislation, health insurance premiums are rising, \nand home values are going down.\n  Clearly, we need to get our economy going. We need to get people back \nto work. We need that economic growth and dynamism that has been the \nhallmark of this country.\n  Clearly, we need to reduce our deficit and our debt. The reality is, \nwe can do it. We absolutely can do it, and we have done it before. But \nwe need to begin with a comprehensive plan to reduce the deficit and \nthe debt. Any agreement to raise the debt ceiling needs to include a \ncomprehensive agreement to reduce the deficit and the debt.\n  By a comprehensive agreement, I mean something that includes a \nbalanced budget amendment, reduction in spending, and living within our \nmeans on an ongoing basis. It means reforming entitlement programs to \nsave them from bankruptcy, not only to protect our seniors today but to \nmake sure those programs are solvent and there for future generations.\n  All these things and more can go into a comprehensive plan. But we \nneed a comprehensive plan to reduce the deficit, to reduce the debt as \npart of the debt ceiling issue we need to deal with now--not put off \nbut deal with now.\n  If we think about it, a balanced budget amendment makes sense. Forty-\nnine of the fifty States--49 out of 50 States--have either a \nconstitutional or a statutory requirement that they balance their \nbudget--not just this year but every year. States balance their \nbudgets. Cities balance their budgets. Businesses balance their \nbudgets. Families balance their budgets, live within their means. Our \nFederal Government needs to do the same. Our Federal Government needs \nthat fiscal responsibility, needs that fiscal discipline.\n  Also, if we think about it, a balanced budget amendment gets \neverybody involved. It gets everybody involved in Congress. It takes a \ntwo-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. Then what happens? It goes out to the States. It goes \nout to the 50 States, and three-fourths of the States must ratify that \nbalanced budget amendment in order for it to be approved. So we not \nonly have everybody at the Federal level working to live within our \nmeans and balance the budget, but we get all the States involved as \nwell.\n  This is a challenging problem--no question about it--getting on top \nof these deficits and our long-term debt not only now but for the \nfuture as well. So let's have everyone involved. A balanced budget \namendment will do just that.\n  Of course, at the same time, we have to reduce our spending both now \nand make sure we continue to live within our means going forward. The \nstatistics are very clear. The statistics right now show that this year \nthe Federal Government will take in about $2.2 trillion in revenue.\n  So our revenue is about $2.2 trillion, but our expenses are $3.7 \ntrillion. That is about a $1.5 trillion deficit. This year, actually, \nit will be larger than that number. So you can see that is why our \nFederal debt now is closing in on $14.5 trillion. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend--40 cents of every dollar we spend--and \nevery single day our debt goes up $4 billion. That is simply \nunsustainable.\n  That is why any vote to increase the debt ceiling must include a \ncomprehensive plan to reduce our deficit and our debt. No question, we \nneed to control spending, but as we do that, at the same time, in order \nto truly solve the problem, we have to create, as I said at\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nthe outset, a government environment that not only encourages \ngovernment investment but empowers private investment across our \nNation.\n  This next chart shows some of the challenges--barriers, if you will--\nto doing that. We need legal, tax, and regulatory certainty to \nencourage private investment. A probusiness, progrowth, projobs \nenvironment is one that creates legal, tax, and regulatory certainty to \nnot only encourage but empower private investment.\n  One of the ways we do this is by reducing the regulatory burden. We \nhave an incredible regulatory burden at the Federal level. We need to \nfind ways to reduce that. That is what this chart shows.\n  Earlier this year, President Obama issued an Executive order that \nproposes to review regulations that may be outmoded, ineffective, \ninsufficient, or excessively burdensome, and also to modify, \nstreamline, or even repeal them. Just a week ago, he said again:\n\n       What I have done--and this is unprecedented--is I have said \n     to each agency, look at the regulations that are already on \n     the books, and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of \n     them.\n\n  That is what he said. I absolutely agree with that. Yet, over the \npast 2 years, the administration has issued 502 proposed or enacted \nregulations and is on pace this year to exceed $100 billion in total \nregulatory cost burdens to industry. That is a huge regulatory burden.\n  This chart shows the cost of major new regulations in billions of \ndollars over the last 30 years. As you can see, when the cost of \nregulation is low, the economy is strong, and when the cost of \nregulation is high, as it is now, the economy is weak; more important, \njob growth is weak. Look at 2010. In 2010, you see the highest \nregulatory burden, in adjusted dollars, in the last 30 years. How did \nour economy do in 2010?\n  Senator Roberts, my colleague from Kansas, myself, and others have \ntaken the President up on his pledge to review these regulations. We \nhave introduced the Regulatory Responsibility For Our Economy Act, a \nmeasure that would give teeth to the President's directive. Regulators \nwill have to show the benefits of a new rule and show that the benefits \noutweigh its cost. They will have to show that it imposes the least \nburden on society and that it maximizes economic benefits. That is an \napproach which would not only encourage but truly empower private \ninvestment.\n  Let me give you another example of what I am talking about with the \nregulatory burden--again, trying to create that legal and tax certainty \nthat stimulates the private investment we need to get this economy \ngoing, not more government spending. We are spending way beyond our \nmeans. What I mean is, more private investment that gets this economy \ngoing, gets people back to work, and generates revenue, which will help \nus, over time, reduce our debt.\n  When we talk about onerous regulations, a key area of the economy \nthat is incredibly overburdened and where we see a prevention of \ninvestment because of the regulatory burden is the energy industry.\n  My next chart illustrates the long reach of the EPA and how it is \nsidelining and dampening job growth in the energy sector. It shows a \nlong, complex obstacle course, if you will, of expensive standards and \nprocedures and regulations that are not only being implemented now but \nwill go on for the foreseeable future.\n  How would you like to be an energy company looking at investing and \nputting hundreds of millions, billions of dollars into new plants and \ninvestments, whether it is producing oil and gas, whether it is \nbiofuels or biomass--you name it--how would you like to make those \ninvestments on behalf of your shareholders and have some idea what rate \nof return you are going to be able to get and what rules of the road \nyou are going to have to follow?\n  This is just a small sampling of the regulations that are now coming \ninto being and will continue to come into place for the foreseeable \nfuture. At a time of high oil prices, unrest in the Middle East, and \nsluggish economic growth, we are not only failing to provide Americans \nwith affordable energy for their homes and vehicles, but we are \nactually discouraging the very investment that will make it happen, and \nthis is just one small example.\n  To remedy that, we need new legislation. I know the occupant of the \nchair and others are working on a lot of new legislation that will \nstreamline regulations and encourage investment.\n  I will give just a couple of examples. One of them I am working on \nwith Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia. He introduced it, and it \nis called the EPA Fair Play Act. It would prohibit rescinding properly \napproved 404 permits. When EPA approves a 404 permit for mining, it \nsays you can't arbitrarily withdraw that permit. So a company that has \ninvested millions or billions of dollars can't find itself high and dry \nafter it has already gotten the proper permit.\n  Another example of legislation that we have introduced that would \nmake a difference is Defending America's Affordable Energy and Jobs \nAct. The primary sponsor of that is Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming. \nThis legislation ensures that Congress makes the call on regulating \ngreenhouse gases, not the EPA through regulatory fiat.\n  Another example is the Gas Accessibility and Stabilization Act, which \nI am pleased to cosponsor with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri and \nothers, which will simplify the complex rules and regulations that \ngovern refining and distribution of fuel throughout the United States.\n  There are many other examples I could give as well.\n  The point is, with 14 million Americans out of work, we can no longer \ndelay. It is not just regulations, it is legal, tax, and regulatory \ncertainty that will empower investment by entrepreneurs and companies \nall over this great Nation.\n  We don't just have to talk about regulations. Let's talk about trade \nfor a minute. Right now, we have three trade agreements pending: the \nUnited States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, the free-trade \nagreement with Panama, and another one with Colombia. These agreements \nhave been pending since 2007. The benefit of these agreements, for \nexample, is that they would generate more than $13 billion a year in \neconomic activity for this country and create up to 250,000 American \njobs. If we fail to act, we will lose on the order of 380,000 jobs to \nthe European Union and Canada, which have already approved their trade \nagreements. Why aren't we dealing with those trade agreements now, when \nwe have 14 million people out of work, when we have an economy we need \nto get going, and when we have huge deficits and debt, increasing at \nthe rate of $4 billion a day?\n  Well, the deadline on the debt limit is fast approaching. The time to \nact is now. The simple truth is this: We cannot continue to spend more, \ntax more, and regulate more. It is time to control our spending and \ncreate an environment that unleashes the entrepreneurial power and \nspirit of the American people. We can do it. In fact, we have done it \nbefore. We just need the will to act for ourselves today and for the \nbenefit of future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by referring to the front \npage of today's Washington Post. The headline is ``Obama: Social \nSecurity on table. Cuts offered in debt talks.''\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that headline is wrong because, in \nfact, Social Security, which is perhaps the most successful Federal \nprogram in the history of our country, has not contributed one penny to \nour deficit or our national debt. The idea of lumping Social Security \nand cuts in Social Security into a discussion about our deficit and our \nnational debt is absolutely wrong and unfair to the tens of millions of \nseniors and people with disabilities who benefit from that program.\n  As you know and as the American people know, Social Security is \nindependently funded through the payroll tax. Every worker and every \nemployer contributes into that fund. Social Security, today, has a $2.6 \ntrillion surplus that is projected, in fact, to grow to over $4 \ntrillion by 2023.\n  We, of course, need a vigorous debate about how we deal with the \ndeficit crisis and our national debt, but Social Security, \nindependently funded, with a $2.6 trillion surplus, having not \ncontributed one nickel to the national debt, should not be part of that \ndebate.\n  I understand there are many people in the Senate--many of my \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\ncolleagues--who do not like Social Security, who do not believe in \nSocial Security because, essentially, they do not believe the \ngovernment should be involved in retirement insurance for seniors or \npeople with disabilities. I respect their point of view. I very \nstrongly disagree with it.\n  The real problem they have is that Social Security is enormously \npopular. Poll after poll shows that the American people do not want to \nsee Social Security cut, they do not want to see the retirement age \nraised, and they most certainly do not want to see Social Security \nprivatized because, in fact, Social Security has succeeded. It has \naccomplished the goals of those people who founded that program in the \n1930s. In the 1930s, about half of America's senior citizens lived in \npoverty. Today, that number, while it is too high, is down to 10 \npercent. More important, given the incredible instability in the \neconomy we have seen for decades--especially in the last few years--\nwhere millions of people have lost some or all of the retirement \nsavings they had invested in Wall Street, over the last 75 years, not \none American has lost one dime he or she was entitled to in terms of \nSocial Security benefits. That is a pretty good record--every American, \ngetting every penny that was owed to him or her for 75 years. It is a \nprogram that has worked. It is a program that is working today. It is a \nprogram that can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American \nfor the next 25 years. It is a program that should not be cut.\n\n  But more to the point, in terms of President Obama, one of the \nproblems we have as a nation is that it is no great secret that many of \nour people are losing faith in government, for a whole lot of reasons. \nBut certainly one of the reasons is that politicians say one thing and \nthey do something else. They campaign on a certain promise, they give a \nspeech, everybody applauds, and 2 years later: Well, I guess I have to \nchange my mind; I can't quite do this.\n  Let's be clear: When President Obama ran for the Presidency in 2008, \nhe was a strong advocate of Social Security. He made it very clear to \nthe American people he was not going to cut benefits. Let me quote from \na speech the President gave--he was then-Senator Barack Obama--on \nSeptember 6, 2008. This is what he said:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear: I will not do either.\n\n  ``I will not do either.'' Today's Washington Post: Obama: Social \nSecurity on table. Cuts offered in debt talks.\n  Mr. President, on April 16, 2008, candidate Obama said:\n\n       The alternatives, like raising the retirement age, or \n     cutting benefits, or raising the payroll tax on everybody, \n     including people making less than $97,000 a year----\n\n  And that is now up to $106,000 a year----\n\n     those are not good policy options.\n\n  On November 11, 2007, candidate Obama said:\n\n       I believe that cutting [Social Security] benefits is not \n     the right answer; and that raising the retirement age is not \n     the best option.\n\n  The American people expect the President of the United States to keep \nhis word.\n  Now, again, I am not privileged to the discussions that may be going \non right this moment in the White House about some grand national debt \nnegotiations. All I can tell you--and it may be accurate, it may not; \nthe media has been wrong once or twice in history--is that according to \ntoday's Washington Post, the President is considering lowering cost-of-\nliving adjustments for Social Security recipients, even though, by the \nway, Social Security recipients have not received a COLA in the last 2 \nyears.\n  So let's be clear: Today, despite significant inflation on health \ncare costs and prescription drugs, the fact that seniors have not \nreceived a COLA in 2 years, the fact veterans have not received a COLA \nin 2 years, apparently, the President, in negotiating with Republicans, \nis considering lowering COLAs in the future.\n  It is important to understand what that means. According to the \nStrengthen Social Security Campaign, which is a coalition of senior \ngroups who are working hard to protect Social Security, changing the \nway Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are calculated--as the \nPresident may be considering--and again, I do not want to make a \ndefinitive statement. All I am doing is telling you what is on the \nWashington Post's front page today. Is it true? I can't say. But if it \nis true, this would cost senior citizens hundreds of dollars a year in \nlower benefits.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the adoption of the \nso-called ``Chained CPI''--and this is a different formulation. I \nhappen to believe, and I have introduced legislation to this effect, \nthe current COLAs for seniors are not accurate and are too low because \nthey do not, in a realistic way, measure what seniors are purchasing, \nwhich, to a significant degree has to do with health care and \nprescription drugs. When you are old, you are not primarily buying \nlaptop computers or big television sets. You are often spending a lot \nof your money on health care, prescription drugs, and those costs are \ngoing up. So I think today's COLA is too low and it does not reflect \nthe real purchasing needs of seniors.\n  According to the CBO, if in fact the government adopted the so-called \n``Chained-CPI''--which is a different formulation that is even lower \nthan the current inadequate formulation--annual COLAs under this \nproposal would cut benefits by $112 billion over 10 years.\n  Here is the important point for individuals. The Social Security \nAdministration Chief Actuary estimates the effects of this change would \nbe that beneficiaries who retire at the age of 65 and receive average \nbenefits would get $560 less a year at age 75 than they would under \ncurrent law and get $1,000 less a year at age 85.\n  People are living longer. Many of our people, God bless them, reach \n75, even reach 85. To say to somebody when they reach 85, and they \ndon't have a whole lot of money, that as a result of these cuts they \nwill get $1,000 a year less is totally, to my mind, unacceptable and \nnot something that should be supported by the President or by any \nMember of the Senate.\n  The American people, despite what many of my Republican friends are \nsaying, are pretty clear on some basic issues regarding how we address \nthe serious problem of our national debt and our deficit. What the \nAmerican people say in poll after poll after poll--and they say it to \nme on the streets in Burlington, VT, or any other place in Vermont that \nI go--is that we must have shared sacrifice; that at a time when \npoverty is increasing in this country, when we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world, when millions of workers \nare working longer hours for lower wages, when unemployment is sky \nhigh, when seniors have not received a COLA in 2 years, when young \npeople are finding it hard to get any jobs at all, it is immoral and \nbad economics to do deficit reduction on the backs of those people--of \nworking families, of children, of the elderly, of the sick, of the \npoor.\n  Overwhelmingly, the American people say that is wrong, especially at \na time when the wealthiest people have never had it so good and when \ncorporate profits are soaring.\n  Mr. President, you may have seen an article on the front page of the \nNew York Times a few days ago. Last year CEOs of major corporations \nhave seen a 23-percent increase in their compensation packages--23 \npercent. We are in the midst of a horrendous recession, where real \nwages for American workers are going down, but CEOs are doing great, \nWall Street is doing great, corporate profits are soaring, and we have \ndozens of corporations that make huge profits and don't pay a nickel in \ntaxes.\n  We have a military budget that is three times higher than it was in \n1997. So the vast majority of the people say--and they say it in polls \nall over the place--we need to go forward with shared sacrifice. Not as \nthe Republicans suggest--cutting programs for the most vulnerable \npeople in this country, throwing millions of kids off Medicaid, ending \nMedicare as we know it now, and making it impossible for working class \nfamilies to send their kids to college. That is not what the American \npeople are saying.\n  A recent survey by Public Policy Polling in swing States asked the \nquestions. When voters in Ohio--this is just\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nthe other day this came out--were asked this spring if they would \nsupport or oppose cutting spending of Social Security to reduce the \nnational debt, only 16 percent favored that approach compared to 80 \npercent who were opposed, with similar, identical results, or very \nclose results in States such as Missouri, Montana, and Minnesota. That \nwas just out in the papers yesterday. Meanwhile, strong majorities, \nincluding Republicans, favor increased revenue from the wealthiest \nAmericans and most profitable corporations being a part of any deficit \nreduction package.\n  So let me conclude by saying that I hope very much President Obama \ndoes not reach any agreement with the Republicans which includes cuts \nin Social Security. Social Security has not contributed one nickel to \nour national debt. It is a successful program and widely supported by \nthe American people who are benefiting from it every single day. More \nto the point, President Obama, when he campaigned for office, made it \nclear when he told the American people if he was elected President he \nwould not be cutting Social Security, and the American people expect \nhim to keep his word.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the matter of tax \nexpenditures, and I would like to expand on that topic today. They are \nbecoming a critical issue in negotiations over the debt ceiling.\n  First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nfinish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Democrats say they want to eliminate tax \nexpenditures. They refer to them as loopholes or spending through the \nTax Code. This might be a good political argument, but it bears little \nrelationship to the understanding of tax expenditures and tax law or \ntax policy.\n  Yesterday, I outlined a general definition of tax expenditures. They \nare most definitely not spending through the Tax Code, as President \nObama so creatively put it, and they are most definitely not, by and \nlarge, loopholes. Rather, they were intentionally included in the Tax \nCode by Congress in order to realize certain policy goals.\n  Tax expenditures are an opportunity for families and businesses to \nkeep more of their income. Unfortunately, rather than have a serious \nconversation about tax expenditures and tax policy, President Obama and \nhis liberal allies are intent on setting new ground for juvenile public \ndiscourse.\n  Faced with a $14.3 trillion debt--and going up every day--Social \nSecurity and Medicare Programs that are set for bankruptcy--ruining \nAmerica's seniors--and a legitimate fiscal crisis that poses a clear \nand present danger to the Nation's security and the security of \nAmerica's families and businesses, President Obama is again talking \nabout shared sacrifice. Well, I like the term. The only thing is, I \nwould prefer to have shared prosperity because all we are going to get \nout of this administration is shared sacrifice, which means everybody \nis going to suffer. I would like to have shared prosperity where \neverybody is lifted.\n  The first time we really started hearing about this concept of shared \nsacrifice was in the debate over ObamaCare. For those who are \nunfamiliar with Washington-speak, this is what the President meant by \nshared sacrifice: I am going to raise taxes on families and businesses \nby over $\\1/2\\ trillion, and I am going to do it by shaking down \nbusinesses.\n  He made them an offer they couldn't refuse: Pay up now or pay up more \nlater. So when we started hearing again about shared sacrifice, we knew \nwhat was coming: more proposals for tax increases. But I have to say I \nremain shocked at how ham-fisted most of these proposals are. They are \nnothing but a series of bad talking points that can be used for the \nPresident's reelection campaign. These talking points were tired by the \nend of the 1936 Presidential election.\n  I would not be surprised to see President Obama dust off Franklin \nRoosevelt's speeches and start railing against economic royalists by \nthe end of the debt limit negotiations.\n  Sadly, the Senate's leadership has followed suit. After making a big \nto-do about keeping the Senate in session to address the fiscal crisis, \nwe are spending this week debating a nonbinding resolution demanding \nhigher taxes on millionaires. Really? The Democrats' solution to $14.3 \ntrillion in debt is to attack corporate jets. Seriously? Three billion \ndollars over ten years. The last time they did that, they wound up with \ntheir tails between their legs in 1990, and in 1993 had to reverse the \nwhole thing because it cost thousands of jobs.\n  I never underestimate liberals' lack of respect for the intelligence \nof the American people, but this is a new low. Do they think that \nordinary Americans are so consumed with class hatred that they will \nrespond like Pavlovian dogs to the criticism of corporate jets, and \nforget that it was programmatic liberalism, not bonus depreciation of \ncorporate jets or tax benefits to energy companies, that got us into \nthis debt crisis?\n  This is how the left perceives Republicans. They want to score some \ncheap points against Republicans by going after corporate jets, as \nthough all Republicans love corporate jets. I would venture to say that \nan awful lot of corporate jets are owned by very wealthy Democrats. \nWhat are we going to get next week, a tax on monocles and top hats? \nMaybe we will spend next week debating a nonbinding resolution on the \nneed to tax madras blazers for the good of the country.\n  Unfortunately, not all of the Democratic proposals are a laughing \nmatter. They have been down this road in the past pushing tax increases \non luxury items such as yachts. Today, the press ridiculed Republicans \nfor ``defending the yachting class.'' There is no yachting class in \nthis country, unless you count the Democratic party of Martha's \nVineyard.\n  But there is a class of people who build yachts. This is what \nhappened to those people the last time the Democrats engaged in class \nwarfare of this kind. In the 1990 budget deal, a new luxury excise tax \nwas created applying to yachts, aircraft, jewelry, and furs, first \napplying to the 1991 year. The similarities are eerie.\n  Faced with soaring deficits, Democrats insisted that revenues be part \nof the equation. And how did this work out? The tax was repealed in \n1993 because, as the Democratic-controlled Senate Finance Committee \nreport, as reported by the Budget Committee, explains:\n\n       During the recent recession, the boat, aircraft, jewelry, \n     and fur industries have suffered job losses and increased \n     unemployment. The Committee believes that it is appropriate \n     to eliminate the burden these taxes impose on the interest of \n     fostering economic recovery in those and related industries.\n\n  Republicans are not defending the yachting class. They are defending \nthe people whose jobs will be lost to Democratic class warfare.\n  Of course, the left cannot contain themselves to these targeted tax \nincreases. Today we read in the paper that the President is eager to \nreform Social Security. Yet it appears he is only willing to do so if \nwe let the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire, tax cuts which only last \nDecember the President acknowledged were necessary components of our \neconomic recovery.\n  I would not be surprised to see the old Democratic hobby horse, an \nincrease in the Social Security tax max, make an appearance in the \nDemocrats' list of demands.\n  These are nonstarters, and everyone understands why. These broad-\nbased tax increases would be a weight around our economic recovery.\n  But the issue of tax expenditures continues to cause confusion and \nmust be addressed. Those who advocate limiting or eliminating these tax \nexpenditures suggest that they are spending and loopholes that benefit \nwealthy individuals.\n  Yesterday, I offered a grown-up definition of what a tax expenditure \nis. Today, I wish to highlight what are in fact the top tax \nexpenditures. What we will find is that the tax expenditures that would \ngenerate the largest amount of revenue are also those that are \navailable to the middle class, enabling them to give to their churches \nand synagogues, and to save for a home, for college, and for \nretirement. To get at meaningful deficit reduction, Democrats would \nhave to eliminate these expenditures. Is that what they want to do? \nThat might be a good question at the President's next press conference. \nMaybe someone could give him\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\na copy of this chart right here, and ask which of these tax \nexpenditures he is willing to eliminate in the interest of deficit \nreduction:\n  No. 1, exclusion for employer-provided health care. Is he going to \nget rid of that? That is 13 percent of all tax expenditures.\n  How about home mortgage interest deductions? Is he going to get rid \nof that? That is 9 percent.\n  How about preferential rates for dividends and capital gains? That is \n8 percent.\n  Exclusion of Medicare benefits. Are they going to do away with that? \nThat is 7 percent.\n  Net exclusion of defined benefit pension contributions and earnings. \nAre they going to attack our pensions? That is 6 percent.\n  And earned income tax credit. My gosh, that is 5 percent.\n  Deduction for State and local taxes, except real property. That is 5 \npercent.\n  No. 8, net exclusion of defined contribution/earnings. That is 4 \npercent.\n  How about No. 9, exclusion of capital gains at death? That is 4 \npercent.\n  And how about No. 10, deductions for charitable contributions? That \nis 4 percent.\n  I venture to say hardly any American is going to want to do away with \nall of those in the interest of getting more revenue so the Democrats \ncan spend it back here.\n  Look at that chart. It is a list of the top 10 tax expenditures. \nMaybe someone can give him a copy of this chart and ask which of these \ntax expenditures he is willing to eliminate in the interest of deficit \nreduction. I encourage all my friends to look at this chart. It is a \nlist of the top 10 tax expenditures.\n  With the rhetoric coming out of the White House, you might be \nsurprised to learn that tax benefits for yachts and corporate jets are \nnot in the top two. Not only do they not make the top 10, they don't \neven come close.\n  If you take the so-called savings that would come from the corporate \njet tax approach of the President, it would take us 3,000 years to even \nreach the approximately $800 billion stimulus package. In the context \nof the President's trillion-dollar deficits, they are statistical \nnoise.\n  So what are the big tax expenditures?\n  No. 1 is an issue from the ObamaCare debate. It is the exclusion for \nemployer-provided health insurance. The exclusion of employer-provided \nhealth insurance from income is the single largest tax expenditure, \nrepresenting 13 percent of tax expenditures.\n  Yesterday a Member of the other side's leadership pointed out that \nthe largest tax expenditure is one for corporations. Boy, is he wrong. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       The biggest single deduction is the employer's exclusion \n     for health care premiums. So employers are able to exclude \n     from income the amount of money they spend for health \n     insurance for their employees. That's the biggest.\n\n  Well, that is an incorrect description of the law that they are \narguing. Employers always have been allowed, and should be allowed, a \ndeduction for the cost of benefits they provide to their employees. \nEmployee compensation, including the provision of health insurance to \none's employees, is a cost of doing business and thus properly \ndeductible by the employer so as to accurately measure the income, or \nprofit, of the employer. That has never been considered a tax \nexpenditure. The exclusion at issue, which is a tax expenditure, refers \nto the employee's tax treatment, not the employer's tax treatment. That \nis, most compensation that an employee receives from his employer is \nincludable as taxable income. One of the few exceptions to that general \nrule is that employees do not include in taxable income the value of \nemployer-provided health insurance.\n\n  Coming in at No. 2 is the home mortgage interest deduction. This \nexpenditure alone accounts for 9 percent of all tax expenditures.\n  The third largest? There we have the lower rate on capital gains and \ndividends. Do away with this expenditure, and the rate on capital gains \nand dividends will almost triple in about 18 months. Capital gains and \ndividends represent about 8 percent of all tax expenditures.\n  What is No. 4? Here we have an untaxed piece of Medicare benefits. \nImagine that. I wonder how many folks on the other side realize this or \neven if the President does. When my friends on the other side \ncategorically talk about cutting back tax expenditures as the yellow \nbrick road to deficit reduction, I wonder if they know that hiding \nbehind the curtain is an increase in the aftertax cost of Medicare.\n  Do my friends on the other side realize this? A few months ago, a \nliberal group ran an ad showing my friend, the chairman of the House \nBudget Committee, Paul Ryan, pushing an old woman in a wheelchair over \na cliff. His crime? Recommending policy changes that would prevent the \ninevitable bankruptcy of Medicare.\n  I am not going to hold my breath waiting for this same group to pull \nthe fire alarm, because the Democrats' talk of eliminating tax \nexpenditures might result in seniors getting hit with higher taxes on \nMedicare benefits. But this is what the President and the Democrats are \ntalking about. If they are serious about using tax expenditures to \nreduce the deficit, these are the things that will have to be on the \ntable. These are the big expenditures. This expenditure is real. You \ncan look it up in the handy tax expenditure publication from the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. It is significant, \nrepresenting 7 percent of all tax expenditures, to the exclusion of \nMedicare benefits.\n  At No. 5 is the pre-tax treatment for defined benefit pension plan \ncontributions and the inside buildup on the accounts. This is a tax \nbenefit that reduces the cost for those workers who make the decision \nto save for retirement. This represents 6 percent of all tax \nexpenditures.\n  What is No. 6? It is the refundable earned income tax credit, the \nEITC. When folks describe tax expenditures as spending through the Tax \nCode, this is one that could properly be labeled that way. Under \ncongressional budget rules, this one, for the most part, scores as \nspending. That is not the case with the other tax expenditures on this \nlist. Refundable tax credits score as spending because the government \ncuts a check to the taxpayer. With the other tax benefits on this list, \nthe taxpayer is receiving a portion of the money back in the form of \nreduced taxes. There are some serious tax hikes there. This tax \nexpenditure accounts for 5 percent of tax expenditures.\n  No. 7 is the deduction for State and local taxes. My friends on the \nother side need to be particularly careful with this one. So far, they \nwould hit seniors, families who have health insurance through their \nemployers, people with mortgages, and anyone who owns stocks and bonds. \nBut with this, many Democrats risk alienating every last taxpayer in \ntheir States. Removing this deduction is going to hit high-tax States \nhard. If you are from a so-called blue State, it is likely that \nconstituents are already heavily burdened with State and local taxes. \nTake away this and you will, in effect, drive up the marginal rate of \nyour constituents who take their deduction by as much as 35 percent.\n  I am convinced that many of the inroads Democrats made between 2006 \nand 2008 were due to carefully crafted Trojan horse campaigns. Skillful \noperatives ran Democratic campaigns promising moderate tax and spending \npolicies that would be respectful of families and businesses. But once \nthat Trojan horse got inside the Capitol, and former Speaker Pelosi and \nPresident Obama took charge, frustrated liberals spilled out and \nstarted taxing anything that could move to pay for the largest \nexpansion of government since Lyndon Johnson was in office.\n  Removing the deduction for State and local taxes might be the final \nact that restores purple America to its traditional red hue. At 5 \npercent of all tax expenditures, this would represent a massive tax \nincrease, this net exclusion of defined benefit pension contribution. \nAnd that is No. 7, after State and local taxes, except for real \nproperty.\n  What is No. 8? This is the pre-tax treatment for the contributions \nworkers make to their defined contribution plans and the inside buildup \non the accounts. Many of us know of these retirement plans as 401(k) \nplans. At 4 percent of tax expenditures, this is a significant \nincentive to families to save for retirement.\n  No. 9 is a bit more obscure but no less critical for families. It is \nthe tax expenditure for the step up in basis at\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\ndeath. We all know the saying that nothing is as certain as death and \ntaxes. Well, if this tax expenditure were eliminated, this step up in \nbasis at death, this saying would take on an even darker meaning. Death \ncould now be taxed twice. First, the decedent's estate might get hit \nwith the death tax. Then the decedent's heirs would be taxed again on \nthe gain embedded in any inherited asset should they decide to sell. \nThis accounts for 4 percent of tax expenditures.\n  We close with No. 10, the tax expenditure and probably the most \nimportant one to my constituents in Utah. It is the tax benefit for \ndonations to charities other than education and health care \ninstitutions.\n  When you make your weekly or yearly donation to your church, you can \nnow deduct it for tax purposes. This charitable deduction represents 4 \npercent of all tax expenditures. The folks in my State all pay \ntithing--almost all of them. That is 10 percent of their gross income. \nI do it every year. I have to tell you, you would hit a lot of very \ncharitable people and a lot of churches with the loss of that one, No. \n10. Yet that is the smallest of the whole 10.\n  As the chart shows, these widespread everyday tax policies account \nfor almost two-thirds of tax expenditures. We are not talking about \nyachts or corporate jets.\n  Now, I have already suggested it, but rolling back many of these \nexpenditures would have an immediate adverse impact on American \nfamilies and taxpayers.\n  It would also undercut longstanding Federal policies promoting \nsaving, home ownership, and charitable giving.\n  Let's turn first to retirement security.\n  About half of Americans save for retirement. The overwhelming \nbipartisan consensus is that this number is way too low. Ideally, all \nAmerican workers would be saving for retirement.\n  More savings means less financial stress on Social Security and \nMedicare. Most importantly, it means retirees can enjoy their \nretirement if they can rely on a nest egg. That is why there has been a \nbipartisan desire to incentivize retirement savings through worker \nparticipation in retirement plans.\n  A time-honored method has been to offer a tax benefit up front in the \ncase of the traditional defined benefit plan, traditional defined \ncontribution, or traditional IRA. The benefit remains untaxed during \nthe individual's working years. It is only taxed when received in \nretirement. By contrast, Roth pension plans and IRAs provide a tax \nbenefit on the back end, when a worker retires and begins drawing on \nthe account.\n  Former Finance Committee Chairman William Roth captured the policy \nrationale best by noting the deliberate tax policy bias toward savings. \nChairman Roth used to make the point with a rhetorical question. He \nwould ask: ``Is there any bad saving?''\n  Of course, the answer is no.\n  One thing we know for sure. Curtail or eliminate the tax expenditure \nfor retirement savings and the after-tax cost of savings will rise. \nSavers will react. It is true that some will continue to save. But it \nis also true they will have less to save if they choose to do so. For \nmiddle income taxpayers, it will probably mean lower savings rates.\n  Is that a good policy to put in place?\n  Consider this: According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2009 \nover half of households paid no income tax. Forty-nine percent of \nAmericans shouldered 100 percent of the income tax burden.\n  The half shouldering the income tax burden are also, generally \nspeaking, the part of the population making sound personal decisions \nlike saving for retirement. That behavior is good in both a micro and \nmacro sense. In the micro sense workers are sacrificing current \nconsumption for security and a better standard of living in the future. \nIn a macro sense, the collective behavior of these citizens stabilizes \nour aging society.\n  To encourage this kind of sacrifice, our tax policy provides a \ntangible tax benefit. Take away that tax benefit and, as with raising \ntaxes on anything else, you will get less of the behavior. Take away \nthe tax benefit, and you will get less saving for retirement. Does that \nmake any sense?\n  In order to avoid restraining the rapid growth in government \nspending, our friends on the other side would have us send the wrong \npolicy signal to the half of our population that saves. They would add \nto the burden of those who are already shouldering the entire burden of \nfunding the Federal Government. At the same time, by discouraging \nsaving and personal responsibility we would further unleash the \nappetite of those who want us to spend more.\n  Take another look at the chart. Add up the tax expenditures from \ndefined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. They account for \n10 percent of tax expenditures. Over 5 years, the revenue from these \nexpenditures amounts to almost $700 billion. On a per-year average \nbasis, it is $140 billion. That is an annual policy shift of $140 \nbillion in incentives for private savings to $140 billion in incentives \nfor growing government spending.\n  Do we want a society where more saving is encouraged? Or do we want a \nsociety where dependency and more government spending are encouraged?\n  Do we want to look more like Switzerland or do we want to look like \nGreece?\n  The answer to this question is clear to the citizens of this country.\n  Unfortunately, not all of their representatives seem to have thought \nthrough the implications of going after tax expenditures.\n  To get at this from another angle, I would like to discuss the impact \non taxpayers of cutting back some of these tax expenditures that come \nin the form of itemized deductions.\n  I am going to examine the effects of cutting back these itemized \ndeductions by applying President Obama's budget proposal to cap \nitemized deductions at 28 percent.\n  It is clear that some in the White House are pushing this 28 percent \ncap hard in the negotiations over the debt limit.\n  As noted before, itemized deductions generally are considered tax \nexpenditures. But itemized deductions impact a number of basic, \nlongstanding features of American life. Itemized deductions include the \nhome mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contribution \ndeduction, and the State and local tax deduction. The President is \nproposing to chisel away at these itemized deductions, and we should \ncarefully reflect on what that would mean.\n  President Obama has proposed repeatedly ``to limit the tax rate at \nwhich high-income taxpayers can take itemized deductions to 28 \npercent.'' It appears that this proposal is designed to lessen the \nbenefit to higher income taxpayers of itemized deductions. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says that this provision would mean the Federal \nGovernment would collect an additional $293 billion in taxes over 10 \nyears.\n  True to form, this is just another version of the same soak-the-rich \nplay that the left has been running for decades. From their \nperspective, it is unfair that higher income individuals get a more \nvaluable tax benefit than lower income individuals? But this \nperspective mischaracterizes a critical issue. The 35 percent bracket \nwas established by Congress with an understanding that itemized \ndeductions would allow a significant tax benefit. Had Congress known \nthat higher income taxpayers would be disallowed some of their itemized \ndeductions--as the President now proposes--undoubtedly Congress would \nhave set that bracket at lower than 35 percent.\n  So, taking away some of the benefit of itemized deductions for higher \nincome taxpayers, while leaving the high-income tax rates at their \ncurrent levels, upsets the balance struck by prior Congresses. \nObviously, Congress is allowed to do this, but let's not pretend that \nthese expenditures are loopholes or oversights by prior Congresses. The \nPresident and the Senate's Democratic leadership are free to do this if \nthey choose, but they should at least come clean about what they are \ndoing. They are significantly raising taxes on the people who are \nalready shouldering the lion's share of the Federal income tax burden--\n98 percent of them, as a matter of fact.\n  Even aside from the staggering character of this tax increase--one \nthat would clearly violate President Obama's campaign pledge not to \nraise taxes on middle class Americans the macroeconomic impact of this \ncap is negative at best.\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\n  President Obama's 28 percent cap would reduce the benefit from the \nhome mortgage interest deduction. For 5 years now, our Nation has been \nexperiencing a bursting of the real estate bubble. Current headlines \nindicate that this trend will continue for a time. Limiting the value \nof the home mortgage interest deduction would apply additional downward \npressure on home prices--not only for high end homes, but for all \nhomes. By repeatedly proposing to limit the benefit of the home \nmortgage interest deduction, is it the President's intent to further \ndepress housing prices, or is this mere collateral damage from his \ndesire to raise taxes.\n  But the damage from this cap does not stop at the housing market. \nPresident Obama's 28 percent cap would also reduce the benefit from the \ncharitable contribution deduction. This would almost surely reduce the \namount of contributions people would make to churches, synagogues, \ntemples, soup kitchens, shelters, universities, and museums. Is that \nthe President's intention? Does the President know that these revenues \nmight never materialize because the elimination of this deduction will \nstep up pressure for direct government assistance for the poor, for \nstudents, and for the arts?\n  Finally, this cap would reduce the benefit of the State and local tax \ndeduction. I touched on this point earlier. High-tax States are able to \nsoften the blow of their high taxes by pointing out to their citizens \nthe Federal deductibility of such taxes. So, my colleagues from high-\ntax States might want to talk to their governors about the impact the \nPresident's proposed cap would have on State and local public finance.\n  I want to be clear about something. Our Tax Code is a colossal, awful \nmess. And tax expenditures must be a part of any conversation about tax \nreform. But I want to emphasize that the conversation about tax \nexpenditures should happen in a conversation about broad based tax \nreform--reform that flattens the code while lowering rates.\n  The conversation about tax expenditures should be a sober one in the \ncontext of a meaningful discussion about tax policy. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has chosen instead to target tax expenditures willy nilly \nwith little regard for the policy implications of these tax hikes.\n  Make no mistake, whatever the President wants to call it--reducing \nspending through the Tax Code, closing loopholes, or making people pay \ntheir fair share--these are tax increases plain and simple. And they \nare tax increases on the middle class.\n  There has been some criticism in recent days about Republicans for \ntheir commitment to a pledge many of them took against any net tax \nincrease.\n  I have to admit I am at a loss here.\n  Conservative Republicans, convinced that taxes are already high \nenough, promise their taxpaying citizens that they will never support a \nnet tax increase.\n  They gave their constituents their word, and are sticking to it.\n  Meanwhile, President Obama, who promised not to raise taxes on the \nmiddle class when running for office, vows to break this promise at \nevery opportunity.\n  And yet it is the conservative Republicans who are somehow lacking \nintegrity? Hardly.\n  I don't care how many blows I take from sophisticated Washingtonians \nand professional leftists for sticking by my pledge to the people of \nUtah. I will resist any effort by the President to include tax \nincreases as part of the deal to increase the debt ceiling. I will do \nso for a number of reasons. First, our Tax Code needs a fundamental \noverhaul. It is a complicated mess that is lacking in fundamental \nfairness. Yet the President's proposal to reduce tax expenditures for \ndeficit reduction, is a proposal to maintain a tax code that grows more \nburdensome by the day. The President's proposal essentially robs the \ngovernment of the revenues that it might use later to flatten the Tax \nCode and lower rates.\n  More importantly, I oppose the President's proposed tax hikes as a \nmatter of principle. Flattening the tax base without any offsetting \nrate reduction is a tax increase.\n  My friend, the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nSessions captured the point well in an interview the other day. I will \nquote Senator Sessions:\n\n       We have to be honest and recognize that if you are going to \n     eliminate systematically a host of deductions and keep the \n     money or spend it for new programs, then you've raised taxes. \n     . . . It just is unless we've changed the English language.\n\n  The campaign against tax expenditures is a campaign for a tax \nincrease.\n  It is a tax increase that could send the wrong signal to those \nAmericans who sacrifice current consumption and save for retirement. It \ncould raise the bar for those Americans who want to experience the \nAmerican dream of home ownership. It would mean the residents of high \ntax States would face even higher State and local taxes. And it could \nmean a cutback back in the volume of charitable giving.\n  This is shared sacrifice that the Nation cannot afford.\n  I prefer shared prosperity by cutting taxes and giving the small \nbusinesses and businesses the opportunity to use that money to hire \npeople and get people working and get more people paying taxes. I think \nit is abysmal that the bottom 51 percent do not pay income taxes, and \n23 million of them get refundable tax credits from the government that \nare far more than the payroll taxes they might have to pay, which are \nSocial Security payments.\n  I listened to my colleague from Vermont saying we cannot do anything \non Social Security, we cannot do this, cannot do that, the poor people \nare going to be hurt. Where are they going to be when Social Security \nis bankrupt? Where are they going to be when Medicare and Medicaid are \nbankrupt? The way we are going, that is where they are going to be.\n  We cannot keep spending like this, and we have to quit playing the \nphony game with tax expenditures.\n  All I can say is we have to get with it around here and we have to \nstart working together as Democrats and Republicans in the best \ninterests of the American people, and that is reforming this awful Tax \nCode, getting taxes down for everybody, and taking care of the poor but \nalso expecting everybody to have some skin in the game--except the \nreally poor--and help our country pull out of the mess we are in.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4438-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4438-S4446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have week \nafter week since the health care bill was signed into law, with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law because the President \nrepeatedly made promises to the American people as the health care bill \nwas being debated and even after the health care law was signed. He \npromised to improve, not hurt, the quality of medical care in this \ncountry.\n  We now know the President's health care law actually makes the \nproblem of health care in this country worse. In fact, since this bill \nwas signed into law, we have learned that it makes the cost of health \ncare worse. We know it makes the American's ability to get health care \nworse and the ability of individuals to keep the care they like--it \nmakes their ability to keep that care worse.\n  Today, I would like to first talk about the cost of care.\n  President Obama promised American families they would see their \nhealth insurance premiums go down because of the health care law, and \nhe actually told them they would go down by over $2,000 per family. \nWell, now we know that is not the case. In fact, Americans have seen \ntheir premiums increase 19 percent since the time the President signed \nhis health care bill into law.\n  I was looking at the front page of the Sheridan Press, Sheridan, WY, \nyesterday. Headline, front page:\n\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\n\n       Health care premium increase. County administrative \n     director said the county's cost to provide health care \n     coverage for its employees will increase by about $360,000 \n     this year.\n\n  We are talking about 1 county--1 out of 23 counties in Wyoming, \n$360,000 for county employees.\n  You know, throughout this entire health care debate, the President \npromised the American people that if they liked their health care plan, \nhis health care law would let them keep it--another broken promise. \nEmployers all across the country have made it clear that the health \ncare law's mandates are too expensive and threaten their ability to \noffer insurance to their employees.\n  A recent study by McKinsey & Company, which is a reputable national \nconsulting firm, produced a report entitled ``How U.S. health care \nreform will affect employee benefits.'' They surveyed over 1,300 \nemployers across diverse industries, geographies, and employer sizes. \nThe results confirmed what Republicans and American workers and their \nfamilies knew all along, and they knew it long before the President and \nWashington Democrats forced this health care law down their throats. \nOverall, the report says, 30 percent of employers will probably stop \noffering employer-sponsored coverage in the years after 2014 when the \nObama health care law goes fully into effect. Among employers with a \nhigh awareness of the health care reform law and what is specifically \nin the law, then the proportion of those who will definitely or \nprobably stop offering coverage jumps to 50 percent, and upward of 60 \npercent will pursue other options. So at least 30 percent of employers \nwould actually gain economically from dropping coverage even if they \ncompletely compensated their employees for the change through other \nbenefit offerings and higher salaries.\n  Apparently, the President's promise that ``if you like the health \ninsurance you have today, you can keep it'' translates into ``you may \nvery well lose your coverage.''\n  As former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin's \nanalysis confirms, if employers decided to drop coverage--which is in \ntheir economic best interest to do in many cases based on their \neconomic evaluation--the cost of Federal insurance subsidies would \nskyrocket.\n  Remember, the White House and Democrats in Congress met behind closed \ndoors. They acted swiftly and covertly to pass a law without regard for \nhow its provisions would impact each and every American family.\n  Then the question is, Will Americans actually have the ability to get \nmedical care they need from a doctor they want at a price they can \nafford? The President promised that his law would increase access to \naffordable care. Some groups tell a different story.\n  In April 2010, a month after the President signed his health care \nplan into law, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimated \nthat based on graduation and training rates, this country would have a \nshortage of 150,000 doctors over the next 15 years. In May of the same \nyear, the American Medical Association issued the results of its survey \nshowing the impact of low payment rates and the threat of future \npayment cuts on Medicare patients' access to care. The AMA found that \none in five physicians currently restricts the number of Medicare \npatients they see. The AMA study shows that nearly one-third of primary \ncare physicians restrict the number of Medicare patients they take into \ntheir practice.\n  All any of the Members of the Senate need to do is, at home on the \nweekend, talk to someone in your community, someone who is on Medicare, \nsomeone who is trying to find a doctor, a doctor to care for them, and \nsee how very difficult it is for someone on Medicare to find a doctor \nto care for them.\n  Well, later last year, the Association of American Medical Colleges \nrelated updated physician shortage estimates. The September 2010 study \nsaid that by 2015, doctor shortages will be actually 50 percent worse \nthan originally projected. By 2020, there will be a shortage of 45,000 \nprimary care physicians and a shortage of 46,000 surgeons and medical \nspecialists.\n  So I find it ironic that we have a health care law that is passed \nthat actually doesn't put money into training doctors to treat you but \nputs money in to hire IRS agents to investigate you. Absolutely \nastonishing.\n  These studies clearly demonstrate that the President's health care \nlaw will only make it harder for Americans to see their doctor. In \nfact, Washington only expanded the ability for folks to get government-\napproved, government-mandated, government-subsidized coverage. They did \nnot expand the ability for the American people to get actual medical \ncare. There is a huge difference between medical coverage and medical \ncare. When you take over $500 billion away from our seniors on Medicare \nnot to save Medicare but to start a brand new government program for \nsomeone else, well, that is a way to make the problem worse. When you \nforce 16 million more people onto Medicaid, a program where half of the \ndoctors in the country won't see those patients, that also makes the \nproblem worse.\n  On the front page of yesterday's USA TODAY, Wednesday, July 6, the \nheadline is ``Medicaid payments go under the knife.'' State cuts could \nadd to shortage of doctors.\n  The second paragraph:\n\n       Some health care experts say the cuts, most of which went \n     into effect July 1, or will later this month, could add to a \n     shortage of physicians and other providers participating in \n     Medicaid.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Under the 2010 health care law, more than 16 million \n     additional people will become eligible starting in 2014.\n\n  So already we have a situation where doctors are reluctant to take \ncare of people on Medicaid. Yet the President's solution to the health \ncare dilemma in this country is to put more people into a system that \nis already broken. We are giving individuals and families an insurance \ncard but not really giving them access to the care that has been \npromised.\n  Adults are not the only ones waiting in lines to get into doctors \noffices as the lines get longer. In fact, children enrolled in Medicaid \nhave a harder time accessing medical care than children who have \nprivate insurance. Yet that is the President's solution to the needs of \nthis country.\n  On January 16 of this year, the New England Journal of Medicine \npublished a study conducted in Cook County, IL. It is President Obama's \nhometown of Chicago. People were calling medical offices asking for \nappointments. They were asking for appointments for children with \nchronic conditions or acute conditions and telling the offices--these \nwere kind of secret shoppers--the person had Medicaid or private \ninsurance. What they found is 66 percent of the time when the \nresearcher called for an appointment and they mentioned Medicaid, they \nwere denied an appointment. But only 11 percent of the researchers \ncalling for appointments who said they had private insurance--only 11 \npercent would not get an appointment. So there you have 66 percent \ndenied if they had Medicaid and only 11 percent denied with private \ninsurance. Those Medicaid patients who did get an appointment, well, \nthey faced wait times twice as long as kids with private insurance--an \naverage of about 6 weeks. As one caller was told when asked what kind \nof insurance the person had--when that person said Medicaid, the \nreceptionist at the medical office said: Medicaid is not insurance. Yet \nthat is what the President and the Democrats base their entire health \ncare plan on--16 million more on Medicaid.\n\n  Here it is over a year after the law has been signed, and the \nPresident's health care law has made health care in America worse. \nPremiums are higher, and the lines at doctors offices are longer. It is \nmore difficult to get a doctor to care for you. This is not what the \nPresident's health care law was supposed to do, and it is not what the \nPresident promised the American people last year. He promised that the \nhealth care law would make health care better for all Americans. Each \nweek, we learn that the promises are coming up empty and health care in \nAmerica under this health care law has been made worse.\n  That is why week after week I come to the Senate floor as we learn \nmore things about the health care law that passed the Senate, passed \nthe House, was signed by the President, and, in my opinion as a doctor \nwho practiced medicine for 24 years, has actually been bad for \npatients, bad for providers\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nand nurses and doctors who take care of those patients, and bad for the \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I have two things I would \nlike to talk about. First, I wish to deal with the resolution we have \non the floor that we had a vote on today, which was this motion to \nproceed to S. 1323, a bill to express the sense of the Senate on shared \nsacrifice and resolving the budget. I think it is important that we \nrealize what is in this sense of the Senate. The findings the Congress \nmakes here are very important, and I would like to read these three \nfindings.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that the median pay for chief \nfinancial officers of the S 500 companies increased 19 percent to \n$2.9 million last year. And then you compare that with the middle class \nover the last 10 years--the median family income has declined by more \nthan $2,500. Mr. President, 20 percent of all income earned in the \nUnited States is earned by the top 1 percent of individuals. Over the \npast quarter century, four-fifths of the income gains accrued to the \ntop 1 percent of individuals.\n  So we conclude in this sense of the Senate--it is the sense of the \nSenate that any agreement to reduce the budget deficit should require \nthat those earning $1 million or more per year make a more meaningful \ncontribution to the deficit reduction effort. And that is what we have \nbeen talking about today; that is what our leaders are doing--meeting \nat the White House with the President--is trying to come up with a \nbudget deal and a resolution to this that involves shared sacrifice and \ninvolves putting us on a path to better budget responsibility, reducing \nthe national budget deficit. Clearly part of this has to do with \nmillionaires paying more of their fair share.\n  Now, we got 74 votes on the motion to proceed, but I heard many \npeople say--many Senators walked on the floor and said: Well, I am \nvoting for the motion to proceed, to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed, but I am not sure I support the bill. But I think the 74 votes \nshow a little bit of bipartisanship in terms of a mix of revenue and \nexpenditure cuts. That is the point I wanted to make on this \nresolution.\n  First of all, I hear things from the White House that worry me \nbecause what has been said when we talk about a package--and they are \ntalking about the overall package--is they say: We are going to have a \nratio of 1 to 3, meaning 75 percent cuts and only 25 percent revenue, \nso three-quarters in cuts and one-quarter in revenue.\n  Now, how does that compare to how we got out of deficit situations in \nthe past? I think that is one of the most important things to look at \nbecause we were in a big hole in the 1980s. The Reagan administration \ntook us down that road and President Clinton and President Bush 1 had \nto deal with that situation. What did they come up with? They came up \nwith an agreement which was basically 55 percent revenue and 45 percent \ncuts. So it was about a 50-50 situation.\n  I urge the President to look at the budget. We have only been briefed \nin a very cursory way on the budget Kent Conrad has prepared, but it \ncomes in at about 50-50 in terms of revenue and cuts.\n  We have to realize we are at the lowest Federal revenue we have seen \nin 60 years and the highest Federal expenditures we have seen in 60 \nyears. So we have to work at both sides of this. So that is where I \nhope the President comes in with some kind of proposal as he is \nnegotiating this, and I look forward to him doing that.\n\n\n                          New Mexico Wildfires\n\n  The other topic I wish to speak about is the wildfires in New Mexico. \nI spent the last week in my State of New Mexico. I stayed there. I \nstarted to go to the plane, and I kept hearing the reports from my \nstaff, and one of the most shocking was the entire community of Los \nAlamos--12,000 people--was evacuated because a forest fire was coming \nin their direction. As I kept getting the reports and the evacuation \nhad started to take place, I thought: Well, the best thing to do is to \nnot fly out but to go back to the community of Los Alamos and the \nsurrounding communities and try to assist in any way I could.\n  I want to talk a little bit about that. I think there are some \nlessons to be learned in terms of budgets and deficits and how we \nshould invest. But first I want to thank the Senators who helped me \nwhile I was gone. As the Presiding Officer, Senator Franken, knows, we \nare assigned weekly duties in terms of presiding, and I was supposed to \npreside last week. So three of my colleagues, Senator Durbin, Senator \nMerkley, and my cousin, Senator Mark Udall, stepped up to help me with \npresiding time. I had an amendment that was on the floor when we were \ndealing with the rules package, and Senator Harkin helped me with that \nproposal. So there was a real team effort within our Democratic caucus \nto help me to be able to work on the wildfire issue out in New Mexico \nand stay there and have my capable staff and the other Senators help \nout. I really thank everybody for that team effort.\n  The wildfires that are raging across New Mexico are not only in New \nMexico. A number of States have been hit: Texas, Arizona, Florida, and \nmy home State of New Mexico. Generally, what we see in this country is \nthe fire season starts at the southern part and moves up to the north \nas we go through the summer season. In the Southwest, we have had an \nextraordinary fire season. I was just briefed by Secretary Vilsack when \nI was out there. He spoke in the southwest region about 1,600-plus \nfires burning 1.5 million acres. This is still very early in the fire \nseason. We could see a lot more burning going on. Then, the thing that \nreally hit me was the fact that we were told this is the driest \nrecorded summer since the Forest Service has been keeping records. So \nit is pretty remarkable we are in this kind of situation where we have \na drought and then we have fires that heat up.\n  This particular fire, for New Mexico--the name of it is called the \nLas Conchas fire right near Los Alamos. As we speak, it is more than \n135,000 acres. It is almost three times as big as the previous fire \nsituation we have seen.\n  What happens with these forest fires in our dry, arid region is we \nget extreme heat within the forest, and we get what are called crown \nfires, where the tops of the trees--these trees may be 30 to 50 to 100 \nfeet tall, and the fires burn in the top of the crown. They can spread \nwhen there is a 40- or 50-mile-an-hour wind, as there was in some cases \nhere. They can be in the crown of the trees and they can jump out a \nmile in advance with embers and create additional fire in front of it. \nAs a result of the heat--very intensive heat; I think close to 1,000 \ndegrees right in the heat of the fire--it makes the soil unable to \nabsorb water any longer, which is something that creates a situation \nwhen we get our rainy season, which occurs right after the fire season, \nwe can have serious flood situations. The soil will not absorb water, \nso when the rains come all of the soil on the surface washes off. It \nwashes into the reservoirs. It can fill them up with silt. Some of \nthose are used for recreation, for fishing; others are used for \ndrinking water. For example, several of the communities in northern New \nMexico get 40 percent, 50 percent of their drinking water from these \nreservoirs. So these kinds of forest fires can be absolutely \ndevastating to communities.\n  But the one thing we were thankful for, because of the Federal \nfirefighters, is the worst case scenarios didn't occur. One of the \nthings that was expected--and I think many saw this covered on the \nnational media--is this might get into the National Laboratory, the Los \nAlamos National Laboratory; that there was going to be radiation \nreleased and those kinds of things. In fact, we dodged a bullet there. \nIt didn't go into Los Alamos National Laboratory. The labs and the \nresidences were protected.\n  There was another fire burning nearby that threatened the Santa Fe \nwatershed. The fire changed directions and because of the skillful \nfirefighting it didn't get into the watershed. So we dodged a bullet. \nBut many other areas--many other areas--were severely impacted, and \nmany other groups were.\n  For example, New Mexico's Indian pueblos--we have 19 pueblos in New \nMexico. Some of them were terribly impacted by this: the Nambe Pueblo, \nthe Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, the Ohkay Pueblo, Owingeh\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nPueblo, and many other pueblos. One of the most damaged pueblos was the \nSanta Clara Pueblo. The Governor is a gentleman by the name of Walter \nDasheno. He and some of his counselors had come to a meeting. Eighty-\nfive percent of this Indian reservation has been burned in the last two \nbig fires. What they said when we were sitting in a room--and these are \nthe elders from the pueblo who came to talk to us--they said: Our \nhearts are in a very sad state. The fire devastated our religious \nsites, our sacred sites. We had medicinal plants we would collect in \nthis area. We can't do that any longer.\n  With great emotion these elders said: We are never going to see this \nforest in the same condition again. So, obviously, the loss was great \nat Santa Clara, but it was all across New Mexico, of those pueblos that \nI just named, and it is a very significant loss.\n  The first thing I wish to do in speaking today is to thank all the \nfirefighters who were involved in this effort. I think we have fighting \njust this one fire 2,600 firefighters from all over the Nation--15 \ndifferent States. It is incredibly tough work--difficult, tough, dirty \nwork.\n  I met many of these firefighters out on the front where they were \nfighting the fire. Some of them would talk about how they had been away \nfrom their families for 2 weeks. They hadn't had a shower. They were \nsleeping in tents. It is a tremendously trying occupation, being a \nfirefighter, but they believe in it. They show up every day, and they \ndo an incredible job. They were supported by our National Guard which \nguarded the community of Los Alamos while the people were evacuated to \nmake sure there wasn't any crime going on. The State police patrolled \nthe roads to try to make sure they could keep order. Local law \nenforcement, local firefighters participated, the local fire \ndepartments.\n  So it was an incredible effort by our community pulling together. One \nof the most remarkable things is the expertise at the Federal level in \nFederal land management agencies and firefighters. These teams are \nheaded up--typically, we will have a type 1 and a type 2 team, and the \nhead of the team called the incident commander will probably have 20, \n25, 30 years of experience in fighting fires every summer around the \ncountry. These are career people from the Bureau of Land Management, \nthe Forest Service, the Park Service, and a variety of other Federal \nagencies that step to the plate and help out when we get in these \nemergency situations.\n\n  As I said, they come from all over the country to work in the States \nthat are impacted, and then as the fire season spreads north up to \nColorado and Wyoming and Montana, those same firefighters move on to \ncontinue the battle up there.\n  One of the points I take from this, one of the things I learned from \nthis--and I think President Lincoln said this very well: Government \ndoes for people what they can't do for themselves. Collectively, we \npull together when we hit situations where if we have an individual who \nhas a home in Los Alamos, there is not much he can do with a big forest \nfire coming in his direction. But we can organize as a governmental \nentity to say when we get big catastrophic fires such as this, we are \ngoing to have people who are competent, who are capable, and who have \nall of this experience in fighting fires who will come together and \nhelp out. That is something we need to protect.\n  When we think of debating budgets and deficits and all of that, there \nis a very important function that government serves out there, and we \nneed to protect that safety net function, that collective function \nwhere we help each other. I think this firefighting is a great example \nof where government is needed and we could be devastated if we didn't \nhave the expertise that the government has in terms of fighting fires.\n  The other thing I saw at these fires--and it was pretty remarkable. \nWhen I have been to tornado sites in New Mexico, when I have been to \nsome of the flood situations, what stands out for me is how New \nMexicans pull together in this situation--New Mexicans helping New \nMexicans. The pueblos I talked about that were so impacted by the \nfires, they actually opened other sites on their reservations so the \nevacuees coming out of Los Alamos, the 12,000 people--several of these \npueblos said: We are going to open our convention center and let them \nset up cots, and we are going to feed the people. We are going to do \neverything we can to help with this situation.\n  At the same time, their particular pueblo was being devastated by a \nforest fire. So there was an extraordinary outpouring of goodwill that \nNew Mexicans have shown in this kind of emergency situation. It is \nremarkable to see in a time of need people pulling together and doing \nthat in such a way that it brings tears to your eyes.\n  There was one individual I want to talk about. I was in talking to a \ngroup of people who were training for a charity that was going to help \nthe evacuees--help them serve meals, help them set up cots, help them \nbe organized. I got a question from the floor, and the individual said \nto me: I have lived in Los Alamos, and I had to come down here. I am an \nevacuee, but I found a friend who was able to put me up. I know there \nare other people who do not have that situation. So I am out here today \ntraining with the American Red Cross because I want to help the others, \nand I want to try to give back.\n  That is the spirit we have seen in New Mexico, that even if you were \nin need and had been driven from your home, you were still trying to \nhelp out. I think it is a pretty remarkable story.\n  One of the things we are going to have to do as we look across the \ncountry--and we see floods in the Midwest and wildfires in the \nSouthwest and tornadoes--all of these things require a disaster relief \nbill, they require disaster relief funding for agencies that deal with \nfires and all these other natural disasters.\n  These things are very costly for local government. FEMA steps in and \nhelps out with the Governor making a request. The Forest Service helps \nout. There are burn area rehabilitation teams that move in right after \na fire to try to protect the erosion so there are not bad floods.\n  We have to try to do everything we can to make sure we maintain, once \nagain, in this deficit situation, that kind of responsibility. The \nFederal Government has to help. Even within a deficit situation, we \nhave to have a disaster relief kind of effort. The idea that we are \ngoing to somehow change the way we do disasters now, that we are going \nto take money away from Medicaid in order to put it into disasters, is \nI do not think a very good idea. So I think when we talk about how we \ndo disaster relief, we need to remember we are all in this together, \nand when disasters hit, we need to help each other.\n  To show you the kind of pressure we are under in New Mexico, \nSecretary Vilsack, with the Forest Service, was out in New Mexico, and \nthe one plea he made to the congressional delegation--because we were \ntalking to him about watersheds that mean clean drinking water and that \nkind of situation--the Secretary said: I have a program that is called \nthe Emergency Watershed Protection Program. It is for all over the \ncountry. It is for when we get into these kinds of wildfires, floods--\nwhatever the situation is. He said: We have $9 million--$9 million--in \nthe account. He said: Already, before your requests or any others have \ncome in from New Mexico and other States--I know there are five fires \ndown in Florida and fires in Texas and Arizona--we have $45 million in \nrequests.\n  So there is $9 million in the account, $45 million in requests. What \nwe are talking about, when we talk about watersheds, is drinking water \nnot deteriorating and that kind of thing. So we need to remember there \nis a lot the Federal Government does in a shared way with local \ncommunities to protect those communities.\n  My final note, to talk a little bit about the biggest picture here. \nThat is about climate change and global warming. We are seeing these \nwildfires, droughts, and floods as we have never seen before. I have \nseen Senators from all over the country talking about these disaster \nsituations. The scientists tell us we are putting too much carbon \ndioxide into the atmosphere, we are warming the atmosphere. In the \nWest--what the scientists tell us--it is going to be twice as hot in \nthe West, the computer models show, than in other places in the \ncountry. While the climate scientists are very cautious with their \nmodeling and what they say,\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nthey say: You cannot point to any particular storm. I cannot say that \nparticular fire that occurred in New Mexico--the Las Conchas fire--was \ncaused by global warming or climate change.\n  They also tell us--and this is the part we need to listen to--the \nscientists tell us what we are going to see as a result of this is more \nsevere weather events, meaning more severe: If you get into a drought \nsituation, it is going to be a more severe drought, which is exactly \nwhat we are seeing in New Mexico right now. When you get floods, you \nare going to see a more severe flood. You are going to see more severe \nwildfires. These are all what we are seeing today in New Mexico. We are \nseeing them across the Nation. We have seen extreme floods in New \nMexico, catastrophic forest fires.\n  We are seeing droughts we have not seen before. The Forest Service \nhas been keeping records for 117 years, and they reported to us there \nis no record for how dry we are right now. This is the driest year we \nhave ever had, which laid the groundwork for the wildfires we had with \nthe wind and all the other things that occurred.\n  So we cannot put our heads in the sand in terms of climate change, in \nterms of global warming. We have to look at these things and realize we \nare contributing to them, and we need to put policies in place, solid \npolicies that put us on a path to reducing that carbon dioxide \npollution that is out there.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer very much and thank the \nSenate for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand before you today to discuss a problem \nthat is of concern to 300 million Americans. It relates to our national \ndebt, a debt that will soon cross the $15 trillion threshold.\n  We have been asked to raise the debt limit, extend the Nation's \ncredit one more time. This we have the power to do but we have to ask \nourselves the question: Should we exercise that power? Should we incur \nadditional debt yet again without any plan moving forward to change \nfundamentally the way we spend money in Washington, DC?\n  Our current law requiring us to raise the debt limit periodically \nevery time our existing line of credit dries up dates back to 1982. We \nhave raised the debt limit since 1982 nearly 40 times. I fear if we do \nit again this time without any permanent binding plan in place, legal \nrestrictions changing the way Congress spends money, we will be right \nback to the same trough a few months later. That is a problem because \nas we do this over time we inevitably put pressure on our financial \nsystem, pressure that will soon cause our economy dire circumstances, \npressure that will in time result in excessive job losses, skyrocketing \ninterest rates, and lots of other economic conditions that would be, to \nsay the least, unpleasant.\n  It is for this reason that 100 Senators from around the country have \ncanceled their plans they previously made to spend time with their \nconstituents in their respective home States this week. That had been \nour plan, to spend time in our home States. We canceled those plans so \nwe could come back here and have serious, earnest debate and discussion \nsurrounding the best path forward toward moving in the direction of a \nbalanced budget, toward figuring out what conditions, if any, would \nsatisfy the American people who are understandably concerned about the \nprospect of yet another knee-jerk reflexive debt limit increase.\n  The American people understand the fact that if we choose to do \nnothing more than say: Well, if we are going to raise the debt limit by \n$2 trillion, let's make sure we cut $2 trillion from our anticipated \nspending--they understand that kind of promise is one that is not \nbinding on the Congress if those spending cuts are stretched out over \nthe course of 10 or 15 years or more, as has been discussed, because we \nhere in Congress cannot bind the Congress that will be sworn into power \nin January of 2013 or January of 2015 or January of 2017. We cannot \nbind a future Congress. We can make suggestions they can follow, but we \ncannot bind them--unless, of course, we choose to do that, which has \nbeen done only 27 times in our Nation's history, which is, amend the \nConstitution. That will bind a future Congress. That, I believe, is \nwhat we have to do in order to change fundamentally the way we spend \nmoney in Washington, to make sure we are not headed back to the same \ntrough a few months from now to do exactly the same thing, leading us \ncloser and closer to the dire circumstances I described a few minutes \nago.\n  While we have been here this week, convening during a week that was \npreviously scheduled for a recess, we as a group of Senate Republicans \nhave come together and offered a real meaningful solution. We have \noffered to raise the debt limit. We have introduced legislation today \nwith 21 Republican cosponsors in the Senate which is a piece of \nlegislation we are calling the Cut-Cap-Balance Act. Here is what it \nsays. It says we will raise the debt limit. We will do so only under \nthree circumstances, only after three very specific conditions \nprecedent have been met.\n\n  The first two relate to immediate spending cuts to discretionary \nspending, and statutory spending caps making sure we start putting \nourselves right now on a statutorily mandated glidepath toward a \nbalanced budget.\n  The third step, which is by far the most important, involves passage \nout of both Houses of Congress by the requisite two-thirds margin a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution--one that would cap \nspending as a percentage of GDP, and one that would require a two-\nthirds supermajority in order to raise taxes. Upon each of those \nconditions being met, then the debt limit would be raised, but only \nthen. We would not raise it without those conditions having been met. \nBecause if we do not meet those conditions, we will not be able to look \nour constituents in the eye and say: We have done what needs to be done \nin order to make sure we get to where we need to be, in order to get to \nthe point at which we will no longer be in a position of having to go \nback to the same trough every few months to go through the ceremony of \nraising the debt limit yet again.\n  We have to remember that every time we do this, we run an increased \nrisk that we will start having to pay higher and higher yields on our \nTreasury instruments. Every time that happens, we incur more expenses \nthat relate to our ability to remain current on our debt interest \npayments. Every time interest rates, yields on those debt instruments, \ngo up by 1 percentage point, we have to spend an additional $150 \nbillion a year in interest once our debt instruments catch up with the \nincreased rate. That is a lot of money. That means if we were to \nreturn--let's say if interest rates were to go up 3 percent, we can \nsoon find ourselves in a position in which we might be spending as much \nas $700 billion a year on interest. We are currently paying about $250 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, $700 billion a year is roughly what we spend on \nnational defense. It is roughly what we spend on Social Security in an \nentire year. It is close to what we pay in Medicare and Medicaid \ncombined at the Federal level in an entire year. So where is the \ndifference going to come from when interest rates start to creep up? \nEven if they go up 3 percentage points, they would still be below their \nhistorical average. That money has to come from somewhere, and it will. \nIt will end up coming from the various programs that Americans are most \nconcerned about.\n  So whether you are a conservative, and you might be most concerned \nabout that money coming from our defense budget or, on the other hand, \nif you are a liberal, and perhaps you are most concerned about it \ncoming from entitlements, you ought to be concerned about our practice \nof perpetually raising the debt limit and engaging in perpetual deficit \nspending, especially when that deficit spending is now in excess of \n$1.5 trillion every single year.\n  This potentially threatens every Federal program out there. It also \ninterferes with the ability of each American to find the prosperity he \nor she seeks, the ability of each American to live his or her life in \nthe way he or she chooses. That is distressing. It interferes with the \nliberty of the individual, which is what we have been elected to \nprotect.\n  I am very proud to be part of this 21-Senator coalition consisting of \na group of Senators who are concerned enough about this issue that they \nare willing to say: We understand that we cannot just not raise the \ndebt limit. There are enough people who are concerned enough in this \ncountry about not raising it. The abrupt halt in spending that\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\nwould bring about would create enough uncertainty and chaos that many \nare unwilling to face that prospect.\n  So recognizing that reality, we have taken the bull by the horns and \nwe are willing to do one difficult thing. In order for us to raise the \ndebt limit, we have to be willing to set things in motion in such a way \nthat will solve the underlying problem and will create permanent \nstructural spending reform within the Congress.\n  I wish to close by responding to an argument made recently by Timothy \nGeithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, to the effect that we in \nCongress are essentially mere surplus when it comes to the debt limit \nincrease. He argued that, as I understand it, section 4 of the 14th \namendment somehow independently authorizes the executive branch--\nperhaps the Treasury Secretary, perhaps just the President--to somehow \nraise the debt limit without consulting Congress, without an act of \nCongress in place.\n  That argument is not accurate. That argument is based on an improper \nreading of the 14th amendment. The language to which he refers reads, \nin part, as follows:\n\n       The validity of the public debt of the United States, \n     authorized by law, shall not be questioned.\n\n  Adopted in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, this provision \nsimply acknowledges the fact that we can't ignore our debt obligations, \nthat when interest or principal comes due on our national debt, they \nhave to be honored. You will notice that in the middle of it, set off \nby commas, is a phrase that says ``authorized by law.''\n  To create law in this country, you have to move something through \nCongress. That something has to be presented to the President for his \nsignature or a veto. You cannot make a law in the U.S. Government \nwithout Congress. Article I, section 8, clause 2 makes that point clear \nby giving the authority to Congress to incur debt in the name of the \nUnited States.\n  So, necessarily, by definition and operation of the plain text of the \nConstitution, you cannot raise the debt limit without an act of \nCongress. If anything, section 4 of the 14th amendment simply makes \nclear that which I wish Secretary Geithner would acknowledge--and I \nhereby call upon him to acknowledge--which is that he has a legal and a \nmoral obligation to make sure that if the debt limit is not increased, \nduring whatever time it remains in limbo, during whatever time we face \nthe debt limit-induced shortfall, it is his obligation to use the first \ntax revenues coming in the door to pay our debt obligations, pay the \ninterest being accrued on our national debt. It is his obligation not \nonly as a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary but also the very provision of \nthe Constitution, section 4 of the 14th amendment--the same provision \nhe cites--binds his hands and requires him to make sure that interest \ngets paid and prohibits him from bringing about a default on our \nnational debt, which is what he has been threatening on many occasions.\n  There is a way forward. The circumstances in which we now find \nourselves are, to be sure, threatening, intimidating and daunting and \nthey are circumstances that bring about substantial disagreement within \nthis body and the other body that meets down the hall from us. But \nthere are answers and solutions to which we can agree.\n  I believe the Cut-Cap-Balance Act provides the proper solution which \ncan appeal to liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans \nalike. I call on all within the sound of my voice to look at this \nlegislation and jump on board and become part of the solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                              Tall Stacks\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a serious public \nhealth issue in Rhode Island and to commend the EPA for its actions to \naddress it.\n  Rhode Island has the sixth highest rate of asthma in the country. \nAccording to our Department of Health, more than 25,000 Rhode Island \nchildren or 11 percent of children in our State--more than 1 in every \n10 kids--suffer from asthma, and 82,000 adults in Rhode Island, which \nis also about 11 percent of our adult population, also suffer from this \nchronic disease.\n  From 2005 to 2009, asthma was the underlying cause or a contributing \ncause of death for 240 people in Rhode Island, including 4 children.\n  In 2009, there were 1,750 hospital discharges in Rhode Island for \nasthma cases. Those hospital stays cost about $8 million--in just that \n1 year--in direct medical costs, not counting the costs associated with \ndays of work and school missed or the medication for ongoing treatment.\n  On a clear summer day in Rhode Island, many of us have had the \nexperience commuting to work and hearing a warning on drive time radio: \nToday is a bad air day in Rhode Island. Infants, senior citizens, and \npeople with respiratory difficulties should stay indoors today.\n  In fact, yesterday was just such a day in Rhode Island. An air \nquality alert was issued by our State Department of Environmental \nManagement, warning that ozone was expected to reach dangerous levels \nin the southern half of our State by afternoon. They recommended that \nall residents limit physical exertion and take refuge in air-\nconditioned environments for the better part of the day. In addition, \nRhode Island's public transit operator, RIPTA, offered free bus rides \nall day long to keep people out of their cars.\n  These are real costs--costs paid in freedom, in reduced quality of \nlife, in medical bills, in burdened public services to respond to the \nhealth risks of dirty air, and in more missed days of work and school.\n  There is still a lot to learn about the causes and cures of asthma. \nBut we know air pollution triggers asthma attacks. We know air \npollution is a preventable problem. Armed with this knowledge, Rhode \nIsland has taken great strides to reduce air pollution.\n  In 2006, Rhode Island passed a law to prohibit cars and buses from \nidling with their engines on.\n  In 2007, Rhode Island passed a law to retrofit all State school buses \nwith diesel pollution controls.\n  In 2010, Rhode Island began requiring heavy-duty vehicles used in \nfederally funded construction projects to install diesel pollution \ncontrols, adhere to the State anti-idling law, and use only low-sulfur \ndiesel fuel.\n  RIPTA has voluntarily retrofitted half its bus fleet with diesel \npollution control equipment.\n  However, Rhode Island cannot solve its air pollution problem on its \nown. We could stop driving entirely and shut down every industry in our \nState, and we would still have problems with ground-level ozone and \nparticulate matter pollution. Why is that? Because, as EPA has \ndetermined, most of the pollution that lands in Rhode Island is sent to \nus by other States. Much of that out-of-State pollution comes from \nvirtually uncontrolled Midwestern coal-fired powerplants that are tied \nto excessively tall smokestacks that send pollution hundreds of miles \naway from the source.\n  Last month, at my request, the Government Accountability Office \ncompleted a report about tall smokestacks at coal powerplants. Here is \nwhat the report said: In 1970, the year the Clean Air Act was enacted, \nthere were two tall stacks--stacks over 500 feet--in the United States. \nBy 1985, this number of tall stacks had grown from 2 to more than 180. \nUtilities and industry literally built their way into compliance with \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  The trend continued. As of December 31, 2010, at the end of last \nyear, 284 tall stacks were operating at 172 coal powerplants in the \nUnited States. These tall smokestacks are associated with 64 percent of \nthe coal generating capacity in our country. Most of the coal \ngenerating capacity in our country vents its pollution through tall \nsmokestacks.\n  Most of the tall stacks--207 of them or nearly three-quarters of \nthem--are between 500 and 699 feet tall; 63 of them are between 700 and \n999 feet tall. The remaining 14 are over 1,000 feet tall. The tallest \nstack at a coal powerplant in the United States is 1,038 feet, which is \nat the Rockport Powerplant in Indiana. This graphic compares some of \nthese stacks with some of the well-known landmarks in our country. Here \nis the Statue of Liberty, at 305 feet; the Washington Monument, at 555 \nfeet; and here are stacks at 1,000 feet, 1,038, and 12,004 feet--the \nEmpire State Building in New York and the Willis Tower in Chicago.\n  As I have noted in previous floor remarks, once a stack gets over \n1,000 feet, it has to be actually marked on aviation maps as a hazard \nto avoid plane collisions.\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\n  What do I mean when I say the utilities built their way into \ncompliance with these tall stacks? In the early days of the Clean Air \nAct, some States allowed pollution sources to build tall stacks instead \nof installing pollution controls. The concept was that pollution sent \nhigh enough into the atmosphere would be sent far away from the source \nand it would not contribute to the air pollution problem in that State \nand everybody would be happy.\n  The problem is, this air pollution causes problems downwind in other \nStates. As the GAO report put it, ``Tall stacks generally disperse \npollutants over greater distances than shorter stacks and provide \npollutants greater time to react in the atmosphere to form ozone and \nparticulate matter,'' which are the precursors to asthma. Yet public \nhealth policy has not yet caught up with this practice. Rhode Island \npays the price.\n  Making matters worse, the GAO found that more than half the boilers \nattached to these tall stacks at the coal powerplants have no scrubber \nto control sulfur dioxide emissions--none. Approximately 85 percent of \nthese boilers went into service before 1980, so they are antiquated and \ndirty and they run the pollution up the tall stack and it ends up being \ndumped on Rhode Island instead of cleaned up at the source. Nearly two-\nthirds of boilers connected to these tall stacks have no postcombustion \ncontrols for nitrogen oxide--controls that are vastly more effective \nthan so-called low NOX burners. Again, uncontrolled at the \nsource, they dump the pollution up the tall stacks, export it \nelsewhere, and it is not their problem, but it then lands on Rhode \nIsland.\n  Here is a graphic that shows more than 70 coal plants which have tall \nstacks at boilers that operate without scrubbers or postcombustion \nnitrogen oxide controls. These boilers are sending hundreds of \nthousands of tons of unabated pollution up very tall smokestacks, into \nthe jetstream, and the jetstream delivers it downwind onto States such \nas Rhode Island.\n  As the GAO indicated:\n\n       In the Mid-Atlantic United States, the wind generally blows \n     from west to east during the day . . . ozone can travel \n     hundreds of miles at night with the help of high-speed winds \n     known as the low-level jet. This phenomenon typically occurs \n     at night . . . due to the ground cooling quicker than the \n     upper atmosphere, which can allow the low-level jet to form \n     and transport ozone and particulate matter with its high \n     winds.\n\n  The map shows a typical prevailing wind pattern in the spring. Notice \nhow the prevailing winds send so much of the pollution up and over to \nRhode Island and other States along the eastern seaboard. In fact, five \nof the States on this map--Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois, \nand North Carolina--have been identified by EPA as contributing \nsignificantly to Rhode Island's pollution problems.\n  The electricity that comes from these uncontrolled powerplants, which \ndon't stop the pollution at the start but instead jet it up into this \nlow-level jet so it gets dumped in other States--the electricity coming \nfrom them might seem cheaper to consumers than electricity from a \npollution-controlled powerplant. But that is not so. That would be \nwrong to consider or to conclude. The costs weren't cheaper. The costs \njust got shifted. They got shifted from the companies and the consumers \nin the polluting States to the lungs of children in Rhode Island and \nother downwind States. It is the lungs of children and adults and \nseniors in Rhode Island that are actually paying for that cheap \nelectricity.\n\n  Happily, and at last, the EPA has begun to remedy this unfair and \nwrongful public health situation by requiring utilities in upwind \nStates to control their pollution under the good neighbor provision of \nthe Clean Air Act, because while a tall stack will send uncontrolled \npollution farther than a short stack would, the most effective way to \nreduce pollution is to install pollution controls.\n  Prompted by petitions from our downwind States, the Bush EPA \nattempted to set pollution limits for States that contribute to \nunhealthy pollution levels outside their borders. However, on review, \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals told them they had not gone far enough. \nSo the EPA went back to the drawing board and crafted the cross-State \nair pollution rule that has been announced today, which will cap the \npollution that can be produced in upwind States, such as Ohio, \nPennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois, and North Carolina. Those caps \nwere designed based on each State's contribution to pollution in States \nsuch as Rhode Island, and it will ratchet down whenever EPA tightens \nair quality standards based on the latest and best science.\n  As I said, that rule was finalized today. So I thank the EPA. I \ncommend the EPA for finalizing that cross-State air pollution rule. I \nalso urge EPA to update the national ozone air quality standard based \non the recommendations from the CASAC--the Clean Air Science Advisory \nCommittee. This will lead to further pollution reductions in States \nupwind of Rhode Island and further benefit Rhode Islanders.\n  These rules will bring us closer to the day when the coal powerplants \non this chart start taking responsibility for their pollution and stop \nexporting that pollution into Rhode Island and other States, when they \ninstall pollution control equipment rather than sending their pollution \nto where it becomes someone else's problem, and to when Rhode Island \nchildren can play outdoors safely without the risk of an asthma attack. \nI am looking forward to that day, and I know the people of Rhode Island \nare too.\n  When you drive in and that morning radio tells you today is another \nbad air day and that children and seniors should stay indoors and can't \nplay, can't take a walk, can't engage in anything that involves any \nexertion, it is frustrating when there is nothing you can do about it. \nThe Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management could pass \nregulations until it was blue in the face. The Rhode Island General \nAssembly could write new laws all day long and it would make no \ndifference because the bombardment of outside pollution on our State is \nwhat is driving these health problems. That is why EPA is so important. \nWe would have no voice in this if it were not for a National \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that can look out for small States such \nas ours that are on the receiving end of this kind of a pollution dump \nfrom the uncontrolled coal-fired plants in the Midwest.\n  I thank very much the Presiding Officer, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to add a few words this \nafternoon about the ongoing negotiations on the Federal budget and on \nour rapidly approaching debt ceiling.\n  I think we all agree that the situation we face is one of enormous \nimportance and complexity. I believe every responsible person also \nagrees a failure to act would have awful repercussions that would \njeopardize or worsen our fragile and tentative economic recovery. So I \nthink the responsible view is, it is imperative we act and it is also \nclear to do so will require every side to make concessions.\n  I rise this afternoon, however, because it is my strong belief that \nany agreement we reach must be based on real savings and must not be \nmade at the expense of our most vulnerable citizens. That is why I am \nso concerned about reports that Social Security and Medicare have been \nraised as possible sources of deficit reduction. Cuts to Social \nSecurity and to Medicare benefits should not be on the table. Social \nSecurity is not the cause of the deficit, never has been the cause of \nthe deficit, and beneficiaries of Social Security should not be made to \nshoulder the burden of deficit reduction.\n  Social Security is funded through the contributions of our Nation's \nworkers and businesses. It has an enormous surplus and is projected to \nbe fully solvent for another quarter century. So while I would agree \nwith steps to strengthen Social Security, any changes should be \nconsidered independent of our effort to reduce the deficit, and we \nshould not cut Social Security benefits.\n  I helped cofound the Senate defending Social Security caucus for this \nvery reason. The solvency of the Social Security program can be \nextended significantly just by applying payroll\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\ntaxes to a greater portion of the earnings of millionaires and \nbillionaires. What we have seen in this country is a huge shift of \nincome going more and more to the uppermost economic reaches and less \nand less to the middle class. The middle class has actually lost income \nin the last decade. So the contributions to Social Security are lower \nbecause there is less income to draw it off of and the income that is \nabove the $106,000 Social Security cap is where the explosion of income \nhas been and they contribute not a nickel from that income to Social \nSecurity.\n  So there is a lot we can do to support Social Security, but what we \nshould not do is give in to any of the calls to put our seniors' \nsecurity at risk in the stock market by privatizing Social Security or \nincreasing the retirement age so that a construction worker or a \nwaitress who works on their feet all day long has to put in more years \nof service at that age--when their body, frankly, might not be up to it \nany longer--or to cut benefits through backdoor methods by lowering the \ncost-of-living adjustment.\n  The Rhode Island seniors I have heard from at my community dinners \nand senior centers around the State I have visited are very concerned \nwhat would happen if their benefits were cut.\n  Audrey, from Middletown, told me that after her husband died, she had \nmany expenses but, as she said, ``no income except for his Social \nSecurity check which enabled me to go on living--simply but adequately \nwithout being a burden on my sons and losing my dignity as well.''\n  Two very important points Audrey makes. One is that Social Security \nis not just a benefit to Social Security recipients. It is a benefit to \nthe children of Social Security recipients, on whom their parents might \notherwise be a burden. It is an American value that senior citizens who \nhave worked hard all their lives, who have played by the rules, who \nhave built the America we now enjoy should be able to draw on so as not \nto lose their dignity at the end of their life.\n  That is a principle that is worth defending.\n  Ronald from Cumberland, RI, had been on Social Security for a number \nof years. He wrote to say: It seems that it's always the people who \nneed the help the most who get cut from the Federal Government. Why is \nthis? No Social Security cost of living adjustment for 2 years, yet \nprices for the basic needs still rise. In a country like the United \nStates of America, this should not happen.\n  These people who are living on Social Security income are not living \nhigh off the hog, and they should not be the targets of our cost-\ncutting zeal.\n  The threat to the Medicare Program is just as real. Earlier this \nyear, Republicans over in the House of Representatives passed a budget \nthat would end the Medicare Program as we have come to know it for \nfuture generations. I can remember being at a senior center in North \nProvidence, and a gentleman sitting at a table said to me: You know, I \nhave helped build this country; I have fought in its wars; And I \nunderstand that the Republican proposal will protect Medicare for me; \nbut I am not willing to let Medicare for my children be thrown under \nthe bus. That would make me feel awful. It simply isn't right for me to \nstay on it and stand for the program to be taken apart and dismembered \nfor everybody else.\n  That was a moving statement for me to hear, and we need to honor \nthat.\n  Estimates suggest that the House Republicans' proposal would end up \nforcing a typical 65-year-old senior to pay, on average, $12,500 each \nyear in out-of-pocket expenses starting in 2022. That is more than \ndouble what a senior is estimated to pay than if the current system of \nMedicare stayed in place.\n  In Rhode Island, the average senior only gets about $14,200 per year \nfrom Social Security to begin with. So if you are going to ask people \nwho now have $14,200 a year, who aren't getting cost-of-living \nadjustments by 2022 to pay $12,500 for Medicare, that would be a \nmassive exercise in poverty creation, and what Medicare and Social \nSecurity have done is lifted the burden of poverty from America's \nseniors. I think sometimes we are blind to what life might be like \nwithout them, when some of our colleagues so cavalierly suggest that we \nshould do away with these programs, privatize them, or turn them over \nto the insurance industry.\n  The Republican budget would also reopen the Medicare prescription \ndrug doughnut hole. We went through a lot of effort to close that \ndoughnut hole in the Affordable Care Act. That doughnut hole will be \ngone in 10 years, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans \nall voted against the Affordable Care Act. They all voted against \nclosing the doughnut hole. And now in their budget on the other side \nthey want to unwind that part of the bill and take away the protections \nwe have provided for seniors in the doughnut hole. That would cost \nmillions of dollars to seniors in Rhode Island starting next year if it \nwere put into law. That is not something off in the future. That is \nright now, thousands of Rhode Island seniors having to cough up \nmillions of dollars because of this Republican House budget plan. That \nis something I think we need to defend against. That is the wrong place \nto look.\n  It is especially the wrong place to look as we find our Republican \ncolleagues fighting so hard to protect tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires. I have given the speech repeatedly already, so I won't \ndwell on it now. But when our Republican colleagues stand and say, We \nare against tax hikes, it is important for Americans to look behind the \ncurtain and see who they are defending, because I will tell you, \neverybody in this Chamber, Republican and Democrat alike, believes that \nordinary American families earning ordinary levels of income should be \nexempt from any tax hikes. That is not even on the table.\n  When our Republican colleagues talk about defending against tax \nhikes, they are talking about defending the oil industry from having \nsubsidies they don't need and that taxpayers pay for taken away. They \nare talking about protecting the top 400 income earners in the country \nwho, on average, pay Federal taxes, actually paid in--this isn't a \ntheory, this isn't a rate; this is what they actually paid in, \naccording to the IRS--18.2 percent. These are people who made on \naverage more than $\\1/4\\ billion, with a B--$1 billion with a B, in 1 \nyear. And God bless them. What a wonderful thing it is to make more \nthan $\\1/4\\ billion in 1 year. But they pay taxes at lower rate than a \ntruckdriver in Rhode Island does on average; the guy who wakes up every \nmorning and gets into his clothes and puts on his boots and gets in the \ntruck and goes out there and works all day, pays the same tax rate as \nthe person earning over $\\1/4\\ billion.\n  They can talk about tax hikes until they are blue in the face. It \nwon't take away the fact that is the way it actually works in this \ncountry, and they are defending that and going after Audrey and the \nfolks on Medicare in Rhode Island and Ronald from Cumberland. That is \nnot right, and we need to argue about that and fight back.\n  We can never overlook what Medicare and Social Security have \ncontributed to our Nation's prosperity. It is not just the benefit for \nthe Medicare beneficiary, it is not just the benefit for the Social \nSecurity recipient. It is the freedom we all feel knowing we will have \na dignified old age; that we won't be at the mercy of Wall Street, that \nwe won't be at the mercy of a private insurance company; that we will \nhave the efficient and effective services that Medicare and Social \nSecurity deliver. We can know that now and enjoy that. We have more \nfreedom as Americans now because we can make bolder choices in our \nlives knowing that we don't have to defend ourselves against that kind \nof poverty and that kind of misery in our old age. Our children can \nmake bolder choices in their lives knowing that they don't have to \nsafeguard against a parent's illness ruining their own financial \nfutures, ruining their family's financial futures.\n  Imagine how awful it must feel for a parent in that circumstance, if \nin your old age you become grievously ill and the only resource you \nhave is to essentially wipe out your children who feel a moral \nobligation to take care of your medical expenses and put themselves \ninto poverty and misery as a result of your illness. What an awful \nhuman tragedy that is for the people involved. And we don't experience \nthat tragedy in America. We don't experience it because Medicare and \nSocial Security are there.\n  The challenge before us is a formidable one, but I truly believe we \ncan\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nreach an agreement on the deficit and the debt ceiling without \ncompromising the security and the well-being of our seniors. I believe \nthe Democratic Budget Committee's proposed budget is a good model for \nhow we can actually do it, and I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion. It is not necessary, in order to solve our immediate \ndeficit problems and to get through this debt limit fight, to take our \nseniors and put Social Security and Medicare that they have relied on \nat risk; to take this country whose prosperity Social Security and \nMedicare do so much to support, and knock that down with a tax on \nSocial Security and Medicare. It is not right, it is not necessary, and \nwe should stand against it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I express my appreciation to \nyou, presiding all these hours you have this afternoon, but I also wish \nto take just a minute and thank these pages. This is the first time \nsince 1974 the Senate has been in session during a July 4 recess \nperiod--since 1974. These young pages had places to be with their \nfamilies during the summer vacation period. They are juniors in high \nschool. They have some plans, I am sure, that we interfered with. But \nregarding the work we have done this week, while there has not been a \nlot of time on the floor, there are a lot of things going on all over \nWashington. There have been meetings at the White House, there have \nbeen meetings with the Vice President, with the President, with the \nSpeaker, and others, working on this very important issue.\n  When these eight pages in later years reflect back on the fact that \nthey were here the first time since 1974 when we were in session over a \nJuly 4 recess period, they should reflect that we were here for \nimportant reasons. If we do what is right, we will rein in this debt \nthe country has and protect the most needy of our country.\n  I apologize for keeping them here. They should not have had to be \nhere this week, but they have stayed because they have an obligation as \npages to be here and they accepted that. They have kept the Senate \nrunning smoothly. We need them. They are helpful to us. They didn't \nhave to be asked; each one of these eight pages volunteered: Naomi \nBiden, Brynn DiNino, Claire Karsting, William Maas, Aliza Reisner, \nMorgan Wissel, Keira Harris, and Chaffee Duckers.\n  I appreciate very much their service and wish them the best in their \neducational endeavors in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4446-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, for nearly 40 years, legendary singer and \nsongwriter Barry Manilow has inspired and dazzled millions of people \nwith his musical talents. He has sold more than 80 million records \nworldwide and has written countless iconic hits.\n  However, I come to the floor today not to discuss his talent but to \nrecognize my friend for another one of his remarkable accomplishments--\nhis ongoing efforts to help preserve music education in public schools \nin Nevada and across this country.\n  In recent years, significant budget cuts to public education have \nforced schools to eliminate a number of important programs. Sadly, \nmusic programs are often one of the first casualties. In response to \nthis disturbing trend, Mr. Manilow started the Manilow Music Project, \nwhich helps public schools continue their music programs. The project \ndonates instruments and materials to public schools and provides music \nscholarships to high school students to further their music education \nat the college level. Since 2008, the organization has donated hundreds \nof thousands of dollars worth of instruments and materials to secondary \nand high school music programs across the country.\n  A wonderful example of the impact of the Manilow Music Project \noccurred last year in Nevada. During one of Mr. Manilow's recent tours \nin Las Vegas, in exchange for donations of new or gently used musical \ninstruments, he offered tickets to attend one of his concerts. The \ncollected instruments, valued at more than $500,000, were then donated \nto fifteen schools in the Clark County School District, the school \ndistrict that serves the Las Vegas Valley. This gift--the largest \ndonation of its kind for Clark County--has provided more than 600 \nstudents with the opportunity to experience the joys of playing a \nmusical instrument.\n  In addition to his donations to the district, Mr. Manilow has also \nhelped foster music appreciation. He recently invited four different \nClark County School District school choirs to perform in his holiday \nshows and provided show tickets valued at more than $30,000 for nearly \n500 students and their parents or chaperones.\n  I would like to thank Barry for his dedication to the Las Vegas \ncommunity and his efforts to keep music alive in Nevada's schools. I am \nso pleased that he has been able to share his love of music with \nthousands of aspiring musicians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4446-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4446-S4447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VA'S MENTOR--PROTEGE PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments of the 24 participants in the Department of Veterans \nAffairs' Mentor-Protege Program who are working to help veteran small \nbusiness owners. In these hard economic times, it is more important \nthan ever to provide this critical support to our veteran \nentrepreneurs.\n  The goal of the Mentor-Protege Program, which was started in 2010, is \nto bring together established companies with service-disabled and other \nveteran-owned businesses. Through these partnerships with established \nregional businesses, veteran business owners receive guidance on \nfinancial and organizational management, business planning and \ntechnical aid. They also develop long-term business relationships with \ntheir mentor partners.\n  Veterans hire veterans because they know what they are getting. \nVeterans are well trained, disciplined team players who can deliver \nresults in challenging conditions. At a time when the Department of \nLabor reports almost 10 percent of all veterans are unemployed, and 27 \npercent of veterans between the ages of 20 and 24 are unemployed, it is \nimperative we do everything in our power to tackle this issue. The \nMentor-Protege program holds the promise of fostering an environment \nwhere veteran-owned businesses can succeed in helping to revitalize our \neconomy while hiring veterans in the process. These veteran-owned small \nbusinesses are exactly what our Nation needs to continue on the road to \neconomic recovery while getting our country's heroes the jobs they \ndeserve.\n  While I am optimistic about the potential of the VA's Mentor-Protege \nProgram, I have heard from several companies participating in the \nprogram who have expressed concerns with delays in VA's verification \nprocess. I urge VA's Center for Veterans Enterprise to expedite the \nverification process so that these companies can get to work in \nrepairing our economy as quickly as possible.\n  Businesses in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, \nTexas, New Mexico, and California are serving as a model of just how \nsuccessful a program of this nature can be. The names of the businesses \nthat are participating in the program, both as mentors and proteges, \nare:\n  ASM Research, Inc. of Fairfax, VA, and Coley & Associates of San \nAntonio, TX, AUI Contractors, LLC of Fort Worth, TX, and Unified \nServices of Texas, of South Lake, TX, Bear Construction Company of \nRolling Meadows, IL, and Opcon Inc. of Chicago, IL, Booz Allen Hamilton \nof McLean, VA,\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nand MBL Technologies, Inc., of Rockville, MD, Creative Computing \nSolutions, Inc. of Rockville, MD, and CPS Professional Services of \nFairfax, VA, EMJ Corporation of Sacramento, CA, and 347 Group \nConstruction of Roseville, CA, The George Solitt Construction Co. of \nWood Dale, IL, and Industria, Inc. of Chicago, IL, The GRD Contractors, \nInc. of Costa Mesa, CA, and Hubzone Corp. of Rancho Cucamonga, CA, \nHarris Corporation GCSD of Melbourne, FL, and Delta Corporation of \nFulton, MD, Health Net Federal Services of Rancho Cordova, CA, and \nThree Wire Systems of Vienna, VA, ICF Incorporated of Fairfax, VA, and \nNova Technology Solutions of Fairborn, OH, JOB Options, Inc. of San \nDiego, CA, and VETSUSA, LLC. of Falls Church, VA, Leopardo Companies, \nInc. of Hoffman Estates, IL, and Segovia Group Corporation of San \nAntonio, TX, Lockheed Martin Corporation of Fairfax, VA, and Fulcrum \nVets, LLC of Fairfax, VA, Marous Brothers Construction of Willoughby, \nOH, and Northstar Contracting, Inc. of North Olmstead, OH, McKesson \nCorporation of San Francisco, CA, and The Stay Safe Store of El Dorado \nHills, CA, Metters Industries of McLean, VA, and Global Technology \nSolutions, LLC. of Corrales, NM, Northrup Grumman Corporation of \nRockville, MD, and Heitech Services, Inc. of Landover, MD, Reva, Inc. \nof Newark, NJ, and M.E.R.I.T.

Mr. President, I rise to make remarks on the \nintroduction of the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act. I would like \nto thank Senators Sherrod Brown and Lisa Murkowski for joining me in \nthis bipartisan effort, as well as the House sponsors, Representatives \nGene Green, Mike Thompson, Steven LaTourette, and Lee Terry.\n  Significant amounts of U.S. electronic waste are currently exported \nto developing countries that handle the waste in an unsafe manner. Much \nof this waste contains toxic materials, such as lead and mercury, and \nthe workers who disassemble and process the electronics use crude, \nunsafe methods that can lead to health problems. This legislation would \nput an end to these dangerous practices. The Responsible Electronics \nRecycling Act would restrict the export of electronic waste, help boost \nthe U.S. recycling industry, and support efforts to domestically \nrecover rare earth materials found in electronics.\n  The United States is the only developed country that has not ratified \nthe Basel Convention, which prohibits exports of hazardous waste to \ndeveloping countries. Under the convention, much of the U.S. \nexportation of electronic waste to developing countries is illegal \nunder the laws of the receiving countries but unfortunately, these laws \nare poorly enforced.\n  If we recycled these materials in the U.S., it would create recycling \njobs for U.S. workers. Companies recycling in the U.S. often operate \nunder capacity because they cannot compete with the cheaper option of \nexporting electronic waste to developing countries. We should be \nprocessing this waste using U.S. workers, and many companies stand at \nthe ready to begin recycling additional electronic waste.\n  Moreover, the dumping of used electronics in the developing world can \ncome back to haunt us. Some countries have active underground markets \nfor U.S. hard drives, contributing to identity theft, as documented in \na 2009 Frontline investigation. Business Week reported in 2010 that \nused computer chips from old personal computers are fraudulently re-\nmarked in China as ``military grade'' chips and sold to U.S. military \nsuppliers. Given the risks to our armed forces from defective \nequipment, I have also introduced the Combating Military Counterfeits \nAct to enhance the ability of prosecutors to keep counterfeit goods out \nof the military supply chain.\n  One of the benefits of recycling electronic waste domestically is the \npotential to recover rare elements in the process. Rare earth materials \nare vital to a number of manufacturing processes, including for \nproducts such as hybrid car batteries and solar panels, yet prices have \nskyrocketed as global supply has tightened. According to the Department \nof Energy, recycled content from electronics could be a valuable \nsecondary source of rare earth materials, but additional research is \nrequired on recovery techniques and collection of electronic waste. \nThis act would establish the Rare Earth Materials Recycling Research \nInitiative at the Department of Energy to coordinate research into the \nrecovery of rare earth materials used in electronics.\n  The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act would also address the \nhealth, environmental, and national security concerns by amending the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the export of electronic waste to \ndeveloping countries, with certain exceptions. These exceptions include \nlegitimate exports of tested and working equipment, warranty returns, \nand recalls. There is also a de minimis exception to allow the export \nof materials that have so little toxicity they would not pose a risk to \nhuman health or the environment. Exporting under the exceptions would \nrequire a license and notice to the Environmental Protection Agency. \nAdditional restrictions apply to exports for warranties or recalls, \nincluding written consent from the receiving country. The act creates a \ncriminal penalty for knowingly exporting electronic waste, and provides \nthe EPA the authority to inspect establishments handling electronic \nwaste.\n  Twenty-five States, including Rhode Island, have passed electronic \nwaste recycling laws. States such as Rhode Island already seek to \nensure that their downstream recyclers do not export the electronic \nwaste but instead responsibly recycle it here in the U.S. But States \ncan only do so much and a federal law is needed to restrict these \nharmful exports.\n  We are pleased to have the support of a number of electronics \nmanufacturers and retailers, including Hewlett Packard, Dell, Apple, \nSamsung, and Best Buy. We are also pleased to have the endorsement of \n29 recyclers representing 74 recycling operations in 34 states. The \nbreadth of our coalition is a testament to the consensus that the \nharmful export of these products must stop.\n  With more and more Americans relying on new technologies and \ngenerating a growing amount of electronic waste each year, we must take \nsteps to properly dispose of this material. This legislation will crack \ndown on the dumping of electronic waste on developing countries, \nprotect American consumers from counterfeit schemes and identity theft, \nand support the growth of electronic waste recycling jobs in Rhode \nIsland and across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4447-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4447-S4448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JOHN MACKEY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Baltimore lost one of its most beloved \nadopted sons last night, former Baltimore Colt tight end John Mackey. \nJohn revolutionized the position and was the second tight end to be \nenshrined in the National Football League's, NFL, Hall of Fame. He \nbecame the first president of the NFL Players Association, NFLPA, after \nthe NFL merged with the old American Football League. He was a \ntenacious and effective advocate for the players, bargaining for higher \nsalaries and better benefits. He organized a 3-day strike early in his \ntenure that generated an additional $11 million in pensions and \nbenefits. Mackey also filed and won an antitrust lawsuit against the \nNFL which eliminated the so-called ``Rozelle Rule'' and ultimately \npaved the way for players' union to secure full free agency for its \nmembers.\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nFor the last 10 years, he suffered from dementia and had to move into \nan assisted living facility that cost much more than his pension. So he \nand his beloved wife Sylvia led the fight to convince the NFLPA and the \nNFL to establish the ``88 Plan,'' named for his uniform number, which \nprovides adult day care and nursing home care for retired players \nsuffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Even in death, John \ncontinues to give: Sylvia has announced that his brain will be donated \nto a Boston University School of Medicine study of brain damage in \nathletes. Researchers at the university's Center for the Study of \nTraumatic Encephalopathy are examining potential links between repeated \nconcussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, a condition \nwhich mirrors symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n  John Mackey grew up in Roosevelt, NY. He was a man of strong \nconvictions, a character trait he inherited from his father, who was a \nBaptist minister. John was offered an appointment to the U.S. Naval \nAcademy but turned it down to attend Syracuse University, where he \nstudied economics, became an All-American football player, and roomed \nwith Ernie Davis, who became the first African American to win the \nHeisman Trophy. The Colts drafted him in 1963 and he caught more \ntouchdown passes and gained more yards as a rookie than the team's two \nwide receivers, Hall of Famer Raymond Berry and Jimmy Orr. John was big \nand strong, like other tight ends of his era, but he could run after \ncatching a pass like no other tight end before him. As Hall of Fame \ncoach Don Shula said, ``Mackey gave us a tight end who weighed 230, ran \na 4.6 and could catch the bomb. It was a weapon other teams didn't \nhave.''\n  John was a three-time All-NFL selection. He played in five Pro Bowls. \nIn 1969, while still playing, he made the NFL's 50th anniversary team \nas pro football's all-time tight end. Over the course of his career, he \ncaught 38 touchdown passes, 13 of which were for 50 yards or more, \nincluding an 89-yarder against the Los Angeles Rams in 1966. That \nparticular touchdown pass was the longest of the 290 scoring passes in \nHall of Fame legend Johnny Unitas's career. In a 10-year career, John \ncaught 331 passes for 5,236 yards. Perhaps the biggest and most \nmemorable play in John's career came in the 1971 Super Bowl, when he \ncaught a pass from Unitas that had been deflected by two other \nplayers--Colts receiver Eddie Hinton and Dallas Cowboys defender Mike \nRenfro--and scored a touchdown on the 75-yard play. The Colts went on \nto win that game in dramatic fashion on Jim O'Brien's field goal with 5 \nseconds left in the game.\n  By the time John retired, he had already endeared himself to the \npeople of Baltimore, but he wasn't finished. He was elected to the Hall \nof Fame in 1992, but he refused to accept his ceremonial ring in \nIndianapolis, where the Colts had moved in 1984. He said, ``I will do \nit in Baltimore. That is where I played.'' And so he received his Hall \nof Fame ring in Memorial Stadium, at half-time of an exhibition game \nbetween Miami and New Orleans.\n  I send my deepest condolences to John's wife Sylvia, to whom he was \nmarried for 47 years; his son John Kevin Mackey of Atlanta; two \ndaughters Lisa Mackey Hazel of Bowie and Laura Mackey Nattans of \nBaltimore; and John and Sylvia's six grandchildren. John Mackey has \nbeen taken from us much too soon, but what a life he lived. He was one \nof the greatest collegiate and professional football players of all \ntime. The Mackey Award is given annually to the best tight end in \ncollege. He is enshrined in the Hall of Fame. He led the NFLPA and then \ncourageously led the fight for retired players which culminated in the \n``88 Plan.'' His accomplishments and legacy will endure in the hearts \nand minds of his fellow players and Baltimore Colts fans and football \nfans forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4448-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4448-S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EPA RULING\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Environmental Protection \nAgency took steps to make the air in Vermont cleaner by issuing the \nfinal cross-State air pollution rule.\n  In Vermont, we pride ourselves on our bucolic views, unspoiled \nwaterways, and our connection to the land. Yet, all of this is \nthreatened by pollution that is beyond our control, and coming from \nbeyond our borders. Vermont has always been a dumping ground, so to \nspeak, for emissions from coal-fired powerplants from other States. \nToxic pollution, generated in other parts of the country, blows into \nVermont and damages our State's scenic beauty, decreases the value of \nconservation investments, and damages our forests, lakes, rivers, and \nwetlands.\n  These powerplant emissions and air pollution are transported long \ndistances and not only mars our landscapes and threatens our health, \nbut it also costs downwind States and businesses billions of dollars \nannually. Our only defense against such activity is the Federal Clean \nAir Act. Today, with the implementation of the EPA's cross-State air \npollution rule, powerplants will be required to install new pollution \ncontrols that reduce the amount of dangerous emissions crossing State \nlines and entering Vermont. This will level the playing field by \nrequiring powerplants to make long overdue investments in proven, \nreadily available pollution control technologies that are already in \nplace at many powerplants.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule requires many fossil fuel-fired \npowerplants to slash emissions that cross State lines and contribute to \nground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other States. These \npollutants contribute to smog and air pollution which causes tens of \nthousands of Americans to become sick each year. Those most susceptible \nto illnesses related to poor air quality are often our most vulnerable \ncitizens. The elderly and children, especially those already suffering \nfrom respiratory disorders like asthma, are routinely forced to stay \ninside on poor air quality days.\n  Pollution is also responsible for thousands of new respiratory \nillnesses each year, adding more unnecessary costs to our health care \nsystem. In fact, the reductions contained in this rule would prevent \n14,000 to 36,000 premature deaths each year, 23,000 nonfatal heart \nattacks, 21,000 cases of acute bronchitis, 240,000 cases of aggravated \nasthma, and 1.9 million missed school and work days. The total benefits \nof this rule are estimated to be $120-290 billion.\n  Some believe these benefits are not worth the costs to industry. \nHowever, the cross-State air pollution rule is projected to cost \nindustry from $10-30 billion, a very modest amount compared to the \nfinancial benefits and deaths prevented by this rule. In addition, a \nutility-funded report recently contradicted arguments that the rule \nwill threaten U.S. electricity reliability. The reason for this is that \na majority of utilities have already taken steps to adapt to Federal \nrules. In fact, over half of the country's coal-fired powerplants have \nalready installed sulfur dioxide scrubbers or plan to install them. Of \nthose that had plans to retire units, they are doing so because they \nare inefficient and cannot compete in today's market, not because of \nthese rules.\n  In the end, only about one-fourth of the Nation's powerplants need to \ntake action. Are we going to let these plants, which have dragged their \nfeet, refusing to install new technology that would prevent pollution \nand prevent deaths and serious illness, continue to poison our air on \nthe public's dime?\n  No, instead we should encourage the use of cleaner technologies that \nwill lead to healthier air, increased efficiency, and a boost in jobs. \nOverall, regulations under the Clean Air Act have dramatically reduced \nair pollution while creating jobs and spurring American innovation in \nnew industries and technology. Reports show the creation of 1.5 million \njobs over the next 5 years and increased global exports of domestically \nproduced clean technologies. History has demonstrated that since 1970, \nevery dollar spent on compliance with the Clean Air Act has led to $4-\n$8 in economic benefits. By 2020, the total benefits of the Clean Air \nAct will reach $2 trillion.\n  Coming from a State with no coal-fired powerplants that has been on \nthe receiving end of these pollutants for far too long, I fully welcome \nthe final cross-State air pollution rule because I know that it will \nimprove the quality of life for Vermonters who are subject to the \nimpacts, and costs, of pollution from far beyond our borders. This rule \nis good for Vermont. It is good for the\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\ncountry. The Clean Air Act has been cleaning our air for over four \ndecades, while continuing to grow our economy. The final cross-State \nair pollution rule that was published today will encourage innovation \nand cost-savings and help powerplants achieve their mission of \nproviding clean, affordable, and reliable energy. I am happy to see the \nEPA use this tool, given to it by Congress, to protect the people and \nthe environment of Vermont and the rest of the country from pollution \ngenerated by distant industries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4449-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING DAVID GETCHES\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize the important \ncontributions of David Getches, who died earlier this week. He leaves \nbehind not only a family to whom he was intensely devoted, but also an \nimpressive legacy of public service, scholarship, mentorship, and \nfriendship.\n  Having served as both chairman and ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I am particularly appreciative of his \nremarkable scholarship and public service in the areas of natural \nresources law and policy. He was a prolific writer on water, public \nland, and Indian law and policy, and there are no doubt many dog-eared \ncopies of his books and articles on those subjects in our committee \nfiles. He was called on to testify as an expert in both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives, and his insight and creativity on those \nissues have had a positive impact on the legislation and oversight that \nare the responsibility of our committee and others.\n  While his resume of government service is notable--including special \nconsultant to Department of the Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and \ndirector of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources--it does not \nreflect the countless hours of knowledge and wisdom that David freely \nshared with government officials and staff who regularly sought his \ncounsel.\n  David was a dedicated teacher of many thousands of students at the \nUniversity of Colorado School of Law and a mentor to two of our \ncommittee staff who have worked on water and public lands issues. He \nwas returning to the faculty this summer after serving 8 years as dean \nof the School of Law.\n  David Getches distinguished himself throughout his career. But what I \nunderstand set him apart, was that, at the same time, he distinguished \nhimself as a father to his three children Liza, Catie, and Matthew and \nas a husband to his wife Ann. They have our deep sympathy as they \nendure this loss. He is greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4449-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 515.

A bill to prevent immigration fraud and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Immigration \nFraud Prevention Act of 2011. This legislation would provide a much-\nneeded tool for prosecutors to use to combat the exploitative actions \nof fraudulent lawyers and consultants who take advantage of individuals \nseeking immigration assistance.\n  The Immigration Fraud Prevention Act would punish fraud and \nmisrepresentation in the context of immigration proceedings. The act \nwould create a new Federal crime to penalize those who engage in \nschemes to defraud immigrants.\n  Specifically, the act would make it a Federal crime to knowingly and \nfalsely represent that an individual is an attorney or accredited \nrepresentative authorized to represent aliens in immigration \nproceedings; and to knowingly defraud or receive money or anything of \nvalue from any person by false or fraudulent pretences, \nrepresentations, or promises.\n  Violations of these crimes would result in a fine, imprisonment of \nnot more than 5 years, or both.\n  The bill would also work to combat immigration fraud by increasing \nthe awareness of notario fraud to immigrants.\n  The bill would require immigration courts to provide immigrants in \nremoval proceedings with information about notario fraud.\n  The bill would require the Justice Department to compile and make \navailable to the public a list of individuals and organizations that \nhave been convicted of immigration fraud; and permit only people who \nhave, within a 12-month period, represented immigrants pro bono appear \non the Justice Department's list of pro bono legal services.\n  By enacting this bill, Congress would help prevent more victims like \nMr. Ibarra, a Mexican national and father of four, who has resided in \nLos Angeles since 1988. Mr. Ibarra hired a so-called ``immigration \nspecialist'' and paid him over $7,500. In his apartment, Mr. Ibarra \nkeeps reams of documents that the immigration consultant claimed to \nhave filed on his behalf but never did--as Mr. Ibarra subsequently \nlearned from immigration authorities when he was placed into removal \nproceedings. I wish I could tell you that this kind of egregious \nbehavior is uncommon, but sadly, that is not the case.\n  Last November, the San Francisco City Attorney filed a lawsuit \nagainst a former lawyer who ran an illicit immigration law practice. In \nthe three decades in which the lawyer was licensed to practice law, he \nwas reported on numerous occasions to the California bar for his \nunethical behavior that included collecting exorbitant fees; \nrepresenting clients in a negligent manner; and misleading immigrants \nwith assurances of favorable outcomes.\n  Eventually, the lawyer resigned from the legal profession and was \nprohibited from representing clients before the Board of Immigration \nAppeals. The terms of his resignation prevented him from practicing law \nor portraying himself as eligible to practice law. Instead of abiding \nby these terms, the lawyer proceeded to set up another law practice \nthrough which he defrauded over two hundred immigrants, depleting many \nof these victims of their entire life savings.\n  I am pleased that last month the Federal Government partnered with \nState prosecutors and immigration advocacy organizations to launch a \nnationwide campaign to combat these harmful schemes. The enactment of \nthis bill would enhance the government's ability to achieve the goals \nof this national campaign by providing prosecutors with a tough new \nFederal criminal law that could be used to convict fraudulent-lawyers \nand consultants who prey on immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I urge support for the Immigration Fraud Prevention \nAct of 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 31, United States Code, \nto establish the Office of Regulatory Integrity within the Office of \nManagement and Budget; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bills that I \nam introducing today to address a serious and persistent threat to the \nintegrity of our government: regulatory capture.\n  Over the last 50 years, Congress has tasked an alphabet soup of \nregulatory agencies to administer our laws through rule-making, \nadjudication, and enforcement. Protecting the proper functioning of \nthese regulatory agencies has led me to the topic of regulatory \ncapture. I held a hearing on the subject last year in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and now am filing two bills that will make our \ngovernment more resistant to the ever-growing power of special \ninterests. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing these important \ngood-government measures.\n  At bottom, regulatory capture is a threat to democratic government. \n``We the People'' pass laws through a democratic and open process. \nPowerful interests then seek to ``capture'' the regulatory agencies \nthat enforce those laws so that they can avoid their intended effect, \nturning laws passed to protect the public interest into regulations and \nenforcement practices that benefit limited private interests.\n  This concept of ``regulatory capture'' is well-established in \nregulatory and economic theory.\n  In 1913, Woodrow Wilson wrote this: ``If the government is to tell \nbig business men how to run their business, then don't you see that big \nbusiness men .  .  . must capture the government, in order not to be \nrestrained too much by it?''\n  The first dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, Marver Bernstein, wrote \nthat a regulatory commission will tend over time to ``become more \nconcerned with the general health of the industry,'' and try ``to \nprevent changes which will adversely affect'' the industry. This, he \nsaid, ``is a problem of ethics and morality as well as administrative \nmethod''; ``a blow to democratic government and responsible political \ninstitutions.'' Ultimately he said it leads to ``surrender'': ``The \ncommission finally becomes a captive of the regulated groups.''\n  Regulatory capture has been the subject of work by Nobel laureate \nGeorge Stigler in his article ``The Theory of Economic Regulation.'' \nStudents of administrative law know how well established the doctrine \nof ``regulatory capture'' or ``agency capture'' is in that field.\n  Last year, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute wrote in the Wall \nStreet Journal about ``a striking example of regulatory capture.'' He \ndescribed the phenomenon this way: ``Agencies tasked with protecting \nthe public interest come to identify with the regulated industry and \nprotect its interests against that of the public. The result: \nGovernment fails to protect the public.'' His example was the Minerals \nManagement Service, in relation to the BP oil spill.\n  The failures of MMS in the lead up to the oil spill in the Gulf of \nMexico, the cozy relationship between MMS officials and industry \nexecutives, and the shameful behavior of some MMS employees are \narchetypal symptoms of regulatory capture. But the report of the \ncommission on the Gulf oil spill never mentioned ``regulatory \ncapture.''\n  That is a pretty strong signal that regulatory capture isn't getting \nthe attention it deserves.\n  When you think about the century-long academic and policy debate \nabout regulatory capture, and when you look at the cost of recent \ndisasters in areas regulated by the Minerals Management Service, the \nMine Safety and Health Administration, and the Securities Exchange \nCommission, it seems pretty evident that Congress should be concerned \nnot only about those prior incidents, but about addressing the threat \nof future regulatory capture. The experts I have spoken with in my home \nstate of Rhode Island certainly understand that regulatory capture \nmatters. They don't want a captured agency to allow the next oil spill \nor other man-made disaster to happen in our state, or for a financial \nagency to allow speculators to wipe out the savings of our citizens. \nSurely constituents of each of the members of this body would agree \nwhole-heartedly.\n  That is why I am introducing two pieces of legislation today.\n  The first bill is called the Regulatory Capture Prevention Act. It \nwould create an office within the Office of Management and Budget with \nthe authority to investigate and report regulatory capture. The office \nwould ensure that abuses were not overlooked, and sound the alarm if a \nregulatory agency were overwhelmed by a more sophisticated and better-\nresourced regulated industry. Scrutiny and publicity are powerful tools \nfor protecting the integrity of our regulatory agencies. This bill \nwould employ them to prevent powerful interests from coopting our laws.\n  The second bill is called the Regulatory Information Reporting Act. \nIt would shed extra sunlight into regulatory agencies by requiring them \nto report to a public Web site the following: first, the name and \naffiliation of each party that comments on an agency regulation; \nsecond, whether that party affected the regulatory process; and \nfinally, whether that party is an economic, noneconomic, or citizen \ninterest. By centralizing this information for public and congressional \nscrutiny, the bill would create a simple dashboard for hints of \nregulatory capture in agency rulemaking.\n  As the Senate considers these bills, we should remember how much \nagreement exists about regulatory capture. During the hearing I chaired \non regulatory capture last year, all of the witnesses, from across the \nideological spectrum, agreed on each of the following 7 propositions. \nFirst, regulatory capture is a real phenomenon and a threat to the \nintegrity of government. Second, regulated entities have a concentrated \nincentive to gain as much influence as possible over regulators, \nopposed by a diffuse public interest. Third, regulated industries \nordinarily have substantial organizational and resource advantages in \nthe regulatory process when compared to public interest groups. Fourth, \nsome regulatory processes lend themselves to gaming by regulated \nentities seeking undue control over regulation. Fifth, regulatory \ncapture by its nature happens in the dark--done as quietly as possible; \nno industry puts up a flag announcing its capture of a regulatory \nagency. Sixth, the potential damage from regulatory capture is \nenormous. Finally, effective congressional oversight is key to keeping \nregulators focused on the public interest.\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\n  With that as a starting point, I am hopeful that the Senate can agree \non legislation to address this very real problem. Administrative law \nmay not be the most glamorous subject, but I hope to work with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to eliminate regulatory capture.\n  This is so important because for as long as there are regulatory \nagencies, regulated industries, and money, there will be efforts at \nregulatory capture.

Res. 227\n\n       Whereas the Mekong River is the world's 12th longest river, \n     originating on the Tibetan Plateau and flowing nearly 3,000 \n     miles down through China into Burma, Thailand, Laos, \n     Cambodia, and Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Lower Mekong River in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, \n     and Vietnam is a source of fresh water, food, and economic \n     opportunity for more than 60,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the Mekong River is second in biodiversity only to \n     the Amazon River, with an estimated 1,500 different species \n     of fish, of which at least a third migrate up the river and \n     tributaries in their life cycle, including the majority of \n     the commercial fish catch;\n       Whereas the Mekong River supports the world's two largest \n     rice exporters, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as the world's \n     largest inland fishery of 4,000,000 tons of freshwater fish \n     per year, providing up to $9,000,000,000 annual income and \n     approximately 80 percent of the animal protein consumed in \n     the Lower Mekong Basin;\n       Whereas China is constructing a cascade of up to 15 dams \n     along the mainstream of the Upper Mekong River, and Thailand, \n     Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam are planning to construct or \n     finance the construction of up to 11 dams on the lower half \n     of the river's mainstream;\n       Whereas scientific studies have cautioned that mainstream \n     dam construction will negatively affect the river's water \n     flow, fish population, and wildlife;\n       Whereas the Mekong River Commission is a river basin \n     management organization including the governments of \n     Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam that have signed the \n     Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development \n     of the Mekong River Basin, done at Chiang Rai, Thailand, \n     April 5, 1995, and agreed to cooperate on management of the \n     river and ``development of the full potential of sustainable \n     benefits to all riparian States'';\n       Whereas the members of the Commission have also agreed to \n     ``make every effort to avoid, minimize and mitigate harmful \n     effects that might occur to the environment, especially the \n     water quantity and quality, the aquatic (eco-system) \n     conditions, and ecological balance of the river system, from \n     the development and use of the Mekong River Basin water \n     resources or discharge of wastes and return flows'';\n       Whereas the Mekong River Commission sponsored a Strategic \n     Environmental Assessment of the proposed series of mainstream \n     dams along the Lower Mekong River, concluding that the \n     decision to move forward with even one dam would result in \n     permanent and irreversible changes to the river's \n     productivity and regional environment;\n       Whereas such changes could threaten the region's food \n     security, block fish migration routes, increase risks to \n     aquatic biodiversity, reduce sediment flows, increase saline \n     intrusion, reduce agricultural production, and destabilize \n     the river channels and coastline along the Mekong Delta;\n       Whereas the United States has significant economic and \n     strategic interests in the Mekong River subregion that may be \n     jeopardized if the construction of mainstream dams places the \n     region's stability at risk;\n       Whereas the Department of State initiated the Lower Mekong \n     Initiative in July 2009 to engage Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, \n     and Vietnam on water security issues, to build regional \n     capacity, and to facilitate multilateral cooperation on \n     effective water resources management;\n       Whereas funding for the Lower Mekong Initiative has \n     primarily focused on the environment, health, and education, \n     leaving the fourth pillar--infrastructure--largely unfunded;\n       Whereas attention to infrastructure development is a \n     critical element of promoting the sustainable, coordinated \n     construction of hydropower dams in the region;\n       Whereas, on September 22, 2010, Laos submitted for review \n     to the Mekong River Commission the proposal for the Xayaburi \n     Dam, the first of nine mainstream dams planned by Laos along \n     the Lower Mekong River;\n       Whereas, on April 19, 2011, the Mekong River Commission's \n     Joint Committee representatives met to discuss the Xayaburi \n     project without reaching consensus on whether the project \n     should proceed, but agreed during the meeting to table the \n     decision and consider it at a later date at a higher, \n     ministerial level; and\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2011, the Government of Laos agreed to \n     temporarily suspend work on the Xayaburi dam and announced \n     plans to conduct further environmental assessments on the \n     project in response to regional concerns: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on United States representatives at multilateral \n     development banks to use the voice and vote of the United \n     States to support strict adherence to international \n     environmental standards for any financial assistance to \n     hydropower dam projects on the mainstream of the Mekong \n     River;\n       (2) encourages greater United States engagement with the \n     Mekong River countries through the Lower Mekong Initiative \n     and increased support for sustainable infrastructure and \n     water security in Southeast Asia;\n       (3) calls on the United States Government in leading the \n     Lower Mekong Initiative to devote greater attention to and \n     funding for capacity building projects on infrastructure and \n     to assist in identifying sustainable economic, water, and \n     energy alternatives to mainstream hydropower dams on the \n     Mekong River;\n       (4) applauds the decision of the Mekong River Commission to \n     delay endorsement of the Xayaburi Dam;\n       (5) supports further delay of the construction of \n     mainstream hydropower dams along the Mekong River until the \n     studies by the Government of Laos have been completed and \n     adequate planning and multilateral coordination can be \n     guaranteed;\n       (6) encourages members of the Mekong River Commission to \n     adhere to the prior consultation process for dam construction \n     under the Commission's Procedures for Notification, Prior \n     Consultation and Agreement;\n       (7) calls on all riparian states along the Mekong River, \n     including China, to respect the rights of other river basin \n     countries and take into account any objection or concerns \n     regarding the construction of hydropower dams;\n       (8) calls on the Governments of Burma and China to improve \n     cooperation with the Mekong River Commission and information \n     sharing on water flows and engage in regional decision making \n     processes on the development and use of the Mekong River; and\n       (9) supports assistance to the Lower Mekong River riparian \n     states to gather data and analyze the impacts of proposed \n     development along the river.\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/07/senate-section/article/S4455-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 228--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \nCOMING TOGETHER AS A NATION AND CEASING ALL WORK OR OTHER ACTIVITY FOR \n A MOMENT OF REMEMBRANCE BEGINNING AT 1:00 PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME ON \n SEPTEMBER 11, 2011, IN HONOR OF THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRORIST \n   ATTACKS COMMITTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Casey, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Toomey, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Webb, \nand Mr. Warner) submitted the following resolution;
