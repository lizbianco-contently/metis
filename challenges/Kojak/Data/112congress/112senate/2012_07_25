Madam President, we are now in the midst of another \nRepublican filibuster. So the time until 2:15 today will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The \nRepublicans will control the first 30 minutes and the majority will \ncontrol the second 30 minutes. At 2:15, there will be a cloture vote on \nthe motion to proceed to the Middle Class Tax Cut Act that was just \noutlined by the clerk.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 3429\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I understand that S. 3429 is at the desk \nand due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3429) to require the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to establish a veterans job corps, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                    Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the third time in as many weeks, \nRepublicans are poised to kill a tax cut without ever debating it on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Two weeks ago, Republicans filibustered legislation to cut taxes for \nsmall businesses. Last week, they filibustered a bill to end tax breaks \nfor corporations that ship jobs overseas and cut taxes for companies \nthat move jobs back to America. Now they are filibustering our plan to \ncut taxes for 114 million middle-class families. Not one of these bills \nhas gotten a debate on the Senate floor. So let's look at what led to \nthis latest Republican filibuster.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator McConnell came to the Senate floor to ask for \ntwo votes, one on the Democratic plan to cut taxes for 98 percent of \nAmerican families and reduce the deficit by about $1 trillion. The \nother vote he wanted was on the Republican plan to raise taxes by \n$1,000 each for 25 million middle-class families while handing out tax \nbreaks to millionaires of $160,000 each.\n  That afternoon, I told the minority leader that Democrats were \nwilling to give Republicans what they said they wanted--those two \nvotes. But although it had been only a few short hours since Senator \nMcConnell asked for those two votes, my offer was refused. He said he \nhad to see our proposal first.\n  It seemed like a thin excuse at the time. He hadn't seen our proposal \nwhen he asked for the votes in the first place, but others within his \ncaucus had seen it, and the staff had seen it, of course. But I took \nthe minority leader at his word.\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\n  So Democrats produced legislation in legislative form, and we offered \nonce again to vote on our bill and on the Republicans' plan to hike \nmiddle-class taxes. Again, they refused the up-or-down votes they had \nasked for. This time they wanted a third vote now, on a different plan, \nwe are told.\n  We have President Obama's tax plan before us. I am not going to make \nup some tax plan of the President that they said they are going to do. \nWe have President Obama's tax plan. We have worked hand in glove with \nhim now for months to come to the body with what we have today. So this \nthird vote is again a charade.\n  The Presiding Officer has a couple of small children. My children \naren't so small anymore. But small children being small children, it is \nvery often they have a bedtime tactic that has been used forever. I am \nsure the Presiding Officer's children--and I know my kids--when they \nneeded to get to sleep always wanted one more story. They would ask for \none more story and then one more story. But parents learned and saw \nthis bedtime story for what it is, a delaying tactic to stave off \nbedtime.\n  Americans see the Republicans' hollow request for one more vote, a \nmade-up vote, for what it is, an excuse to put off a simple majority \nvote on the Democrats' plan to cut taxes for the middle class. Of \ncourse, we know why Republicans are filibustering our plan to protect \nthe middle class: They know it would pass if we held an up-or-down \nmajority vote on that today.\n  Our bill has the support of President Obama, it has the support of \nthe Democratic caucus, and it has the support of the American people. A \nmajority of Americans--including a significant majority of \nRepublicans--agree taxes should remain low for the middle class and \nthat the top 2 percent should pay their fair share to reduce the \ndeficit. As I said, the majority of Republicans agree. The only place \nthere is no agreement is with the Republicans in Congress. They once \nagain have decided to obstruct rather than to legislate. So the Senate \nmay not even get to debate the merits of our plan to cut taxes for 98 \npercent of American families.\n  There is still time for Republicans to reverse course and drop their \nfilibuster. They owe the American people a serious debate on this \nproposal.\n\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Madam President, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwill allow us to debate a crucial cybersecurity bill before the end of \nthis month. We hope to have a vote on this as early as tomorrow or the \nnext day.\n  Cybersecurity--a new word, but there is nothing more important to \nnational security than doing something about cybersecurity. If we do \nnot pass this legislation that is now before the Senate, if we don't do \nsomething about this, we are told by the experts it is not a question \nof if; it is a question of when. This legislation is extremely \nimportant.\n  National security experts from the left, the right, and center say \nweaknesses in our cyber defenses are among the greatest threats facing \nour Nation--and some say it is the greatest threat facing our Nation. \nSo Congress must act rapidly to address this issue.\n  The House and Senate must also act before Congress leaves for the \nAugust recess to pass the final version of legislation initiating new \nIran sanctions.\n  This past year, the Senate conference has been hard at work to \ncomplete this agreement. I have been clear that I expect the \nnegotiations to conclude soon so we can further tighten these sanctions \nagainst Iran. Sanctions are critical. It is a critical tool to help \nstop Iran's nuclear weapons program and ensuring the security of our \nally, the State of Israel.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 2:15 p.m. will be equally \ndivided or controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss a wholly \npredictable and foreseeable economic disaster. I ask why the Senate \ncontinues to waste valuable time while we continue barrelling toward a \nfiscal cliff.\n  In a little more than 5 months, the current tax rates are scheduled \nto expire for every single American, resulting in the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n  It is hard to imagine this massive tax increase is what the President \nwants. Just 2 years ago, he warned that we absolutely should not raise \ntaxes in a poor economy. Yet today the economy is actually in worse \nshape.\n  So what does the President do? He calls for raising taxes on job \ncreators, on small business owners filing as individuals, on investment \nincome, on all those things that actually drive economic prosperity and \nhiring.\n  Their favorite talking point claims that all those making more than \n$250,000 should just be taxed more. While those families reporting \nincome of more than $250,000 may only make up about 2 percent of all \ntax returns, it is these citizens who are the owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 25 percent of America's workforce. These are the \nsame small business owners that created two-thirds of the net jobs in \nthe last decade.\n  I hear from small business owners in Nebraska every day, and they \ntell me if faced with a more expensive tax bill, they will be forced to \ncut costs elsewhere.\n  In fact, according to the global accounting firm Ernst & Young, the \nDemocrats' tax plan would result in 710,000 fewer jobs compared to \nsimply keeping the current rate the same for all Americans.\n  The economic wreckage resulting from the tax hike doesn't stop there. \nIn the same study, Ernst & Young estimates these reckless policies will \ndrive wages of hardworking Americans down by 1.8 percent.\n  Furthermore, investment is estimated to decrease 2.4 percent as the \ntax on dividends increases. Well, what is apparent here? What is \napparent is that less investment means less economic activity, which \nmeans fewer jobs, and it is really that straightforward. It is really \nthat simple.\n  The President and the Senate Democrats apparently disagree over just \nhow much to increase our taxes on dividend income. It is one of the few \nareas where their plans are not in lockstep, but both plans increase \nthe dividend tax rate nonetheless. While their rhetoric continues to \nlambaste the ultrawealthy, make no mistake, this tax increase will \naffect the vast majority of the middle class. When examining historical \nIRS data, it is revealed that 68 percent of all tax returns showing \ndividend income are from those Americans with incomes below $100,000.\n  While adding insult to injury, the President has proposed to increase \ntaxes on the estate of deceased loved ones as well. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle not only pick up the President's proposal but \nthey make it worse. Believe it or not, they want to tax even more \nestates at even higher rates than the President. It is astonishing, and \nunfortunately this reversal on the death tax will disproportionately \nimpact agricultural States such as Nebraska.\n  In their opposition to the Democratic bill, the Nebraska Farm Bureau \nand the Nebraska Cattlemen state that allowing the estate tax exemption \nto fall to $1 million would subject the typical full-time farm or ranch \nto the increased estate tax rate of--get this--55 percent.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these \ntwo groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Nebraska Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                       Lincoln, NE, July 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Mike Johanns,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johanns: On behalf of the over 56,000 members \n     of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, I am writing today to \n     inform you that congressional action to extend\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n     current tax law is urgently needed to provide stability to \n     our nation's farmers and ranchers. Now is not the time to \n     raise taxes on an industry that is struggling with high \n     production costs and extreme weather uncertainties. Farm \n     Bureau opposes S. 3412, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act because \n     of the tax increase it will impose on our industry.\n       Estate taxes are especially troublesome for farmers and \n     ranchers. S. 3412 fails to provide any estate tax relief \n     which would allow a $1 million per person exemption and 55 \n     percent top rate to be reinstated on January 1, 2013. A $1 \n     million exemption is not high enough to protect a typical \n     farm or ranch able to support a family from estate taxes and, \n     when coupled with a top rate of 55 percent, will make it \n     especially difficult for farm and ranch businesses to \n     transition from one generation to the next.\n       Capital gains taxes also have a significant impact on \n     farming and ranching, impeding new farmers wanting to enter \n     agriculture and discouraging operations from upgrading and \n     expanding. Extending lower rates for taxpayers making under \n     $250,000 does not mitigate the damage since the sale of farm \n     assets tends to produce a one-time income surge likely to \n     push a farmer or rancher over the threshold.\n       Farm Bureau believes that estate taxes should be repealed \n     and capital gains taxes permanently lowered. We support \n     passage of S. 3423, the Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2012, to \n     temporarily extend tax relief for all Americans and to put \n     Congress on a path toward fundamental reform.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our position and the \n     work you continue to do on behalf of Nebraska agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephen D. Nelson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Nebraska Cattlemen,\n\n                                       Lincoln, NE, July 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Senator Mike Johanns,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johanns: On behalf of the members of Nebraska \n     Cattlemen, I write to you to encourage you to support the \n     generational transfer of Nebraska farms and ranches. One of \n     the highest priorities of the men and women who raise \n     Nebraska beef is to ensure that their land, cattle and other \n     business assets are passed on to their children as easily as \n     possible.\n       It is our understanding that the Senate will be considering \n     a tax bill tomorrow that ignores farmers and ranchers by \n     proposing that the estate tax revert back to pre-2001 levels. \n     These hurdles of a one million dollar exemption and a 55% tax \n     rate will trip farmers and ranchers causing many to fall out \n     of the race of producing quality food.\n       We encourage you to vote ``no'' on this detrimental piece \n     of tax language and hold to your commitment to make the \n     estate tax recognize the importance of family agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kelsey,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Senate \nDemocrats' estate tax plan would hit over 48,000 estates with a $40.5 \nbillion tax bill compared to an extension of the current rates. While \nan extension of current estate tax rates is not perfect--I believe it \nshould be repealed permanently--it is far better than putting over \n48,000 families, a large percent of them farmers and ranchers on the \ndeath tax rolls. I have said over and over again that death should not \nbe a taxable event. Families should not have to sell the family \nbusiness and lay off their employees to pay Uncle Sam a 55-percent tax \nrate on the value of the estate.\n  All of these ill-advised tax policies taken together add up to bad \nnews for our economy and our country, bad news for our workers, and bad \nnews for every American. The National Federation of Independent \nBusiness estimates that the tax increases would result in a U.S. \neconomy that is 1.3 percent smaller than it is today, and that is an \noutcome for which none of us should strive.\n  So what is the alternative? Just last week the senior Senator from \nWashington laid out the Democrats' plan if they don't get their way on \nraising taxes: Hold the economy hostage and go over the fiscal cliff; \nmake sure everybody's taxes go up by the largest amount in the Nation's \nhistory; let the $110 billion sequester for this year strip our \nmilitary of the resources it needs to keep us safe and impact domestic \nprograms; let the alternative minimum tax wreak havoc on our middle \nclass, with the exemption actually falling below the median household \nincome.\n  In Nebraska alone, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nestimates for 2012 there will be over 134,000 potential AMT tax returns \ncompared to 16,000 in 2009. All told, this fiscal cliff will cost us \nbetween 3 percent and 5 percent of our entire gross domestic product, \ntrillions of dollars in destroyed wealth, and a CBO-predicted economic \nrecession. That is the plan, and it is astonishing to me that the \nDemocrats would go to these lengths just to raise taxes on our \ncountry's economic engine.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will claim that taxes must \nbe raised to address the mammoth deficit. Make no mistake, attacking \nour deficit should be job No. 1. However, on actual analysis we see \nthat the Democrats' claim is nothing but a mirage. According to the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the difference between the \nDemocrats' plan to increase taxes and a simple extension of all the \ncurrent tax rates is not even enough to cover 5 days of our government \nspending. It is only three-tenths of 1 percent of our crushing $16 \ntrillion national debt. This simply is not about our national debt or \nabout deficits; it is about an ideological statement and nothing more.\n  After today's failed vote on these tax increases, it is my hope that \nwe can get together and practice some common sense. Common sense would \ntell me, let's not raise taxes in a struggling economy. That used to be \nthe President's position before he was up for reelection. Let's not \npunish our job creators and small business owners, let's not punish our \nsenior citizens and other savers who rely on dividend income, and let's \nnot hinder passing down family farms and ranches from one generation to \nthe next. Let's extend the current rates for as long as it takes to get \nto work on comprehensive tax reform and actually solve the problems of \nour Tax Code. Let's get serious and start working on the business that \nAmericans sent us here to do. A massive tax increase will drive our \neconomy to its knees and bring about another recession. We can't afford \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, Reagan once joked that if anyone wants \nto understand Washington, DC, just look at how they designed the \nroads--it is full of circles. We don't have too many roundabouts in \nNevada, but in Washington, DC, it seems to be part of the culture. \nUnfortunately, today Washington is going around in circles again. This \ntime it is about whether Congress should raise taxes on small \nbusinesses at a time when our economy is struggling to grow.\n  The sad reality is that we all live in a country with a temporary tax \ncode. Right now there is no certainty for an entrepreneur to start a \nnew endeavor. There is no certainty for a small business that wants to \nhire a new employee. There is no certainty for businesses to invest in \nnew equipment or in new buildings.\n  What makes the situation worse is that the American public is now \nhearing from the majority party that they are willing to take our \ncountry off the fiscal cliff, regardless of the economic damage it may \ncause, by raising taxes, resulting in a smaller economy, fewer jobs, \nless investment, and lower wages.\n  President Obama said in 2009:\n\n       You don't raise taxes in a recession . . . because that \n     would just suck up, take more demand out of the economy and \n     put businesses in a further hole.\n\n  I agreed with that statement in 2009, and I agree with that statement \ntoday.\n  Let me give my colleagues another quote from President Obama after he \nsupported extending all of the tax rates for 2 years in 2010:\n\n       The bipartisan framework we have forged on taxes . . . will \n     provide businesses with incentives to invest, grow, and hire.\n\n  I supported this bipartisan framework as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet, today, in a complete 180-degree turn, raising \ntaxes and going over the fiscal cliff seems to be the new economic \nagenda.\n  The plan the majority party and the President are offering will cost \nNevadans more than 6,000 jobs and will shrink the State's economy by \n$1.7 billion. Let me repeat that. The plan of\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nthe majority party and this President will cost Nevadans 6,000 jobs and \nshrink the economy $1.7 billion. Nationwide, this plan will hurt more \nthan 700,000 jobs. Is this really the economic strategy Washington \nshould be embracing? My home State of Nevada leads the Nation in \nunemployment at 11.6 percent. We cannot afford to lose another 6,000 \njobs.\n  Divisive, partisan politics does a great disservice to every American \nwho is either out of work or has taken a pay cut. Those who stay up \nlate at night are wondering how they are going to make their mortgage \npayments, put food on their tables, or clothe their children. While \npeople across our country are struggling to get by, the Senate majority \nis pushing legislation that will actually hurt job creation.\n  Congress should do everything within its power to encourage economic \ngrowth, and that begins with providing America with tax certainty. It \nis true that our current Tax Code is too costly, too complex, and too \nburdensome. There is no question that the Tax Code is unfair and needs \nan overhaul. But the best this President and the Senate majority can do \nis push a tax hike designed for nothing more than perceived campaign \nsound bites.\n  Instead of election-year campaign gimmicks, let's have an honest \ndiscussion on fundamental tax reform. Last summer I reached out to \nPresident Obama to offer to work with him to fundamentally reform the \nTax Code in a way that would broaden the tax base by eliminating and \nclosing loopholes and reducing the marginal tax rates both on \nindividuals and businesses. This was an issue I worked on in the House \nas a member of the Ways and Means Committee and I continue to advocate \nhere in the Senate. Yet here we are today, and instead of debating \nfundamental tax reform we are taking another show vote on a tax \nproposal that would raise taxes on small businesses and cost jobs. \nAgain, it will cost Nevada 6,000 jobs.\n  The Senate was created by our Founding Fathers to be the deliberative \nbody. Yet once again we find ourselves in a situation in which we will \nbe unable to have an open debate on an issue that will affect every \nsingle American taxpayer.\n  The Senate should be debating all tax proposals on a bipartisan basis \nand working to find consensus on areas to increase American \ncompetitiveness. Yet instead of providing our Nation's job creators \nwith clarity and economic certainty, some of my colleagues would rather \nengage in messaging for a perceived political gain. Raising taxes will \ndo nothing to create jobs in Nevada or this Nation.\n  As the fiscal cliff draws nearer and nearer, the job growth remains \nstagnant. Congress should focus on long-term economic solutions that \nprovide businesses the certainty they need to create jobs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for nearly 4 years now, Democratic \nleaders in Washington have claimed to want what is best for the economy \nbut done just about everything you can think of from a policy \nperspective to actually undermine the economy.\n  Whether it is overwhelming businesses with redtape, burdening them \nwith costly new health care laws or punting on major economic decisions \nuntil after the election, Democrats have done everything you would \nexpect of a party more focused on centralizing power in Washington than \nreviving a weak economy.\n  And, of course, we have the results to show for it. As a result of \nthe Democrats' policies, we have fewer jobs today than the day the \nPresident took office, more signed up for disability assistance last \nmonth than got jobs--more people signed up for disability assistance \nlast month than got jobs--and the percentage of Americans who actually \ncan work but are not is at the lowest point literally in decades.\n  This is the sad legacy of this President's economic policies. And \nlater today we will have a chance to cast a vote for more of the same \nor for a plan that will help us get off of this hamster wheel we have \nbeen on for the past 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  I am referring, of course, to the very different proposals we will \nvote on today for dealing with a looming tax hike coming in January: \nthe Republican plan, which gives every American not only the certainty \nthat their income taxes will not go up at the end of the year but that \nCongress will deliver meaningful tax reform within a year, and the \nSenate Democratic plan which raises taxes on a million small business \nowners at a moment when we are counting on them to create jobs, raises \ntaxes on thousands of family farmers and small business owners grieving \nthe loss of a loved one, leaves a middle-class tax hike in place, and \nreforms absolutely nothing.\n  We would also like to vote on the President's plan, though it appears \nour Democratic friends will deny the President his vote.\n  I will leave it to others to explain the finer points of these plans. \nBut one thing stands out. As I have indicated, the thing that stands \nout is the Democratic proposal to raise the death tax. This is one of \ntheir bright ideas to revive the economy: to raise the death tax. It \ndramatically lowers the exemption level, so more families actually get \nhit by it, and dramatically increases the amount of the tax itself. \nUnder their plan, family members who inherit a farm or a ranch would \nhave to write a check for 55 percent--55 percent--of the value of the \nproperty and equipment above $1 million, all but guaranteeing that tens \nof thousands of small and mid-size family businesses across the country \nwill be broken up and handed over to the government instead of passed \non to the next generation.\n  Look, I know some Democrats will try to justify their vote on this \nstunningly bad proposal by saying they will deal with the assault on \nfamily farms later. Wrong. The Democratic bill we will vote on today, \nby not addressing the problem, makes the tax liability for these \nfamilies even worse. A vote for the Democratic plan is to vote to put \nthese farms and ranches literally out of business. There will be no \nstand-alone bill signed into law on the death tax, and anyone who says \notherwise is not being straight with the American people.\n  But there is one big difference between our plan and theirs. The most \nimportant difference is this: Only ours is aimed at helping the \neconomy; only ours is aimed at helping the economy; only ours is meant \nto help struggling Americans in the midst of a historic jobs crisis. \nTheirs is meant to deflect attention from their continued failure to \nreverse this economic situation.\n  Throughout this entire debate, not a single Democrat has come forward \nto claim that raising taxes on job creators will help the economy. \nNobody is claiming that because they cannot. The real motives are based \non an ideological agenda, not an economic one.\n  Ordinarily, Republicans would do everything we can to keep a plan as \ndamaging as the Democrats' plan from passing, and the only reason we \nwill not block it today is we know it does not pass constitutional \nmuster and will not become law because it did not originate in the \nHouse. If the Democrats were serious, they would proceed to a House-\noriginated revenue bill, as the Constitution requires.\n  That said, the potential consequences of inaction on this issue are \nso grave that the American people deserve to know where their elected \nrepresentatives really stand--truly stand--on this issue.\n  That is why I am announcing this morning Republicans will allow a \nsimple majority vote--a simple majority vote--on the two proposals I \nhave described, and that is why we are also calling for a simple \nmajority vote on the President's plan. He is the leader of the \nDemocratic Party. He has been calling for a vote on his plan. I for one \nthink we ought to give the President what he is asking for: a vote on \nhis plan.\n  So what I am saying here this morning is, we will have a simple \nmajority\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nvote on the Senate Democratic plan, on the Republican plan, to make \nsure no one's income taxes go up at the end of the year, and I would \nalso recommend we have a simple majority vote on the President's plan.\n  The only way to force people to take a stand is to make sure today's \nvotes truly count. By setting these votes at a 50-vote threshold, \nnobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while \nleaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery--a simple \nmystery--to the people who sent them here. That is what today's votes \nare all about: about showing the people who sent us here where we \nstand.\n  We owe it to the American people to let them know whether we actually \nthink it is a good idea to double down on the failed economic policies \nof the past few years or whether we support a new approach, whether we \nthink it is a good idea to raise taxes on nearly a million business \nowners at a moment when millions of Americans are struggling to find \nwork or to do no harm and commit to future reform.\n  Three votes, two visions. Three votes, two visions. The American \npeople should know where we stand, and today they will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suppose Senator McConnell, the leader, has given a \npreface as to what I want to say. I think the American people should \nknow where we stand on these important questions. That is why I come to \nthe floor, to indicate that I will vote in favor of proceeding to \ndebate on S. 3412, Senator Reid's proposal to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986. But if the matter does come to a full discussion \nand debate on the floor, as I hope it will, I will not vote for it in \nits current form, and I want to explain why.\n  I feel strongly that the first thing the American people want us to \ndo is get the economy going again so that the economy is creating jobs. \nI am convinced the best thing Congress can do to restore economic \ngrowth and job creation is to enact a comprehensive, bipartisan plan to \nbalance our budget along the lines of the Bowles-Simpson Commission \nrecommendations.\n  Unfortunately, S. 3412, which is the so-called middle-class tax cut--\nwhich would extend the existing reduced tax rates on couples making \nless than $250,000, but would raise taxes on others making more than \nthat--does not represent such a plan. In other words, it is not a \nbipartisan plan to balance our budget in a way that will create job \ngrowth.\n  Its enactment at this time, in my opinion, would only serve to \npreclude debate and action on exactly the broader type of reforms we \nneed to fix our broken Federal Government fiscal system. Just imposing \nacross-the-board tax increases for individuals and small businesses \nthat make over $250,000 a year is neither tax reform nor the balanced \ndeficit reduction agreement our country needs right now.\n  I do not hesitate, and I will not hesitate, as part of this kind of \nbalanced, bipartisan debt reduction--hopefully, debt elimination--plan \nto vote to increase the amount of taxes that the wealthiest Americans \nare paying. But I will not do that as part of a scatter-shot approach. \nIt has to be part of a program that reduces spending, that reforms \nspending on our entitlement programs--which are the fastest growing \nelement of our Federal budget--and that reforms our tax system. The \nbill before us is not such a plan.\n  I have said over and over that there is plenty of time this year to \nget a bipartisan, balanced budget program passed in Congress, and that \nI would vote against both the President's partial repeal of the so-\ncalled Bush tax cuts and the Republican plan to extend all the cuts for \nanother year. I think we can do better this year, and I think we must \ndo better. I know that is exactly what our constituents want us to do.\n  We can cut spending, adopt tax reform, and entitlement reform. While \nthat hope is alive, I am going to vote against both partial measures \nand proposals to put off the tough decisions about our economic future \nthat our constituents elected us to make. I think both the Democratic \nplan, which is the subject before us right now in this motion to \nproceed, and Senator Hatch's plan do not make it. They are partial, and \nthey basically kick the can down the road again without solving our \neconomic problems. Giving the private sector the confidence about our \nfuture to invest the trillions of dollars in cash they are sitting on \nnow--which is the only thing that will get our economy growing and \ncreating more jobs; and the private sector businesses will not do that \ntoday because they do not know where this government of ours is going--\nthey do not have a sense of certainty and confidence.\n  So as I said, if for some reason the process that the Senate is \nfacing today changes, and both the Democratic plan to raise taxes on \npeople over $250,000 comes up for a vote and Senator Hatch's Tax Hike \nPrevention Act, which extends all the tax cuts for another year, comes \nup, I will vote against both of them because I do not think they do \nwhat our country needs to be done.\n  There is plenty of time, as I said, left this year to do what we have \nto do.\n  Why am I going to vote to proceed to debate on either or both of \nthese if I am opposed to each of them as they are drafted? It is \nbecause I think there is nothing more important we could do in this \nCongress than to begin to confront and debate the challenge of our \ntime, which is to get our Federal Government back in balance, to make \nthe tough decisions that will do that, and thereby get our economy \ngoing and creating jobs again.\n  Debate, yes. Let's not hide from debate. Let's confront it and deal \nwith it as quickly as we can. But these two proposals, in my opinion, \ndo not do what our economy needs to be done.\n  I will say a final word about the deep hole we are in and about the \nidea of raising taxes on everybody making more than $250,000, but \nraising no taxes on people making less than $250,000. The truth is we \nare in a deep hole in this country. We are heading toward what has now \nbegun to be popularly called the fiscal cliff. The challenge to our \ngovernment is whether we are going to have the courage, the honesty, \nthe leadership qualities to come together across party lines and \nprotect our economy and our country before we begin to go over the \nfiscal cliff.\n  I know that requires us to make difficult decisions. Maybe it is \neasier for me to say because I am not running for reelection this year, \nbut I honestly believe what the American people would most like us to \ndo is to do what we think is right, to do something that does not seem \nlike conventional politics, to have the guts to enact tax reform, \nentitlement reform, and cut spending. That is really what they want us \nto do because that is what they know the country needs us to do.\n  Let me come back to this $250,000. I know it is politically \nappealing, but the truth is to balance our budget again we are going to \nhave to ask most every American to give a little something so our \ncountry will grow and everybody will benefit. Sure, the people who are \nmaking the most should pay more in revenue, but I think we are at a \npoint where we cannot simply say to what we generally describe as the \nmiddle class that they do not have to give anything else. I think that \nwould be wrong. That is not consistent with the revenue system we have \nnow, which is a progressive and fair system. I want to build on that, \nreform it in some ways to make it more constructive and make it more \nlikely to incentivize growth in our economy. But let's not take \nanything off the table. Our economy, as precarious as it is, as it \nfaces very uncertain effects from economic troubles in Europe and even \nin China now, I think we have to be very careful about raising \nanybody's taxes in the short run; that is, next year.\n  What we need is a long-term balanced debt reduction program for \nAmerica. So that is why I will vote to proceed to vote for debate on \nthese subjects we desperately need, but neither the Democratic or \nRepublican approaches do what this country needs. Therefore, if they \ncome to the floor and we have a debate, I will try to amend them with \nsomething like the Bowles-Simpson recommendations. If that fails, I \nwill vote against them because we can do better than that, and the \nAmerican people have a right to expect that we will.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the issue on the floor \nbefore the Senate, the vote we will take later today on two competing \nplans for our path forward. As the Presiding Officer and I and all of \nthe Members of this Chamber know, our national debt and our deficit are \nenormous. They are unsustainable. Last week an array of our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle came to the Senate floor one after the \nother to make exactly that point.\n  Members of both parties agree excessive debt hurts our \ncompetitiveness, that it causes interest rates to rise, and it crowds \nout critical investments in our country's future. My own experience in \nthe private sector and 6 years of tough budget balancing as a county \nexecutive in my home State of Delaware taught me how important it is to \nhave responsible budget processes in place to manage our way through \ndifficult financial times, to create opportunity for our communities \nwhile still reducing our deficits and debt.\n  There is no question that high debt levels lead to lower growth in \nthe long run, and it can restrain or starve or strangle the dreams of \nour communities, our children, for our future. Our deficit and debt is \na ticking time bomb, and everyone--Republicans and Democrats, \nIndependents, economists, experts, working families, small business \nowners, the American people--knows that we want to and have to deal \nwith it. But the key, in my view, is to deal with this problem \nresponsibly and fairly and in a way that reflects America's best.\n  Our debt is neither a Republican nor a Democratic problem but a \nshared and structural problem. It took both parties to get us into this \nmess, and it will take both parties working together to dig us out. \nEach Member of this body must take responsibility and look at what is \nbest for the next generation not just for winning the next election.\n  For my part, I am going to continue to fight for balanced and \nresponsible deficit reduction. If the American people can share in the \nsacrifice in our cities and counties and States all over this country, \nas they are already doing in my home State of Delaware, then \nRepublicans and Democrats have to show that we too can come together \nand find a way to compromise.\n  It is time we recognize a sobering realty: If we are going to plug \nthe hole in national balance sheets, if we are going to avoid the fate \nof Europe--and it is a big hole in the bottom of America's balance \nsheet--while still continuing to invest in our future and in the \nstrength and promise and opportunity of our communities, we have to \nfind a more responsible, more fair balance between spending cuts and \nrevenue increases.\n  We simply cannot achieve the level of savings we need through \nspending cuts alone. Drastic cuts, dramatic cuts, across-the-board cuts \nviolate our very values and will drive down the possibility of recovery \nand growth in the future. Spending cuts must be a central part of the \nsolution to our budget problem. But the fact is revenue must also play \na meaningful role. We need balance. That is the only way to provide the \neconomic certainty necessary to sustain a recovery and, in my view, the \nonly way to sustain investments that are critical for our future.\n  Let's be clear about some rhetoric we have heard both out in the \ncountry and in this Chamber. The United States does not begrudge \nsuccess. We, as Democrats, in this Chamber do not resent those who have \nachieved, who have succeeded. In fact, that is the engine that for \ngenerations has drawn people from around the world to this country and \nhas pulled people forward: the hopes and dreams of those who see reason \nto the work in this country because of the promise of opportunity, the \nvery real history of entrepreneurship, of risk taking, and the very \ngreat rewards this country provides those who succeed beyond their \nwildest dreams through hard work, through innovation, through \ncreativity.\n  No, we do not resent or reject wealth and success in this Chamber or \nin this country. In fact, we admire it and want to create the \ngroundwork for a whole new generation of Americans to achieve the \nsuccesses of the last generation. If we are going to do right by the \nnext generation of Bill Gateses or Warren Buffetts, that requires us to \nfind solutions that make our tax system fairer and to prevent burdening \nthe next generation of Americans with a crushing national debt.\n  President Lyndon Johnson once said:\n\n       It is not just enough to open the gates of opportunity, all \n     of our citizens have to have the ability to walk through \n     those gates.\n\n  The ability of future Americans to walk through those gates, I \nbelieve, requires sustainable investments in our future, in our schools \nand teachers so our children can compete in the global economy and we \ncan keep improving public education and infrastructure; so our \nbusinesses can move their products and ideas as fast as our competitors \ncan on our roads and rails and broadband, in research and development; \nso America can continue to be a world leader in innovation and \nscientific breakthroughs.\n  We all know health care costs are among the greatest drivers of our \nmounting national deficits and debt. We have two paths forward: One, \nwhere we cut and constrain and reduce spending, and another where we \ninvest in basic science and research, where we innovate and where we \ncure our way out of these challenges. I think this latter way of \ninvesting in our schools, our infrastructure, our innovation, and in \nfinding path-breaking cures is more true to the American spirit.\n  Cuts to essential services and programs are already deep. Although \nthis is not broadly known throughout the country, sacrifices have \nalready been made here, and pennies are already being pinched from \nprograms that, in my view, serve the people who can least afford them.\n  In my home State of Delaware, due to choices we have made here, we \nhave already seen cuts to critical programs such as heating assistance \nto low-income families and programs such as the community development \nblock grants. Home programs were cut roughly 30 percent in last year's \nbudget, programs that for so long have supported affordable housing for \nthe disabled, for seniors, and for low-income families.\n  We must continue to make cuts across the board to move our way toward \na sustainable Federal deficit. But cuts alone cannot responsibly make \nour path forward, and we have seen proposals in the other Chamber that \nwould decimate vital safety net programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, \nshifting the burden of deficit reduction to our most vulnerable \ncitizens. We need to bring balance back to how we solve these problems. \nWe need to do it in a way that puts a circle of protection around those \nwho are most vulnerable in our society.\n  In previous generations that served in this Chamber, when they came \ntogether and reached the resolutions that solved our country's fiscal \nproblems, in 1983, for example, they put a circle of protection around \nthe most vulnerable Americans. They chose not to slash or cut or \neliminate those programs that were focused on the most vulnerable in \nour society: the disabled, low-income seniors, and children in the \nearliest stages of life.\n  I think it is important that we remember those values as we look at \nthe choices we make today and as we come together in the months leading \nup to the election--and, hopefully, after the election--to craft a \nsolution to our structural problem.\n  Today on the floor the Senate is considering the other piece of the \nequation from cuts, revenue. We have a stark choice between us today. \nWe have two plans: a Reid plan and a Hatch plan. We have a Democratic \nproposal and a Republican proposal. Let me put this in some context \nthat I think has been missing in some of the speeches I have heard on \nthe floor earlier today.\n  In both cases these are plans that make choices about which of our \nexisting tax cuts, which of the existing tax expenditures we will allow \nto expire and which we will extend. There is a lot of talk about the \ncoming taxmageddon, about the greatest one-time tax increase in \nAmerican history. But let's be clear. What we are talking about is tax \ncuts that were enacted in\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n2001 and 2003 and other tax cuts that were enacted in 2009, 2010, and \nwhether they should be extended or whether these temporary tax cuts \nshould be allowed to be that and expire.\n  We have two starkly different plans. In one, the Republican plan, \nthey extend all of the Bush tax cuts, even for the highest income \nearners, even on the marginal rates of the highest income earners. The \nDemocratic plan extends and does not allow to expire critical tax cuts: \nthe earned-income tax credit, the tuition tax credit, and the child tax \ncredit that 25 million Americans--the working poor, working families \nwith children--rely on to get through this difficult recession.\n  The Republican plan allows all three of those to expire, and thus, to \nuse their language, raises taxes on 25 million of the working poor. It \nshould be an obscenity for there to be people who are working full time \nand get poor in this country. This is a country, as I said before, of \nopportunity; the place to which millions have come over generations \nfrom around the world seeking the opportunity of this country.\n  Yet, today, and especially in this economy, ``working poor'' has real \nmeaning, as the rate of poverty has risen to alarming levels, where one \nin six is poor today, which is the highest since the 1960s. The \neconomic inequality and lack of opportunity and justice for those who \nare the poorest is at an alarming rate.\n  We also have, as I said before, a structural challenge before us, a \ndeficit and debt that we must deal with. So the Democratic plan that is \non the floor today, which we will vote on today--on whether this body \nwants to proceed to take a deciding vote on it--would allow the \nmarginal tax rate above $200,000 for individuals, $250,000 for couples, \nto return to the Clinton era.\n  Let's be clear because I think this is often lost. Under the \nDemocratic tax plan, we would continue tax breaks for all Americans who \nearn income and for all small businesses that are revenue-earning but \njust on the first $200,000 of individual income or $250,000 of couple \nincome. So even the millionaires and billionaires would continue to get \nsome of the benefit of the tax breaks first enacted in 2001 and 2003. \nWhat would be raised is the tax rate on income above $250,000 per \ncouple. So everybody continues to get some tax advantage, but the \nexcessive--the highest reductions in tax burden on the very wealthiest \nAmericans we would allow to expire.\n  What would the impact be on our deficit and debt? It would be $850 \nbillion over 10 years, which, with the interest savings, is nearly $1 \ntrillion in deficit and debt reduction. These are significant savings. \nIf we ask the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans to take on that burden, \nto go back to the interest rates on marginal income that they lived \nthrough in the Clinton era, what might that do? It will significantly \nreduce the deficit and debt and make it possible for us to sustain the \nearned-income tax credit, the tuition tax credit, and the child tax \ncredit, and, frankly, it will reflect our values.\n  This recession has brought an alarming rise in the rate of poverty. I \nbelieve our faith traditions--and we come from a very broad range of \nfaith traditions--speak to us and challenge us to show our values. As \nthe Vice President, who held the seat in Delaware before me, has so \noften said, his father once said to him: Show me your budget, and I \nwill show you your values.\n  Psalm 72 teaches us that to defend the cause of the poor and to give \ndeliverance to the needy is one of our highest callings. It is repeated \nthroughout the books of the Torah and the New Testament--in many faith \ntraditions all across this country. To reject this deliverance to the \nneedy, to reject the circle of protection for the neediest in our \nsociety and instead say that we will extend ad infinitum the tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest Americans defies American values and our greatest \ntradition of creating and sustaining opportunity while protecting the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  I think our belief in the American dream and our commitment to basic \nfairness and responsible problem-solving calls us forward to vote for \nthe Reid plan.\n  This bill is not a substitute for the comprehensive tax reform our \nNation truly needs. We need tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code and \ncloses many unsustainable and costly loopholes while lowering rates and \nbroadening the base. In the current political environment, I believe \nthis bill, to which I hope this body will turn, is the best chance we \nhave at retaining these important tax credits and opportunities for the \nworking poor while bringing some sanity to the rates at the highest end \nand asking those who benefited the most to contribute to solving our \nproblems.\n  Last week I got a letter from Judith in Talleyville, Delaware, who \nwrote my office saying this:\n\n       Millionaires and billionaires must be asked to pay their \n     fair share toward economic recovery.\n\n  Judith puts her finger on the crux of the issue. If we are going to \naddress our deficit crisis and resolve the hole at the bottom of \nAmerica's balance sheet in a way that reflects our core values, I \nbelieve we must move to and consider and pass the Reid plan in this \nSenate this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are debating the proposal of the \nSenate Democratic leadership to raise taxes on the American people. \nPursuit of this tax hike strategy is clearly being instigated by the \nPresident's reelection efforts. I suspect that many of my friends on \nthe other side are very uncomfortable with this strategy. I can think \nof a number of Senate Democrats whose constituents would be surprised \nto learn their Senator supports tax increases on small businesses, an \nincrease in the alternative minimum tax, and hikes in the death tax.\n  With the economy still on the ropes, I think they would be surprised \nto learn their Senators supported a tax hike strategy that might win \nsome votes but at the risk of sparking a recession. That is what the \nPresident wants. We will see if that is what he gets. He has pitched \nhis tax hike plan as a way to be fiscally responsible. That could not \nbe further from the truth. One need only look at the treatment of the \nHouse budget by my friends on the other side. That budget received more \nvotes than any other budget considered by the Senate, including the \nphantom budget advanced by the Senate Democratic caucus. The House \nbudget provided $180 billion more in deficit reduction than the \nPresident's budget for 2013. The House budget's extra deficit reduction \nof $180 billion exceeds the differences in deficit impact between the \nproposal I introduced with my friend and colleague, the Republican \nleader, and the proposal advanced by my Democratic friends. That is \ntrue even if you apply the other side's distorted and misleading \naccounting of the differences between the two proposals. More on that \nin a moment.\n  When we hear our friends on the other side say they must risk going \noff the fiscal cliff for deficit reduction, consider this: They \nrejected out-of-hand spending restraints that provided more deficit \nreduction than is at stake here today.\n  Not only are the deficit reduction numbers phony, but the President \nand his Democratic allies in the Senate have repeatedly suggested that \nthey are willing to intentionally drive our economy off what Fed \nChairman Ben Bernanke has called the fiscal cliff in order to make a \npolitical argument about the top marginal tax rates.\n  The President thinks he has struck political gold with this argument. \nHe will be able to run for reelection on a platform of raising taxes \nunder the mantle of deficit reduction. Now, this might be politically \nadvantageous, but I doubt it.\n  I do know that from a fiscal and economic perspective, the \nPresident's signature proposal threatens serious damage to our already \nfragile economy. The President's tax increases on those he deems ``the \nrich'' in fact represent a massive tax hike on the small businesses \nthat are necessary for economic and job growth. Moreover, until he gets \nhis way on raising taxes on these small businesses, he is threatening \nevery single American taxpayer with a tax hike. Like a petulant child, \nhe is insisting that it is his way or the highway. We have had far too \nmuch of that. He will get his way on raising taxes on the small \nbusinessmen and entrepreneurs--who find no shelter in today's \nDemocratic coalition of unions, lawyers, and government employees--or \nhe will let\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nthe current tax relief expire, raising taxes on all Americans. This is \nthe antithesis of statesmanship at a time when our economy requires \nserious direction. It is the political equivalent of a temper tantrum. \nI expect that American voters will have about as much patience for this \nas they would a similar fit from their children. The American people \nwant a grownup in the White House, but on tax policy we appear to be \ndealing with adolescence.\n  I have said before that the President's proposal is the policy \nequivalent of Thelma and Louise intentionally driving their convertible \noff a cliff. The difference is that there is at least some ambiguity \nleft about the fate of Thelma and Louise. If the President gets his way \nand either raises taxes on small businesses or denies relief to all \nAmerican taxpayers, there will be no ambiguity about whom to hold \nresponsible when our economy crashes.\n  When a liberal Democratic President has lost the New York Times, he \nhas lost America. Even the Times understands what is coming if the \nPresident continues to put the pedal to the floor and drive us over the \nfiscal cliff. The Times wrote that ``with the economy having slowed in \nrecent weeks, business leaders and policy makers are growing concerned \nthat the tax increases and government spending cuts set to take effect \nat year's end have already begun to cause companies to hold back on \nhiring and investments.''\n  That is 100 percent right. The election is not for another 3 months, \nand already the President's lack of direction and the threats emanating \nfrom Democratic leadership about letting the tax relief expire are \nleading businesses to slow down. How can businesses plan for next year \nand how can they make hiring or investment decisions when they have no \nidea what their tax rates are going to be? They simply can't. And the \nPresident and Senate Democratic leadership, with their delay and \nconfusion about how to extend this tax relief, are doing absolutely \nnothing to inspire confidence in these job creators.\n  Rather than address the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan \ntax relief, we have been debating campaign commercials masquerading as \nserious legislation. Last week the Senate wasted its time on yet \nanother piece of legislation that had absolutely no chance of becoming \nlaw and zero prospects for creating jobs. It is worth comparing the \npuny impact of the bill considered last week to the size of the coming \ntax hikes--tax hikes so large that the Washington Post has referred to \ntheir impending arrival as ``taxmageddon.''\n  Referring to this chart, look at the impact of the 20-percent credit \nversus taxmageddon over the next 10 years. The Bring Jobs Home Act \nwould only cost about $87 billion. Taxmageddon is going to cost us \n$4.538 trillion.\n  Make no mistake, our small businesses and our economy face an \nexistential threat at the end of 2012. Yet the majority leader \nschedules votes that generate campaign fodder rather than jobs or \nlasting economic growth.\n  Facing a fragile recovery and a weak jobs market, President Obama \nseems content to sit idly by and allow the scheduled $4.5 trillion tax \nhike to occur just to make a populist political argument about the need \nfor the so-called rich to pay what he thinks is their fair share. \nCongress needs to act now in order to prevent this tax hike on \nAmerica's families, individuals, and job creators.\n  Look at this chart again--the difference between the Bring Jobs Home \nAct and taxmageddon. It is clear that they are driving us off the \ncliff, and they are willing to do it for political reasons.\n  It is critically important for our economy and the American people \nthat we act now to extend the bipartisan tax relief originally signed \ninto law by President Bush and extended by President Obama back in \n2010.\n  As you can see on the chart, the tax legislation to-do list, nothing \nwas done on tax extenders, although we are willing to work on that with \nour committee chairman in the Finance Committee; nothing was done on \nthe AMT patch, but we are willing to work on that in the overall scope \nof things; and nothing was done on death tax reform. In fact, the \nsuggestion by the Democrats is to increase it so that all the small \nfarms--or many of them--will get hammered with taxes, along with a lot \nof small businesses. Nothing was done to prevent the 2013 tax hikes. \nNo, no, no, no on everything.\n  This is the most crucial piece of legislation Congress can address \nthis year. If we allow this tax relief to expire as scheduled, almost \nevery Federal income taxpayer in America will see an increase in their \nrates. Yet that is what our friends on the other side said they are \ngoing to do if they don't get their way--like petulant children. Some \nwill see a rate increase of 9 percent. Others will see a rate increase \nof as much as 87 percent.\n  Because the vast majority of small businesses are flowthrough \nbusiness entities, any increase in tax rates for individuals \nnecessarily means that those small businesses will get hit with a tax \nincrease. This tax increase lands on these small business owners even \nif they do not take one penny out of their business. That is what the \nDemocrats are going to do to them. They are willing to go off the cliff \nand do this. Our economy simply cannot afford to take on such a fiscal \nshock.\n  It was just in 2010 when the President said the economy was so \nfragile we needed to carry over the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n  We are in worse shape today than we were in 2010, but unfortunately--\nor fortunately--we are in an election year. Unfortunately, the \nPresident is playing games with these very serious matters.\n  Our economy simply cannot afford to take on such a fiscal shock. \nEconomists estimate if these current tax rates are allowed to expire, \nthe economy could contract by approximately 3 percentage points. \nConsidering the first quarter GDP growth was 1.9 percent and that \nexpectations are even lower for the second quarter growth--that will be \nreported this Friday--going over the fiscal cliff would almost \ncertainly throw us into a recession.\n  I don't know many economists who would disagree with that. Certainly \nthe Fed doesn't disagree. We are going to go into a recession if the \nDemocrats get their way. We could even slip into recession in the \nsecond half of this year, given reluctance of businesses to hire and \ninvest due to fiscal uncertainty.\n  For the President and others who argue we should raise the top two \ntax rates in the name of fiscal responsibility, I would just like to \npoint out a few things. The Senate majority leader introduced his tax \nbill--one that largely mirrors the President's proposal--under the \nauspices of deficit reduction. It closely adheres to the Democratic \ntalking point that the only thing standing between our deficits and \nfiscal stability is the current top marginal tax rates. We have heard \nthis argument for a year and a half, with the President and his \nDemocratic allies insisting it is not their out-of-control spending \nthat got us into this mess but the Republicans' refusal to allow for \ntax hikes on the so-called rich.\n  That is laughable. This argument sounds nice, but it is belied by the \nactual facts. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, an apples-\nto-apples comparison of the Democrats' tax proposal and the proposal I \nintroduced with my friend the Republican leader shows a difference of \n$54.5 billion. The Democrats' bill--which raises the top rates and \nexpands the death tax, while patching the AMT for 1 year--is scored at \n$249.7 billion, and the score of my bill--without the 2013 AMT patch--\nis $304.2 billion.\n  So we have a debt that is fast approaching $16 trillion. Taxes are \nset to go up by $4.5 trillion, and Senate Democrats are crowing about \ntheir fiscal responsibility, threatening to drive the economy off the \ncliff, over $54.5 billion worth of tax relief? I believe this is called \nmissing the forest for the trees. In order to satisfy their urge to \nredistribute $54 billion of taxpayer dollars, they are willing to risk \na recession and see taxes go up by $4.5 trillion.\n  The President recently claimed we need to raise the top two tax rates \nbecause ``it's a major driver of our deficits.'' The numbers show this \nis plain and simple nonsense. The real difference between the \nDemocratic and Republican plans is only $54.5 billion--or about 5 \npercent of the deficit. That represents .34 percent of our national \ndebt. To put it another way: The Democrats' tax hike proposal would \nonly provide enough additional revenue to pay for 5 days of Federal \nGovernment spending--5 days of Federal Government spending.\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n  It is also worth noting what exactly the Democrats' refusal to \nprovide 2 years of AMT relief means for their constituents. If Senate \nDemocrats do not patch the AMT in 2013, their AMT will take away over \n40 percent of the tax relief they claim to be providing with their \nbill. This is their prerogative, but I hope the hometown papers in \nnorthern Virginia, New Jersey, New York, Florida, and Colorado are \npaying attention. I hope they are paying close attention to what a lack \nof AMT relief will mean for middle-income families in those States.\n  These tax proposals, in the end, have nothing to do with sound tax \npolicy that maximizes economic growth, and they have nothing to do with \ndeficit reduction. They have everything to do with pursuing an antique \neconomic philosophy that is principally concerned with running down the \neconomy's job creators and entrepreneurs.\n  The explicit tax policy is only the half of it. We learned yesterday \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office the true tax bill for ObamaCare is \nover $1 trillion. We were promised there wouldn't be any tax increases. \nIt is the biggest fiasco I have seen around here in almost the whole \ntime I have been here. In fact, I can't think of anything bigger.\n  All the new ObamaCare regulations will cost McDonald's franchisees \nalone more than $400 million in health care costs. The President might \nthink Ray Kroc did not build McDonald's, but this is delusional. He \nmight view the small businessman who took a chance and opened those \nfranchises as not especially smart, not responsible for his own \nsuccess, but this is a view that could only be embraced by an academic \nand activist who has no experience in the private sector.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that 53 percent of all \nflowthrough business income in the United States would be subject to \nthe President's proposed tax hikes. Take that, small business. The \nPresident is saying: We don't care about you, I guess. I do, and \nRepublicans certainly do.\n  The President's proposal would take the marginal tax rate on small \nbusinesses from 33 percent and 35 percent to 39.6 percent and 41 \npercent, respectively. Look at this chart. This is the increase to \nsmall business--the top marginal rates. As we can see, it goes up from \n33, 35 to 40 and 41 percent. How could that not help but ruin our \neconomy? This is the kind of economic thinking we are putting up with \naround here, and it is all coming from the White House. Our friends on \nthe other side apparently don't want to take the White House on. It is \nan increase of 17 to 24 percent on the marginal tax rates for small \nbusinesses.\n  Ernst & Young recently released a study showing these proposed tax \nhikes--on top of ObamaCare's 3.8 percent tax increase--on dividends, \ninterest and capital gains would reduce our economic output by 1.3 \npercent. The Ernst & Young study also found that real aftertax wages \nwould fall by 1.8 percent as a result of President Obama's policies.\n  Not surprisingly, the study noted 54 percent of the entire private \nsector workforce is employed by flowthrough businesses, such as S \ncorporations and partnerships, the majority of which would see their \ntaxes go up under the President's plan.\n  That is where the jobs are. What kind of thinking are they willing to \naccept on the other side of the aisle? It is hard for me to believe. \nThere isn't a person over there I don't care for. It is hard for me to \nbelieve they are not willing to stand up to this President and say: \nHey, the game is over.\n  The truth is many of the people targeted by Democrats as wealthy are, \nin fact, middle-income, small business owners who spent their whole \nlives building up a business, then selling it and falling into the top \nbracket just for the year of the sale.\n  Consider a real-life example provided by the Associated Builders and \nContractors. A husband and wife from Pennsylvania who retired to \nFlorida owned an S corporation. In 2009, the couple paid no Federal \nincome tax because they did not have enough taxable income to owe any \ntax. In 2010, when they sold their business, their adjusted gross \nincome was about $780,000, and they paid $170,000 in taxes. If they had \nnot sold their business in 2010, they would have paid no taxes. So the \none-time sale of the business, built up over many years, caused these \nsmall business owners to be in one of the two top brackets for just 1 \nyear, after years of building their business and then having to sell it \nand have this catastrophe fall on them.\n  Yet the President would have the American people believe this couple \nis part of some rich elite who are refusing to pay their fair share. \nThat is not all or, as Ron Popiel would say: But wait, there is more.\n  Last week, before the ink was even dry on the Democratic leader's \nsmall business tax hike legislation, the bill was changed to \nsubstantially increase--get this--the death tax. Why was that? Because \nthey found there was only $28 billion difference between the Democratic \nbill and our bill, and they wanted to find a way to get it up to $50 \nbillion, which is, as I said, 5 days of spending around here.\n  It might be hard to believe, but this proposal is even worse than \nPresident Obama's. The proposal by the Democratic leader would impose \nthe death tax on 15 times the number of estates than under current tax \npolicy, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation--the nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation. It would increase the number of estates \nhit by the death tax from 3,600 estates to 55,200. According to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, 24 times more farming estates would be hit \nby the Democrats' death tax proposal.\n  What is going on over there? These are intelligent people--our \nfriends on the other side. How can they possibly live with this?\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 24 times more farming \nestates would be hit by the Democrats' death tax proposal which they \nwrote in here. I have to believe they just did it so they could raise \nthe difference between the two bills from $28 billion--3 days' spending \nby the Federal Government--to a little over $50 billion--5 days' \nspending. Let's call it 8 days' spending. The number of small \nbusinesses hit by this death tax spike would grow by 13 times.\n  What would that do to the incentives for people to build small \nbusinesses, small businesses that could become big businesses and \nemploy thousands of people? This proposal would subject 2,400 percent \nmore farms and 1,300 percent more small businesses to the death tax.\n  Farmers work all their lives hoping to leave their farm to their \nchildren. They will have to sell the farm to be able to pay the death \ntaxes our friends on the other side have written into this bill. They \ncan't be serious. But they are. I would like to be a fly on the wall \nwhen some Members of this body go home and attempt to defend their \nsupport for a proposal effectively designed to hobble small businesses \nand family farms.\n  The President might think it is no big deal. I am sure he has never \nbeen on a farm, other than since he has been President. I am not sure \nhe has ever worked with a small business. He has been a community \norganizer. That is important, but that doesn't necessarily qualify \nsomeone for President. After all, according to the President, those \nfarmers and businessmen were not responsible for their success anyway.\n  I am going to give the President the benefit of the doubt on that \none. I think maybe he misspoke. But I sometimes believe, in the \nPresident's view, he thinks these folks aren't very smart; they owe it \nall to the bureaucrats stationed at the Departments of Agriculture and \nLabor and their helpful investment-creating regulations. We all know \nabout those, don't we? The sweat and tears and sacrifice of the \nfamilies and individuals who create and run small businesses have \nnothing on the hard work and commitment of the mid-level bureaucrats \nwho make their success possible.\n  But my guess is that some Members of this body have a slightly more \nnuanced understanding of the importance of these farms and businesses \nto their communities, on both sides of the aisle. They have to.\n  There is a limit to what this President should ask of my Democratic \nfriends, and he is asking way too much. They should stand up and say, \nWe have had it. We are not going to do this.\n  It seems clear what the agenda of the Senate should be. We should be \nfocused like hawks on preventing\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nTaxmageddon. We should be focused on job creation. Yet instead of \naddressing these important matters, President Obama and his Democratic \nallies are spinning their wheels trying to raise taxes on politically \nunpopular groups. Even the Democrats' treasured Keynesian economics \nsays you do not raise taxes in a weak economy if you want to create \nmore jobs.\n  The President is devoting his entire reelection campaign toward tax \nhiking in the name of fairness. We have voted twice on proposals to \nraise taxes on oil and gas companies for no other reason than that \nDemocratic pollsters found the President's base does not like oil and \ngas companies. Then a few months ago, we voted on the silly Buffett \nrule. This was not serious tax policy. It was a statutory talking \npoint--and not a very good one at that. Then there was last week's bill \non overseas investment that was little more than a campaign \nadvertisement with cosponsors.\n  The American people are tired of these political stunts. They are \ntired of the Senate doing nothing. They are tired of the Senate \nbringing up bills that aren't going to go anywhere. Every minute \nDemocrats spend playing politics is a minute we fail to prevent the \nlargest tax increase in American history. But instead of working to \nprevent this massive tax hike on small businesses, the President and \nthe congressional Democratic leadership have doubled down on their tax \nhike strategy.\n  Believe it or not, while doubling down on their tax hike strategy, \nour friends on the other side are pushing the canard that the Hatch-\nMcConnell proposal is a tax hike. Yesterday, one of our colleagues--who \nI won't name, though he named me--said the following:\n\n       Republicans claim not to want to raise taxes, but the \n     Republican tax bill would let very popular lower and middle-\n     class provisions expire that would cost 25 million Americans \n     an average of $1,000 each. Under the Republican bill, 12 \n     million families would see an end to the--a smaller child tax \n     credit. Six million families would lose their earned income \n     tax credit and 11 million families would lose their American \n     opportunity tax credit.\n\n  A little over 11 years ago, one-fourth of the Democratic caucus \nsupported the bipartisan 2001 relief plan which is the foundation of \nthe policy underlying the Hatch-McConnell bill. At that time, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation showed that the bill distributed an across-the-\nboard tax cut which made the Tax Code more progressive. The 2003 bill \nwas passed on a narrower bipartisan basis and extended on a broader \nbipartisan basis in 2004 and 2006--bipartisan. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation data showed that, against current law, the fiscal cliff my \nfriends are threatening is, not surprisingly, basically the same as it \nwas in 2001, 2003, and 2006.\n  In other words, the Hatch-McConnell proposal provides across-the-\nboard tax relief benefiting virtually every income tax payer, yielding \na tax system that is more progressive than we would face if we went \nover the fiscal cliff. Let me repeat that.\n  The Hatch-McConnell proposal provides across-the-board tax relief \nbenefiting virtually every income tax payer, yielding a tax system that \nis more progressive than what we would face if we went over the fiscal \ncliff. The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis indicates a similar \nresult today.\n  To be sure, if you count continuous stimulus checks issued by the \ngovernment to folks who do not pay income tax as tax cuts, the \nDemocrats' proposal does more of that than the Hatch-McConnell \nproposal. There is no question about that. But when is it going to end? \nIs the upper 49 percent going to have to continue to carry everything \nin this country?\n  Under Federal budget law, those continuous stimulus checks are \ncounted in the main as spending. I would say to the colleague I \nreferred to a moment ago that if the Democrats want to use that talking \npoint--one at odds with conventional budget accounting--it is a free \ncountry. But if Democrats are going to make that strained and tortured \ncharge, then they should also answer for the failure of their bill to \npatch the AMT for the year they claim to be delivering middle-income \ntax relief.\n  Their plan exposes 28 million middle-income families to a stealth tax \nincrease of over $3,500 per family. So while they claim that our bill \nraises taxes by cutting stimulus spending, they are mum on the massive \ntax increase on 28 million American families implicated in their own \nbill. I think we might have a case here of folks in glass houses \nthrowing stones.\n  Make no mistake, Taxmageddon is coming. The only good news is that \nCongress can prevent this historic tax increase from happening. As I \nmentioned, I have a bill I have introduced with Senator McConnell--S. \n3413, the Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2012--which will prevent this \nhistoric tax increase and will pave the way for tax reform in 2013. \nThat is where my focus will be until Taxmageddon is averted. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in preventing this looming tax increase from \nbeing imposed on the American people.\n  Forty of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to \ntemporarily extend this tax relief in 2010, recognizing that we were in \nfinancial difficulty--we are in worse difficulty today--and they should \ndo so again. At that time, President Obama said it would be foolish to \nraise taxes during an economic downturn, and he acted accordingly. I \nrespect him for that. But he is not acting that way now. This is an \nelection year.\n  Our economy remains weak today. In fact, it is weaker in terms of \ngrowth in GDP than it was at the end of 2010, and incoming data clearly \npoint to even more slowing in the economy as uncertainty from the \nfiscal cliff has begun to strangle hiring and investment. My friends on \nthe other side have got to wake up to these facts. The only thing that \nappears to have changed is that President Obama has apparently chosen \nthe path of class warfare and is pursuing a politics-driven tax agenda.\n  I remember days in the past when my friends on the other side would \nrise up against even their own President when it came to good \neconomics. I hope they will again, but it appears that it is not so \ntoday. My hope is my colleagues, who have supported this tax relief in \nthe past, will put the President's shortsighted and self-interested \npartisanship aside and vote on behalf of their constituents in favor of \nS. 3413 to extend this tax relief to America's families and small \nbusinesses.\n\n  For the sake of the more than 12.7 million unemployed Americans, my \nhope is that we act to prevent the President's campaign drive to malign \nsmall businesses and raise their taxes, and that it does not get in the \nway of sound tax policy and job creation. To put us through this for a \ndifference of a little more than $50 billion between the two bills is \namazing to me. That amounts to about 5 days of Federal spending. And to \ndo this because the President wants it done? Sometimes it is good for \nthis body to stand up and say, Mr. President, you are going too far.\n  What have I proposed? I proposed that since it is even worse than \n2010, when the President thought it was the wise thing to do in a \nfragile economy that we put over the 2001, 2003 tax cuts for 1 year--1 \nyear--and that we strike out a new force in this Senate and in the \nHouse to do tax reform in that year on a bipartisan basis.\n  I don't believe that is an unreasonable request, especially under the \ncircumstances that we have seen with the potential of Taxmageddon. I \nactually believe it would be very wise on the part of all Senators to \ndo exactly that. And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could work together \nfor a change over the next year, knowing that year is devoted to tax \nreform.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter dated July \n25, 2012, from the Associated Builders and Contractors printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Associated Builders\n\n\n                                        and Contractors. Inc.,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 25, 2012.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Associated Builders and \n     Contractors (ABC), a national association with 74 chapters \n     representing 22,000 merit shop construction and \n     construction--related firms, I am writing to express strong \n     opposition to the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2012 (S. 3412), \n     an ill-considered measure that would amount to a massive tax \n     increase on business income, capital investment, and \n     succession.\n       Per the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 14 \n     percent of small business employers will see a double-digit \n     rate\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\n     increase under this bill, foisting a large tax hike on nearly \n     one million job creators at the worst possible time. \n     According to a new study by Ernst & Young, these tax \n     increases would cost more than 700,000 American jobs and \n     reduce the economy by 1.3 percent while diminishing wages and \n     capital investment. With roughly 80 percent of commercial \n     contractors paying business income taxes at the individual \n     level, this scenario would disproportionately harm the \n     construction industry.\n       Worse yet, the resurgent estate tax burden enabled by this \n     bill will harm family businesses across the spectrum. Absent \n     explicit congressional action, uncertain business owners \n     would be faced with an escalated 55 percent rate with a \n     severely diminished $1 million exemption. According to the \n     National Small Business Association, one-third of all small \n     business owners would be forced to sell outright or liquidate \n     a significant portion of their company to pay this punitive \n     tax. In a capital-intensive industry such as construction, \n     with a large proportion of closely-held and family-owned \n     businesses, a reversion to pre-2001 estate tax levels would \n     be nothing short of disastrous.\n       Rather than exposing nearly one in seven job creators to a \n     perilous fiscal cliff, Congress must act swiftly to extend \n     current tax policies as a bridge to comprehensive tax reform. \n     The Hatch-McConnell alternative plan would do just that, \n     continuing the 2001 and 2003 rates while abiding by the \n     bipartisan estate tax compromise reached in 2010 and \n     providing for a path to reform the code.\n       ABC strongly opposes the small business tax hikes contained \n     in S. 3412, and urges a NO vote for cloture on the motion to \n     proceed.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Geoffrey Burr,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                                  Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yearn for the day when we can see both \nsides come together and work together--work together in the best \ninterests of the country.\n  We know this Presidential election is close. We know they are \nvirtually in a tie right now. Let that play itself out, but let's do \nwhat is right here. Let's not hammer small business. Let's not have the \nbiggest tax increase in history. Let's not put this country into a \nrecession--and maybe even a depression. It was irresponsible, in my \neyes, for any Democrat or any Republican to say that if you don't give \nus what we want, we are going to allow Thelma and Louise to go off the \ncliff. And we are Thelma and Louise in this situation.\n  We can work together on an economic program that hopefully everybody \nin this body--or at least the vast majority--can support in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I hope we can get through this. I am very concerned about our country \nand very concerned about the way these types of things are being \nbrought up in this election year.\n  I will make one last comment. The Senate is not being run like the \nSenate. We are not going according to the regular order. We are not \ngoing through the committees. It is pure politics. I expect a little \nbit of that, but I don't expect everything to be pure politics. When \nour side isn't even given a chance in many circumstances to bring up \namendments in the greatest deliberative body in the world, you can see \nwhy there are some bad feelings around here. And it is all being done \nto protect some Members here rather than doing what is right for the \neconomy and for our country. We have got to wake up and start doing \nthings in a little better fashion around here. I hope we can.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will accept my suggestion \nhere. It is done in good faith. I believe we can dedicate next year to \ntax reform, and I believe we can get it done if we work together. I \nbelieve we can bring this country out of the morass it is in. And I \nsuspect if my colleagues on the other side will support what I have \nsuggested here today, the economy will start to turn around almost \nimmediately. It seems to me it would be to their benefit in this \nPresidential election year, even though I don't trust what some have \ndone in the past.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I am going to deviate for a moment from \nmy prepared comments. I listened to my good friend and colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch. I respect him greatly. As perhaps the only person \nwho actually runs a small business, I wish to comment on a few things \nand comment on this important piece of legislation we have in front of \nus.\n  Small business is defined not by the SBA, which is 500 and below. \nWhen I talk to small businesspeople, they wish they had 500 employees. \nIt would be a dream, but it is not a fact. We have to be careful about \nthe numbers, and there are a lot of numbers being thrown around.\n  There was the story about the gentleman from Florida who sold his \nbusiness and paid more taxes. I will be corrected if necessary, but \nwhen someone sells their small business, they pay capital gains tax, \nwhich is about 15 percent. So when they make more money when they sell \ntheir business--I have sold several of my small businesses over the \nyears, and if someone doesn't reinvest, they pay a certain rate, and \nwhen they reinvest, they can bypass it through an exchange afforded \nthrough the Tax Code.\n  My friend from Utah sits on the Finance Committee. I am guessing the \nsmall businessperson had a pretty good rate, 15 points, which isn't \nbad. Let me also make sure and be very clear, again, there are a lot of \nnumbers thrown around. The bills are very simple. They both cost money. \nOne costs $930 billion over the next 10 years and one costs $250 \nbillion. The proposal my friend from Utah suggested costs $930 billion \nover 10 years. That is how the Congressional Budget Office scores these \nthings. We can argue if we agree or disagree. It is amazing on days \nthey like the numbers they agree, on days they don't like the numbers \nthey disagree.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is the Congressional Budget Office. I \ndon't like the group. I like the people. I think they have a black \nmagic box there and come up with numbers. The fact is, those are the \nnumbers. That is the bipartisan organization that is selected by this \nbody jointly to determine these numbers. We can argue over them after \nthe fact. For example, when this extension that my friend talks about \nover there that in just 1 more year--how many times have we heard that? \nI have heard it twice since I have been here. It was a 10-year deal \nwhen it was first passed that would bring this relief and this growth \nand this economy beyond our belief. In the last 3\\1/2\\ years, I don't \nknow, the economy crashed. It is recovering now and struggling.\n  When I came here, they said: We need to extend it for just 2 years to \nhelp the economy. So we extended it. I voted to extend them all for 2 \nyears. I am not doing that again. We can't afford it. For 2 years, we \nhad this extension that was supposed to boom the economy. We have had a \nslow-growth economy. The people growing this economy are the small \nbusinesspeople. These are the people who have 25 or less employees. \nThey are the real small businesspeople.\n  As a matter of fact, this bill--and I heard the number. Again, I ask \npeople to listen to the numbers and the twisted commentary that \neverybody gives on both sides. In Alaska, we say it how it is. Here are \nthe facts, and we saw them in the documents, whatever may be presented \nto us. Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses in this country \nwill not see a tax increase because they are real small businesspeople.\n  When we walk out of this building and we go down the street for lunch \nand see the restaurateurs that are operating, there are not 500 \nemployees. There are 10 or 15 employees. I talked to the owner at the \nAlaska Growth Company today. He has 15 employees. The largest SBA \nlender, bigger than Wells Fargo, bigger than Key Bank, bigger than all \nof them, has 15 employees. That is a small business. Those are the \npeople we are talking about.\n  I respect my friend. He has been a lawyer all his life. I am not a \nlawyer. No disrespect to lawyers. I am a small businessperson. That is \nwhere I made my living, that is where I make my living, and that is \nwhere our family makes our living. Let's make sure it is clear what we \nare talking about.\n  When the Senator talked about--I can't remember the exact \npercentage--but 54 percent of these dollars are passed through. He \ntalked about dollars. Yes, because the 3 percent or the employers who \nhave over 25 or 50 employees have huge revenue streams. The small \nbusinesspeople in this economy, 97 percent of them make less than \n$250,000 net income. That is what we are talking about. I think every \nsmall business would love to have net income over $250,000. They strive \nfor it every\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nday. I know I do in my small business. I hope every day we achieve \nthese numbers. As the public listens carefully to the debate and as the \nminority leader said earlier today, there is a difference, a clear \ndifference. We cannot afford their bill. The taxpayers cannot afford \ntheir bill. It is $930 billion over the next 10 years, plus interest \ncosts. I heard over and over from the other side, 40 percent of what we \nborrow is--we have to borrow to pay our bills. Forty percent of \neverything we pay, we have to borrow. Where are they getting the $930 \nbillion? Where is that coming from? It costs money, it costs interest, \nand we don't have it because over the last decade and a half Democrats \nand Republicans spent like there was no tomorrow. Tomorrow is here.\n  We have to determine what our priorities are. Despite the fear \ntactics being laid out, I support small businesses 100 percent. Many \nbills I presented and supported over the last 3\\1/2\\ years were about \nprotecting and growing our small business. Define a real small \nbusiness. There are people who have to take their credit cards and \nfigure out how to get capital because banks will not give them the \nmoney. They have a dream of an opportunity and people look at them and \nsay: How much money do you have in the bank? You can mortgage your two \nhomes or one home or you can put everything up that you have as \ncollateral, plus maybe your first born. I have been through this.\n  My wife started her small business with a small investment out of her \nretirement funds, her own funds, and a small $30,000 SBA loan. Just as \na side note, I get so frustrated when I hear these ads, everyone is \ngoing to exaggerate what they hear and see. I am sure, whatever I say \ntoday, in 2 years they will take a couple words and use them against \nme. I expect that. They will say whatever they want. That is what \nopponents do in campaigns. It is too bad we can't talk about the \nissues.\n\n  I am not here to defend the President. The President gets to defend \nhimself. That is what he does. I have disagreed with the President more \nthan once. I have disagreed with my national party more than once. His \npoint is when we build a business, there are other elements that help \nbuild it.\n  For my wife's business, it was an SBA loan. I had a vending business. \nWhen I had those trucks on the street, those roads were built by a \ncollective group of taxpayers who helped to build those roads. It is a \ncombination of those things. Don't get me wrong. It is the blood, \nsweat, and tears of small businesses and the people who come up with \nthe dreams and ideas that create these businesses and push it forward.\n  So I sat here patiently. As I was presiding, I listened. The numbers \nare simple. One costs more, one costs less. The taxpayers can't afford \nit. As I said, 2 years ago, I supported the extension because I was \ntold we were going to invest. We were going to grow this economy \nsignificantly. We have grown it on the backs of small businesspeople. \nThat is on whom we have grown this economy. That is where the fastest \ngrowing population of new employees are coming from.\n  To my friend on the other side of the aisle, we gave that idea a \nshot. It didn't perform. I have to say as to Thelma and Louise--a scene \nI hear about all the time--thank God they were driving an American car. \nMy bet is they landed safely on the other side wherever they went. But \nthe fact is, it was in this body--and I heard the same arguments on the \nother side: We can't help our auto industry; we can't help them out of \nwhat they are struggling with--we took a calculated risk to support \nthose businesses that manufacture and employ people and today they are \nthriving because this body said we are going to take a risk. Again, \nThelma and Louise, thank you for driving an American car.\n  This is simple. It is about making sure 98 percent of Americans today \ncontinue to have tax relief. It is about 97 percent of the businesses \ncontinuing to have tax relief--small businesses. It is important that \nwe do this not only for the economy but for these families who are \nstruggling. There are 300,000 families in Alaska alone who will benefit \nfrom this relief.\n  There is a comment that I think Senator Lieberman said earlier, and I \nrecognize his point. His point is we should have real tax reform. I \nagree and that is why I sponsored a bill with Senator Wyden and Senator \nCoats on real tax reform. We are moving down the path, but we have to \nkeep doing some things here. We have to do some things that keep the \neconomy moving forward in the right direction.\n  A typical family of four in Alaska, if not without this relief, will \npay another $2,200 a year in taxes. A married couple making $80,000 \nwith one teenager at home and another in college will see their taxes \ngo up by $2,250. A couple earning $130,000 with one child will see \ntheir taxes go up $4,000. I could go on and on. We have choices to \nmake, and they are not going to be fun. Those days are gone. They did \nthat in the last decade and a half when they had all kinds of money to \nspend. We are in a different situation. We have to make choices of whom \nwe invest in to grow this economy.\n  I will invest in the small business community, the 97 percent that \nwill continue to receive tax relief under this bill and the 98 percent \nof Middle America who are working every day to try to make ends meet. \nThese are the folks I am focused on.\n  I recognize my colleagues on the other side want to again see massive \ntax reform. We have not had it since the early 1980s. I have not been \nhere since then. I know a lot of these guys have been here a long time \nand sit on the Finance Committee and other committees. Do it. I am all \ngame for amendments on the floor. I am all game for that. We did it on \nthe farm bill. I believe we had 80 amendments. We had a ton of \namendments on the Transportation bill. It doesn't bother me one darn \nbit. Vote on whatever we need to and move on. Let's move this economy \nforward and keep moving forward on the legislation that is critical.\n  Let me end on one point. I respect my colleagues on the other side. \nWe agree many times and sometimes we disagree. Today we disagree on \nthis issue. We don't have the money. We have to limit where we can put \nour resources and target them in the best way we can.\n  As I said, I voted a couple years ago for this extension on \neverything and more layoffs occurred in these big companies and certain \nthings happened that didn't show the economy growth. One thing did \nhappen. Small businesses did grow. For the first time in 5 years, home \nprices reported last week are up. New home starts are up for the first \ntime in many months. Why are those up? Because the small business \ncommunity and Middle America are starting to put money into those \nareas. That is important because that will grow this economy and grow \nit beyond our belief over the next decade, plus.\n  But for us to say we can still have the train moving at the speed we \nwere moving at before the crash, we can't do it. We can't extend these \ntax rates for everyone. They want us to give a little, so we are asking \nthe top 2 percent to give a little bit. At the end of the year, my \nguess is we are not going to extend the payroll tax. We can't afford \nit, so that means people on the other end will have to give a little \nbit. As my friend Senator Lieberman said, everyone needs to give a \nlittle bit. Yes, we are going to do that.\n  From my end, I see the give and take and tough decisions that are \nnecessary. That is what we were elected for, and that is why we are \nhere. To keep business as usual and say: Just for 1 more year, we will \ndo tax reform someday, well, that day is here. There is no tomorrow, \nand we have to make tough calls. So why not give the relief to the real \n97 percent of small businesses?\n  Again, I have to clarify. I have a sub S. I have an LLC. I understand \nthis. One comment my friend said was even if the owner didn't take a \ndime--I have a small business where I didn't take a dime. My LLC made \nmoney. I paid not corporate, but I paid a passthrough through me \nbecause I get a sub S, which is a combination of corporations.\n  The point is everyone needs to give a little to make it happen and \nmake it work. Today we are asking one group to give a little but making \nsure the bulk of our economy continues to move forward. We want to make \nsure the 300,000 Alaskans whom I see on a regular basis still get the \nrelief; for the small businesses that are creating jobs and creating a \ndream where they have to put a max on their charge cards to build the \nbusinesses because they can't get capital from the banks, or spending\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\ntime cashing out their retirement because they believe in their dreams, \nthat this might be their opportunity, these are the people I want to \nsupport.\n\n  So, again, I appreciate the time. I wish we had more than what \nhappens when we come down, we speak, we leave; we come down, we speak, \nwe leave. There is no real give-and-take. I wish my friend from Utah \nwas still here. We could have a great conversation about the data he \nused. But here is one simple point: One costs about $1 trillion, one \ncosts about $150 billion. We can afford the lower cost option which \nprotects 98 percent of the people in this country, giving them relief, \nand 97 percent of our small businesses.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Hoeven, for his courtesy of allowing me to speak now so \nthat I may take the Chair and listen to his speech.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support our economic recovery, \nendorse fiscal responsibility, and bolster the middle class by voting \nto extend tax cuts on income up to $250,000.\n  Minnesotans are still struggling, and we need to act now so people \nmaking under $250,000 can keep their tax cuts. Middle-class families \nneed every bit of help they can get. At the same time, we need to make \nsure the richest 2 percent of Americans are paying their fair share so \nwe can pay down the deficit. It would be irresponsible not to.\n  Thanks to the policies of the Recovery Act, we emerged from one of \nthe worst recessions in generations and actually stopped it from \nbecoming the second Great Depression. That being said, too many working \nfamilies are still struggling to find work, pay their rents or their \nmortgages, find affordable childcare, and send their kids to college. \nBy extending tax cuts to these families, we will be putting money in \ntheir pockets and, in turn, they will likely go out and spend that \nmoney in their communities, at their local small businesses, and \nfurther bolster recovery.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle look at this a bit \ndifferently. They have put forward a proposal that would extend tax \ncuts on income over $250,000 for a year as well, which would cost us \nover $800 billion in revenue over 10 years. They argue if we let taxes \ngo up on the richest 2 percent of Americans, we are inviting another \nrecession and we are stifling growth. They can make that claim over and \nover, but there is no evidence of this. It would be more helpful to \nexamine the facts and what recent history has taught us.\n  First, it is essential to clarify who exactly would get a tax cut \nunder the Democratic proposal. Luckily, the answer is easy: essentially \neveryone. If we pass the bill proposed by the majority leader and \nextend the tax cuts on the first $250,000 of income, everyone who \ncurrently pays income taxes will get a tax cut extension.\n  If a person makes $50,000, our bill preserves that person's entire \ntax cut. If a person makes $100,000, this bill preserves their entire \ntax cut. If a person makes $250,000, it preserves the person's entire \ntax cut, and their tax cut is also a lot bigger than the guy making \n$50,000 or $100,000. That might not be clear from some of the rhetoric \nwe have been hearing lately, but it is true.\n  People making over $250,000 would still get a tax cut worth thousands \nof dollars, and it would be larger than anybody else's tax cut. The \nonly portion of their taxes that would increase--or it would stay the \nsame as under the law we have now, which is to not extend the Bush tax \ncuts--would be on any additional income above $250,000. If a person \nmakes $250,000 plus $1, that person pays 39.6 percent on that extra $1. \nThat is a difference of 4.6 cents, a little less than a nickel. So for \nthose people under this plan, they get the benefit of thousands and \nthousands of dollars in tax cuts, minus a nickel.\n  Secondly, claims that not extending the extra tax breaks for the \nrichest 2 percent will cause harm to the economy are not supported by \nhistory. Let's take a look at President Clinton. When he proposed his \ndeficit reduction plan in 1993, every Republican in the House and every \nRepublican in the Senate opposed it. And what was their claim? Their \nclaim was that it would hurt businesses and cause a recession. Every \nRepublican voted against it.\n  What really happened in the ensuing years? Not only did we have an \nunprecedented expansion of our economy for 8 years, creating more than \n22 million new net jobs at the very tax rate we are talking about now \nfor people over $250,000, but, at the same time, we turned the biggest \ndeficit in history into the biggest surplus in history. President \nClinton handed President George W. Bush a record surplus. So the only \ntime in the last 30 years in which we actually had the budget in \nbalance was after we raised taxes on those at the top--the very level \nwe are talking about now.\n  Between 1993 and 2001, this country created an unprecedented number \nof jobs--22.7 million net--and did so while benefiting everyone up and \ndown the economic ladder. Not every individual but every quartile. \nThere was economic growth in every quartile. We witnessed a decrease in \nthe number of Americans in poverty, and we saw the creation of more \nmillionaires and billionaires than ever before. President Clinton's \ndeficit reduction plan not only reduced the deficit as planned, it \neliminated it entirely. So not only did we create all that prosperity, \nPresident Clinton then handed off a record surplus. I think this needs \nto be said. He handed off a record surplus to incoming President George \nW. Bush.\n  In fact, when President Bush took office, we were on track to \ncompletely pay off our national debt with $5 trillion of surpluses \nprojected over the next 10 years. In other words, we would have zeroed \nout our national debt last year--zero, no debt. But he cut taxes in \n2001, and he cut taxes in 2003, after we went to war--unprecedented in \nour Nation's history.\n  The decision before us today is a fundamental one: Should we extend \nthese tax cuts on income up to $250,000, preserving tax cuts for \neveryone, with the largest tax cuts going to those with incomes of \n$250,000 or more--they would get the largest tax cuts--or should we ask \nthe richest 2 percent to pay their fair share, to pay 4.6 percent extra \non income over $250,000, which has been shown historically to create \njobs? It poses a question about choices: We can choose to do the \neconomically responsible thing or we can choose to provide additional \ntax cuts for people who least need them.\n\n  When everyone pays their fair share, our Nation can get back on a \npath to fiscal responsibility and, at the same time, invest in quality \neducation, in infrastructure, in R for high-tech industries. These \nare the things which create prosperity. We can create good jobs in our \nmanufacturing sector and other emerging industries.\n  In fact, investing in the middle class is a win for everyone. The \nbuying power of the middle class is what sustains our economy, makes it \ngrow. Our economy doesn't grow from the top down. If our experience \nover the last 30 years teaches us anything, it is that. It grows from \nthe middle class out. President Clinton understood that and so does \nPresident Obama.\n  I have friends who have been very successful in the business world. I \nhave enormous respect for them and what they have accomplished, and I \ndo for almost every American who has been successful in building their \nbusinesses. There are some people who have taken some shortcuts and \nmaybe don't deserve our approval, but they are a very small fraction. \nWe honor, we celebrate people who have been successful.\n  This is what my friends who have been successful tell me. They say \nwhen the middle class is strong--when they have customers--they grow \ntheir businesses and can make more money. Believe me--I have had \nfriends tell me exactly this--they would rather pay a 39.6-percent \nmarginal rate on $2 million of income than pay 35 percent on $1 million \nof income. That is the difference between a booming economy and a \nstagnant one. How many times have we heard that the deficit is what is \nhurting our economy? We are talking about a difference of almost $900 \nbillion to get our deficit under control. All this is just common \nsense. It is common sense and taking a little bit of a look at history \nover the last 30 years. Policies that support and grow the middle class \nbenefit everyone and increase prosperity all along the economic \nspectrum.\n  So, in the end, we have a big decision to make today. Do we stand for \nour\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\neconomic recovery and for middle-class families and for addressing the \nbudget deficit with the Democratic proposal or do we continue to give \nextra tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of Americans instead of \nextending improvements in the child tax credit and earned-income tax \ncredit affecting more than 13 million working families while adding \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit?\n  Let's be clear. The Republican plan would raise taxes on 13 million \nmiddle-class and working-class families and get rid of the expanded \nearned-income tax credit to people who are working so we can pay for \ntax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. I hope we can show the \nAmerican people that common sense still prevails in the Senate by \nacting in unison across the aisle to do what is responsible.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to extend the middle-class tax cuts and \nto vote for the majority leader's bill.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Hoeven.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the need for \nprogrowth tax reform rather than a tax increase.\n  President Obama has proposed raising taxes. He says that we should \nraise income taxes on individuals and small businesses, that we should \nraise capital gains taxes on investments, and that we should raise the \nestate tax, meaning raise the death tax on American families.\n  For example, take the estate tax. You have a farmer. Right now, if he \nwants to pass his farm on to the next generation, for any value over $5 \nmillion, he has to pay the estate tax. Generally, families may be able \nto do that. They may be able to borrow the dollars required and pass \nthe family farm on to the next generation. But under this proposal, \nthat changes. Instead of paying the estate tax on anything over $5 \nmillion, now that farm family would have to pay the estate tax on \nanything over $1 million. So think about a farmer in my home State of \nNorth Dakota or maybe in Minnesota or anywhere else throughout the \nMidwest. How do they pass on that family farm when they are going to \nhave to pay taxes on any value over $1 million? So now they are looking \nat a situation where they are going to have to sell that farm rather \nthan have their children continue farming an operation that may have \nbeen in that family for generations. That is a real problem for our \nfarmers, for small businesses, and for families across this great \ncountry, and it certainly is not going to help our economy. In fact, it \nwill hurt our economy.\n  The President himself has said that we cannot raise taxes in a \nrecession. He has said repeatedly that doing so would hurt the economy \nand would, in fact, hurt job creation.\n  So let's review our situation right now. Our situation right now is \nthat we have 8.2 percent unemployment. We have more than 41 months in \nwhich unemployment has been above 8 percent. We have 13 million people \nout of work, and we have another 10 million people who are \nunderemployed. So you are talking about 23 million people in this \ncountry who are either unemployed or underemployed.\n  Middle-class income, since this administration has taken office, has \ndeclined on average from approximately $55,000 to $50,000.\n  Food stamps use. Food stamp recipients have increased from 32 million \nrecipients, when this administration started in office, to 46 million \nfood stamp recipients today.\n  Home values have dropped on average from $169,000 to $148,000.\n  Economic growth. Economic growth in this recovery is the weakest of \nany recovery since World War II. For the last quarter, our growth was \n1.9 percent versus the prior quarter--1.9 percent.\n  Job creation last month: 80,000 jobs. But it takes 150,000 jobs \ngained every month just to hold even with our population growth, just \nto start reducing that 8.2-percent unemployment rate.\n  Those are the facts. They speak for themselves. You can draw your own \nconclusion.\n  The President's approach to our economy is making it worse. His \nfailure to join with us in extending the current tax rates and engage \nin progrowth tax reform rather than raising taxes is sitting on our \neconomy like a big wet blanket. But we can change that, and we can \nchange that right now. We do it by extending the current tax rates, the \ntax rates that have been in effect for 10 years--not raising them but \nextending the current tax rates for a year--by engaging in \ncomprehensive, progrowth tax reform, and also, of course, by getting \ncontrol of our spending. Business investment and economic activity \nwould respond immediately.\n  Look at the latest information from the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe CBO projects that the economy will contract--will contract--by a \n1.3-percent annual rate for the first 6 months of next year if the \nfiscal cliff is not addressed, meaning the current tax rates, which go \nup at the end of the year unless we address this, an increase in taxes \nand the sequestration.\n  Now, if those things are addressed with the approach we have put \nforward, instead of an overall one-half percent of growth next year, \nyou are looking at 4.4-percent growth for our economy. Those are the \nCBO's statistics. Think of the difference--think of the difference--\nthat would make for those 13 million people who are looking for a job. \nIt just stands to reason because business needs certainty to invest, to \ngrow, and to hire people, not higher taxes. With legal, tax, and \nregulatory certainty, businesses in this country would invest and grow.\n  Right now, there is more private capital on the sidelines than at any \nother time in the history of our country. Private investment capital \nthat businesses would otherwise invest and get this economy growing and \nget people back to work is sidelined because of the regulatory burden, \nbecause of the government spending and the deficit and because of plans \nlike this to raise taxes. It is that situation which is sidelining \nprivate investment and private capital. That means slow economic \ngrowth. That means higher unemployment. That means more people without \njobs. That means less revenue to reduce our deficit and our debt.\n  So clearly raising taxes is not the way to go. But President Obama \nsays: Now, wait a minute, everybody needs to pay their fair share. \nRight? You hear him say that all the time: Everyone needs to pay their \nfair share. Well, of course everyone needs to pay their fair share, but \nthe way to do it is with progrowth tax reform and closing loopholes. \nThat is exactly what we have proposed, not raising taxes on more than 1 \nmillion small businesses in this country--the very job creators in this \ncountry--as the President has proposed.\n  Let's take a look at tax rates for just a minute. We talk about this \nall the time. Let's take look at these tax rates. According to the \nNational Taxpayers Union, for the tax year 2009, the top 5 percent of \ntaxpayers paid almost 60 percent of the taxes. One more time. The top 5 \npercent of taxpayers paid almost 60 percent of all the income taxes \npaid. The top 10 percent paid 70 percent of all income taxes, and the \ntop 50 percent paid 98 percent. The top 50 percent of taxpayers paid 98 \npercent of all income taxes.\n  So what we are proposing is progrowth tax reform, closing loopholes. \nLet's extend the current tax rates for 1 year and set up a process to \npass comprehensive, progrowth tax reform that lowers rates, that closes \nloopholes, that is fair, that is simpler, and that will generate \nrevenue from economic growth rather than higher taxes. The reality is \nthat, along with controlling government spending, is the only way we \nare going to balance our budget, that is the only way we are going to \nget on top of our deficit and debt, and that is the only way we are \ngoing to get these 13 million people back to work. Because that is how \nthis American economy works--when we stimulate that private investment, \nthat entrepreneurial activity of small businesses across this county \nthat has made our economy the envy of the world.\n  To be successful, this effort has to be bipartisan. We have to join \ntogether in a bipartisan way to make it happen. So let's get started. \nLet's give small businesses in this country the legal, tax, and \nregulatory certainty, the business climate, the environment they need \nto encourage private investment and innovation and job creation. That \nis the\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nAmerican way. That is the real American success story. We can do it, we \nneed to get started, and we need to make it happen now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to take some time at this point \nto talk about some events in Asia. I think we all need to be paying \nvery close attention to them. Before I do that, I would like to clarify \nmy position on the vote we are going to be taking this afternoon.\n  First, I wish to emphasize that I agree with all those comments that \nhave been made by my Democratic colleagues about needing to keep these \ntax cuts in place for our lower income workers, our middle class; I \njust happen to believe we need to keep them in place for everyone who \nis making their income through what we call ordinary earned income.\n  Earned income, ordinary earned income, is the strongest indicator \nthat a person in this country is actually accumulating wealth, which is \nthe American dream, and it is not necessarily that you have wealth--\nwhatever the amount may happen to be. Passive income, which is income \nfrom capital gains, such as investment in stocks or dividends, is one \nof the best indicators that you actually have accumulated a certain \namount of wealth--you have enough money to set aside and invest it.\n  So my long belief has been that if we are going to raise taxes on \nincome, in addition to these other things we have been talking about \nwith respect to tax loopholes and subsidies and those sorts of things, \nwe really ought to be doing so in the fairest place, and the fairest \nplace is from passive income, not ordinary earned income. I have said \nsince the day I announced for the U.S. Senate years ago that I will not \nvote to raise taxes on ordinary income of any amount. I gave a rather \ndetailed set of floor remarks several months ago about this issue.\n  I would like to share this particular chart with my colleagues today \nbefore I begin speaking on the situation in the South China Sea. This \nshows sources of income for the top 0.1 percent. We keep talking about \nthese people at the top who are not paying their fair share. Well, two-\nthirds of the money that is being made by the top 0.1 percent in this \ncountry--that is 140,000 taxpayers--is being made from passive income. \nIt is being made from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a \nmuch lower rate than ordinary income--right now, 15 percent.\n  So in addition to fixing the larger Tax Code, I would like to say \nagain to my colleagues that this is the area where we really should \nhave the courage to make some decisions.\n  I was reading an article in the Economist--this week's edition--\npointing out that American profits, corporate profits as a percentage \nof GDP, are actually higher now than they were at the high point before \nour economic crisis. In other words, corporate profits have gone up to \na point where they are now about 15 percent of our GDP at the same time \nour wages have stagnated and gone down. They made one point in here \nwhere they said there is an irony that a high share of GDP for profits \nautomatically results in a low share for wages. Why? Because the people \nwho are making the money by running these companies--the executives--\nare selling their stocks, their stock options, taking the lower \npercentage on capital gains in order to make their money.\n  So I am not going to vote for raising taxes on ordinary earned \nincome. But, again, I will renew my suggestion to this body that we \ntake a good, hard look at this because this situation is creating the \ngreatest disparity among our people.\n\n\n                            South China Sea\n\n  Mr. President, for many years, since well before I came to the \nSenate, I have had the pleasure to work and travel inside East Asia in \nmany different capacities--as a marine in Okinawa and Vietnam, as a \njournalist, as a government official, as a guest of different \ngovernments, as a filmmaker, as a business consultant.\n  What we have been able to do, I think, in the last 5 or 6 years in \norder to refocus our country's interest on this vital part of the world \nis one of the great success stories of our foreign policy. But at the \nsame time, we have to always be mindful that the presence of the United \nStates in Southeast Asia is the guarantor of stability in this region.\n  If you look up here at the Korean Peninsula, you will see that for \ncenturies there has been a cycle where the power centers have shifted \namong Japan, Russia, and China. This is the only place in the world \nwhere the geographical and power interests of those three countries \nintersect, and they intersect, with the Korean Peninsula being right in \nthe middle of it.\n  We saw earlier, actually in the middle of last century, what happened \nwhen Japan became too aggressive in this part of the world. The \nJapanese fought Russia in the early 1900s. They defeated them. This is \nwhen they moved into Korea, occupied Korea, moved into China.\n  This resulted in our involvement in the Second World War. And since \nthe Second World War, our presence has been the guarantor of stability. \nWe have seen blowups, the Korean war when we fought China in addition \nto North Korea, the Vietnam war, in which I fought. But generally the \nlong-term observers of this region, people such as Minister Mentor Lee \nKuan Yew of Singapore, will say that the presence of the United States \nin this region has allowed economic systems to grow and governmental \nsystems to modernize. We have been the great guarantor of stability.\n  The difficulty we have been facing in the past 10 to 12 years has \nbeen how to deal with the economic and international growth of China in \nthis region. Before China's expansion, when I was in the Pentagon in \nthe 1980s, we had seen the reemergence of the Soviet Union. When I was \nin the Pentagon at that time, on any given day Russia's dream of having \nwarm-water ports in the Pacific had been realized, to where they would \nhave about 20 to 25 ships in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, at the end of the \nVietnam war. But for the past 10 to 12 years, the challenge has been \nfor us to develop the right sort of relationship with China so we can \nacknowledge their growth as a nation but maintain the stability that is \nso vital in this part of the world.\n  The last few years have been very troublesome. There have been a \nnumber of issues out here in the South China Sea that for a long time \nour military leaders assumed were simply tactical engagements where \nChinese naval vessels and fishing vessels would be involved in spats \nwith the Philippines off the coast of Vietnam. But it became very \nclear--and also in the Senkaku Islands near Japan.\n  It became very clear after a while, though, that what we are seeing \nare sovereignty issues. People were talking for many years about \nsolving the situation in Taiwan, the sovereignty issue in Taiwan. It \nwas clear--I was speaking about this for many years--that there are \nmany other sovereignty issues once Taiwan is resolved: the Senkaku \nIslands, which Japan and China both claim, the Paracels, which China \nand Vietnam both claim, the Spratlys, which are claimed by five \ndifferent countries, including China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n  So we started seeing a resurgence of incidents that became military \nconfrontations over the past couple of years. Our Secretary of State \nand this administration were very clear 2 years ago, almost to the day, \nthat these situations were not simply Asian situations, that they were \nin the vital interests of the United States to be resolved peacefully \nand multilaterally.\n  We have been struggling on the Foreign Relations Committee to try to \npass the Law of the Sea Treaty where these sorts of incidents--which, \nby the way, are more than security incidents, they involve potentially \nan enormous amount of wealth in this part of the world. We have had a \nvery difficult time getting a Law of the Sea Treaty passed where most \nof the countries around the world recognize the basic principles of how \nto resolve these international issues through multilateral involvement.\n  In the absence of a Law of the Sea Treaty, and, I think, with the \nresurgence of the Chinese--a certain faction of the Chinese tied to \ntheir military, China has become more and more aggressive. This past \nmonth has been very troublesome. On June 21, China's State Council \napproved the establishment of what they call the Sansha City\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nPrefectural Zone. This is literally the creation from nowhere of a \ngovernmental body in an area that is claimed also by Vietnam.\n  Unilaterally on Friday, July 13, because of disagreements over how to \ncharacterize the South China Sea situation, ASEAN--the Association of \nEast Asian Nations, a 10-nation body, which has been very forthcoming \nin trying to solve these problems--failed to issue a communique about \nthe South China Sea issues, a multilateral solution of the South China \nSea issues.\n  On July 22, the Central Military Commission of China announced the \ndeployment of a garrison of soldiers to the islands in this area. The \ngarrison will likely be placed in the Paracel Islands right here, as I \nsaid, claimed by Vietnam, within the exclusive economic zone of \nVietnam.\n  July 23, China officially began implementing this decision. It \nannounced that 45 legislators are now to govern the approximately 1,000 \npeople who are occupying these islands. They have elected a mayor and a \nvice mayor. They have announced that a 15-member standing committee \nwill be running the prefecture. They have announced that this city they \nare creating will administer more than 200 islands, sandbanks, reefs, \ncovering 2 million square kilometers of water.\n  In other words, they have created a governmental system out of \nnothing. They have populated with a garrison an island that is in \ncontest in terms of sovereignty, and they have announced that this \ngoverning body will administer this entire area in the South China Sea.\n  China has refused to resolve these issues in a multilateral forum. \nThey claim these issues will only be resolved bilaterally, one nation \nto another. Why? Because they can dominate any nation in this region. \nThis is a violation, quite arguably, of international law. It is \ncontrary to China's own statements about their willingness to work with \nASEAN, to try to develop some sort of code of conduct. This is very \ntroubling. I would urge the State Department to clarify this situation \nwith China and also with our body immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to share my concerns over the \nproposed changes in the estate and gift tax provisions of the current \nTax Code that will be considered within hours on the floor.\n  Similar to much of the Tax Code, the estate and gift tax provisions \nare terribly complex, costly to comply with, and have very serious \nnegative consequences. These negative consequences disproportionately \nharm farmers and ranchers and worry their lenders.\n  Visiting with farmers and stockmen today--livestock producers--one \nhad better stand back. They are upset, they are frustrated, they are \nangry, they are concerned, and they are worried.\n  All across farm country, we are suffering from a severe drought--\nwhich is a real emergency, historic in scope and damage, particularly \nfor our livestock industry. Congress should respond. At the same time, \nthey are facing a farm bill that is in limbo, regulations that defy any \ncommonsense cost-benefit yardstick, and no farmer or their lender can \nplan in this environment. In farm country, there is no certainty.\n  But just to split the shingle, now we have proposed changes to the \ncurrent estate tax--the infamous death tax--all based on a select few \nin Washington deciding who is wealthy, what is a fair share people \nshould pay in a tax and how they should pay that tax, playing again \nwith the politics of envy and class warfare. I think we ought to quit \nthis business. The classic example is that under current law, the \nFederal estate tax is set at 35 percent on estates over $5 million.\n  If nothing is changed, on January 1, 2013--or if Senators vote for a \nparticular version of the two tax bills we are going to be considering \nin just about 1\\1/2\\ hours--if nothing is changed, the estate tax \nexemption will drop from $5 million to $1 million and the estate tax \nrate will jump from 35 percent to 55 percent.\n  If we do not act to extend the current death tax structure--I would \nlike to eliminate it; I would like to repeal it but at least extend \nit--the Joint Committee on Taxation reports that over 10 years, the \nnumber of small businesses subject to the death tax will increase from \nabout 1,800 folks to 23,700, and the number of farming estates subject \nto the death tax would increase from about 900 farmers and ranchers to \n25,200. That is more than 20 times additional farming estates that \nwould be hit with this massive death tax hike, a 2,000-percent \nincrease.\n  It is not just farmers and ranchers who would be affected. Nine times \nmore small businesses would be hit with this massive death tax--a 900-\npercent increase. Twelve times more taxable estates would be hit--a \n1,200-percent increase. While I support permanently repealing the death \ntax, if we cannot achieve that goal, how we structure this tax in \nparticular has immediate real-world implications for folks in Kansas \nand across the country.\n  The looming 2013 change to the estate tax law would be a huge \ndisservice to agriculture because it is a land-based, capital-intensive \nindustry with few options for paying estate taxes when they come due.\n  The current state of our economy, coupled with the uncertain nature \nof estate tax liabilities, makes it tremendously difficult for family-\nowned farms and ranches to make any sound business decisions. They are \non the sidelines of our economy. They are not on the economic playing \nfield. Again, there is no certainty.\n  Obviously, raising the estate tax burden will strike a blow to farm \nand ranch operations trying to transition from one generation to the \nnext. A $1 million exemption sounds like a lot. To some people in this \nChamber--and obviously to some people within this administration--at $1 \nmillion a person is rich, they are wealthy, with no consideration as to \nwhat the personal situation is for that individual, but somebody just \ndetermining what a fair share is and then taking from that individual \nand redistributing to those whom they think deserve it.\n  But a $1 million exemption is not high enough to protect a typical \nfarm or ranch able to support a family. When coupled with a top rate of \n55 percent, that is going to be especially difficult, if not \nimpossible, for farms and ranches and businesses to pass on their \nwherewithal to the next generation.\n  Yet our Nation's estate tax policy is in direct conflict with the \ndesire to preserve and protect our Nation's family-owned farms and \nranches. Individuals, family partnerships, and family corporations own \n98 percent of our Nation's 2 million farms and ranches. When estate \ntaxes on an agriculture business exceed cash or other liquid assets, \nmany surviving family partners will be forced to sell land, buildings \nor equipment needed to keep their businesses operating.\n  With 85 percent of farm and ranch assets illiquid, producers have few \noptions when it comes to generating cash to pay the estate tax. Recent \nincreases in agricultural land values--on average, 25 percent from 2010 \nto 2011--have greatly expanded the number of farms and ranches that now \ntop the estate tax exemption. How on Earth can farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall businesses even plan for this?\n  In order to keep farm or ranch businesses operating after the death \nof the owner, families must plan for the estate tax. But under the \nmajority party bill we will vote on shortly, many more farmers and \nranchers will face increased filing, paperwork, and other hassles in \nplanning for succession, not to mention lawyers, CPAs, and estate \nplanners. In fact, if we don't extend the current estate tax, estates \nrequired to file paperwork with the IRS rise from about 8,600 to \n107,500. That is a lot of time and cost that could be avoided.\n  The planning costs associated with this tax are not only a drain on \nbusiness resources but also take money away from the day-to-day \noperations and investing in the business. Even with planning, uncertain \ntax law combined with changing land values and family situations make \nit impossible to guarantee that an estate plan will protect the family \nfarm or ranch. This not only can cripple a farm or ranch operation, but \nit hurts all throughout our rural communities, up and down Main Street, \nevery business that agriculture supports.\n  The death tax is one of the worst offenders in bringing real \ncomplexity to the Tax Code, and I believe it is one of the most \ndistortive provisions in our system.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  Some believe and will point out that the estate tax is an instrument \nof social justice; that it is designed to limit wealth accumulation and \nto spread that wealth around, something I think that is contrary to \nwhat this country is all about.\n\n  Why do you work? You work hard to make a difference, and you work \nhard because you enjoy the work and hopefully you get paid for it--and, \nhopefully you get paid for it enough that you can at least have enough \nwherewithal so your kids and their kids can continue that kind of \nendeavor if they so choose. But some people say we want to spread that \nwealth around.\n  Even if someone holds what I consider a socialistic view--a tough \nword; it is a pejorative, I know, but I think that applies here--the \nestate tax, which distorts no end of economic decisions, isn't the most \nefficient method to redistribute wealth. If you are a wealth \nredistributor, if you will, in this body, clearly taxpayers facing the \ndeath tax respond to the tax by cutting back on investments, consuming \nmore of the capital and other assets that could be passed on to build \nbusinesses.\n  So the disincentives the death tax creates in the end lead to lower \ngrowth, fewer jobs, and less savings. How do we redistribute that? \nThere is nothing to redistribute. In a troubled economy, this forced \noutcome does not make sense.\n  Being able to plan for the future is critical. The current \nuncertainty leads to the repeated provisions of wills and trusts, which \nburdens taxpayers and advisers alike. I don't care what farm \norganization I am talking to, what commodity group, what small business \ngroup, wherever I go in my State of Kansas--and I think it is the same \nin regard to other States that Members are privileged to represent--\nover and over, I have been asked again what Congress will do with these \nprovisions: What should a rancher do? How can they pass farms on to \ntheir children?\n  I have even been asked, for planning purposes--I am not making this \nup--if this is a good year to die. That is astounding, if not \noutrageous. It may be a good year to die because this egregious change \nis going nowhere.\n  These two bills we are considering in just a few moments are not \ngoing anywhere. We will vote in a little while, but they are both \nsubject to a point of order--not having originated in the House, they \nwill be blue-slipped. That is a fancy word, a parliamentary word, \nsaying they are going nowhere because bills on taxes have to originate \nin the House. Talk about a real income redistribution--a nothing \nburger. That is what we are considering. But it is indicative of what \nis being considered in this Chamber and indicative of what we have to \ntake care of in true tax reform.\n  Folks in Kansas should not have to make such important decisions on a \ntax law that is changing all the time. We need to repeal or permanently \nreset the death tax. If this tax cannot be repealed, it needs to be set \nin stone--hopefully, not a gravestone--and at a rate and in a manner \nthat provides certainty.\n  While it is important to permanently eliminate this very punitive \ntax, until this can be accomplished, Congress should at least extend \nthe current $5 million exemption, indexing it to reflect land values \nand continuing the spousal transfer and maintaining the top 35-percent \ntax rate.\n  We pay taxes all of our lives. It just doesn't make sense to be taxed \nagain when we die.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, although I note that my colleague \nfrom Illinois is perhaps ready to speak. I will be happy to yield back \nany time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a short time we are going to vote on a \ntax measure that gives the Senate a very clear choice, and here is the \nchoice: At the end of this year, a whole battery of tax cuts that were \nenacted into law years ago will expire, on December 31. The question \nis, What is going to happen next? If we do nothing, a very good thing \nwill happen but also a very bad thing will happen. The good thing is \nthat if the taxes go up on virtually all Americans for 10 years, we \nwill reduce our deficit by $5 trillion--more than any group has been \nable to suggest or come up with a plan to achieve in any of the \nmeetings in which we have been involved. That is $5 trillion in deficit \nreduction. It is an amazing reduction. There is another side to the \nledger. On the other side of the ledger it says: If we start taxing \nfamilies now while this economy is in recovery, it is going to slow \ndown the recovery. Well, that is natural. People have less money to \nspend, and many working families living paycheck to paycheck will face \na new hardship they don't have today. They reduced their spending, the \neconomy contracts, and we see this recession hang on with high \nunemployment and businesses failing.\n  So it really is a very Faustian choice, a difficult choice--reduce \nthe deficit dramatically, on one hand, by letting all the tax cuts \nexpire but risk going into a deeper recession and maybe repeating what \nhappened a few years ago, which devastated our economy.\n  The President said: Let's try to strike the right balance. When all \nof the tax cuts expire on December 31, let's focus on restoring the tax \ncuts for that portion of American families and workers who need a \nhelping hand to continue. But let's not go all the way. Let's not \nrestore the tax cuts for those in the highest income categories.\n  So the President says: We can have both. If we follow my plan, we \nwill reduce the budget deficit because we don't give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest, and we will still help working families, and we will keep \nthe economy moving forward.\n  He tries to strike that balance. The balance he strikes is that \neveryone will get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of income, even \nmillionaires, but not beyond that.\n  The Republicans have a different approach. They will offer an \namendment--extend all the tax cuts for everyone to the highest levels \nof income, well beyond $250,000, not just to the 98 percent of the \nAmericans who make $250,000 or less but 100 percent, everybody. Well, \ntheir approach, by extending those tax cuts, will mean no deficit \nreduction. In fact, their approach would add about $900 billion to the \ndeficit compared to the President's approach. So they are really \nbasically throwing a bucket of red ink on this conversation and saying: \nWe are prepared to add $900 billion to the deficit so that the top 2 \npercent of wage earners can get a tax break.\n  That isn't all. The Republican approach, which will be offered by \nSenator Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, \ngoes a step further. I don't understand this part of it. He wants to \nextend the tax cuts to the highest income categories, but then he very \ncarefully excises or eliminates some of the basic tax breaks working \nfamilies use.\n  Let me be specific. The Hatch-McConnell bill does not extend the \nearned-income tax credit, child tax credit provisions, and as a result \nhere is what happens: The Hatch provision, which protects the \nwealthiest in America by saving their tax cut, would increase the tax \non 11 million working families in America who currently are able to \ndeduct the college tuition expenses for their kids. So while the \nwealthiest in America will get a break all the way through with the \nHatch-McConnell Republican approach, 11 million American families will \nfind their tax bills going up if they have kids in college.\n  What kind of message is that? Here the students are struggling to get \nthrough school, families are incurring debt, and we create a tax \nbenefit to help those families get through, but the Republicans say: \nNo, we are going to raise the taxes on 11 million working families.\n  That is not all. They also raise the taxes on 6 million other \nfamilies, working families with three or more children, by $800 each on \na change they refused to make on the earned-income tax credit and then \nturn around--and I think this is one of the worst--and increase the \ntaxes on families with children. The child tax credit currently in the \nlaw allows a break for families with kids, a helping hand, because kids \ncan be expensive. This is part of the Tax Code that helps these \nfamilies.\n  So about 25 million American families will see their taxes go up with \nthe Hatch-McConnell Republican tax approach that protects those at the \nhighest level of income categories. I don't think that is sensible.\n  I have spent a lot of time in the last couple of years talking about \nthis deficit. It is serious. I guess I come from\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nthe Democratic side of the spectrum, the left side of the spectrum. \nThat is what my values reflect, and that is what my voting record \nreflects. But I will say this: This Democratic Senator understands that \ndeficits are for real. We cannot continue to borrow 40 cents of every \ndollar we spend, even for the programs I love, let alone the programs I \nam not so crazy about. So we have to reduce spending, but we can't \nbalance the budget with millions of Americans out of work. We need to \nget this economy growing, moving forward, and creating jobs.\n  People who are working and paying taxes make this a strong country \nand start to solve some of our deficit problems just by virtue of the \nfact that they are working, paying their taxes, and raising their \nfamilies. So when it comes to these tax cuts, let me say that I am \npassionate about making certain working families get the break they \nneed.\n  Pew Trust did a survey last year. Here is what they asked working \nfamilies across America: If you had a family emergency and you needed \n$2,000 in 30 days, could you get it? Could you come up with $2,000 if \nthere was a major car repair or a pretty routine trip to the hospital \nor to a doctor's office? That can run to $2,000 in a hurry if you have \na broken arm. Consider the possibilities. So they asked all the working \nfamilies how many of them could come up with $2,000 in 30 days. The \nanswer was half of the working families. That means the other half \ncan't. It tells us how close to the edge many people are living.\n  That is why the President's proposal--the Democratic proposal here--\nthat gives the tax cuts and tax breaks to the working families makes a \ndifference. Ninety-eight percent of Americans will benefit from the \nPresident's approach; 2 percent will pay more. I think 2 percent will \npay their fair share.\n  The Republican approach means, for a person making $1 million in a \nyear--and just some quick math: that is $20,000 a week in income--it \nwould give them a $250,000 annual tax break. Come on. At this moment in \ntime, when we are dealing with the deficit and calling on Congress for \nmore spending cuts and saying we have to get it together as a nation, \n$250,000 a year in additional tax cuts for millionaires? I don't get \nit. I don't begrudge them their wealth. This country is based on \nsuccessful people who have led us in business and so many other \nendeavors. But I also think those people, when you talk to them, are \ndarned appreciative to live in this country and willing to help it move \nforward.\n  Then they make the argument that, well, wait a minute, if we raise \ntaxes on people making $1 million a year, we are going to hit a lot of \nthe ``business creators.'' Well, we looked at that. Ninety-seven \npercent of small business owners are exempt if we draw the line at \n$250,000 of income. I will concede that there are professional \ncorporations and S corps, investment fund managers, some accountants, \nsome lawyers, and some doctors who may be job creators. I don't doubt \nthat. But are we really asking a great sacrifice from someone making $1 \nmillion a year not to get a tax break to the full extent they did \nbefore?\n  I think what we understand is that if we are going to help the \nmiddle-class and working families in America and if we are going to \nmove the economy forward, we need a sensible tax policy.\n  I happen to be of the school that maybe not all the Democrats agree \nwith. On the Simpson-Bowles Commission, I was the one who said that the \nonly way to deficit reduction is to put everything on the table, \nincluding the programs that I think are critically important for \nAmerica's future.\n  Medicare makes a difference in the lives of 40 million-plus \nAmericans, and I want it to be there. I know it is going to run out of \nmoney in 11 years. Think about that. If we don't do a thing here and if \nwe get caught in political gridlock, the Medicare Program that 40 \nmillion-plus Americans depend on is going to run out of money. What \nexcuse are we going to come up with? There is no excuse. We need to sit \ndown, look at this program, make sure that works, and make sure it is \naffordable for seniors. We have to do it sooner rather than later.\n  We hear so much about Social Security. Let's get the facts out. For \nat least the next 22 years, Social Security is going to make every \npromised payment to every retiree in America, with a cost-of-living \nadjustment, no questions asked. We can't say that about many, if any, \nFederal programs. But in the 23rd year, we will be in trouble. We will \nhave a dropoff in revenue in the Social Security trust fund, and the \npayments would have to be cut about 30 percent.\n  If you are wealthy in retirement--and some people are--your Social \nSecurity check is like a little extra dividend, but for some people, it \nreally determines whether they are going to get by for another month, \nand a 30-percent cut is unacceptable.\n  We need to look at Social Security. It doesn't add a penny to the \ndeficit, but the Social Security trust fund needs to be stronger \nlonger. We need a bipartisan approach to this. We did it 50 years ago, \nand we can do it now. We need to sit down and make sure it works. We \nshouldn't decide that this is out of bounds. That is something we need \nto consider.\n  It won't be voted on today, neither Medicare nor Social Security. We \nare just dealing with the tax side of this conversation. I happen to \nbelieve all of these things need to be discussed. When it comes to \ntaxes, we are pretty basic on that. I want to make sure working \nfamilies have a tax code that helps them.\n  Think about this for a second. Last week we had a bill on the floor \nof the Senate, and here is what it said. Currently the Tax Code creates \nincentives and rewards American businesses that want to ship jobs \noverseas. American businesses that want to outsource and ship jobs \noverseas, the Tax Code says, we will give you a break. They will pay \nless taxes if they send jobs away. That makes no sense at all. Why \nwould we reward the export of American jobs? Why would we provide for \nthe deductibility of moving expenses and other expenses related to \nmoving their business out of America and hiring people in another \ncountry?\n  So last week Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Senator Sherrod \nBrown of Ohio came to the Senate floor and said: Let's eliminate the \ntax incentive to move jobs overseas, and let's turn it around. Let's \ncreate a tax incentive for businesses that want to bring jobs back to \nAmerica. Sounds right to me, doesn't it, that we are creating jobs in \nthis country and discouraging them from going overseas? In the end, we \nhad all the Democrats voting for it and only 4 out of the 47 \nRepublicans voting for it. That is not enough to break the Republican \nfilibuster.\n  When we talk about a tax code, I not only want to help working \nfamilies, I want to provide an incentive and reward for those good, \nhome-based American corporations that are trying to keep good-paying \njobs right here in the United States of America. Honest to goodness, if \nwe want to walk into a store, pick up a product, flip it over, and see \n``Made in the U.S.A,'' we better wake up.\n  Currently what is going on is unacceptable. This notion on the \nRepublican side of the aisle that we shouldn't get in the way of \nbusiness when they want to make their decisions, I may not argue with \nthat premise, but I don't think we ought to incentivize it, subsidize \nit, provide something in the Tax Code to encourage it, particularly \nwhen it costs American jobs. But last week, only 4--4--of the 47 \nRepublicans would join us in that effort, so we came up short. This \nweek, we have to get it right when it comes to our Tax Code in the \nfuture and tax cuts for the families across America.\n\n  One of the things that has worried me greatly as I consider the \nchallenges facing families is their inability to provide for their kids \nthe way they want to. I think we all know the expenses of raising \nchildren. We all know what families face when the kids are off to \ncollege and we know some of the challenges they face after college. We \nhave come up with an approach which I think is sensible: a child tax \ncredit for the young kids; a deduction of college education expenses \nfor those who made it to that level of education; and then part of what \nsome call derisively ObamaCare, which says that families can keep their \nkids on their own family health insurance until those young men and \nwomen reach the age of 26. That makes sense. How many young people \ncoming out of college today\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\nstruggle to find a job and, if they find one, struggle to find a job \nwith health care benefits?\n  I can tell my colleagues that many times I would call my daughter or \nson after they got out of college and ask them about health insurance, \nand my daughter used to say, Dad, I don't need that now. I will get it \nlater. I feel fine. Well, she never knew and I didn't know what \ntomorrow would bring.\n  So if we are going to give peace of mind to families, let's make sure \nwe think along the spectrum, along the continuum. Why would the \nRepublican proposal today want to raise taxes on families with \nchildren, raise taxes on some 15 million families across America, \nincluding those with kids? If they can find room for a tax break for \nthe wealthiest, shouldn't they be able to include those families with \nkids? They may not be the wealthiest, but they are, in many cases, the \nneediest, and they are, in many cases, the most important for our \nfuture. Yet the Republican approach--the Hatch approach--is going to \nraise taxes on middle-income families with children. That is something \nwe should never allow to occur.\n  Let me say, this should be a simple vote for everyone in the Senate, \nacross the political spectrum. We ought to agree on two things. First, \nwe need to cut taxes for middle-income and working families. Second, we \nshould be responsible stewards of the Federal budget and not leave a \nmountain of debt for our kids. Giving tax breaks to the wealthiest \npeople and adding $900 billion to our national debt is not responsible.\n  Let's take this vote and show the American people we stand with them \nand their values. We stand for cutting middle-class taxes and putting \nour debt on a sustainable path to recovery.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. \nthe cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to S. 3412 be \nwithdrawn; the Senate adopt the motion to proceed to S. 3412, a bill \nextending the 2001, 2003, and 2009 tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans \nand 90 percent of all small businesses; that the only amendment in \norder to the bill be a substitute amendment offered by Senators \nMcConnell and Hatch, which is identical to the text of S. 3413; that \nthe amendment not be divisible; that the time until 4 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to a vote on \nthe McConnell-Hatch amendment; that upon disposition of the McConnell-\nHatch amendment, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as \namended, if amended; that there be no motions, points of order, or \namendments in order to the amendment or the bill; that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes; finally, that when the \nSenate receives a companion bill from the House providing for the \nextension of tax cuts, as designated by the majority leader, it be in \norder for the majority leader to proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; strike all after the enacting clause and insert the text \nof S. 3412 as passed by the Senate in lieu thereof; that the House \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, a statutory pay-go statement be \nread, if needed, and the bill, as amended, be passed with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the request be modified to strike the last \nparagraph and, further, that it also be in order for a second \namendment, the text of which will be at the desk and is the President's \nsmall business tax hike; further, that it be considered under the same \nterms of my amendment, and that after the vote on that amendment the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the McConnell-Hatch amendment as the \noriginal request provided for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nPresident's bill is the one that is before this body that I asked \nunanimous consent on. We have a Statement of Administration Policy. It \nis the President's bill. So I respectfully object to my friend's \nsuggested modifications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the original request by the majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend is objecting to the last paragraph \nin my request. He has asked consent to add a third provision. I have \nobjected to the third provision. He has objected to the last paragraph. \nI would be willing to renew my consent minus the last paragraph which \nbegins ``finally'' and ends with the word ``debate.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the new unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vote will occur at 4 o'clock today on \nthese two amendments. I appreciate very much the Republican leader \nallowing us to arrive at the point where we are. I would tell everyone \nthat the time until 4 o'clock is evenly divided, approximately an hour \nfor each side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if there are quorum calls between now \nand 4 o'clock the time be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about two things here \nbriefly and also yield to my colleague for some remarks. First of all, \nwhile it is beyond our jurisdiction here, and perhaps it is a little \nbit out of line for me to talk about this, I am urging the Congress, \nspecifically in this case the House of Representatives, to follow this \nbody in passing the farm bill.\n  I do so for a number of reasons. Even though I had some problems with \nthe farm bill, and I fully understand the issue, there are those who \nbelieve those policies that directly affect agriculture are being \nsubordinated to a bill which incorporates about 80 percent of that bill \nfor Federal food assistance. These are nutrition issues which, of \ncourse, are related to agriculture.\n  By the same token, it is a Federal program that is significantly \ndifferent than what the farm bill is designed to accomplish. So about \n20 percent of that bill affects the farmers in our area, the other 80 \npercent goes to a Federal welfare type of program for providing food \nstamps and other nutrition assistance.\n  I am hoping that the House, particularly in light of the fact we are \nsuffering a significant drought, probably the worst drought since 1950 \naccording to the weather records, and getting worse all the time--the \ntemperatures have been in the low hundreds all across the Midwest, the \nbread basket of America, where we produce most of our grain and \nfeedstock.\n  The cornfields and soybean fields and other pastures are burning up \nwith blazing sun in the hundreds of degrees every day and no water \nfalling from the sky. This drought is seriously impacting my State, but \nalso a number of Midwestern States and especially the States that \nproduce the bulk of our agricultural products. This affects not only \nneeded crops to provide feedstock, but also that support our ethanol \nprogram and a number of other programs. It is a dire situation.\n  I am hoping the House can resolve its issues and move forward. There \nare a number of provisions in this farm bill that provide relief to \nfarmers and ranchers suffering from this drought. Those are expired. So \nit is important that we pass this bill, that we get it passed by both \nHouses of Congress and into conference, resolved and signed by the \nPresident.\n\n  I am urging my colleagues in the House, where I once served, to help \nwith this by moving forward on this farm bill.\n  The other point I want to make is that we are about to face--we just\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\nlearned from our leadership, we are about to enter into a short amount \nof debate before we vote on a motion to address taxes. This also \ndirectly affects our agriculture community and we will explain why. But \nI wish to yield to my colleague here from Mississippi for some comments \nin this regard.\n  Mr. WICKER. I appreciate what my friend said about the drought. Much \nof my State at the last minute escaped it, but I happened to be in the \nState of Missouri in the past few days and saw the terrible drought \nconditions there.\n  I cannot think of a worse time, with our farm community being \ndevastated by this drought, to talk about a huge tax increase on our \nagriculture community, particularly in the form of the estate tax. I \njust learned a remarkable thing. I would ask my colleagues if this is \nthe state of the bill we will now be voting on at 4 this afternoon.\n  The result of this legislation would be to take the estate tax back \nup to 55 percent on all of the value of an estate over $1 million. This \nwould be a devastating tax increase. I honestly do not believe the \nAmerican people understand that this is the effect of the legislation \nour friends on the majority side have brought forward. But if this bill \nis passed the way it is currently configured, that would be the result. \nWe would go back to the old law, 55-percent tax on all, the value of \nthese southern and midwestern farms, of any small business across the \ncountry, would go up to 55 percent over values of $1 million. It is an \nunthinkable result. I frankly would not be surprised if the phones \nacross the street in our offices are ringing off the wall at this \nresult.\n  I ask my friend from South Dakota if I have misunderstood the effect \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might respond to my colleagues from \nMississippi and from Indiana, the Senator from Mississippi is \nabsolutely right. The proposal we will vote on as presented by the \nDemocrats today would allow the death tax exemption to go back to $1 \nmillion, that is the pre-2001 level, and apply a 55-percent tax rate on \ntop of that.\n  To give you an example of how that might work in a State such as \nmine, I represent South Dakota. The average size farm in my State is a \nlittle under 1,400 acres.\n  And if you look at the average value per acre of land and multiply it \nby the size of the average farm, you are talking about an average farm \nof between $2 million and $2.5 million in value. You could be talking \nabout--and this is average, and we have a lot of farms that will be \nimpacted more significantly than this. But you will be subjecting about \n$1.5 million of that farm's value to a 55-percent tax rate; and 84 \npercent of the value of farm assets, according to USDA, is in real \nestate. They are land rich but cash poor.\n  What happens? When the IRS comes calling after somebody passes away \nand says: Your farm is worth this amount, we are going to assess a 55-\npercent tax, they will say: We cannot pay that. We have it in land but \nnot cash. So they have to sell land, assets, and equipment to pay the \nIRS. Here we are trying to promote the intergenerational transfer of \nfarms and ranches as part of the tradition and backbone of our economy, \nand this is the absolute opposite of what we ought to be encouraging. \nWe want policies that encourage the situation that family farms and \nranches stay in the family.\n  Having a confiscatory tax like this that would apply a 55-percent tax \nto assets above $1 million will have a crushing impact on farms and \nranches in my State and, I submit, to other States.\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senator will yield for a moment, this has also the \nsame effect on mom-and-pops, family businesses that may have been in a \nfamily for generations. We are going to impose a 55-percent \nconfiscatory tax on them.\n  I am just speechless that this bill has now gotten to the point where \nit brings us back to the earlier punitive estate tax rates.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might say to my colleague from Mississippi and to the \nSenator from Indiana, to put this into perspective, the proposal in the \nDemocratic bill, which would take the exemption back down to $1 million \nand raise the top rate to 55 percent, would apply to 24 times the \nnumbers of farms and ranches as does current law. In other words, it \nincreases by 24 times the number of family farms and ranches that would \nbe impacted by the estate tax relative to where we are under current \nlaw.\n  As the Senator from Mississippi pointed out, lots of mom-and-pop \nbusinesses--13 times the number of small businesses--would now be \nsubject to the death tax as is the case with current law. So if we look \nat the impact of this, certainly on farm and ranch country--and I see \nthat Senator Moran is here, who represents a lot of farmers and \nranchers very much like those in my State of South Dakota--this is \nprofoundly impactful. It would have a very negative impact on farm and \nranch country--and I also argue, as the Senator from Mississippi \npointed out--and on a lot of mom-and-pop small businesses.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my colleagues for joining in on this. They made \nthe point that I think outlines the fact that many of us are stunned \nwith the proposal being brought forward for a vote today to proceed on \nthis bill, which if passed, will put a 55-percent tax, when one dies, \non all the work and all the profits and all of the investments they \nhave made throughout their lifetime, which they have paid taxes on over \nand over and over. The government cannot ever seem to get enough. The \nSenate Democrats are now proposing to raise the death tax from 35 \npercent, the current level, to 55 percent.\n  Let me personalize this for a moment. We have some very close friends \nwho, throughout generations, have been handing the farm down from one \ngeneration to another. They have suffered through the hard times, the \ndroughts, the hail storms, the tornadoes, and they have also benefited \nfrom the good times when the rains have come and the soil was good and \nthe yield was good. Yet right now they are suffering in a way they have \nnot in more than a half century with this drought that is unrelenting \nall across the Midwest in this country. It takes in almost the entire \nFarm Belt of the Midwest and Upper Midwest, where most of our grain and \nproducts are grown.\n  At a time like this, to bring forth a piece of legislation that \nbasically says not only are you being nailed by the weather--and we, \nobviously, cannot do anything about that except provide some basic form \nof financial relief to get through this particular time; and that is \nwhat I talked about earlier--but we are going to nail you with a tax \nthat, when you die, will basically prevent you from passing on your \nbusiness or your farm to the next generation.\n  As I said, to personalize it, we have some dear friends--more than \none couple. I have also talked to people throughout Indiana where the \npride in holding their ground as part of their extended family, \ncovering more than one and two generations, and the work they have put \nin, in order to preserve that hand-down to their children and to their \ngrandchildren now goes up in flames because when they die, if their \nfarm is valued at more than $1 million, they are imposed with a 55-\npercent tax on the value of everything over $1 million.\n  People say they are millionaires. No, they are not. They are sitting \non property that might be valued at that, but they might be losing \nmoney. For sure, this year, they are not going to make any money \nbecause they have had to plow their corn under because it hasn't gotten \nthe rain and moisture it needs and it will not grow. We don't yet know \nthe extent of this disaster, but to preserve that within the families \nand hope for better years to come, that will not happen because, as the \nSenator from South Dakota said, they are going to have to value their \nland--the IRS will value their land at a price that the only way they \ncan pay for that is to sell their assets.\n  Why in the world would they do that at a time of economic turmoil and \ncause a drift back essentially into recession? This country is not in \ngood economic shape. Compared to Europe, we are in better shape, but if \nyou look at the numbers, they are not trending the right way. Why at a \ntime like this would you walk onto the floor of the United States \nSenate and put up a bill that will raise taxes on people who are \nalready suffering from 35 percent to 55 percent? How high does it have \nto go? How many taxes have to be imposed on\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\nthe American people before they say that is enough? They are saying: \nClean up your spending process in Washington so we don't have to pay so \nmuch in taxes to cover all you are doing there.\n  My colleagues would like to continue to respond. I want to turn to my \ncolleague\n  Mr. WICKER. If I may, I will make one point. I know my friend from \nKansas also wants to join in.\n  This could only hurt job creation among small businesspeople and \nsmall farmers. I can't imagine why they want to do this. We have had 42 \nmonths of unemployment at over 8 percent, the longest period in \npeacetime and modern history. To put this tax on farms that create jobs \nand small businesses that create jobs, which is where most of our new \njobs come from, is just unthinkable. I cannot imagine that it would do \nanything, if it were signed into law as the President wants to do, \nother than make that 8.2 percent unemployment rate go even higher.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I now turn to my colleague from Kansas, and \nI tell him about one of the families very close to us--my wife grew up \nwith her lifetime friend, who married a farm boy from Kansas. They ran \na farm near Norton, KS. We speak with them regularly. Even though we \nare city people, we have learned from them the sacrifice that goes into \nmaintaining a farm, the suffering that occurs from the whims of the \nweather, the prices of the crops. We see them struggle and struggle, \nand this obviously will not be a good year. But this is a farm that has \nbeen passed down to the third generation now. They own a lot of land.\n\n  As the Senator knows, Kansas has a lot of land. And they didn't get \nthe rainfall we did. I know this is a situation that ends the dream \nthat has been passed down from generation to generation because on the \ndeath of the current owners of the farm, the tax on that would force \nthem to sell their land.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nyielding. Yesterday, in Norton, KS, the temperature was 118. I read the \nstory where they just watched the thermometer go up degree by degree, \nand it has now been more than a month in which the temperatures in our \nState have exceeded 100 degrees. Certainly, it has been more than a \nmonth in which we have had little or no rainfall in most places across \nthe State.\n  The drought is real, and it puts people in a different mood. There is \nalways optimism on a farm, optimism on a ranch. My small business men \nand women in Kansas are optimistic that when they get up and go to work \nevery day, it will be a better day at the end of the day, and tomorrow \nwill be better than today, and next month will be better than this \nmonth. I can tell you, with the weather pattern we have had in the \nMidwest this summer the optimism begins to disappear.\n  Today we have come to learn just one more thing that is now going to \nbe oppressive to farmers and ranchers and small business men and women \nin Kansas and across the country. We started this year with a \ndiscussion about something the Department of Labor did--the proposed \nrules to prohibit restricting a young person from working on a family \nfarm. We have had a series of regulations from the EPA and others that \nmake it so difficult for a small businessperson or a farmer to succeed. \nNow we learn today the proposal that we are going to revert back to \ndays gone by in which a $1 million estate will be subject to a marginal \ntax rate of 55 percent.\n  It has been a series of things in the last year from this \nadministration and this Congress that send a message to farmers and \nranchers in Kansas and small business men and women in our State and \nacross the country that their value, their work ethic, their efforts \nwill not be rewarded. Not only will they not be rewarded, but we will \ndiscourage them. We will not reward the work they do each day, the work \nthey are optimistic about.\n  The Senator from Indiana is so correct in this sense. Every farmer \nand rancher I know, at the end of the day their goal is to see that \nthey have done work that day not only to feed, clothe, and provide \nenergy to the world, but to see that they have a farming operation, a \nranching operation that is of the nature that it can be passed on to \nthe next generation of Kansas farmers and ranchers. It is the sense of \nsatisfaction that comes in a farmer's life when the son and daughter \nwho follow them have that ability.\n  Nothing is easy in agriculture, and there is not a thing any day that \nis easy on a farm or ranch across the country. With our weather \npatterns and soil conditions, it takes a lot of drive, effort, stamina, \nand discipline to survive. Much of the day is spent trying to survive. \nHere we see a series of things as we arrive today and discover that we \nwant to increase the tax on those people who work hard every day and \nwhose goal it is to tell their sons and daughters: I have a farm or \nranch that can be yours someday, and you can take over where I left \noff.\n  Why is that important? That is traditionally and historically how \nfarming has occurred. It is passed down from great-grandparents to \ngrandparents to parents to children to grandchildren, and there is \npride and satisfaction that comes from that.\n  We are here today to make certain the Federal Government doesn't \ncreate one more obstacle toward that goal of making certain the next \ngeneration of Kansans has the opportunity to work to earn a living and \nfeed the world on their own family farm or ranch. It is so surprising \nto me that there would be anyone who believes these individuals, these \nbusiness operations, farms or small businesses, ought to be singled out \nand treated in a way that discourages them from accomplishing that \nAmerican dream of passing that farm and ranch on to their kids and \ngrandkids. I hope our colleagues see the light and understand how \nimportant this is in rural America. And not only is it important in \nrural America, but what happens in our part of the country determines \nwhether we have the ability to provide food and fiber for the country \nand the globe.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, whether it is the family my wife grew up \nwith and knew or the one in Posey County, IN, who brought their \nneighbors together for a meeting a few months ago or whether it is a \nfamily or business owner or small businesses across the State of \nIndiana that I have talked to repeatedly, they basically say: I resent \nbeing called rich by the President, who said they need to pay more in \ntaxes. We have been working our tails off for generations, and we have \nbeen paying our taxes faithfully for the profits we made--the years we \nhave made profits. Yet we are being classified as some type of an elite \ngroup that is not paying their fair share. We can look back and we read \nstatistics, such as 47 percent of Americans aren't paying any income \ntaxes, while we are out there creating jobs, building a business--with \nsometimes good years, sometimes bad years--over a lifetime. There is \nvalue added to that business, but that value is in machines, it is in \nbuildings and land, in terms of farmers. Yet that gets evaluated when \nwe die at a level which means we can't pass it on. We can't afford to \npass it on to other generations and we have to sell it. The Federal \nGovernment, having taxed us all our life on the profits we have made--\nthe income taxes, the Social Security contributions, the Medicare \ncontributions, the sales taxes, the personal property taxes, the car \ntaxes, the boat taxes, if one has a boat, the excise taxes, the liquor \ntaxes, the beer tax, the sales tax and on and on and on it goes--it is \nnot just the income tax we are being taxed on. There is not a tax that \ngovernment doesn't like or want to impose on the American people.\n\n  Why would anyone, of either party, at a time of economic distress--\nwhen the United States is the only country struggling to stay ahead and \nperhaps lead the world back into economic growth, at a time when we are \nseeing signs of a potential double-dip recession facing us, and the \nnews in the last few days has been dramatically bad--want to bring a \nbill to the floor of the Senate that says you are not paying enough if \nyou own a small business or if you own a farm. You are not paying \nenough, so we think 55 percent is a fair rate--55 percent if you die, \nafter you have paid taxes all your life to a Federal Government which \nis bloated and duplicative.\n  The bureaucracy here is out of control. Congress hasn't lived up to \nits responsibility to take any kind of sensible fiscal measures that \nwill get us back on track in terms of battling our\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nbudget and not spending more than we take in. Throughout all the \nefforts that have taken place throughout 2011, and some in 2012, we \nstill have not come up with a program, with a budget arrangement which \nwill put us on the path to fiscal health. Yet what is the response from \nthe other side? The response is: Let's impose another tax. So at 4 \no'clock today, Members are going to come down and vote in terms of \nwhether they want to impose a 55-percent death tax on people who are \nalready being taxed to death.\n  I will yield the floor, but then I am sure my colleagues will want to \nask for their own recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think we have about one-half hour left; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nenter into a colloquy with my colleagues for the remainder of that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I first want to thank the Senator from \nIndiana for his very astute observations about the impact of these \ntaxes on hard-working men and women in this country. I would say to my \ncolleague from North Dakota, who is now here, and the Senator from \nKansas--both of whom represent very rural States--this is not an issue \nthat is inconsequential. A lot of people think people who have $1 \nmillion in assets are rich. But as I said earlier, in most farm and \nranch operations, 80 percent of the value of that is in real estate. So \nthey may be land rich but cash poor.\n  When we talk about imposing a tax of this size on hard-working \nfarmers and ranchers in this country, we are getting at the very heart, \nas the Senator from Kansas pointed out, of their ability to transfer \nthat farm or ranch operation to the next generation. That is what is at \nstake.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is here, and the farmland in North \nDakota is similar to what we have in South Dakota, except they have \nenergy. They found oil in a few places in North Dakota, which drives \nthose land values up even higher. We would like to see some of that in \nSouth Dakota, but in either of the Dakotas or in Kansas we have seen \nland values going up in the past few years and it takes a bigger \noperation to make it work to survive in modern agriculture. So the size \nof these operations, in many cases, exceeds by multiples the million-\ndollar exemption that would be allowed by the Democratic proposal, and \neverything above that, as was said, would be taxed at 55 percent, which \nwould be absolutely disastrous for American agriculture today, and that \nis on top of the other taxes.\n  This proposal also raises taxes on about 1 million small businesses \nthat employ about 25 percent of the American workforce. It raises taxes \non capital gains and dividends and then it puts this death tax back \ninto place with the million-dollar exemption. As I said earlier, if we \nlook at the number of people who would be subject to and covered by the \ndeath tax today, this proposal would increase those people subject to \nwhom the death tax would apply by 24 times--a 2,400-percent increase in \nthe number of people who would be subject to the death tax, according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation. That is the group that studies \nthese issues and that looks at the impact of tax policy. According to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, 24 times more farmers and ranchers \nwould be subject to the death tax than are subject to it today and 13 \ntimes more small businesses. That is the scale of the proposal the \nDemocrats have put forward.\n  I would say to my colleague from North Dakota, my neighbor, that I \nassume, as he talks to farmers and ranchers in his State, he gets the \nsame sort of feedback I do in visiting with people in South Dakota; \nthat is, they are very concerned about what would be a huge tax \nincrease, so to speak, when someone passes on and tries to pass that \noperation on to the next generation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is exactly right. I am pleased to be here with my \nesteemed colleague from South Dakota as well as my esteemed colleague \nfrom Kansas. I wish to commend Senator Coats from Indiana for the \nstrong and important points he made here as part of this discussion on \nthe Senate floor. This vote we will have on the Tax Code and its impact \non farming and small businesses across this country is certainly \nimportant.\n  But Senator Coats also made a very important point a few minutes ago; \nthat is, we already have farmers and ranchers--our producers--in a \nsituation where they face difficult times because of the drought. So I \njoin him in calling on our House colleagues to act on the farm bill. I \nthink it is very important we pass a farm bill, as we have in the \nSenate.\n  I had an opportunity to work on that farm bill with Senator Thune of \nSouth Dakota and others. We passed a good package in the Senate. The \nHouse Ag Committee has passed a good farm package as well. We need that \nto pass the House, get it into conference, and get a farm bill done for \nour producers. I think that is incredibly important always because good \nfarm policy benefits every American. We have the highest quality, \nlowest cost food supply in the world thanks to our farmers and \nranchers. Particularly now, with our farmers throughout the country \nlooking at this drought, it is very important they know we have a sound \nfarm program in place for now and for the future.\n  As regards this vote in the Senate today, whether it is the good \nSenator from Indiana, from Kansas, from South Dakota or others, this is \nincredibly important. We are looking at a bill that is essentially a \nplan put forward by President Obama that will raise income taxes, that \nwill raise taxes on capital gains, and that will raise the estate tax.\n\n  I was on the floor this morning, as others have been, talking about \nthe impact that those tax increases will have on small business when we \nhave 8.2 percent unemployment. We have had 8 percent unemployment for \nmore than 40 straight months. To a large degree, people are focused on \nthe increase in the income tax and its impact on small business, but \nthe impact from the estate tax--from the death tax--is a big deal, and \npeople need to understand what the ramifications are if that estate tax \nis increased.\n  We understand it very well in our States because of the case we are \nmaking right here. Look at how this affects our farmers and ranchers. \nWe are talking about going from a situation where when a farmer or \nrancher, looking to pass on that farm or ranch right now, is taxed, \nfrom an estate tax standpoint, on the amount above $5 million and then \nit is set at a 35-percent rate. But the plan being put forward today--\nand being put forward essentially by the President and by the other \nside of the aisle--would change that to go back to anything over $1 \nmillion would be subject to the estate tax and then would be taxed at a \n55-percent rate. So just do the math; right?\n  That is the point the good Senators from South Dakota and Kansas and \nothers have been making. It doesn't work. It just doesn't work. In \nother words, that family can't borrow enough money to pay off the \nestate tax and keep the farm because they can't afford to pay back that \nlevel of debt. The farming operation will not sustain it. The ranching \noperation will not sustain it. You can't borrow that much money to try \nto keep the farm in the family because you can't afford to pay the \ndebt. As a business enterprise, it can't service the debt. So what \nhappens? The only alternative is to sell the farm.\n  So we have farmers who have been farming for generations--their \nfather, their grandfather, grandmother, mother, relatives all the way \nback--and now their kids are farming with them. Their children are \ninvolved in that farming enterprise, and they want to continue farming, \nbut that is not going to happen because they are not going to be able \nto afford the estate tax. So this is exactly what we are talking about \nwhen we talk about how raising taxes will have a detrimental impact on \nour economy.\n  We have talked about this in terms of small business and we have \ntalked about it in terms of the income tax and the ramifications on \ncapital gains tax, but I think this demonstrates how clearly it truly \nhas an impact across this country on all small businesses because I \nthink all of us, from our States and from many other States, know\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nthese farm families. We know this is not just a job or a vocation, it \nis a way of life, and it is a way of life these families have been \ncounting on.\n  I wish to make one further point before I turn the floor over to my \nesteemed colleague; that is, these farm families or any other small \nbusiness, when we look at the estate tax, we have to keep in mind they \nare passing assets, but throughout their entire life they have been \npaying taxes. They have been paying income tax, sales tax, property \ntax. They have been paying taxes all the way along. So it is not as if \nthey are just handing this stuff on to the next generation without \npaying taxes because they are not paying a death tax. They have been \npaying taxes on it all their lives and not just one or two taxes but \nmultiple taxes. So this property has been taxed their entire life. They \nhave worked their entire lives to pay those taxes and would now face a \ndeath tax that would force them to sell their business. That is not \nright.\n  You know what. It is not right if it is a farm or a ranch or, \nfrankly, any other kind of small business in this country because this \ncountry is about small business. That is the backbone of our economy. \nIt is the economy of this country, and that is exactly what we are \ndealing with.\n  That is why we put forward an option--and we encourage our colleagues \nto support this option--that will continue the current tax rates, that \nwill not raise tax rates, and then we will work on extending those \ncurrent tax rates for 1 year while we engage in progrowth tax reform. \nWe close loopholes and we get more revenue from economic growth, from a \ngrowing, more vibrant economy that puts people back to work rather than \nraising taxes.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my esteemed colleague from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the remarks of my colleague from North Dakota \nwho understands this issue very well, representing a State that is \ncomposed largely of family farms and ranches and small businesses. It \nis similar to my State of South Dakota, similar to Senator Moran's \nState of Kansas. We share not only a lot of commonalities in terms of \nhow we make our living but also in the kind of hard-working people who \nare the backbone, as my colleague said, of our country.\n  There is a work ethic among people involved in working the land, \npeople who are involved in agriculture, that we hope gets rewarded. One \nof the ways that gets rewarded is when someone works very hard all \ntheir life--and that is very true in agriculture. There are very few \njobs in agriculture that are easy. It is a hard way to make a living. \nThe men and women who are involved in production agriculture have, in \nmy view, among the best work ethic in the country, and we want to see \nthat hard work rewarded. One of the ways we hope that gets rewarded is \nwhen it comes time to pass that operation on, to allow that operation \nto be handed off to the next generation so they, too, can benefit from \nthat hard work and build that enterprise and grow the family farm in a \nway that is good for our economy generally and certainly good for the \neconomy in places such as North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas.\n  That is why a proposal such as this is so devastating, because you \nare subjecting 24 times more farms and ranches in this country to the \ndeath tax than are currently exposed to it under current law.\n  This is a dramatic increase in the number of folks who would be \nimpacted by the death tax--obviously a significant increase in the \namount people are going to be forced to pay when the time comes. I \nthink at a time when we are facing unemployment now for 41 consecutive \nmonths over 8 percent, some 23 million Americans either unemployed or \nunderemployed, and some Americans have been unemployed for a longer \nperiod of time, one thing we don't need in the middle of this kind of \neconomy is a big fat tax increase.\n  That is what the Democratic proposal does--not just on the estate tax \nbut also the marginal income tax rates going up on small businesses on \nJanuary 1. There will be almost 1 million businesses impacted by higher \nrates, which employ 25 percent of the workforce in this country, as \nwell as increasing taxes on investment, on capital gains, and \ndividends.\n  A big fat tax increase in the middle of a very fragile economy is the \nwrong prescription. I would hope, as the Senator from North Dakota \nsuggested, that our colleagues on both sides will support the \nalternative we will put forward which will extend the rates for all \nAmericans, so not any American is faced with higher taxes come January \n1 of this year. I think it would be devastating for our economy to do \nthat. Certainly it would be devastating to the family farms and ranches \nin places such as the Midwest.\n  I know my colleague from Kansas understands very well, because he \nrepresents the same kind of people we do in the Dakotas. They are hard \nworking. All they want to know is that they have an opportunity to be \nable to benefit from that hard work and hopefully pass it on to the \nnext generation when the time comes.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senator from North Dakota \njoined us, because I think he made a very valid point, something I \nshould have explained better. It is not just the fear of having to pay \nmore taxes, but it is the reality you don't have the income to pay the \ntax, therefore requiring the sale of the assets--the sale of the farm \nmachinery and equipment, the sale of the land, the sale of the cattle.\n  While no one wants to pay more taxes, in this case it is even more \nonerous in that you have value to assets. You have some wealth in the \nland and the equipment and the cattle, but never the sufficient income \nto pay the tax. Therefore, the sale of those assets is required to pay \nthe tax man; and, therefore, you don't have those assets I was talking \nabout earlier to pass on to your children and grandchildren.\n  This is not just about: I already pay enough taxes; I don't want to \npay any more; I can't afford any more. This is the reality: I don't \nhave the ability at all to come up with the income, unless, as the \nSenator from North Dakota says, I go to the bank and borrow the money. \nBut then I don't have the cashflow to repay the loan, and therefore I \nsell the property.\n  This comes at a time when many Kansans--farmers and others--would \ncomplain about how business and agriculture keep getting bigger and \nbigger. The reality is we would love to have those farming operations, \nthat family-sized farming scale that is so important to the cultural \nand economic vitality of communities across Kansas and across America. \nBut because we have laws such as the estate tax, we sell those assets \nto bigger entities that can better afford it, and we reduce the number \nof family farms that most of us believe are so important to who we are \nas Americans, and certainly so important to the economy and the \ncultural nature of rural America.\n  I have heard the discussion here on the floor today about the farm \nbill. I know my colleagues, the Senator from South Dakota and the \nSenator from North Dakota, have encouraged passage of a farm bill by \nthe entire Congress. But this farm bill, let me remind you, is a \nreduction in farm bill spending only on the side of production \nagriculture, of family farms across Kansas--a reduction in the amount \nof money available under the farm bill of $23 billion.\n  Farmers in Kansas tell me they are willing to take their so-called \nhit to help reduce the country's fiscal condition. We are willing to \ntake the $23 billion out of farm programs, but don't do other things to \nus that eliminate or reduce our ability to earn a living.\n  So here comes Congress, a few weeks after we pass a farm bill \nreducing the amount of money available for farm programs by $23 \nbillion, saying, Oh, let's do something else damaging to agriculture, \nto farmers and ranchers. Let's impose an estate tax in which the \nthreshold is $1 million and the marginal rate is 55 percent.\n  So it goes back, contrary to what farmers say, which is: We will take \nour hit; we will contribute to getting this country's fiscal house back \nin order, but let us have the opportunity under a free enterprise \nsystem to succeed. And now we have one more handicap, one more hurdle \nto accomplishing that.\n  I was on the Senate floor yesterday talking about this issue and \nparticularly talking about a tax system. We need dramatic reform in our \nTax Code. The idea that we would be extending the current tax law for \nthe foreseeable future, this Congress, this President\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\nought to be serious about scrapping the Tax Code and starting over with \nsomething much different. I spoke yesterday in favor of the fair tax. \nBut regardless of what the conclusion is, we ought to have a simpler, \nfairer, more understandable Tax Code. We ought to have the circumstance \nin which most taxpayers don't have to seek professional advice to \nfigure out what it is they owe or to spend their whole time as a farmer \nor rancher or a business person trying to figure out, What do I do \ntoday that will have a positive or negative consequence upon the tax \nbill at the end of the year?\n  We Americans spend a huge amount of time and a significant amount of \nmoney in which we pay professionals to advise us how to avoid paying \ntaxes. We desperately need a whole new Tax Code that is fairer, \nsimpler, much more straightforward and understandable, so that we spend \nour time growing the economy, as compared to spending our time trying \nto figure out how to manipulate the Tax Code and, in the process, lose \nour individual liberties and freedoms because we are all about trying \nto make certain that we comply with the Tax Code as compared to \ndetermining what is in the best interest of us as citizens, us as \nindividuals, as family members, and us as business owners.\n  So while it is important that we point out the onerous nature of the \nestate tax and what is about to happen here in a vote in about an hour, \nwe ought to remind ourselves that there is a much more important goal \nthan this Congress and this President have been willing to address, and \nthat is, scrap this Code and get something that makes sense to the \nAmerican people that is understandable, affordable, and that pays the \nnecessary amounts to fund those programs required for us to be a \nsuccessful country.\n  I yield for the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I too look forward to \nworking with him on fundamental tax reform, because that is what we \nneed to do to get the economy turning around. I think you will see \ntremendous economic growth. I think you would see our economy unleashed \nif we would reform our Tax Code in a way that broadens the tax base and \nlowers the rates. The Senator from Kansas talked about the fair tax--\ncertainly another proposal out there that many people support. But in \nany event, we do need a fundamental tax reform. And it would be nice \nif, when we do that, we do away with the death tax completely.\n  With that being said, what is being proposed here today, as we have \nall pointed out, is something that in many cases in places such as \nKansas and South Dakota--and our colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Barrasso, is now here, who represents a rural State, a State \nwhere you have a lot of folks with big expanses of land. There are many \npeople in agriculture who are land rich and cash poor.\n  The Senator from Kansas pointed out that when you have an operation \nthat exceeds that $1 million threshold that is being proposed in the \nDemocratic tax plan and then everything above that in terms of the \nvalue of your assets is taxed at that top marginal rate of 55 percent, \nthen you are in many cases having to sell pieces of your operation in \norder to pay the IRS--or, worse yet, going to the bank to borrow money, \nin which case you may not be able to repay it.\n  But this creates all kinds of problems for people who are involved in \nthe day-to-day production of agriculture when it comes to keeping that \noperation in the family.\n  I appreciate the observations of the Senator from Kansas and his \ninsights based upon his experience and the people he represents. I too \nlook forward to the day when we are debating fundamental tax reform. \nBut until that comes, we shouldn't be raising taxes. We shouldn't be \nraising taxes in this type of an economy where we have as many people \nunemployed as we do, we have sluggish economic growth. And we certainly \nshouldn't be punishing family farmers and ranchers and small business \npeople with what is a punitive death tax proposal coming out of the \nDemocrats in the plan we are about to vote on at 4:00.\n  I yield to my colleague from Wyoming who is here, again, representing \na State much like mine and much like the Senator from Kansas, who has a \nlot of people who would be impacted by this Draconian tax.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, to follow up on that, clearly in the \ngreat State of Wyoming there are lots of farmers and lots of ranchers. \nIt is our heritage, it is our economy, it is our future.\n  Many people--we talked a little bit about that--to keep these \noperations going actually have a job in town so they can make enough \nmoney to help pay the mortgage and keep things going. But the price of \nland continues to go up, and on paper they have quite a bit of \nresources. So to think that we are in the next hour going to vote on a \nproposal by the Democrats to bring back the death tax is something that \nshould be a surprise to all Americans. It is to farmers and ranchers \nand all small business owners.\n  I think of the movie theater owner in Casper I have known for over 20 \nyears. I have operated on him, fixed his ankle when he broke it. He \nstarted with one small theater. He was the guy taking tickets, making \nthe popcorn. Other people near him helped out and made it all work. He \nexpanded to a second movie theater, and then again and again. He built \nthe buildings, he built the business. He made it work. He was there \nearly. He was there late. He was there with a broom.\n  But when I hear the President say, If you have a business, you didn't \nbuild it; someone else did, I ask the President to come to Casper, WY, \nto meet the business owners there, meet the guy who has a dry cleaners, \nmeet the florist, meet the person with the car wash, meet this owner of \nthe movie theaters, and then go around the community and the outskirts \nof the area to take a look at rural Wyoming, at the ranchers and \nfarmers, and hear their stories, hear of their life's work, hear about \nwhat they have put together.\n  To see a proposal on the floor of the Senate that says, We don't care \nwhat you did, how hard you worked, what the impact is going to be on \nleaving this legacy to your family, we are going to bring back the \ndeath tax and we are coming for you. It is something that people back \nhome, in all of rural America--and I would think in many places around \nthe country--would find shocking, astonishing, and very sad as a \ncommentary of what role Washington and government is trying to impose \nupon their lives, to take these levels of taxation to much higher \nlevels where the death tax hits at $1 million and 55 percent at that \nlevel, from where we are now, where it is at $5 million and indexed for \ninflation because we see inflation and a maximum of 35 percent. I am \nastonished that people would actually consider voting for that. But yet \nthat is what the Senate majority leader has been proposing, and that is \nwhat we are going to vote on within the next hour.\n  It is interesting, I was driving through the Hot Springs County, \nThermopolis, WY, area a couple of years ago talking to a farmer. He \nsaid, You know, I could fight the weather or I could fight the \ngovernment, but I couldn't fight both. And he got out of it.\n  A lot of families haven't gotten out, and they continue. Now, once \nagain, the heavy hand of government comes with this crushing blow in \nwanting to raise this sort of tax on families all across the country, \non people who have built their own businesses. In spite of what the \nPresident may say, these are the people who made this happen.\n  After the President's comments last week, I was in Thermopolis for a \nclass reunion over the weekend. They have all the different classes \ncome together for a big picnic and cookout in the park. My mother-in-\nlaw is a member of a class that graduated quite a few years ago. It was \nher reunion as well. We were talking about the family bakery that she \nhad worked at as a little girl. The family actually lived above the \nbakery. They got their food from the bakery because they ate what \ndidn't get sold. They worked every day. She talked about her father \nworking so very early in the morning, through the day. For lunch she \nwalked home from school to be able to eat at the bakery. That is a \nfamily who built that business.\n  We talked about it, and I asked, Well, who else worked there? She \nstarted to run through the names of the people in the family who built \nand contributed to this bakery business called the Wigwam in \nThermopolis, WY. She talked\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nabout Sonny who had worked there. There are a lot of businesses and a \nlot of farms and a lot of ranches--I see my friend and colleague from \nKansas here--where there was a Sonny who worked on that farm or on that \nranch.\n  Who else worked there in the bakery? Well, Shorty worked there too. I \nthink every community has a Shorty who worked in a business that made \nsomething happen.\n  I said: Who else? She said: Sandy. I know there is a Sandy in every \ncommunity. Yet the President thinks they didn't do anything.\n  Who else? Smokey. We have all these different names of people in the \nfamily who made this business, helped to put it together, and built it. \nThose are the people who made this business. Those are the people the \nPresident seems to have forgotten or never met in the first place. \nThose are the people who built the businesses of this country. It \nwasn't somebody else; it was them. It was parents who got up early and \nworked hard. Their kids worked there too. Everyone in the family \nparticipated. Everyone contributed. Every community in this country has \nsomeone like that.\n  Now to see the Democrats coming forth with a proposal that says: You \nmay have built a business--well, they may not believe that family \nactually built the business--and we just want to tax you more when the \nperson who really put the sweat equity into it dies. The family maybe \nends up having to sell, as we heard from the Senators from Kansas, \nNorth Dakota, and South Dakota. Why? A lot of it is because this \ninstitution can't control the spending, so they are always looking for \nnew ways to tax other people.\n  The problem is not that we are taxed too little; it is that we spend \ntoo much in this institution. Congress spends too much, and the \nPresident always seems to find another way to spend more money. That is \nwhat we see, ways to continue to find money and then spend, borrow, and \ngrow government bigger and bigger. That is not what built this country. \nThat is not what made this country great. It was the families with \nranches, farms, and small businesses all across this country who put in \nhard work, dedication, and commitment to getting up early in the \nmorning, working all day long and well into the evening.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from Kansas, I am sure the Senator can \nthink of families and picture those families where folks actually got \nup before sunrise and worked through the end of the day and after the \nSun went down to building something, to make something of themselves \nand their family, and to contribute to the community. Now we see \ngovernment with its heavy hand coming to say: The death tax is here. We \nwant to raise the death tax, and we are coming for you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor his comments. Those of us who had the privilege of growing up in \nsmall town America know those names the Senator from Wyoming indicated. \nIt is one of the advantages of that small town life.\n  Every day we see those families who own a business or have a farm or \nranch. We know who they are. We know who works there, we know what jobs \nare created by that business or that farm, and we have the \nunderstanding of how important that is in the community if there is \ngoing to be jobs in our town. It is that small businessperson who gets \nup early, works late, does whatever is necessary to make sure they are \na success in that business. Sometimes they are successful and sometimes \nthey are not. Every day they fight the fight to make certain they put \nfood on their family's table, they have the ability to save for their \nchildren's education, for that better life, and save for their own \nretirement.\n  Again, just like we talked about the farmers and ranchers who are \nwilling to forgo things from Washington, DC, to help contribute to \ngetting our debt under control, get our fiscal house back in order, \nmake America what we know it can be--they are willing to forgo those \nthings that Washington seems to want to give us. All they ask is, \nPlease don't put more burdens on us. Don't make it more difficult for \nus to succeed.\n  We see the example today where the Democrats' tax proposal creates a \nhuge burden on a huge sector of this economy and on people who are so \nimportant to us as to whether we are going to have jobs created and the \nopportunity for every American to pursue the American dream.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 2 minutes followed by Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is important to simplify what \nis going on with these two proposals, the Republican proposal and the \nDemocratic proposal. So I am going to attempt to do that. We have two \npackages of tax cuts. The Democratic package gives everyone a tax break \non their income tax for the first $250,000 of income. So everybody gets \nthat tax break. The main difference is that under the Republican plan, \nthey give more to incomes above $250,000, where we say everybody gets a \ntax break up to $250,000, and after that we go back to the tax rates of \nBill Clinton when we created 23 million jobs, balanced the budget, and \ncreated a surplus.\n  Now, in order to do this, the Republicans don't do some of the things \nwe do for the middle class, which is an extension of the tuition tax \ncredit and a generous child tax credit. So that is the difference. \nTheir package costs $50 billion more. If we figure we do this over 10 \nyears, we can do the math. That comes to $500 billion. But let's just \ntake it to 1 year. The $50 billion cost of their package, if we didn't \ngo that way and supported the Democratic package, we could use that to \neither reduce the deficit or to soften the sequester.\n  We have people running all over television saying we are ruining the \ncountry with this sequestration. The Republicans came up and supported \nthat idea of automatic spending cuts. We can take the $50 billion if \nthe upper income would pay their fair share and cut the automatic \nspending cuts in half.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank, first of all, my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer. I happened to be on the Senate floor and \nlistened to my Republican colleagues as they were talking about the \nestate tax. I think we have to clarify what this legislation is all \nabout that we will be voting on in a few minutes. It is an effort to \nfully protect about 98 percent of Americans from the uncertainty as to \nwhether their income tax will go up on January 1. That is what this \nbill is about. There are a lot of other problems we have, including the \nfiscal cliff we have been talking about.\n  I understand the concerns we have with the estate tax. We have a \nproblem with the physician reimbursement under Medicare. We have \nproblems with the sequestration orders and the impact it would have on \nall of our agencies whether it is national security or the domestic \nbudget. We have concerns about extending tax provisions for the energy \nsector of our economy. We have the uncertainty of whether we will \nextend the unemployment insurance additional benefits. All of those are \nlegitimate concerns.\n  I hope the Republicans and Democrats will come together to deal with \nthe deficit. That is what we should do. I can tell everyone I have been \none of those Senators meeting with Republicans, meeting with my \nDemocratic colleagues, and that is what we want to do. We want to give \npredictability to the American people about a credible plan to deal \nwith our deficit.\n  I was proud to be one of the Democrats on the Budget Committee in the \nSenate. The Presiding Officer helped to say let's use the Simpson-\nBowles model to try to get a bipartisan agreement on a budget document \nmuch earlier this year so we could come forward with a credible plan to \ndeal with the deficit. We are now just a few weeks away when Congress \nis likely to go out of session for the November elections. We have \nheard in the House they are talking about leaving the third week of\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nSeptember. So what we are trying to do--and this is a pretty simple \nbill--is to say for the overwhelming majority, 98 percent, let's at \nleast give the certainty to the people of our country so they know on \nJanuary 1 their tax rates will not go up. Why do we want to do that? \nBecause predictability gives confidence. Confidence allows people and \nconsumers to buy and helps to grow our economy. That is why we do it.\n  Sure, it is frustrating we can't deal with everything right now. We \nwant to deal with everything, but we are not going to be able to come \nto that political agreement. Can't we at least come to the agreement to \nprotect the vast majority of the taxpayers of this country?\n  The bill we will be voting on very shortly says we would not let the \npersonal income tax rates go up for those whose incomes are up to \n$250,000. As Senator Boxer pointed out, every income-tax payer gets the \nadvantage of it. If you make $1 million, you get the lower tax rates on \nthe first $250,000. That way everyone gets the advantage.\n  We also protect the refundable child tax credit because we know \nAmerican families depend upon that refundable tax credit. I want to \nthank the majority leader for putting this into the bill. That is part \nof a family's planning process to know whether they can buy consumer \ngoods. We included that in the legislation that we will have a chance \nto vote on. We included the American opportunity tax credit. The \nPresiding Officer is very involved in that. That is to help families \nafford college education.\n  I was at a university meeting over the weekend and looked at the debt \nthat our college graduates are inheriting as they go through college. \nWell, we extend in this bill the help we give to working families to be \nable to afford a college education for their children, which helps to \nbuild this great Nation. It helps to make us more competitive. We have \nalso included in the legislation the small business expenses because we \nwant to give predictability to small businesses to go out and buy \ncapital assets so they can turn around and help our economy grow.\n  So I just wanted to point out some pretty simple choices. Do we \nbelieve we should give the predictability that I think everybody agrees \non? Why can't we keep the bill simple and get it done? My Republican \ncolleagues want to find some way to be able to vote no to help the \noverwhelming majority of the people in this country.\n  I will say this again. If you make $1 million, you are going to get \n$6,000 of relief under this bill. Isn't that enough? Then let's come \ntogether and hopefully use the remainder of this year or early next \nyear to get a credible plan and get our deficit under control. Let's \ngive confidence to the American people so we will not face that fiscal \ncliff, and we will get our job done. The purpose of this is to create \njobs. We need to create more jobs in our country.\n\n  I wish to share with my colleagues this photograph that was taken. I \nwill ask my colleagues where they think this photograph took place, \nwith many people sewing and manufacturing clothing. We can see the U.S. \nflag there. The next question is, When do my colleagues think this \nphotograph was taken? The 1920s? The 1930s? I remember growing up in \nBaltimore and seeing all of the different clothing manufacturers \nlocated in my city. So perhaps this is a historic photograph. It is \nnot. It was just recently taken in Westminster, MD. It is the English \nAmerican Tailoring Company, with 380 jobs, producing the finest suits \nin the world.\n  I show this photograph to demonstrate that we can succeed in \nmanufacturing in America. In the last 28 months, we have seen an \nincrease of 500,000 jobs in manufacturing in America. That is the \nlargest growth since 1995 in our country. We have to fight for the jobs \nand keep our jobs here in America.\n  I had a chance to talk with English American Tailoring Company union \nemployees. They are happy not because they are happy to have a job--\neveryone is happy to have a job--they know they have a good job in a \ncompany that cares about them, and they take pride in what they are \nmaking. Make it in America. In Maryland, in the United States, we have \na company that makes the best custom suits in the world because they \nare American made and because they have the best technology and the \nbest quality of any company in the world.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something else that might surprise them. \nThey had a 15-percent increase in sales this year. They added an \nadditional 50 employees this year. They are now making plans to break \nground on a training facility in Westminster, MD. They have confidence \nin their ability to produce the right product for America and to create \nthe jobs and keep the jobs here.\n  We have done this over and over in America. I know my colleagues have \ntaken the floor to talk about the auto manufacturing industry, with the \nbest sales in 5 years. Chrysler's sales have increased 34 percent; \nGeneral Motors is up 12 percent; Ford is up 5 percent; 10,000 new jobs \nat Ford Motor Company; 4,000 coming from Mexico back to the United \nStates. Make it in America. Our U.S. auto manufacturers are making it \nin America. We can create more jobs if we just create the right \nclimate.\n  We need to help small business. I agree that is where most of the job \ngrowth will take place. That is where most of the new innovation comes \nfrom. So why don't we take up sensible legislation that the majority \nleader talked about that would reward small companies that are creating \nmore jobs by giving tax credits? I am also proud of a provision in that \nbill to increase surety bonds for small companies so they can compete. \nThat is what we should be doing.\n  We need trade policies. I want to give another bit of good news. I \nsee Senator Nelson is on the floor, and he was instrumental in the \ncitrus trust fund. But we have the wool trust fund and the cotton trust \nfund also approved by the Senate Finance Committee. Why is that \nimportant for this contract we have here? This company, English \nAmerican Tailoring, makes quality suits, but they have to import the \nwool because the wool is not available in America. Here is what \nhappens. The tariff today on that wool coming into America is higher \nthan the finished suit, if it was imported into America, which \nencourages manufacturing outside of America. That makes absolutely no \nsense at all. That is why we have a wool trust fund--to correct this \ninverted tariff so that we can make it competitive to manufacture in \nAmerica. That is why we have it. I am proud that by a unanimous vote, \nwe are recommending that from the Senate Finance Committee. I hope we \ncan find the cooperation on this floor to get that done.\n  I also want to make sure that the citrus industry in Florida is taken \ncare of, so we take care of the citrus trust fund and the cotton trust \nfund. Shirts are manufactured today--my friend from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez, helped on this, and Senator Schumer helped a great deal with \nthe wool trust fund. We make cotton shirts in New Jersey. We can make \nthose shirts because we can manufacture more efficiently than other \ncountries, but we can't have an inverted tariff. We can't afford to \nmake it more expensive to manufacture than import. That is what that is \nabout. These are commonsense policies.\n  We need tax policies that make sense. Senator Stabenow has been \nworking hard on the Bring Jobs Home Act so that we actually reward \ncompanies that bring their jobs back to America and we don't allow \ntaxpayers to foot the bill for those who want to take their jobs \noverseas.\n  The bottom line is that we can make it in America. We can make it in \nAmerica. We are doing that in Maryland, and we are doing it throughout \nthe country. We need sensible policies.\n  We also need the confidence of consumers about the take-home pay they \nare going to have in order to be able to buy the suits manufactured by \nEnglish American Tailoring or other companies in our community or to \nbuy a car manufactured here in America. They want to do that, but they \nneed the confidence.\n  So don't complicate the bill we are going to be voting on in 1 hour. \nDon't make it that difficult. It is a pretty simple bill. It says \nwhether we are going to fully protect 98 percent of Americans from \nseeing their tax rates go up and their paychecks go down on January 1 \nand help every American, regardless of their income, with the first \n$250,000 of taxable income.\n  I hope we will then make a commitment, Democrats and Republicans, to\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nput aside our partisan differences and listen to each other and come up \nwith a credible plan that answers not just the issues--the only issue \nraised by my Republican colleagues, which is the estate tax--but also \nanswers the questions of our physicians for Medicare and answers the \nproblems of our people who depend upon government, the sequestration \norders. Let's get it together and get all of that done, but let's not \nlet the traditional partisan differences stop us from protecting 98 \npercent of Americans, so that companies such as English American \nTailoring can continue to expand and create more jobs here in America \nto help our economy grow because people will be willing to buy the \nsuits, knowing there is some confidence in the Tax Code that allows \nthem to plan for their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the efforts we are going to vote on \nin a few moments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are soon going to be voting on \nother matters, and I see the distinguished senior Senator from Florida, \nwho wishes to speak, so I will not take long. However, there is one \narea I don't want people to forget about; that is, the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Eight months ago Senator Crapo and I joined together to introduce the \nLeahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011. We \ndecided to put victims first, not politics first. So we set aside any \npartisan differences the two of us might have. We did this so we could \ntell the Senate that even though we come from entirely different \npolitical philosophies, we are united on the need to protect victims. \nAt a time when we hear people say this body is deeply divided, an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, \njoined us in that effort, and we passed this commonsense legislation \nwith a remarkable 68 votes. That is a rare feat in the Senate today and \nit sent a clear message--stopping domestic and sexual violence. There \nare some who say we couldn't get 51 votes to say the Sun rises in the \neast. We got 68 votes to protect victims. We sent a clear message that \nstopping domestic violence is a priority and we will stand together to \nprotect all victims from these devastating crimes.\n  Most of us here hoped the House Republicans would follow our \ndemonstration of bipartisanship. We gave them an excellent bill and a \nchance to quickly take it up and pass it. Instead, unfortunately, they \nput politics first. They drafted a new bill, and they are within their \nright to do that, but here is what they did. They intentionally \nstripped out protections for some of the most vulnerable victims, \nincluding immigrants, LGBT victims, and Native women. They took out the \nkey provisions to make campuses and public housing safer. They rejected \nthe input of law enforcement and victims' services professionals who \ntell us these protections are desperately needed to save lives. In \nother words, they said: If you have two victims who are subjected to \nthe same kind of abuse, we might protect this one, but by law we won't \nprotect this one. I can tell my colleagues that there is no one in law \nenforcement in this country, no matter what their political background, \nwho wants to be put in that position. They believe that a victim is a \nvictim is a victim, and they want to protect all of them.\n  In fact, it was so obvious that the acts of some of these House \nRepublicans were too much even for some of their own party. Nearly two \ndozen House Republicans, including the chair of the crime victims \ncaucus, stood up and voted against this restrictive House bill.\n  We can talk about numbers and all of those things, but I wish those \nwho came up with this restrictive House bill could have been with me \nlast Thursday to hear from Laura Dunn, a courageous survivor of campus \nsexual assault who told us of her own horrendous experience. She said: \nI come before you to tell you about this because I want you to include \nthe Senate provisions the House stripped out. She made an impassioned \nplea for that and for Congress to do all it can to protect all students \non campus from the kind of unspeakable violence she encountered--the \nkind of violence that I pray my daughter and my granddaughters will \nnever have to face.\n  More than 200 survivors of campus violence at 176 colleges and \nuniversities came forward publicly and joined her in an open letter to \nCongress calling for the immediate passage of this critical \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2012.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: We, the undersigned survivors \n     of violence committed on college and university campuses \n     nationwide and the families of those who did not survive this \n     violence, call upon every Member of Congress to pass the \n     Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization before the \n     end of September. Furthermore, the final VAWA must contain \n     comprehensive campus provisions including the Campus SaVE Act \n     and the Campus Safety Act.\n       Each of us has been dramatically affected by at least one \n     of the four crimes that have become a silent epidemic on \n     college campuses: stalking, sexual assault, dating violence \n     and/or domestic violence. We have been the victims of this \n     violence. We have family members who have been killed on \n     campus as part of the commission of these crimes. We have \n     family members who might not have been killed if their \n     colleges and universities had been fully and responsibly \n     addressing stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence \n     through well structured campus systems for prevention, \n     intervention, victim support and perpetrator accountability.\n       And we are not alone: 13.1% of college women report having \n     been stalked during the school year; one in five college \n     women report having been sexually assaulted; 70% of all \n     victims of intimate partner violence in the US experience the \n     first incidents of abuse before they reach the age of 25.\n       There are more than 4,700 colleges and universities in the \n     United States with a total enrollment of over 20 million \n     students. This is a population in crisis that cannot and will \n     not be ignored.\n       The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), enacted in 1994, \n     recognized the insidious and pervasive nature of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In \n     every reauthorization of the Act, Congress has worked \n     carefully to craft improved, enhanced, and accountable \n     programs and services, as well as coordinated community \n     responses, with the goal of providing comprehensive, \n     effective and cost saving responses to these crimes. VAWA's \n     reauthorization must build upon its successes and continue \n     progress towards ending the violence. VAWA must reach all \n     victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault and stalking in every community and \n     on every college campus.\n       The Grants to Reduce Violent Crimes Against Women on Campus \n     program helps institutions of higher education adopt a \n     comprehensive response to domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault and stalking. First authorized in 1999, this \n     very small program has had a dramatic impact on the \n     institutions of higher education lucky enough to get one of \n     these grants (approximately 20-22 colleges per year). It is \n     essential to reauthorize the Campus Grants Program in VAWA, \n     yet it is unacceptable for this to continue to be the only \n     piece of VAWA addressing the overwhelming need.\n       The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act, \n     introduced independently in both chambers and passed as part \n     of S. 1925 in the Senate-passed VAWA, is a crucial step \n     forward. It will address sexual violence, dating violence, \n     and stalking at institutions of higher education and increase \n     awareness and prevention of these acts of violence by \n     requiring transparency of information, systemic, campus-wide \n     policies and procedures to address these crimes, prevention \n     programs, and assistance for victims.\n       The Campus Safety Act, introduced independently in both \n     chambers and passed as part of H.R. 4970 in the House-passed \n     VAWA, is also essential. It will establish a National Center \n     for Campus Public Safety that will provide a centralized, \n     government operated entity to promote proactive approaches to \n     campus safety through the development of best practices, \n     research, and training opportunities.\n       Both the House and the Senate passed bills earlier this \n     year to reauthorize VAWA. It is clear that the vast majority \n     of Congress supports a reauthorization of the Violence \n     Against Women Act with key improvements. But as we watch the \n     clock ticking on the 112th Congress, we are painfully aware \n     of the devastating blow to the young people in our colleges \n     and universities that will occur if Congress fails to pass a \n     final VAWA.\n       We are the voices of the unimaginable pain and suffering \n     occurring every day on our college campuses. We are the \n     voices of those young people whose safety continues to be at \n     such great risk. We are the voices of those who are still too \n     unsafe to speak out about the violence they experienced. We \n     are the\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\n     voices of those who have tragically died senseless deaths \n     when their lives were just beginning.\n       We will not wait! Get VAWA done now.\n       We call upon each and every Senator and Congressperson to \n     prioritize the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \n     Act and the safety and well-being of the young people we are \n     all relying on to carry our nation forward. We implore you \n     not to let us or them down.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Now the House Republican leadership is hiding behind a \nprocedural technicality as an excuse to avoid debate on the Senate \nbill. That is nonsense. We all know the Speaker of the House could \nwaive the technicality, called a blue slip and allow the House to have \nan up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate bill at any time. He could \ndo it this afternoon.\n  I have been consistently calling for House action on this legislation \nsince we passed it overwhelmingly 3 months ago. In fact, last month \nSenator Murkowski and I wrote a bipartisan letter to Speaker Boehner. \nWe asked him to allow an up-or-down vote. Last Thursday five House \nRepublicans followed suit. They called on Speaker Boehner and Majority \nLeader Cantor to take up the Senate-passed bill and resolve the blue \nslip problem.\n  The Speaker's hands are not tied in this matter. He has to stop \nchoosing to hold up the bill and instead choose to let these efforts to \npass the bill go forward. A New York Times editorial earlier this week \nentitled ``Delay on Domestic Violence'' put it well:\n\n       Mr. Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that, \n     of course, would also require his Republican colleagues to \n     drop their . . . opposition to stronger protections for all \n     victims of abuse.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that both letters and the editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2012]\n\n                       Delay on Domestic Violence\n\n       With Congress just days away from its August break, House \n     Republicans have to decide which is more important: \n     protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the \n     harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their \n     party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.\n       At issue is reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, \n     the landmark 1994 law central to the nation's efforts against \n     domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.\n       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's \n     Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill. \n     Instead of embracing the Senate's good work, House \n     Republicans passed their own regressive version, ignoring \n     President Obama's veto threat. The bill did not include new \n     protections for gay, immigrant, American Indian and student \n     victims contained in the Senate measure. It also rolled back \n     protections for immigrant women, including for undocumented \n     immigrants who report abuse and cooperate with law \n     enforcement.\n       Negotiations on a final bill are in limbo. Complicating \n     matters, there is a procedural glitch. The Senate bill \n     imposes a fee to pay for special visas that go to immigrant \n     victims of domestic abuse. This runs afoul of the rule that \n     revenue-raising measures must begin in the House. Mr. \n     Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that, of \n     course, would also require his Republican colleagues to drop \n     their narrow-minded opposition to stronger protections for \n     all victims of abuse.\n       Unless something changes, Republicans will bear \n     responsibility for blocking renewal of a popular, lifesaving \n     initiative. This seems an odd way to cultivate moderate \n     voters, especially women, going into the fall campaign.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2012.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: Saving the lives of victims of domestic \n     violence should be above politics. Yet politics seem to have \n     gotten in the way of House passage of the bipartisan Senate \n     Violence Against Women (VAWA) Reauthorization Act, a bill to \n     strengthen law enforcement's response to domestic violence \n     that cleared the Senate on April 26th with a strong \n     bipartisan vote. In the time since the Senate passed its \n     bill, over 1.5 million Americans have become victims of rape, \n     physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner. We \n     cannot afford to let another day go by. We urge you to \n     swiftly allow for an up-or-down vote in the House on the \n     Senate's bipartisan VAWA Reauthorization Act.\n       Since being enacted in 1994, VAWA has developed a long \n     track record of protecting women and reducing the incidence \n     of domestic violence by providing critical support to law \n     enforcement and services for victims. Each previous \n     reauthorization substantially improved the way VAWA addressed \n     the changing needs of domestic violence victims by addressing \n     challenges facing older victims, victims with disabilities, \n     and other underserved groups. The Senate's bipartisan VAWA \n     Reauthorization Act continues this tradition by placing \n     greater emphasis on training for law enforcement and forensic \n     response to sexual assault, and by strengthening protections \n     for all victims regardless of where they live, their race, \n     religion, gender, or sexual orientation. These changes were \n     included at the recommendation of professionals from all over \n     the country who work with victims every day.\n       We should not let politics pick and choose which victims of \n     abuse to help and which to ignore. However, this fundamental \n     principle is not reflected in the House version of VAWA \n     reauthorization legislation, which disregarded the input from \n     professionals and would eliminate Senate language that \n     ensures universal protection for LGBT victims who currently \n     face obstacles to accessing VAWA's life-saving services, make \n     it more difficult for local law enforcement to help immigrant \n     victims of domestic violence, and fails to match the Senate's \n     effort to address the epidemic of domestic violence on tribal \n     lands.\n       Although significant progress has been made, domestic \n     violence and sexual assault remain serious challenges. Every \n     day, abusive partners kill three women, and for every victim \n     killed there are nine more who narrowly escape. It would be \n     unacceptable to step away from our commitment to stopping \n     violence and abuse, and from seeking justice for victims, by \n     undermining VAWA's protections.\n       The delay of the VAWA Reauthorization Act has real \n     consequences for these and future victims, and should not be \n     allowed to continue. VAWA was enacted and reauthorized with \n     broad bipartisan support, and this year's reauthorization is \n     endorsed by over 500 state and local organizations, and 47 \n     attorneys general. We are concerned that unnecessary \n     political and procedural posturing is breaking the bipartisan \n     consensus on an issue that should rise above such \n     considerations, and is creating an unconscionable delay that \n     further threatens victims of violence. We urge you to honor \n     VAWA's bipartisan history and affirm the House's commitment \n     to combating domestic violence by having an up or down vote \n     on the Senate's VAWA Reauthorization Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                                   Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2012.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Office of the Speaker, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Eric Cantor,\n     Office of the Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor: As strong \n     supporters of a bipartisan approach to the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization, we thank you for your \n     efforts to secure timely House consideration of this issue. \n     We strongly urge you to work diligently with the Senate to \n     solve the blue slip problem as effectively as you did with \n     the Transportation Bill and quickly craft a bicameral \n     compromise on VAWA reauthorization that includes the \n     following provisions:\n       1. Concurrent jurisdiction for tribal crimes--Because of \n     the significant backlog of crimes occurring on tribal lands, \n     federal courts have limited resources to pursue all but the \n     most serious violations. As a result, most sexual assaults \n     and domestic incidents that occur on native lands go \n     unpunished. Allowing our tribal court systems to prosecute \n     these crimes would help to ensure that justice is served and \n     prevent the spread of domestic violence in native \n     communities.\n       2. Protections for LGBT populations--Under current law, all \n     victims of domestic violence are entitled to VAWA services. \n     However, in some communities, services remain unavailable to \n     LGBT individuals simply because of their sexual orientation \n     or gender identity. LGBT-inclusive language would simply \n     clarify the law to ensure that all domestic violence victims \n     have access to the support offered by VAWA.\n       3. Eliminate disincentives for reporting crime among \n     immigrants--The House proposal provides temporary shelter for \n     victims who report domestic crimes, but it maintains the \n     long-term threat of deportation for immigrant victims who \n     come forward. No one should be discouraged from bringing an \n     abuser to the attention of law enforcement. While the \n     Department of Justice confirms that the U-Visa program is not \n     subject to significant fraud, we stand ready to work with \n     concerned Members on improving accountability within the \n     system to ensure that Congress can monitor its effectiveness.\n       4. Improve safety on college campuses--The Senate requires \n     more transparency of information, more prevention programs, \n     and improved assistance for victims of domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on college \n     campuses. The House proposal supports a Campus Safety \n     Resource Center that would be able to support colleges and \n     universities with best practices and guidance to address \n     violence on campus better. Both of these provisions are \n     critical improvements to protect students on campus.\n       We urge you to make VAWA reauthorization a significant \n     priority during the rest of\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n     the 112th Congress and ensure that the aforementioned \n     provisions are included in the final reauthorization bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judy Biggert,\n     Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,\n     Robert J. Dold,\n     Todd R. Platts,\n     David Rivera.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, victims shouldn't be forced to wait any \nlonger. The problems and barriers facing victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence are too serious for Congress to delay. I think of my home \nState of Vermont and the very small State that it is, but more than 50 \npercent of homicides are related to domestic violence--50 percent. That \nis simply unacceptable. We know how to identify these cases early. We \nknow how to intervene. We know how to stop these needless deaths. The \nSenate-passed bill includes important new tools for law enforcement in \ncommunities all over Vermont and every other State to do just that. But \nuntil the House Republican leadership stops playing games, those \nresources will not reach the people who need them now and lives will be \nlost.\n  Enough is enough. Let's stop this fiction of saying we will stand \ntogether to protect this victim but not this other victim, as though \nsomebody who has been victimized, somebody who has faced this violence \nshould be treated differently. It is time to put aside the politics. We \nneed to stop picking and choosing which victims of abuse get help and \nwhich are ignored. We will not find a single police officer who has \ngone to a scene of domestic violence or abuse who will tell us: Well, I \ndon't want to catch the person who did this, but the person who did \nthis, we will go after them. No. Police officers want to protect us \nall. That is what the Leahy-Crapo bill does. This is to protect us all. \nSo I hope the House will take up and vote on the bipartisan Senate bill \nbecause our bill protects all victims. Domestic and sexual violence \nknows no political party. Its victims are Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents. They are rich and poor. They are gay and straight. They \nare immigrant and citizen alike. A victim is a victim. Helping these \nvictims, all these victims--whether they are from Vermont, California, \nAlaska, Iowa, Oregon, Florida, or anywhere else--that has to be our \ngoal because their lives depend upon it.\n\n  Mr. President, we live a privileged life in this Senate, just as the \nHouse Members do. They are not facing this kind of abuse. But the lives \nof millions of Americans do face it. Their lives are depending upon us \nnot to play partisan games but to give law enforcement and all the \nvarious organizations that help prevent abuse the tools they need. We \nhave done that in the Senate. It is time for the House to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in the midst of all of this tax \ndebate and the partisan wrangling and the gridlock that has ensued--and \ntoday we will have another couple of tax votes, and, again, real \nprogress will be stalled--I would like to offer a bipartisan thought \nthat will lead to a solution. As a matter of fact, I think there are \nover 50 Senators of the 100-Senator body who agree that deficit \nreduction can be done, and done in a comprehensive way. I think \npartisan politics, all mixed up in election-year politics of a \nPresidential election, is getting in the way, and I think that is what \nwe are going to see being played out this afternoon on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  What would that solution be? Well, if our target is that we want to \nreduce the deficit over a 10-year period by at least $4 trillion--that \nwas clearly where the Simpson-Bowles Commission was going; that was \nclearly where the Gang of 6, which morphed into 45 of us who last \nsummer stood and had a press conference and talked about $4 trillion-\nplus in deficit reduction, was going--if that is what our goal is, and \nas others have spoken out here, if we could get that kind of deficit \nreduction agreement for a 10-year period, what we would have is a shot \nof confidence into the economy, and we would see this economic engine \nstart to roar more to life, other than the gradual economic recovery we \nare seeing--indeed, a recovery of 27 straight months of private sector \njob growth, but albeit a slow economic recovery.\n  If over 50 of us were to come together and strike that agreement, \nindeed, that is what we would have, and the stock market would take \noff, the bank lending would take off, the credit ratings would go up, \nand all of the incidental things that would flow from that.\n  You know what. At the end of the year that is what we are going to \nhave to do, and most every reasonable Senator knows that. That is why \nthere are a number of Senators on this side and that side of the aisle \nwho have spoken the same message.\n  What is that message?\n  No. 1, that we have to have some spending cuts, but if we are doing \n$4 trillion-plus, we cannot do it all with spending cuts. We have to \nhave revenue produced.\n  How do we get the revenue? What over 50 Senators in this body would \nagree to is we reform the Tax Code in a comprehensive way by starting \nto eliminate some of the tax preferences, otherwise known as tax \nloopholes, tax deductions, tax credits, that have ballooned out of \ncontrol.\n  The last time I voted for tax reform I was a young Congressman and \nPresident Reagan was President. It was 1986. When we reformed the Tax \nCode back then, the tax expenditures for a 10-year period were worth \nabout $2 trillion to $3 trillion. Do you know, that has ballooned now \nto over $14 trillion over a 10-year period, just in tax preferences--\nthat is individual tax preference items for different special \ninterests--which means revenue is not coming in. As a matter of fact, \nthere is more going out in tax preferences than there actually is \ncoming in each year in individual income tax.\n  Well, if we reform it in the way that a lot of us are talking about, \nthen we take that revenue and we do two things with it: No. 1, we \nsimplify the Tax Code and we lower everybody's tax rates--individual \nincome tax rates, as well as corporate income tax rates--and we take \nthe rest of the revenue and pay down the annual deficit.\n  Now, that is fairly common sense, and it is fairly simple. Of course, \nto get in and comprehensively reform the Tax Code is going to be quite \na task, and the committee that is designated to make the first cut at \nit would be the Finance Committee, of which I have the privilege of \nbeing a member.\n  We have heard similar statements by a number of Republican Senators. \nWe will continue to hear statements from other Democrats--such as me--\nabout what I just said. And we will hear that because the commonsense \npeople know that is what it is going to take to get our budgetary house \nin order.\n  But we are not there. We are in the middle of a partisan war, all \nwound up in the crucible of an election year for President, and as a \nresult we are going to have two tax votes today that do not pass.\n  The Republican version of the tax cut is going to be all of the Bush \ntax cuts from 2001 and 2003. They stay in effect for all levels of \nincome. Oh, by the way, in their bill, they say to make up for that \n$405 billion that will not go into the Treasury as a result of the \ncontinuation of the Bush tax cuts--in 1 year, $405 billion--we cannot \ndo anything with revenue. So they are going to prohibit what half of \nthe Senate knows ultimately is the solution to this problem. That is \none version.\n  The other version is what is being brought forth by the majority \nleader, which is, give the tax cuts for everybody, including the top 2 \npercent. But the top 2 percent--above $250,000 adjusted gross income on \na joint return--that tax rate will go up a little over 4 percent just \non the income above the $250,000 adjusted gross income, not on the \nincome underneath, for which everybody continues to have the continued \ntax rate. In that same proposal, 97 percent of the small businesses \nwill not get any kind of tax increase. Likewise, if they are a \nsubchapter S corporation, they will have the same benefits of the tax \ncut up to that level of $250,000.\n  We heard comment out here about, oh, we have to keep the exemptions \non the estate tax up, which I certainly agree with. Well, in this \nversion the majority leader is going to offer, it has no provisions in \nit on raising the estate tax.\n  What would be my preference? I am going to vote for the majority \nleader's proposal, but my preference is that we would take that tax cut \nup to the level of adjusted gross income of $1 million\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\non a joint return, which would mean far less than 1 percent of the \npeople in this country would be affected by a 4-percent increase in \nthat income above $1 million.\n  That is my preference. That is what I voted on a year ago. But that \nis not the choice before us today. So I have no choice but to vote as I \njust indicated. But at the end of the day, this is not going to solve \nthe problem. It is going to be more political posturing all the way up \nto the November election. Then in a lameduck session we are going to \nget down to work. We are going to let common sense and bipartisanship \noperate, and we are going to solve this deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the cogent \nremarks, sensible remarks of my colleague from Florida. He has fought \nlong and hard for the middle class in terms of taxes, and I very much \nappreciate his hard work on this issue. The citizens of Florida should \nbe proud of him.\n  I rise today, of course, also to talk about the upcoming Senate vote \non the middle-class tax cuts.\n  For weeks, Senate Democrats have been asking our friends on the other \nside of the aisle to allow this debate on taxes to happen. Leader Reid \nhas repeatedly offered to have a simple up-or-down vote on both the \nDemocratic and Republican proposals. Time after time, minority leader \nMitch McConnell has declined.\n  But, fortunately, that has now changed. Senator McConnell has, after \nweeks of delay, relented and decided he is not going to filibuster our \nmiddle-class tax cut bill. That is very good news for the country. The \nmost important thing we can do for the economy right now is to provide \ncertainty to the middle class that their taxes are not going up.\n  I believe there are two reasons Senator McConnell finally decided to \nallow this to happen.\n  First, forcing his entire caucus to filibuster this legislation would \nhave been politically disastrous for them. It would have prevented any \ndebate or amendments on the Democratic tax cut legislation, meaning the \nRepublicans would not have been able to offer their amendments to \nextend tax cuts for those millionaires and billionaires. In other \nwords, a filibuster would have meant there would have been only a \nsingle vote on middle-class tax cuts on the Democratic proposal and \nthat almost all Republicans would then have been on record against \nthem. So it is easy to see why that would have been uncomfortable for \nthem.\n  Second, I truly believe some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle have truly looked at the Democratic proposal and realized that \nvoting for it is the right thing to do. I believe Senator McConnell \nwould have not been able to stop them from voting yes.\n  Faced with widespread concern in his caucus, I believe Senator \nMcConnell decided an abrupt about face was in his best interest. So the \nSenate is about to speak. We are going to pass a bill that will ensure \ntaxes do not go up for the 98 percent of Americans who earn less than \n$250,000 a year. We are going to defeat a proposal that would spend \nalmost $1 trillion providing additional cuts for the richest 2 percent \nand at the same time allowing tax breaks used by 25 million middle-\nclass families to expire.\n  Included in that is something very important to me; that is, the \n$2,500 credit middle-class families get to help defray the cost of \ntuition. To not allow that to move forward, whether in this bill, the \nextenders bill or another bill would be very bad policy, hurt the \nmiddle class, and hurt the future of America.\n  We are doing it. I hope everyone will join us in supporting the \nDemocratic bill which has that provision to provide tuition relief, tax \nrelief to help middle-class families defray the cost of tuition.\n  Once the Democratic proposal passes the Senate, it will be sent to \nthe House. I am sure Speaker Boehner does not appreciate the \nuncomfortable position Senate Democrats and Republicans have put him \nin. Make no mistake about it, Senator McConnell, to save his caucus \nfrom a disastrous vote against the middle-class tax extension, has had \nto put the Speaker in a box.\n  The Speaker knows if he puts this bill on the floor, his Members will \nhave trouble voting against it. So they have decided to put out an \nargument that they should not bring it up because of a blue-slip issue. \nWhile it is true that revenue vehicles have to originate in the House, \nthis is a problem that could be easily remedied. In fact, Senator Reid \ntried to do it by unanimous consent earlier today, but unfortunately \nthe minority leader blocked it.\n  When it comes to blue-slip issues, where there is a will, there is a \nway. House Republicans have passed two landmark revenue bills this \nCongress after the Senate passed them--the highway bill and the FAA \nbill. Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in passing legislation \nin the Senate this Congress despite potential blue-slip issues, the \nViolence Against Women Act and the ethanol excise tax credit repeal, \nfor example.\n  But if House Republicans insist on blocking our middle-class tax cuts \nand using the blue-slip issue as an excuse, that is a debate we are \nwilling to have. That is a debate we welcome. Because, for once, we \nhave broken the vice that Republicans have had on tax issues for 30 \nyears. They have always conflated tax cuts for the middle class and tax \ncuts for the very wealthy. But this bill breaks that vice and allows us \nto support middle-class tax cuts without--without--giving tax cuts to \nthe very wealthiest among us who, A, will not bump up the economy \nbecause they do not spend a large proportion of that high income, and, \nB, could go to deficit reduction.\n  I know lots of very wealthy people who say: I do not mind paying more \ntaxes if the money would go to deficit reduction. Our bill allows \nexactly that to happen. So Democrats are going to be happy to bring the \nargument to the American people and ask them whether they think obscure \nprocedural rules which the Republican Party in the House has ignored \ntime and time again are now reason enough to let over 100 million \nfamilies face a tax hike of $1,600 a year.\n  The Senate is about to pass the only tax cut bill that has a chance \nof becoming law. No one thinks it is a good idea to raise taxes on the \nmiddle class. No one. We can disagree about whether the very wealthiest \nin society should also get a tax break, but we all agree the middle \nclass should get one. So why hold one hostage for the other?\n  The Senate supports middle-class tax breaks. The President supports \nmiddle-class tax breaks. The House supports middle-class tax breaks. \nDemocrats support middle-class tax breaks. Republicans support middle-\nclass tax breaks. Instead of fighting over whether the wealthiest in \nsociety should also get a tax break, why do we not pass this now, give \nreal relief to the middle class, and have the other debate later?\n  Middle-class Americans who do not want to see their taxes go up \nsupport what we are doing. The House should act immediately so the \nPresident can sign this bill into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of our time to Senator \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish to thank my friend from California for her kindness \nand for her graciousness in allowing me this little bit of time to make \nfinal remarks with regard to this bill that Senator McConnell and I \nhave filed.\n  We are going to be taking two votes on a critical issue in a few \nmoments. Action on the fiscal cliff is long overdue. Before we vote, I \nwould like to make three points. First, it has been suggested that the \nHatch-McConnell bill fails to extend the earned-income tax credit and \nchild tax credit provisions. This is utterly false. The Hatch-McConnell \nbill extends these provisions as they were originally agreed to in \n2001, and that agreement actually doubled the child tax credit. \nDemocrats are complaining that our bill does not extend the stimulus \nprovisions that expanded these provisions even further and made them \nmore refundable.\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\n  Democrats sold the stimulus bill as being ``timely, temporary, and \ntargeted.'' Now they are holding up tax relief for nearly every income \ntaxpayer unless these stimulus provisions that are mostly spending \nthrough the Tax Code are extended yet again.\n\n  Second, the Democratic proposal includes a significant increase in \nthe death tax. The number of death tax filers will increase under their \nbill by 11 times. This is what they are proposing: 98,300 new filers \nwill now have to fill out estate tax forms, get appraisals, deals with \nthe IRS, and get all this done within 9 months of the death of a loved \none. That is the equivalent of one entire midsized American city being \nforced to deal with the death tax every year.\n  Third, the Democratic bill is a massive tax increase on small \nbusiness job creators. It would subject 53 percent of all flowthrough \nbusiness income in the United States to higher taxes. There is a \ncompromise here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds, with \nan equivalent time for the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is a compromise here; it is the Hatch-McConnell \nbill. Our economy needs relief, businesses and families need certainty, \nand all we are proposing is extending current tax law for 1 more year \nso we can dedicate that year to do tax reform.\n  By contrast, the Democratic bill offers nothing but more uncertainty \nand tax increases on job creators. Let's face it, we are talking about \n940,000 small businesses that will be drastically affected by this. \nMany of those provide jobs in our society and will continue to do so if \nwe do not clobber them with the Democratic approach.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 3412, \nthe Middle Class Tax Cut Act, which would act on President Barack \nObama's proposal to restore our economy and control our deficit by \nimmediately extending the current tax rates for American families \nmaking less than $250,000 a year and asking our Nation's top 2 percent \nof income earners to pay their fair share.\n  As we continue to work to enact policies that move our economy \nforward, it is important that we protect the middle class from having \nto pay higher taxes--which will happen if Congress does nothing before \nJanuary 1, 2013. In Hawaii, this means 500,000 families would pay an \naverage of $1,600 more in taxes in 2013 alone, which they cannot \nafford. My colleagues and I are working to reduce the national debt; \nhowever, at this point in our economic recovery, we cannot allow the \nvast majority of Americans--the middle class--to shoulder this burden \nalone. They have always been and remain the backbone of our economy and \nour country.\n  Most of us here in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nour colleagues in the House, can agree that we should maintain the \ncurrent income tax rates for 98 percent of Americans. With that in \nmind, my colleagues on the left have been trying to work with the rest \nof the Senate to get this sensible legislation passed. However, some \nMembers in this Chamber refuse to come together to pass the tax \nextensions that we all agree on. We need to take action now. Hard-\nworking American families should not have to worry about their taxes \nincreasing as they budget for housing, food, and other necessities for \nthe coming year.\n  To cut our deficit, we must ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their \nfair share. That means closing tax loopholes for corporations and not \nextending the tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Yet some \nMembers of the Senate continue to oppose this bill in hopes of \nincluding an extension of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. \nThese tax breaks for the wealthy were originally intended to be \ntemporary measures, enacted during a time when our Nation had \nsubstantial annual surpluses. However, we must acknowledge our current \neconomic situation and respond by asking the wealthiest Americans to \npay their fair share.\n  This country was founded on the principles of fairness and \nresponsibility. This bill would help restore those fundamentals to our \ntax system. I urge my colleagues to consider all of their constituents \nwhen voting on this bill and support it for the 98 percent of Americans \nwho need our action today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a moment? I am going to \nuse my leader time. But I am happy to defer to the Senator from \nCalifornia first.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Whatever is more convenient for the minority leader. If \nthe minority leader wishes to speak now, I will defer and take my 8 \nminutes later.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will let the Senator from California \ngo ahead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, very much. Let me say that this is a very \nimportant debate. When we look at the two plans, the Republican tax cut \nplan versus the Democratic tax cut plan, what we see is one is for the \nmiddle class; that is, the Democratic plan. One is for our middle-class \nfamilies. It includes tuition tax credits, and an enhanced child tax \ncredit. It is very important that we do that.\n  The other is a giveaway to the millionaires and the billionaires. It \nis amazing to me that it is not enough for my Republican friends to \ngive everyone a tax break in this Nation of ours up to the first \n$250,000 of income and then say after that we are going to go to the \ntax rates of Bill Clinton.\n  In those years, unlike the Bush years, we created 23 million jobs, \nand we created surpluses as far as the eye could see. But my Republican \nfriends want to go backward to the Bush years, to the trickle-down \nyears. Here is the problem. They do it on the backs of the middle \nclass.\n  They claim our plan will hurt small business owners. Let me be clear. \nNinety-seven percent of small business owners earn less than $250,0000 \na year. So all that talk about job creators is nothing but talk. It is \nnothing but a smokescreen for the highest earners in America. Here is \nanother problem. The Republican plan adds $930 billion to the deficit \nover 10 years. It is a problem. In 1 year, the first year, it is a $50 \nbillion add-on to the deficit.\n  I have heard my Republican colleagues cry about sequestration. They \ndo not want it, even though they agreed to it when we made our deal \naround the debt ceiling. Let's remember that. They did not want to give \nan increase to the debt ceiling. They held everybody hostage. We lost \nour credit rating. Even Ronald Reagan said: Never play with the debt \nceiling. They played with it. They played a game with it.\n  Then, to get out of it, they said: OK. We will sequester if we do not \nhave the debt deal. Now they are crying about sequester. Guess what. If \nwe do the Democratic deal, we save $50 billion. We could cut that \nsequester in half. But oh, no, they want to do tax breaks for the \nwealthy few.\n  This is the deal. Look at this chart. This is Robin Hood in reverse--\nthis is Robin Hood in reverse. The wealthiest among us get back \n$160,000 a year under the Republican plan. Let me repeat that. The \nwealthiest taxpayers in America will get back $160,000 a year under the \nRepublican plan while the middle class gets harmed.\n  They lose $1,100 a year for their tax credits on the tuition tax \ncredit. They lose $800 a year from an enhanced child care tax credit, \n$500 a year from enhanced earned-income tax credit. So our families \nlose money, our middle-class families, while the wealthiest among us \ngets this enormous tax break and the deficit goes up and the debt goes \nup.\n  When my colleague Senator Hatch says the Hatch-McConnell compromise \nis good, it is not a compromise. It is going right back to the problem \nthat led us to this situation in the first place. It is going right \nback to the same policies of George W. Bush. Remember when George W. \nBush became President? We had surpluses as far as the eye could see. \nThen he gave these tax breaks to the top 1 percent. By the way, this \n$160,000, that is the millionaires' tax break. They want to give tax \nbreaks to the multimillionaires, to the billionaires, to the \nmultibillionaires. They put no cap on the tax cuts whatsoever. Someone \ncan earn $100 billion, they want to give them a tax break.\n  There is a cost. There is a cost to the Treasury. There is a cost to \nthe debt. There is a cost to the deficit. There is a cost to fairness. \nThere is a cost to the middle class. I think the American people have \nweighed in on this one. They\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nbelieve that to give a tax break to the first $250,000 of everybody's \nincome is fair because then the people above that can pay a little \nmore, the same rates they paid when Bill Clinton was President. We need \nto go back to those days when we created 23 million jobs and when we \nnot only balanced the budget but we created surpluses as far as the eye \ncould see.\n  The question is, who are you fighting for? Are you fighting for the \npeople who make a billion dollars a year? That is who the Republicans \nfight for. They get so emotional about it. Or are you fighting for the \nmiddle class, the heart and soul of America--the people who live in my \ntowns, the people who live in towns across this Nation, the people who \nget up every day and put one foot in front of the other and work hard, \nthe people who are trying to raise their families, the people who want \nus to be fiscally responsible, not have a tax cut that causes huge \ndeficits? We have been there. Trickledown doesn't work; giving to the \ntop doesn't work. It has brought us the worst recession since the Great \nDepression.\n  Vote for the Democrats' plan and against the Republican plan, and do \nwhat our President said, which is get this country moving forward \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed for a few \nmoments on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the vote we are about to take on the \nDemocratic plan to raise taxes is interesting for a few reasons. First, \nit is a revenue measure that didn't originate in the House, so it has \nno chance whatsoever of becoming law.\n  Second, it is the perfect example of what you get when you put \npolitics over the people who sent you here. If the Democrats truly \nbelieved what the President has been saying out on the stump, they \nwould vote on his plan. But as the vote tally will show, they can \nbarely muster 50 votes on their own plan, let alone his. So for the \nentire President's talk about supporting a balanced approach to taxes, \nhe evidently can't even get 50 votes for his plan in a Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate when we all know he would need 60 votes to get it to \nhis desk.\n  Instead of voting on the President's plan, our Democratic friends \nhave cobbled together the only thing they could come up with that would \nmuster more than 50 votes--a purely political exercise, and a total \nwaste of time.\n  But to be honest, I can't imagine why they would want to vote for \neither one, since both proposals raise taxes on about a million \nbusiness owners, and both raise taxes on investment, at a time when the \neconomy is in paralysis.\n  Here is the Democratic plan for the economy: We will get this thing \ngoing again--by raising taxes. Let's take more money out of small \nbusiness and send it to Washington; that is how we will create jobs, \nthey say. Let us create jobs instead of the small business owners out \nin America. After all, they don't create jobs anyway; of course, \nWashington creates jobs.\n  If you are looking for the legislative equivalent of the President's \nnow famous view that ``you didn't build that,'' this is it.\n  They don't think you deserve to keep what you have earned because you \nare not responsible for earning it. They don't think you are entitled \nto keep what you have earned because, after all, you weren't even \nresponsible for earning it; they are.\n  That is the message Democrats are sending with today's votes, that \nyou are not responsible for your success; Washington is. So give us \nyour money, and we will handle it for you. That is their tax plan. That \nis their plan for the economy and for jobs.\n  Fortunately for the American people, there is another approach. Next \nweek, House Republicans will pass a bill that drew broad bipartisan \nsupport in this body 19 months ago, and it would draw broad bipartisan \nsupport today if Democrats were more concerned about what is best for \ncreating jobs than they were in centralizing power right here in \nWashington and pleasing their liberal base.\n  The Republican proposal is to do no harm and to commit to the kind of \nserious tax reform we all know we need. That is the vote Senate \nRepublicans are proud to take today and House Republicans will take \nnext week. It is the plan Senate Democrats--and the President--would \nsupport if they were serious about jobs.\n  The Democratic plan is to raise taxes on nearly a million business \nowners and, in a notable departure from the President, threaten tens of \nthousands of family farms and ranches with a death tax of 55 percent at \nthe end of the year. That is their plan. That is their idea of economic \nstimulus. That is the bill they would rather vote on than the \nPresident's proposal. And it is absolutely the last thing we need right \nnow.\n  The good news is that this new, convoluted Democratic bill will never \nmake it to the President's desk. It will never make it. The bad news is \nthey will also vote down the one tax plan that should make it to his \ndesk.\n  We can do better than this. It is time for the Democrats to work with \nus on rewarding success and not punishing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republicans' tax hike on the middle \nclass has just been defeated. Their plan would have raised taxes by \nabout $1,000 for 25 million middle-class families while giving \nmillionaires an average of a $160,000 tax break. So let's look at that. \nTheir bill would have raised taxes on 25 million middle-class families \nby about $1,000 a year, and it would have given millionaires a $160,000 \ntax break. Those numbers are staggering. Their bill would have raised \ntaxes on parents trying to pay for college, on families--especially \nlarge families--with children. So it is no wonder a majority of \nSenators opposed that legislation.\n  In just a short time there will be a bill that will pass cut taxes \nfor 98 percent of Americans, including every middle-class taxpayer and \nmore than 97 percent of small businesses. This plan, proposed by \nPresident Obama, would cut taxes for 114 million American families. \nTheirs raises taxes for 25 million middle-class families. This is the \nonly bill that has a chance of becoming law, so it is the only plan \nthat would actually give a middle-class family the security of avoiding \ntheir fiscal cliff. The House should take up this legislation and pass \nit.\n  President Obama believes we must keep taxes low for 98 percent of \nAmericans. Democrats agree. So do the majority of Americans. A majority \nof Americans, including a majority of Republicans, around this country \nbelieve taxes should remain low for the middle class but the top 2 \npercent should pay their fair share to reduce the debt. The bill the \nSenate is about to pass respects the will of the American people, \nincluding a majority of Republicans in America outside the Halls of \nthis Congress. Republican Members of Congress disagree with a majority \nof Republicans.\n  The President, of course, has said he will sign the bill immediately. \nBut now Republicans are threatening to hide behind yet another arcane \nprocedural maneuver to stall this crucial legislation, and this will \nget the attention of the American people. They are threatening to do \nsomething called blue slip this because revenue-raising resolutions \nmust be originated in the House of Representatives. But my Republican \ncolleagues have very short memories. Senate Republicans are all too \nhappy to bypass the procedural hoop when it suits their purposes. They \nare willing to go around it when it is time to reauthorize the FAA. \nThey were willing to sidestep it when we passed the Violence Against \nWomen Act. We did that here in the Senate. They were willing to dodge \nit when we passed the Transportation bill that was so important to this \ncountry. But now their excuse for stalling a tax cut for 98 percent of \nthe American people is an old procedural trick that the American people \ndo not understand, and rightfully so.\n  If Republicans in the House fail to act on this bill, taxes will rise \nby $2,200 for the typical middle-class family of four. That is $2,200 \nless to spend on gas, groceries, rent, and life in general for these \npeople. This tax hike on ordinary families couldn't come at a worse \ntime--just as our economy is doing its utmost to get back on its feet.\n  Republicans should not force middle-class families off their fiscal \ncliff to protect more wasteful giveaways to millionaires and \nbillionaires--an average of $160,000 a year per millionaire. Democrats \nbelieve this country can't afford more budget-busting giveaways for the \ntop 2 percent of earners. Again, Republicans in America agree with us. \nIt is only here in the Senate that the Republicans don't agree. But \nthat is a debate we are willing to have, and the House Republicans need \nnot hold tax cuts for the middle class hostage in order to have that \ndebate. They can and should pass our middle-class tax cuts immediately.\n  Once we give middle-class families security, we can spend the next 5 \nmonths debating whether wealthy families need more tax breaks. We know \nhow the American people feel--just like we do.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first let me welcome the Vice President \nhere today, our good friend who served for so many years in the Senate.\n  It reminds me of the negotiation he and I conducted in December of \n2010. I got a call from the Vice President one day, and he said: The \nPresident thought we ought to talk about the possibility of extending \nthe current tax rates for everyone because the economy is not doing \nvery well, and the worst thing we could do would be to raise taxes on \nanyone in the middle of this economic situation.\n  I said: Mr. Vice President, I think that is something we would be \ninterested in.\n  So the Vice President and I negotiated for a period of time and \nagreed that because the economy was not doing well in December 2010, we \nought to extend the current tax rates for everyone.\n  I can remember the signing ceremony. I was there. The majority leader \nwas not. The Speaker of the House was not. The President made a speech \nin signing an extension of the current tax rates for everyone that I \ncould have made myself. Forty Members of the Senate on the Democratic \nside voted for it.\n  Today, my colleagues, the economy is growing slower than it was in \nDecember of 2010. So we know this is not about the economy; we know \nthis is about the election. We all know there is an election going on. \nThere is politics from time to time practiced here in the Senate. I am \nnot offended by that. But I think what the American people would like \nto hear from us is a response to the economic situation.\n  This proposal guarantees that taxes will go up on roughly 1 million \nof our most successful small businesses. Over 50 percent of small \nbusiness income--25 percent of the workforce--will be affected by it. \nIt guarantees that taxes will go up on capital gains, on dividends, \nwhich provide the income for a huge number of our senior citizens. This \nis a uniquely bad idea. It may poll well, as my friend the majority \nleader indicated, but, of course, the fact that he needed to mention \nthat illustrates the point that this is more about the election than it \nis about the economy.\n  So I would predict there will probably be bipartisan opposition to \nthis proposal. I am sure a few arms have been twisted in order to get \nthe result. The Vice President is at a disadvantage: he can't speak, \nbeing an occupant of the chair. But in this particular instance, he is \nactually better not to because he would have the dilemma of trying to \nexplain the difference between the economic situation the country \nconfronts today and the condition the country confronted in December of \n2010 when the economy was doing better. So be grateful, I say to my \nfriend the Vice President. This is a debate I don't think you would \nwant to lead.\n  With that, my colleagues and friends, I urge a ``no'' vote on this \nvery, very bad idea for the U.S. economy.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 2010 the country was staring at what had \ntaken place the prior 8 years--8 million jobs lost. What has happened \nin the years since 2010 that my friend the Republican leader talks \nabout? This administration has created 4.5 million jobs. We haven't \nfilled the hole we lost during the 8 years of the prior President, but \nwe have made some progress. We all acknowledge we need to do more, but \ndon't ever compare today with 2010.\n  First of all, everyone understands, all you folks who love to give \ntax cuts to the millionaires, our bill does that also. The first \n$250,000 they make is treated just like a middle-class family.\n  I would also point everyone to this. I have talked about the \nRepublicans around the country supporting this legislation. Of course \nthey do. They know the deficit needs to be handled, and they know that \nabout $1 trillion is what our legislation will do to fill the hole of \nthe debt.\n  But also, people who are in this great country of ours who have done \nso well understand that they are supposed to contribute more. They know \nthat. My friend doesn't like to hear polls, but let me give him another \none. Sixty-five percent of these really rich people are willing to pay \nmore taxes. Again, the people who are unwilling to do this are people \nwho signed a pledge for this person, Grover Norquist. And remember, \nthere was a little vacillating about a month ago, so he came up here \nand had somebody renew their vows with him.\n  So we are on the side of the angels; we are on the side of the \nAmerican people because this legislation that is going to pass is what \nis good for the American people. And I ask that we have that vote now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Remember, I always get the last word.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me briefly add that I listened carefully to what \nmy friend the majority leader said. He once again was making it clear \nthis is about the campaign. It is about the campaign and not about the \neconomy.\n  But if you listen carefully to the rhetoric, what he is saying here \nis that these million businesses didn't create this success; that we \nsomehow need to take this money because we will spend it better on \ntheir behalf.\n  Now, I know my colleague is going to get the last word, and that is \nfine. I am happy for him to have it. But the fact is this: The economy \nis in worse shape today than it was in December of 2010--worse shape \ntoday. The growth rate is slower. The President signed this bill, \nadvocated its passage back then because the economy didn't need to get \nhit with a big tax increase. The growth rate is slower today. The \neconomic situation remains largely the same. The worst we could do in \nthe middle of this economic condition is to pass this tax increase.\n  Now my friend the majority leader can have the last word, and then we \nwill be happy to go to a vote.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, they may have different newspapers in \nKentucky than I read. I get my Nevada clips every day. I try to read \nsome papers from back home. We have now 28 months of job growth in the \nprivate sector, 20 months in a row. That is pretty good.\n  This legislation is about the debt. It is about the debt. We have to \ndo something about the debt, and we have tried mightily to do that. We \nhave tried mightily.\n  We had the Conrad-Judd Gregg legislation. Seven people who are \nRepublican Senators who cosponsored that wouldn't vote for it and allow \nme to get it on the floor because they had adopted the Republican \nleader's philosophy that the most important thing we can do is defeat \nPresident Obama for reelection. Then we went to Bowles-Simpson, which \nwas a program we put together when we couldn't get that legislation. \nThat was so good, by two of our best financial minds in the Senate, \nJudd Gregg and Kent Conrad. And Bowles-Simpson didn't make it. Then we \nhad a series of talks with the President and the Speaker. Always, we \ncould never quite get it done. Why? Even though my friend and I care \nabout him, John Boehner said, I want to do big things, not little \nthings. One of the little things he couldn't do is get his caucus to \nagree to just a little bit of revenue so we could have a deal, the \ngrand bargain. Then we tried the Biden talks. The majority leader in \nthe House of Representatives walked out on those talks. Then we had the \nsupercommittee, and about 1 week before, by statute, Patty Murray and \nher troops were supposed to offer the legislation, I got a letter \nsigned by virtually every Republican Senator saying: No thanks. Grover \nwins again. No revenues.\n\n  This is about our country, about doing something about a debt. It \nwill contribute about $1 trillion to the debt. That is not bad.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I heard my good friend the majority \nleader say this is about the deficit. This will produce enough revenue \nto operate the government for about 1 week. This would produce about \nenough revenue to operate the government for about 1 week.\n  This is not about the deficit or the debt, this is about the \ncampaign. We all know there is a campaign going on, but why don't we do \nserious legislating here? No budget, no appropriation bills, no DOD \nauthorization bill. When are we going to actually pass things in the \nSenate?\n  This is a uniquely bad idea for the economy. The good news that I can \nsay to the American people is that it isn't going to happen today. It \nought not to\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nhappen anytime. This is part of the fiscal cliff we are facing at the \nend of the year. The Chairman of the Fed is concerned about it, the \nCongressional Budget Office, which Republicans certainly don't run, is \nconcerned about it. We have heard talk on the other side that we should \nhave Thelma and Louise economics and just drive the country right off \nthe cliff. We all get in the car and go right off the cliff together \nand see what it is like.\n  The American people know a campaign is going on, but why don't we in \nhere try to do something important for the country now. The campaign \nwill take care of itself. This is not a serious piece of legislation \nbecause it is not going anywhere, and thank goodness it is not going \nanywhere because it would be bad for the economy and the single worst \nthing we could do to the country.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, required reading for decades now has been \nGeorge Orwell. College students read it now just like I did when I was \nin college. George Orwell came to the conclusion that we have arrived \nat a time where up is down and down is up, and that is what my friend, \nthe Republican leader, has done. If there were ever a statement \nOrwellian, it is his.\n  We haven't done the appropriations bill. Stop and think just 1 \nminute. Does the minority leader think 85 filibusters had anything to \ndo with that? Eighty-five filibusters. We haven't done a budget. That \nis poppycock. We have one. We did it, and my Republican friends--I \nappreciate it--voted with us. We have our numbers right now. We could \nhave done every appropriations bill. Chairman Inouye marked them up. We \ncan't do them because we have to overcome 85 filibusters.\n  For my friend to say, let's do something important, please--is this \nbill we are going to pass important? You bet it is. He said it would \nonly pay for the government for 1 week or whatever the number was. Over \n10 years, it is $1 trillion. Over 1 year, it is $100 billion. Even in \nLas Vegas that is not chump change.\n  I wish we would vote now.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the passage of S. 3412.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Con. Res. 21 (110th \n     Congress).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Middle \nClass Tax Relief Act. This afternoon, I voted for legislation that \nwould have extended the middle-class tax cuts through 2013.\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n  In Minnesota, 2 million families and small businesses will see their \nFederal income taxes increase by an average of $1,600 unless the \nmiddle-class tax cuts are extended. Instead of waiting until the \neleventh hour, this legislation would have provided certainty for \nfamilies and small businesses that their already squeezed budgets won't \nhave to be trimmed further in the coming year.\n  I would like to make clear that extending the middle-class tax cuts \nis just the first step. There is a growing majority here that favors \ncomprehensive tax reform that would simplify the Tax Code, broaden the \nbase, and lower tax rates. Passing the middle-class tax cuts today \nwould give us time to reach consensus on the details of reform that \nwould streamline our Tax Code, pay down our debt, and ensure the United \nStates remains competitive.\n  We also must take action on the estate tax. If Congress does nothing, \nthe exemption would drop to $1 million and the rate would rise to 55 \npercent. This is not an acceptable outcome and would hurt farmers and \nsmall businesses in Minnesota who have worked hard to build a legacy \nthey can pass on to their children and grandchildren. In the past we \nhave come together to pass compromise levels that don't harm farmers \nand small business owners, while still being mindful of our deficit. I \nwill work to ensure it happens again.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to talk briefly about the estate \ntax and Colorado's agricultural community and small businesses. While I \nvoted in favor of the Middle Class Tax Cut Act, I do not believe that \nthis legislation represents an end to the tax reform debate in \nWashington. In particular, it is important that we find a bipartisan \nand responsible path forward on the estate tax that provides the \nnecessary certainty for businesses and families across Colorado. This \nis vital for Colorado's economy. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues in Congress to establish an estate tax policy that works for \nsmall businesses, family farms and ranches, and all Coloradans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5357-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5357-S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2012--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 470, S. 3414, a bill to enhance the \n     security and resiliency of the cyber and communications \n     infrastructure of the United States.\n         Harry Reid, Joseph I. Lieberman, John D. Rockefeller IV, \n           Dianne Feinstein, Sheldon Whitehouse, Barbara A. \n           Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Jeff Bingaman, Patty Murray, \n           Max Baucus, Charles E. Schumer, Bill Nelson, \n           Christopher A. Coons, Tom Udall, Carl Levin, Mark R. \n           Warner, Ben Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Honoring Senator Leahy and Senator Lugar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise with great pleasure to honor my \ncolleagues, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dick Lugar of Indiana, \nas they reach a milestone in their careers. They each cast a momentous \nvote just a short time ago. For Senator Leahy, the vote just cast is \nhis 14,000th rollcall vote. For Senator Lugar--it is interesting that \nit is the same day and 1,000 votes apart--it is his 13,000th. These two \nfine men and dedicated Senators share the milestone purely by \ncoincidence.\n  I applaud Pat Leahy, my dear friend, who has always possessed a great \ndrive to serve. Maybe it was growing up across from the State House in \nMontpelier that put the idea in his head from such a young age.\n  After graduating from Georgetown University Law School, Pat served 8 \nyears as State's attorney for Vermont before coming to the Senate. He \ncontinues to exercise his fine legal mind as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Leahy has also led the fight against \nlandmines, as well as numerous landmark pieces of legislation on which \nhe has been the leader.\n  Pat is loved by the people of Vermont. His intellect and his \noratorical skills, his boldness, and his persuasiveness are all \novershadowed by one thing--by his teammate Marcelle. Marcelle is \nclearly his greatest asset.\n  I also commend my colleague Senator Lugar on reaching his milestone \nof his 13,000th vote. Senator Lugar is a fifth-generation Hoosier, a \nproud Navy veteran, and the longest serving Member of Congress in \nIndiana history. He is also a bit of an overachiever, graduating first \nin both his high school and college classes, and going on to become a \nRhodes Scholar at Oxford.\n  As ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and past \nchairman of the committee, having served with the Presiding Officer for \ndecades, he has dedicated his time in the Senate to reducing the threat \nof nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n  It has been my distinct pleasure to watch both of these fine Senators \nwork tirelessly on behalf of the United States. I congratulate both of \nthem on their service and on reaching this impressive milestone.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the majority leader has indicated, \ntwo legislative milestones have been reached in the Senate today by two \ndedicated and long-serving Senators who happen to be from different \nsides of the aisle. I pay tribute to the senior Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Leahy, for casting his 14,000th vote, and to the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, Mr. Lugar, for casting his 13,000th vote.\n  To put these milestones in perspective:\n  Senator Leahy, a Member of the Senate since 1975, ranks sixth on the \nall-time rollcall vote list, most recently passing former Senator Pete \nDomenici. Senator Lugar, who was first elected to the Senate 2 years \nlater, in 1976, ranks tenth on the all-time list and most recently \npassed our former colleague and current occupant of the chair, Vice \nPresident Joe Biden. This is not only a remarkable accomplishment of \nlongevity for both men, it is also an opportunity for their colleagues \nto honor them for their decades of service to the people of Indiana and \nof Vermont.\n  Senator Leahy isn't just the second most senior Senator in this body, \nhe is also the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a senior member \nof the Agriculture and Appropriations Committees. Pat and I got to know \neach other pretty well, alternating as chairman and ranking member of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations for over a \ndecade. Somehow he finds time to also be an amateur photographer and to \nhave a blossoming movie career. I have no doubt he gives most of the \ncredit, of course, to Marcelle, his wife, with whom he will be \ncelebrating a far more important milestone in the next month, their \n50th wedding anniversary. So congratulations to Pat on both counts.\n  As for our friend Senator Dick Lugar, I have known him going back to \nmy first Senate campaign. He is the longest serving Member of Congress \nin Indiana history and one of America's most widely respected voices on \nforeign policy. In a career filled with many achievements and \nmilestones, Senator Lugar's leadership on the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program is, in my opinion, his greatest and most \nlasting achievement with the American people--not only for the American \npeople and for the security of this country, but for the promotion of \npeace throughout the world. Because of Senator Lugar's work, thousands \nof nuclear warheads have been dismantled and the world is, indeed, a \nsafer place.\n  Like Senator Leahy, I know Senator Lugar would say none of this would \nhave been possible without the love and support of his wife of 55 \nyears, Charlene. So I congratulate them both on this milestone and I \njoin my colleagues in once again paying tribute to\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\nour two colleagues and this signature achievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my longtime friend \nand colleague from Vermont, Senator Patrick Leahy, on the occasion of \nhis 14,000th vote. That is a lot of votes. In the long history of our \nRepublic, only six Senators have achieved that milestone before him.\n  Born in Montpelier, VT, our State's capital, educated at St. \nMichael's High School in Montpelier, St. Michael's College in \nColchester, VT, and Georgetown University Law School, Senator Leahy was \nfirst elected to the Senate in 1974--the first and, to this date, only \nDemocrat elected to the Senate from Vermont. I remember that campaign \nvery well because I was in it, and Pat Leahy got a lot more votes than \nI did.\n  Before assuming the office of U.S. Senator, Pat Leahy gained a \nnational reputation for law enforcement during his 8 years as State's \nattorney in Chittenden County--the State's largest county.\n  Over his 3\\1/2\\ decades here in the Senate, Patrick Leahy has many \nremarkable achievements. Let me just mention a few.\n  Cognizant of the suffering and tragedy that landmines cause for \ncivilian populations, Patrick Leahy has led, in this body and, in fact, \nthe entire U.S. Government, the campaign to end the production and use \nof antipersonnel landmines. Many lives and limbs have been saved as a \nresult of Senator Leahy's efforts.\n  With similar commitment and passion, as chair of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Patrick Leahy has led the effort to insist on fairness at \nthe Department of Justice, to support free speech and a free press, and \nto require and maintain openness and transparency in government. At a \ntime of major infringements on privacy rights in this country from both \nthe private sector and the government, Pat Leahy has been a strong \nchampion of civil liberties and the Constitution of the United States.\n  Senator Leahy, reflecting Vermont's very strong consciousness \nregarding the need to preserve our environment, has for many years been \na champion of environmental protection and has been named over and over \none of the top environmental legislators by the Nation's foremost \nconservation organizations. He has been, as Vermonters well know, a \nspecial champion in preserving the high quality of water in Lake \nChamplain, our beautiful lake, perhaps the most valuable natural \nresource we have in our State.\n  Today, I congratulate, on behalf of the people of the State of \nVermont, Senator Patrick Leahy on the occasion of his 14,000th vote and \nlook forward to working with him as closely in the future as we have \nworked in the past.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the well-\ndeserved chorus of congratulations for our colleague and friend from \nVermont.\n  Senator Patrick Leahy is the last remaining member of a historic \nclass in the U.S. Senate, the class of 1974, better known as the \n``Watergate babies.'' And he has been making history ever since.\n  Casting 14,000 votes in the Senate is kind of like joining the 3,000 \nHit Club in baseball. It is an achievement many dream of but few \nactually reach.\n  More important than the number of votes Senator Leahy has cast, \nhowever, is the wisdom and courage of his voting record.\n  It has been my privilege to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor more than 15 years. During that time Senator Leahy has been either \nour committee chairman or its ranking member.\n  I have the greatest respect for Patrick Leahy's fidelity to the rule \nof law and his determined efforts to safeguard the independence and \nintegrity of America's Federal courts. He is a champion of human rights \nat home and abroad.\n  I congratulate him on this milestone. As an old friend of his might \nsay, just keep truckin' on.\n  Mr. President, I also want to congratulate another friend and \ncolleague, Senator Richard Lugar from Indiana.\n  Senator Lugar knows that wisdom is not the exclusive property of any \none political party.\n  He bases his political decisions not on polls or the passions of the \nday but on what his conscience and his own careful study tells him is \nright.\n  Two years ago, Dick Lugar joined me in asking the President not to \ndeport young people who were brought to this country at a young age by \ntheir parents.\n  When the DREAM Act was on the Senate floor a year and a half ago, \nSenator Lugar was one of three Republicans who voted in support.\n  He coauthored the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act--one of \nthe most visionary and courageous bipartisan achievements in recent \ntime.\n  His work on the Global Fund has helped the United States meet its \ncommitment to the single most powerful tool in the fight against AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria.\n  Senator Lugar has served six terms in the Senate, and he will be \nmissed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank, of course, the majority \nleader and the Republican leader, friends with whom I have served for \nyears--and we have always been friends--for their kind words.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Vermont, another dear friend. Our \ncareers have paralleled in many areas--from the time he was the mayor \nof our largest city, to being our lone Representative in the House of \nRepresentatives, to now being my partner here in the Senate.\n  Of course, as to my dear friend Dick Lugar, we have worked together \nso many times. We alternated between being the chair and ranking member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee. He did a great deal on the \nenvironment, passed an organic farm bill, did so many things, all the \ntime when he was doing his invaluable work to protect our Nation \nagainst nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I value the Senate. I love the Senate. It has been a \nmajor part of my life. But I was glad to hear both leaders mention the \ntrue love of my life, my wife of nearly 50 years. There is nothing I \nhave accomplished throughout my whole public career that I could have \ndone without Marcelle's help. Not only has she raised three wonderful \nchildren and is helping to raise five wonderful grandchildren, every \nsingle day I have been a better person because of her. When we first \nstarted the race for the Senate in 1974, few people said I could win. \nMarcelle and I campaigned together. She always said I could. And we \ndid.\n  None of us know how long we might be in the Senate, but I have valued \nevery single moment here, and I will value every single moment as long \nas I am here.\n  I am glad Marcelle is here. She is joined by my dear and valuable \nfriend Peter Welch, our Congressman from Vermont, and his wife \nMargaret, but also so many members of my staff. I feel that I have been \nblessed with the finest staff any Senator has ever had. Again, they are \nthe ones every day who, if I look good and do something well on this \nfloor, I give the credit. I joke that I am a constitutional impediment \nto them totally running everything. But thank goodness they are there. \nI will speak more about this at another time.\n  But it is a special feeling to be here with my friend Dick Lugar, to \nhear the kinds words of my friend and colleague Bernie Sanders, to know \nthat the other Member of our delegation--we are a huge delegation; all \nthree Members--Peter Welch is here. But especially I acknowledge \nMarcelle and Kevin, Alicia, and Mark, and their families. How wonderful \nit is to be here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, what a pleasure it is to be with my \ncolleague Pat Leahy on this very special day. It was a great \ncoincidence that the 13,000th vote and the 14,000th vote should occur \nthis afternoon, but what a joyous moment to be with my friend on this \nexperience.\n  I once again thank the leader Mitch McConnell of our party and Harry \nReid the majority leader of the Senate for their very generous remarks \nabout both Pat and me.\n  I join Pat in extolling the virtues of those who have made such a \ndifference in our lives. My wife Charlene, our 4\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\nsons, our 13 grandchildren, our great-grandchildren--these are very \nprecious people who have made such a difference in my life and made it \npossible for me to have good health and spirits throughout all this \ntime and to enjoy thoroughly this experience.\n  I would just add to the remarks of my colleague that tomorrow we hope \nto have a little celebration in the Agriculture Committee room.\n  Long ago, at the beginning of our careers, Pat and I were situated at \nthe end of the long table that stretched the length of the Agriculture \nCommittee room. Our chairman, Herman Talmadge of Georgia, was at one \nend with Senator Jim Eastland of Mississippi. I am not certain what the \nrules of the Senate were at that time, but I recall that frequently \nboth were enveloped in smoke at the end of the room, and it seemed to \nme that they were, in fact, developing whatever the policy was going to \nbe and making decisions. As a matter of fact, sometimes they simply \narose, and Pat and I were left to ponder really what had occurred.\n  So it was appropriate that our two portraits should be put at the end \nof the table, at the entry to the Agriculture Committee room, where we \nonce sat as the most junior members and eventually ascended to the \nchairmanship, having great experiences together in farm policy and the \nability to help feed the world.\n  I am grateful, likewise, for Vice President Biden's presence today \nbecause he was a wonderful partner in the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor so many years. I was not aware that the Vice President would be in \nthe chair. I told him I was somewhat embarrassed because my 13,000th \nvote finally eclipsed his votes, and he ranks now 11th. Joe was aware \nof that. He had in the chair today the rankings 1 through 11. So we are \nsort of all situated and still love each other in the process.\n  I thank all Senators for the honor that has been accorded for this \nopportunity to address the body. This has been a great experience of my \nlife, and this has been a very special moment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my colleagues, \nSenator Leahy and Senator Lugar, for this achievement and thank them \nfor their service to the country.\n  I also appreciate the willingness of Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman to allow me to speak for a few minutes before we return to \nthe business at hand--legislation regarding cybersecurity.\n\n\n                        USDA Employee Newsletter\n\n  I want to point out to my colleagues--and perhaps to the Department \nof Agriculture--something I saw today that caught my attention. In \nfact, it is amazing to me, this development.\n  This is the Department of Agriculture's--the USDA--employee \nnewsletter I hold in my hand. In that newsletter, it says the \nfollowing--it has a section in the newsletter that says ``Food Services \nUpdate.'' Well, the Department of Agriculture, which, in my view, has a \nserious and significant responsibility to promote agriculture, says \nthis in their own newsletter:\n\n       One simple way to reduce your environmental impact while \n     dining at our cafeterias is to participate in the ``Meatless \n     Monday''. . . .\n\n  ``Meatless Monday.''\n\n       This effort . . . encourages people not to eat meat on \n     Mondays. . . .\n       How will going meatless one day of the week help the \n     environment? The production of meat, especially beef (and \n     dairy as well) has a large environmental impact. According to \n     the U.N.--\n\n  ``According to the U.N.''--\n\n     animal agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gases and \n     climate change. It also wastes resources. It takes 7,000 kg \n     of grain to make 1,000 kg of beef. In addition, beef \n     production requires a lot of water, fertilizer, fossil fuels, \n     and pesticides. In addition there are many health concerns \n     related to the excessive consumption of meat. While a \n     vegetarian diet could have a beneficial impact on a person's \n     health and the environment, many people are not ready to make \n     that commitment. Because Meatless Monday involves only one \n     day a week, it is a small change that could produce big \n     results.\n\n  Our own Department of Agriculture, again, at least from my \nperspective--and we ought to look at what the mission of the Department \nAgriculture is, and I think it will reflect what I am saying--is to \npromote agriculture, to help those who every day go to work to produce \nfood, fiber, and fuel for this country and the world. Yet our own \nDepartment of Agriculture is encouraging people not to eat meat and \nindicates--from these statements, again, from their newsletter--that \n``the USDA Headquarters Food Operations are a high profile opportunity \nto demonstrate USDA's commitment to USDA mission and initiatives.''\n  So it would not surprise me if what you see is that the Department of \nAgriculture somehow loses this newsletter. But it is posted on their \nWeb site, and I would encourage Secretary Vilsack and the officials at \nthe Department of Agriculture to rethink their role in discouraging \nsomething that is so vital to the U.S. economy and something so \nimportant to the Kansas economy.\n  We are a beef-producing State, and it generates significant revenue \nfor Kansas farmers and ranchers and is one of the items that improve \nour balance of trade, as we export meat and beef around the world. Yet \nour own Department of Agriculture encourages people not to consume \nmeat.\n  I think I will have more to say about this topic, but for the moment, \nin light of the kindness that was extended to me by the Senators, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas. \nNormally, when you yield the floor to a colleague in the Senate, you \nare not sure how long they are going to speak. So he not only kept his \nword to speak for less than 3 minutes, he proved that he continues to \nhave some lingering holdover reflexes from his service in the House of \nRepresentatives, where they always speak shorter than we do.\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 3414.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support that motion to proceed to S. 3414, \nwhich is the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, and I do so with the hope and \nrequest that all of our colleagues will vote yes on this motion to \nproceed so we can begin what I think is a crucial debate about how best \nto protect our national and economic security in this wired world where \nthreats increasingly--and thefts--come not from land, sea, or sky, but \nfrom invisible strings of ones and zeros traveling through cyberspace.\n  This bill has been a long time in coming to the floor. A lot of work \nhas been done on it. But I must say, I have a sense of confidence, \ncertainly, about the inclination of the overwhelming majority of \nMembers of the Senate to vote to proceed to this matter because I think \neveryone in the Chamber understands what we are dealing with is not a \nproblem that is speculative or theoretical.\n  Anybody who has spent any time not even studying the classified \nmaterials on this but just reading the newspaper, following the media, \nknows that America is daily under constant cyber attack and cyber \ntheft. The commander of Cyber Command, GEN Keith Alexander, said \nrecently in a speech that cyber theft represented the largest transfer \nof wealth in human history.\n  That is stealing of industrial secrets and moving money from bank \naccounts. I believe he said it was as if we were having our future \nstolen from us. It is all happening over cyberspace. Obviously, \nenemies--both nation states, nonstate actors such as terrorist groups, \norganized criminal gangs, and just plain hackers--are finding ways to \npenetrate the cyber systems on which our society depends, the cyber \nsystems that control critical infrastructure: electric grid, \ntransportation system, the whole financial system, the dams that hold \nback water, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  This bill is not a solution in search of a problem. It is a problem \nthat is real and cries out for the solution this bill would provide. \nThere are some controversial parts of the bill. There has been some \nspirited debate both in committee and in the public media about it. \nThere is a competing bill introduced by some of our colleagues called \nSECURE IT.\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n  But I want to report to the Chamber and to the public that there was \na significant breakthrough today where the lead cosponsors of our bill, \nSenators Collins, Rockefeller, Feinstein, Carper, and I met with the \nlead cosponsors of the other bill, Senators Chambliss, McCain, and \nHutchison, along with a group of Senators led by Senator Kyl and \nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, who, along with Senator Coons, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Coats, and others who have been working very hard to \ncreate common ground because they recognize the urgency of this \nchallenge.\n  Well, this is good news. We got a motion to proceed, which, in the \ncurrent schedule, will come up on Friday. I think it would send a \nmessage of real encouragement to the public that we can still get \ntogether across party lines on matters of urgent national security if \nwe adopted that motion to proceed overwhelmingly, particularly now that \nwe are engaged in dialogue with the leaders of these main bills and \npeople trying to bridge gaps that began to meet today. We will meet \nagain tomorrow morning. So I think we have a process going that can \nlead us to a very significant national security accomplishment.\n  I am going to yield at this time to Senator Rockefeller, the chair of \nthe Commerce Committee, whose committee produced a bill of its own. He \nworked very closely with Senator Collins and me to blend our bills. We \ndid. Senator Feinstein came along with her chairmanship of the \nIntelligence Committee of the Senate, did some tremendous work on the \ninformation-sharing provision, title VII of the bill before us.\n  I know Senator Rockefeller has another engagement which he has to go \nto. So I am going to yield to him for his opening statement. Then \nSenator Collins, who, as always, for all these years, has been just the \nmost steadfast, constructive, sturdy, reliable, creative partner in \nworking on this bill. It gives me confidence that together we will see \nit to success next week. So I will now yield to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, who is a real expert on this subject \nand has contributed enormously to the bill that is pending before the \nSenate now.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. My dear colleague, I would feel better if the \nSenator from Maine spoke before I did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, that is very kind of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. My statement is quite lengthy. So if the Senator from \nWest Virginia, in light of his commitment, would like to precede me, I \nwould be more than happy to have him do so. I would encourage him to go \nahead. Then the Senator from Connecticut has graciously said he would \nallow me to go next. We are all so nice around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish all negotiations proceeded \nwith such comity. For those of us who have lived long enough, we have \nseen, obviously, enormous transition. We are in a totally new age.\n  Today, as we begin our debate, over 200 billion e-mails will be sent \naround the world to every continent. Google, a company that really is \njust 10 years old, will process over 1 billion searches and stream more \nthan 2 billion videos today. And in the next minute, about 36,000 \ntweets will be posted on Twitter. So we are now connected as we never \nhave been before.\n  Here in the United States we have been the leader in both its \ndevelopment and adoption of the initial structure. Actually, it is \ninteresting because it was created by our own government. The open \nnature of the Internet can be traced back to our initial decision in \nthe government to relinquish control of what we had invented, so to \nspeak. So to this day our Nation remains a leader in using the \nInternet's innovation and growth.\n  In just over a decade, we have digitized and networked our entire \neconomy and our entire way of life. Every one of our most critical \nsystems now relies upon these interconnected networks: power grids, \ntransportation systems, gas pipelines, telecommunications. They all \nrely on networks to function. They all rely on the Internet. Yet the \nramifications of this new era remain poorly understood by many; \nfrankly, by most.\n  History teaches us that disruptive technological advancements can \nbring about both opportunities and also dangers. We cannot let our \nexuberance blind us from this simple truth. We cannot ignore the part \nof the equation in this happy adventure of ours that is unpleasant. \nThis is it. These technological advances can compromise our national \nsecurity and indeed are already doing so.\n\n  The connectivity brought about by the Internet and the new ability to \naccess anything, combined with our decision as a country to put \neverything we hold dear on the Internet, means we are now vulnerable in \nways that were unfathomable just a few years ago. Yes, we rushed to \ndigitize and connect every aspect of the American economy and way of \nlife. We have spent little time focusing on what this actually means \nwith respect to our security. We have left ourselves extraordinarily \nvulnerable.\n  The consequences, as pointed out by the Senator from Connecticut, are \ndevastating. Our intellectual property is our greatest asset as a \nnation. It is our greatest advantage in the world. It is currently \nbeing pilfered and stolen because it is connected to the Internet and \ntherefore is unsecure.\n  Well, we did not think about that, did we? Experts have called this, \nas the Senator from Connecticut said, the greatest transfer of wealth \nin the history of the world. That is a dramatic statement, but it is \njust an absolute terrifying fact--terrifying fact.\n  Our most important personal information, including our credit card \nnumbers, our financial data is now accessible via the Internet and is \nstolen through data breaches that occur all the time.\n  Most importantly, our critical infrastructure: water facilities and \ngas pipelines to our electric power grid and communications networks \nare now vulnerable to cyber attacks, and they are happening. Many of \nthose systems were designed before the Internet. In fact, virtually all \nof these systems were designed before the Internet came about, and were \nnever intended to be connected to a network. Yet they are. Therefore, \nthey are unsecure.\n  If these systems are exploited via cyber vulnerabilities, lives could \nbe lost. Yes, there is lots of other things that could happen before \nthat, but this has the potential to be far greater than even the \ntragedy of 9/11.\n  In recent months we have learned that hackers penetrated the networks \nof companies that control our Nation's pipelines--gas pipelines. There \nhave been attempts to penetrate the networks of companies that run \nnuclear power plants. Last year, a foreign computer hacker showed that \nhe could access the control systems of a water facility in Texas with \nease. He accomplished this task in minutes at a computer thousands of \nmiles away.\n  Our critical infrastructure is being targeted, and it is vulnerable. \nThe major general of our National Guard, James Hoyer, recently shared a \nfrightening story with me. He was talking about his work on \ncybersecurity. He said in West Virginia, he learned that a critical \ninfrastructure facility in the State--critical infrastructure facility; \nthat means a really important one--its engineers were being allowed to \noperate control systems on their home computers. How naive. But who \nwould know? Who would have guessed?\n  The Internet and what it has done for our country is unparalleled, \nbut everything we have accomplished in this Internet age is now \nvulnerable and, in starker terms, undoable. We have built a castle in \nthe sand and the tide is approaching. Our systems are too fragile, too \ncritical, and too vulnerable. It is a recipe for disaster. It is time \nto do something about it before it is too late.\n  We have all known about the seriousness of our cyber situation for \nyears. Our national security experts know it. Our law enforcement \nexperts know it. And there is a bipartisan agreement that something \nneeds to be done. But that does not tell us a lot, to make that \nstatement in the Senate. In my capacity both as the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and former chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and still on that committee, I have become very familiar \nwith the threat posed by cybersecurity. I have been working with my \ncolleagues to address it.\n  For the past 3 years, a number of us have been working with both \nRepublican and Democratic Senators to find\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\ncommon ground on these issues so we can have a bill to get control of \nthis. We have held hearings, we have held markups, we have held \ncountless meetings with the private sector and interest groups. It is \nan endless, endless process, and the staff does four times as much.\n  We have been very patient in working to find a compromise. Now is the \ntime to make that compromise happen. It will not happen today; it could \nhappen in the next several days. We know what we need to do, I do \nbelieve. So here is what we know right now: The Federal Government \nneeds to do a better job of protecting its own networks.\n  Companies control most of our Nation's critical infrastructure, and \nthey need to do a better job of eliminating cyber vulnerabilities in \ntheir systems. There are no clear lines in the authorities and \nresponsibilities in the Federal Government for cybersecurity, which \nwill cause confusion in the event of a cyber catastrophe.\n  The private sector and the Federal Government need to be able to \nshare information about cyber threats. Over the last year, the \ncommittees of jurisdiction in the Senate have worked together. The \ncommittees have worked together to finalize legislation that addresses \neach of those concerns.\n  Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, Collins, and I have made it a \npriority, as well as others, to finish this work together and with a \nbroader group. We believe every Member of this body will be able to \nsupport some kind of legislation. We have put legislation before the \nSenate, but it is subject to change. In fact, it may be in the process \nof changing in a good sense because we held a long meeting this \nmorning. We are going to have another one tomorrow, perhaps on a daily \nbasis.\n  The basic thing we have done is that we took a more regulated \napproach. In other words, we have to do this. This is what we should \ndo. At one level we should do it.\n  We have taken that away, and we have made it much more voluntary. We \nmade it a voluntary approach. Some say that is worse than no bill at \nall, to which I reply, no, if we incent people properly with a \nvoluntary approach, the pressure to do something is greater, \nparticularly if they have to submit to audits as to the standards of \nwork they are doing to protect themselves.\n  There are a variety of ways to do this. We could have a council--a \nDHS council that would decide what the standards should be. There was \ntalk this morning about having a convening session called by NIST, \nNational Institute of Science and Technology--which is very good at \nthis stuff--convene the private sector and have those two work out a \nsystem. NIST has no regulatory authority, so they could let them come \nup with their suggestions. Then there was an idea that maybe DHS could \nlook at that and certify it, stamp it with approval, on basic critical \ninfrastructure. Of course, we would have to pick out which was the \ncritical infrastructure because there is lots of it. Which one would be \nsubject to special regard is something we would still have to work out.\n  This bill, however it works so far, and I think in the future, is \nbipartisan. There is some sort of tribulation about let's let bygones \nbe bygones, we have all given up and compromised, to which my point of \nview is some of us have been working on this for a very long time, and \nwe have been joined by others with good ideas. But don't close off the \npast or the future.\n  The bill will be bipartisan. It will incorporate the good ideas and \nsuggestions that have been made by many colleagues. We have settled on \na plan that creates no new bureaucracy. However that plan forms, it \nwill have no new bureaucracies or heavy-handed regulation. That is \nalready understood. It is premised on companies taking responsibility \nfor securing their own networks, with government assistance where \nnecessary. This bill represents a compromise, and it is time to move \nforward with it.\n  I think, in closing, back to the year 2000 and 2001. I was on the \nIntelligence Committee at the time of 9/11. The fact is, we get reports \non all this which never surfaced, but we know the facts. There were \nsigns of people moving around the country, and they weren't just sort \nof haphazardly moving around. In San Diego, a certain safe house there \nwould appear and people were coming and going from there. Then there \nwas the FBI office in Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case, and the FBI \noffice in Minneapolis reported to the FBI Osama bin Laden office--and \nperhaps that didn't happen.\n  We all knew something was new and that the world was getting \ndifferent. We knew the danger could come upon us. Our intelligence and \nnational security leadership took these matters very seriously. \nHowever, they did not take it seriously enough, nor did we. So then it \nwas too late and 9/11 happened, and the world changed forever.\n  Today, we have a new set of warnings flashing before us with a wide \nrange of challenges to our security and safety and we once again face a \nchoice: Act now and put in place safeguards to protect this country and \nour people or act later when it is too late. Obviously, the conclusion \nis we must act now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his comments. He has worked so hard on this issue for many \nyears but, in particular, the past 3 years, as he and the chair of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein, have worked with \nSenator Lieberman and me.\n  I rise this evening to urge our colleagues to vote to begin the \ndebate on the Cyber Security Act of 2012. Senator Lieberman and I have \nintroduced this bill along with our colleagues Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Feinstein, and Senator Carper. It has been a great pleasure to \nwork with all of them--and work we have--in numerous sessions over \nliterally a period of years, as we have attempted to merge the bills \nthat were reported by the Commerce Committee and the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  Of course, it is always a great pleasure to once again work with my \ndear friend the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator \nLieberman, as we bring forth yet another bipartisan bill to the Chamber \nfor its consideration.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller has warned that the cyber threat will \nsoon equal or surpass the threat from terrorism. He has argued that we \nshould be addressing the cyber threat with the same kind of intensity \nwe have applied to the terrorist threat. This vital legislation would \nprovide the Federal Government and the private sector with the tools \nneeded to help protect our country from the growing cyber threat. It \nwould promote information sharing, improve the security of the Federal \nGovernment's own networks, enhance research and development programs \nand, most important of all, it would help to better secure our Nation's \nmost critical infrastructure from cyber attack. These are the \npowerplants, the pipelines, the water treatment facilities, the \nelectrical grid, the transportation systems, and the financial networks \nupon which Americans rely each and every day.\n  The fact is the computerized industrial controls that open and close \nthe valves and switches in our infrastructure are particularly \nvulnerable to cyber attack. Indeed, the Internet is under constant \nsiege on all fronts by nations such as China, Russia, and Iran, by \ntransnational criminals, by terrorist groups, by activists, and by \npersistent hackers. That is why our Nation's top national security and \nhomeland security leaders from the current and former administrations \nhave urged us to take legislative action to address this unacceptable \nrisk to both our national security and our economic prosperity.\n  Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta described our bill \nas ``essential to addressing our Nation's critical infrastructure and \nnetwork cyber security vulnerabilities, both of which pose serious \nnational and economic security risks to our Nation.''\n  Just last month, the Secretary reiterated his call for Congress to \npass our bill and stress the potential for a cyber attack to cripple \nour critical infrastructure in a way that would virtually paralyze this \ncountry.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, has also \nsounded the alarm. He has described the cyber threat as a ``profound \nthreat to this country, to its future, its economy and its very \nbeing.''\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\n  The warnings have not been confined to officials in the Obama \nadministration. Former national security officials, including Michael \nChertoff, Michael McConnell, Paul Wolfowitz, Michael Hayden have \nwritten that the cyber threat ``is imminent and . . . represents one of \nthe most serious challenges to our national security since the onset of \nthe nuclear age sixty years ago.'' They have urged us to protect the \n``infrastructure that controls our electricity, water and sewer, \nnuclear plants, communications backbone, energy pipelines, and \nfinancial networks'' with appropriate cyber security standards.\n  Similarly, in a letter to our colleague, Senator John McCain, GEN \nKeith Alexander, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the Director \nof the National Security Agency, wrote:\n\n       Given DOD reliance on certain core critical infrastructure \n     to execute its mission, as well as the importance of the \n     Nation's critical infrastructure to our national and economic \n     security overall, legislation is also needed to ensure that \n     infrastructure is sufficiently hardened and resilient.\n\n  The threats to our infrastructure are not hypothetical; they are \nalready occurring. For example, while many of the details are \nclassified, we know multiple natural gas pipeline companies have been \nthe target of a sophisticated cyber intrusion campaign that has been \nongoing since December of last year.\n  The cyber threat to our critical infrastructure is also escalating in \nits frequency and severity. According to DHS's Industrial Control \nSystems Cyber Emergency Response Team, last year, almost 200 cyber \nintrusions were reported by critical infrastructure owners and \noperators. That is nearly a 400-percent increase from the previous \nyear, and these are only the intrusions that have been reported to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Many go unreported and, even worse, \nmany owners are not even aware their systems have been compromised.\n  What would a successful cyber attack on our critical infrastructure \nlook like? We have just seen recently what a serious storm that leaves \nmore than 1 million people without power can cause: the loss of life, \nthe blow to economic activity, the hardship for the elderly, the \nnonworking traffic lights that resulted in accidents. Multiply that \nimpact many times over if there were a sustained cyber attack that \ndeliberately knocked out our electric grid.\n  The threat is not just to our national security but also to our \neconomic edge, to our competitiveness. The rampant cyber theft \ntargeting the United States by countries such as China has led to the \n``greatest transfer of wealth in history,'' according to General \nAlexander. You have heard many of us use his quote. Let me give some \nspecifics of his estimates. He believes American companies have lost \nabout $250 billion a year through intellectual property theft, $114 \nbillion to theft through cyber crime, and another $274 billion in \ndowntime the thefts have caused.\n  In their op-ed earlier this year, former DNI McConnell, former \nHomeland Security Secretary Chertoff, and former Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Bill Lynn warned that the cost of cyber espionage and theft \n``easily means billions of dollars and millions of jobs.'' The threat \nof a cyber attack doesn't just go to our national security, critical \nthough that is. It also directly is a threat to America's ability to \ncompete, to our economic edge.\n\n  In recent years, a growing number of U.S. firms, including \nsophisticated firms such as Google, Adobe, Lockheed Martin, RSA, Sony, \nNASDAQ, and many others have been hacked by malicious actors. Earlier \nthis month, the security firm McAfee released a report on a highly \nsophisticated cyber intrusion dubbed ``Operation High Roller,'' which \nhas attempted to steal more than $78 million in fraudulent financial \ntransfers at at least 60 different financial institutions.\n  Trade associations have been attacked too. The Chamber of Commerce \nwas the victim of a cyber attack for many months, blissfully unaware \nuntil informed by the FBI that its membership data was being stolen. \nThe evidence of our cybersecurity vulnerability is overwhelming. It \ncompels us to act.\n  Yesterday 18 experts in national security strongly endorsed the \nrevised legislation we have introduced. The Aspen Homeland Security \nGroup, made up of officials from both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations and chaired by former Secretary Chertoff and former \nCongresswoman Jane Harman, urged the Senate to adopt a program of \nvoluntary cybersecurity standards and strong positive incentives for \ncritical infrastructure to implement those standards. This group called \nfor action on our bill, saying:\n\n       The country is already being hurt by foreign cyber \n     intrusions, and the possibility of a devastating cyber attack \n     is real. Congress must act now.\n\n  Mr. President, you have heard some Members of this body say that \nsomehow this process has been rushed or the bill inadequately \nconsidered. Nothing could be further from the truth. Since 2005--7 \nyears ago--our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nalone has held 10 hearings on cybersecurity. Other Senate committees \nhave also held hearings, for a total of 25 hearings since 2009, not to \nmention numerous briefings the Presiding Officer and Senator Mikulski \nof Maryland have helped to convene--classified briefings--for any \nMember to attend.\n  In 2010, Chairman Lieberman, Senator Carper, and I introduced our \ncybersecurity bill, which was reported by our committee later that same \nyear. As I indicated, we have been working with Chairman Rockefeller to \nmerge our bill with legislation he has championed, which was reported \nby the Commerce Committee. We have also worked very closely with \nSenator Feinstein, an expert on information sharing.\n  The bill we are urging our colleagues to proceed to today is the \nproduct of these efforts. It also incorporates substantial changes \nbased on the feedback from the private sector, our colleagues, and the \nadministration.\n  This new bill is a good-faith effort to address the concerns raised \nby Members on both sides of the aisle by establishing a framework that \nrelies upon the expertise of government and the innovation of the \nprivate sector. It improves privacy protections that Americans expect \nfrom their government.\n  It also reflects many concepts proposed by Senators Kyl, Whitehouse--\nthe Presiding Officer--Blunt, Coats, Graham, Mikulski, Blumenthal, and \nCoons. We have revised our bill in a very substantial way. We have \nabandoned the approach--which I still believe to be a good idea--of \nmandatory standards and, instead, have adopted a voluntary approach to \nstandards. This is a significant change from our initial bill, and it \nwas one that was promoted by Senator Kyl's and Senator Whitehouse's \ngroup.\n  The new version encourages owners of critical infrastructure to \nvoluntarily adopt the cybersecurity practices in exchange for various \nincentives for entities complying with these best practices. This was \nalso one of the primary recommendations of the House Republican \nCybersecurity Task Force.\n  These incentives include liability protection against punitive \ndamages. I, for one, am open to making that a more robust liability \nprotection. They include the opportunity to receive expedited security \nclearances, eligibility for prioritized technical assistance from the \ngovernment, and access to timely cyber threat information held by the \ngovernment.\n  These major changes from the approach we initially proposed \ndemonstrate our willingness to adopt alternatives recommended in good \nfaith by our colleagues, and we are still open to changes to the bill.\n  Our bill also includes strong information-sharing provisions that \npromote voluntary information sharing within the private sector and the \ngovernment, while ensuring that privacy and civil liberties are \nprotected. And again, we incorporated some suggestions from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to strengthen these provisions.\n  To be sure, more information sharing is essential to improving our \nunderstanding of the risks and threats. But let us be clear: More \ninformation sharing, while absolutely essential, is not sufficient to \nensure our Nation's vital, critical infrastructure is protected. If you \nsurvey the vast majority of experts in this field, they will tell you \nthat to pass a bill that only provides for more information sharing \ndoes not begin to accomplish the job that must be done\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nto better secure our Nation from this threat.\n  With 85 percent of our Nation's critical infrastructure owned by the \nprivate sector, government obviously must work with the private sector. \nOur bill--both our original bill and our revised bill--has always \nenvisioned a partnership between government and the private sector. We \nhave a very stringent definition of what constitutes covered critical \ninfrastructure. It is infrastructure whose disruption could result in \ntruly catastrophic consequences.\n  What do I mean by that? I am talking about mass casualties or mass \nevacuations or severe degradation of our national security or a serious \nblow to our economy. That is the kind of disruption we are talking \nabout. Obviously those who have claimed that every company or every \npart of our infrastructure is going to be considered as critical \ninfrastructure have not read the definition in our bill.\n  But here is more evidence of why we must act. A study done in 2011 by \nthe computer security firm McAfee and CSIS revealed that approximately \n40 percent of the companies surveyed--the critical infrastructure \ncompanies--were not regularly patching and updating their software, \ndespite the fact these safeguards are among the most basic and widely \nknown cybersecurity risk mitigation practices. We have even found \nreports where companies haven't bothered to change the default password \nthat came with the industrial control software. In many cases, the \ncontrol devices used to operate our Nation's most critical \ninfrastructure are inherently insecure.\n\n  A Washington Post special report last month noted that security \nresearchers found six out of seven control system devices are ``riddled \nwith hardware and software flaws,'' and that ``some included back doors \nthat enabled hackers to download passwords or sidestep security \ncompletely.''\n  Another front-page story in the Post earlier this month highlighted \nthe fact that as technological advances have allowed everyone from \nplant managers to hospital nurses to control their systems remotely via \nthe Internet, these vital systems have become even more vulnerable to \ncyber attacks. To prove the point, the story described how a security \nresearcher was able to easily steal passwords from a provider that \nconnects millions of these systems to the Internet.\n  These examples illustrate that far too many critical infrastructure \nowners are not taking even the most basic measures to protect their \nsystems, and this is simply dangerous and unacceptable to the security \nof our country. These basic practices need not be expensive. In most \ncases, they are not expensive. And I will tell you, they are a lot less \ncostly than the consequences of a breach, not to mention a major cyber \nattack.\n  A recent report by Verizon, the Secret Service, and other \ninternational law enforcement agencies analyzed 855 data breaches and \nfound that 96 were not difficult to pull off and 97 percent of them \ncould have been prevented through fairly simple and inexpensive means.\n  The point is, we must act, and we must act now. We cannot afford to \nwait for a cyber 9/11 before taking action on this legislation.\n  In all the years I have been working to identify vulnerabilities \nfacing our country in the area of homeland security, I cannot identify \nanother area where I believe the threat is greater and that we have \ndone less.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the wisdom of former Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff and former NSA Chief General \nHayden. They wrote the following:\n\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of ``whether'' this will happen; \n     it is a question of ``when.''\n\n  And this time all the dots have been connected. This time we know \nthat attacks are occurring against our Internet systems and cyber \nsystems each and every day. This time the warnings from all across the \nboard are loud and clear. I urge our colleagues to heed these warnings \nand to support the motion to proceed to the cybersecurity bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend, the ranking \nmember on the Homeland Security Committee, for her excellent and \nthoughtful statement. I thank Senator Rockefeller, the chair of the \nCommerce Committee, for his compelling statement on behalf of \nproceeding and, of course, on behalf of the underlying bill. I think \nthese two statements set the table for the debate that will follow in \nthe next several days.\n  Within the next day or two, certainly no later than Friday, we will \nvote on the motion to proceed to the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. I \nappeal to our colleagues to come together across party lines and vote \nto proceed, as a way of saying that we recognize exactly what Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Collins have said: We have a problem here. We \nare vulnerable to cyber attack. It is not just speculative. We are \nbeing attacked. We are being robbed every day through cyberspace. And \nwe are not adequately defended. It is as simple as that.\n  Part of the problem, as my colleagues have said, in the challenge is \nthat 80 to 85 percent of our critical infrastructure in this country is \nprivately owned. That is the American way. That is the way it ought to \nbe. But that privately owned infrastructure is vulnerable now to attack \nby our enemies, and we have to work together--public and private \nowners, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, \nAmericans all--to figure out a way to say to the private owners of \ncritical cyber infrastructure, You have got to do more to protect our \nsecurity, to protect our prosperity. And that is what this bill is all \nabout.\n  My colleagues have described the challenge, the inadequacy of the \ncurrent defenses, the work that has been done on our bill, the \ncompromises that have been made all along the way. I thank the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, \nand Senator Kyl from Arizona and the others who worked on a bipartisan \nbasis to help us find common ground.\n  This question of cybersecurity is, again, a test of whether this \ngreat deliberative body still has the capability to come together and \nsolve our Nation's most serious problems.\n  We had a couple of votes today. I suppose some people could say they \nwere show votes. I took them seriously. But they all involved the \nterrible fiscal shape our country is in, $16 trillion in national debt. \nEarlier in my life I couldn't believe we could come to this point. And \nwhy have we? Because we haven't been willing to make tough decisions. \nWe haven't been willing to work across party lines to do some things \nthat might be politically controversial to fix a problem we have. So \nthe problem gets tougher and tougher to fix. This is another one.\n  Usually, even in the most partisan and ideologically rigid times, \nwhen it comes to our national security we put our party labels aside \nand our party loyalties aside, and we have acted based on our loyalty \nto our country--to the oath of office we took to protect and defend not \nour ideology or our party but to protect and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States, our freedom. That is as much in jeopardy from cyber \nattack as any other source of threat to our country.\n  I appreciate the opening statements that have been made. I am \nactually very optimistic about the vote on the motion to proceed that \nwill occur in the next day or two, and I am increasingly hopeful we are \ngoing to pass, before we break for August, a strong cybersecurity bill. \nIt is not going to be the bill Senator Collins, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Feinstein, and I started out with. We have compromised along \nthe way.\n  I have in my office in a very prominent place a picture of two of \nConnecticut's representatives to the Constitutional Convention, Sherman \nand Ellsworth. I have it there because these two were the creators, the \nsource of the so-called Connecticut Compromise. Some people erroneously \nrefer to it as the Great Compromise. The correct title is the \nConnecticut Compromise. This was the conflict between the States that \nhad a lot of population and the smaller States, how were they going to \nbe represented in this new Congress. Sherman and Ellsworth came up with \na great compromise: We will\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nhave one body--the Senate--where every State has two representatives, \nand another body--the House--where you are represented by population.\n  I always like to say to people, the very institution we are \nprivileged to be Members of was created as a result of a compromise. \nGenerally speaking, in this Congress--which represents 310 million \npeople, extraordinarily diverse in every way--you can't succeed here, \nwe can't get things done if people say, I must get 100 percent of what \nI want on this bill or I am going to vote against it.\n  That is the way we have felt and that is why we have compromised, \nparticularly because of the urgency of the cyber threat, which is real, \npresent, and growing.\n  Senator Collins and I have felt very strongly, we want to get \nsomething started. It can't just be anything, it has to be real. S. \n3414 is real. It will be effective. The standards are no longer \nmandatory, but there are enough incentives in here. And the very fact \nthat there will be standards, private sector generated but approved by \na governmental body, I think will create tremendous inducements--yes, \nmaybe even pressure--on CEOs and private operators of critical cyber \ninfrastructure to adopt those standards and implement them in their \nbusiness or else, God forbid, in case of attack, they will be subject \nto enormous, probably a corporation-ending, liability.\n  I am very encouraged, thanks again to a lot of good work done by a \nlot of people, that we have started today, the lead sponsors of the \nother bill, SECURE IT, the lead sponsors of this bill, the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012, and the group that has been working so hard, \na bipartisan group, to bring us together. We did come together today. \nWe are going to meet again tomorrow morning, and I think we are \ninvolved in a collaborative process that will not only lead to the \npassage of cybersecurity legislation this year that will be effective \nto protect our national security and prosperity but will in its way \nprove to the American people that we are still capable here in the \nSenate of coming together across party lines to fix a problem--in this \ncase, to protect our great country.\n  With that, and knowing we will be back tomorrow, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I plan to speak on cybersecurity \ntomorrow. I thank Chairman Lieberman, Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman \nFeinstein, and Senator Collins for their work on this very important \nissue, and also all the other Senators who have worked so hard on this, \nincluding the Presiding Officer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak this evening as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering the Victims of Aurora, CO\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about loss. I know I \nspeak for all Minnesotans when I say how shocked and saddened we have \nbeen by the loss of life in Colorado. Our hearts go out to the families \nand friends of those who died, and to those who were wounded in that \nmassacre. Anyone who has watched reports can only feel outrage or \nprofound sadness.\n  So many of those who died were so young. A number died so heroically, \nshielding a loved one from the madman's bullets. So much grief, so much \nsuffering is unspeakable. The one hopeful lesson we can draw from this \ntragedy comes from the stories of courage and selflessness we have \nheard about those who were in the theater, the first responders, and \nthe outpouring from the community of Aurora and the rest of the Nation.\n  Minnesota unfortunately has also seen its share of senseless \nviolence. It is something no State is immune to. Hopefully, out of this \ntragedy we can draw lessons that will make these kinds of tragedies far \nless common.\n\n\n                         Remembering Tom Davis\n\n  Today I come to the floor to talk about a personal loss to me and to \nso many of his friends and family and fans--a Minnesotan who brought so \nmuch laughter and so much joy to his fellow Minnesotans and to millions \nand millions of Americans. My friend Tom Davis died last Thursday after \nhe was diagnosed 3 years ago with cancer.\n  I had the privilege to be Tom's comedy partner and best friend for \nover 20 years. We started working together in high school in Minnesota \nand did standup together for years, and were among two of the original \nwriters for ``Saturday Night Live.''\n  I spoke with Tom's mom Jean last Thursday, not long after Tom died. \nShe told me how fondly she remembered the laughter that came from the \nbasement when Tom and I started writing together in high school over 40 \nyears ago. That is what I remember about Tom, his laughter.\n  I last saw Tom about 2 weeks ago at his home in Hudson, NY. Dan \nAykroyd, who collaborated so often with Tom, was there too with his \nwife Donna and Tom's wife Mimi. We laughed and laughed.\n  Tom's humor was always sardonic, and as you might expect, it was a \nlittle more sardonic that day than usual. But his humor also had a \nsweetness about it. We laughed. But Tom told us that he was ready to \ngo. He faced death with great humor and courage.\n  Tom created laughter. The obituary cited Tom's body of work--some of \nit. He and Dan Aykroyd created the Coneheads. Tom was the key \ncollaborator with Bill Murray on Nick the Lounge Singer, and on and on \nand on. This started an outpouring of blogging on the Internet--people \nwriting about Tom and the laughs he brought them. I was happy to see \nhim get his due. People called him an original. He was. They called him \na brilliant comedian. He was.\n  Since last Thursday, I have been hearing from our friends and \ncolleagues, how Tom's voice was unique, how so often his stuff came \nseemingly from out of nowhere, how Tom had come up with the biggest \nlaugh of the season in the rewrite of this sketch or that one or how \nTom had been the first to nail Ed McMahon's attitude when he and I did \nKhomeini the Magnificent, and how Tom was such a loyal and generous \nfriend.\n  People would always ask me and Tom what our favorite moment was from \n``Saturday Night Live.'' We worked on so many sketches that it was \nimpossible to single anything out. Both of us would always say our \nfavorite memory was rolling on the floor--the 17th floor at 30 Rock--\nrolling on the floor, laughing at 2:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the \nmorning at something that someone wrote or at a character someone had \njust invented. This was that moment of creation. There was the laugh at \nwhatever it was that one of us had come up with, combined with the joy \nthat you knew you had something.\n  This is your job. Woody Allen once said that writing comedy is either \neasy or impossible. When it is impossible, it can be agony. When it is \neasy, when you are laughing and rolling on the floor--literally, when \nDanny, Billy, Belushi, Gilda, Dana Carvey, Jim Downey, Conan O'Brien, \nor Steve Martin or any of the many hilarious people whom we had the \nprivilege to work with would come up with something that made us \nexplode with laughter and roll there on the 17th floor, that was just \npure joy.\n  Tom was an improvisational genius. The first public stage we \nperformed at was Dudley Riggs' Brave New Workshop in Minneapolis. \nDudley's was essentially the Minneapolis version of Second City, based \non the same improvisational techniques. When Tom and I were in high \nschool, we did standup there. But while I went off to college, Tom \njoined the company at Dudley's, and when I came back, I saw that he had \nmastered improv and mastered it hilariously.\n  Now, as a writing team, Tom and I brought different strengths to our \ncraft. Sometimes we would get stuck, and Tom would find an object. The \nthird year of SNL, Tom and I were watching TV, and we saw Julia Child \ncut herself while doing a cooking segment on, I believe, the ``Today \nShow.'' So we wrote a sketch that Danny performed brilliantly that is \nnow known as ``Julia Child Bleeding to Death.'' The sketch worked so \nwell that when they installed the Julia Child exhibit at the National \nMuseum of American History, in addition to her TV kitchen set--I \nbelieve this was at her insistence because she loved it so much--they \nincluded a monitor with the sketch of her bleeding to death on \n``Saturday Night Live.''\n  When Tom and I were writing the sketch, we could not find an ending, \nand Tom found an object--the phone. The phone hanging on the wall of \nJulia Child's cooking set. I don't actually\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\nthink there was one; Tom just found it. That is something improv \nartists do when they are on the stage, they find objects to work with. \nSo Danny, as Julia Child in the sketch, is spurting blood, and Julia is \ntrying everything to explain how to make a tourniquet out of a chicken \nbone and a dish towel or how to use chicken liver as a natural \ncoagulant, and nothing is working. She is losing blood. So, in \ndesperation, she sees the phone on the wall, and turning to it, she \nsays, ``Always have the emergency number written down on the phone. Oh, \nit isn't. Well, I know it. It's 911.'' She dials 9-1-1 and realizes it \nis a prop phone and throws it down sort of in disgust and starts to get \nwoozy and rambles on about eating chopped chicken liver on Ritz \ncrackers as a child. Finally she collapses, and as she is about to die, \nshe says, ``Save the liver.''\n  It was a tour de force by Danny. When I was with Danny and Tom a \ncouple of weeks ago, we started talking about this somehow, and Danny \nsays he remembers me there under the counter pumping the blood. Only I \nwasn't the one pumping the blood; it was Tom. I remember that was \nsomething of a union issue because that is a special effect, pumping \nblood, pumping the blood to get exactly the right pressure so that \nDanny could release the spurts at precisely the right time.\n  Now, every once in a while, the special effects guy or the sound \neffects guy would let a writer do the effects because it was all about \nthe comedic timing. Also, they liked Tom. Everybody liked Tom. The \nspecial effects guy knew that Tom knew exactly what to do, and it was \nall about teamwork with Danny, who was also controlling the spurting \nwhen Tom was controlling the pressure. Man, it was hilarious.\n  Now, this is live TV. We did hundreds and hundreds of sketches \ntogether, a lot of stuff that was just so stupid that it was funny. We \njust had so much fun. Tom and I toured together all over the country. I \ntold Senator Mike Johanns, my colleague and friend from Nebraska, that \nTom and I played Chadron State twice. And last week we had a witness in \nJudiciary whom Senator Sessions introduced from Anniston, AL, where Tom \nand I played. We did a gig to six students in Huron, SD, because they \nbooked us by mistake during spring break and there were just six \nstudents there. There were five members of the basketball team who \ncouldn't afford to go back east for the break. The sixth guy had been \ngrounded because he had gotten caught smoking pot freshman year and \nthey wouldn't let him leave campus except during summer vacation. I \nthink this was his junior year. I think Tom and I played 45 States.\n  When we flew, we always booked ourselves in aisle seats across from \neach other, C and D seats, so we could talk to each other. Tom would \nalways get on first and find our row, and if there was a pretty girl in \nthe middle seat of one side, he would sit next to her, and I would sit \nnext to the fat, sweaty guy in the mesh shirt, which, by the way, I \nthink should not be allowed on planes. I plan to introduce legislation \non that.\n  This went on for years. Tom would board first, get to a row, and take \nthe aisle seat next to an attractive woman or quiet-looking, slender \nman, and I would sit next to the large loud guy who looked like he \nwanted to talk through the entire flight. I thought, what a \ncoincidence, Tom's aisle seat is always next to the more desirable \nseatmate. Finally I checked my ticket stub, and I saw that Tom had \ntaken my seat. That is when I realized he had been doing this for \nyears. He said: Yeah, I was just waiting for you to figure it out. Now, \nI really had to blame myself. Tom had played me, and it was my fault \nfor being a kind of trusting idiot.\n  Tom saved my butt on occasion. We used to go camping and fishing up \nin the Boundary Waters of the wilderness area between northern \nMinnesota and Canada. Tom was expert with a canoe, and I wasn't. I \nreally wasn't. Once, we went up there in October. It was kind of cold, \nbut we were catching a lot of walleye and having a great time. There \nwere three of us--me, Tom, and our friend Jeff Frederick. We had put in \nfor just one canoe.\n  On the third evening I decided to fish from this point near our \ncampsite on this island. I cast out and got my line caught in \nsomething, so I decided to go out alone in the canoe and untangle the \nline. So I am paddling out, and I get caught in this current and start \ngetting carried away from the island we were camped on, and I start \ncalling for help. Now, we are in the Quetico wilderness in Canada in \nOctober. We had not seen another human being in the 3 days we had been \nthere. So Tom and Jeff come running and yelling and cursing at me \nbecause if I didn't make it back with the canoe, they were pretty much \nstuck on this island for the winter, and I am probably dead because I \nhave no gear, nothing, just the paddle, which isn't doing me any good \nat this point. This is where Tom's improvisational skills came in \nreally handy because he talked me back. He was screaming and cursing, \nbut he talked me out of the current that was carrying me away to my \ncertain death, and I was able to circle back and get to the point--\nexhausted but so relieved. Maybe that is why I cut him some slack when \nhe played me on the aisle seats years later.\n\n  Now, speaking of cold, Tom and I were huge Vikings fans. We would go \nto the old Metropolitan Stadium during the Bud Grant years when Grant \nwould not allow heaters on the side lines even when it was below zero. \nI once asked Bud Grant why he did that, and he said: There are certain \nthings people can do when they are cold.\n  Tom and I were there on a very cold winter afternoon at the Vikings-\nCowboys playoff game, the one where Roger Staubach threw the Hail Mary \nthat Drew Pearson pushed off on and caught for a touchdown--and he did \npush off. Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn need to go back to the \nvideotape. Drew Pearson pushed off. It was offensive pass interference, \nand the Vikings should have won that game and gone to the Super Bowl. \nThat is how I saw it, that is how Tom saw it, and that is how the fan \nwho threw the whiskey bottle from the bleachers and knocked the ref out \nsaw it. Tom and I both saw the bottle glinting in the cold winter Sun \nas it arced from the bleachers. We were stunned when it hit the ref \nright in the forehead. That was not Minnesota nice.\n  Tom and I suffered through four Super Bowl losses and through last \nseason. As sick as he was, Tom watched our Vikings and complained \nbitterly to me on the phone later on Sunday.\n  Tom and I went to a lot of Grateful Dead shows together--more than \neven Senator Leahy. Tom and I went to a lot of New Year's Eve Dead \nshows. This year I went up to New York to celebrate New Year's with Tom \nand Mimi at their home. We knew this would probably be his last, and at \nmidnight we turned on the Dead and we danced.\n  Now, unlike me, Tom became an accomplished guitarist, and he could \nsit in with rock or blues bands. Tom was a terrible student in high \nschool, but the fact is he was a renaissance man. He loved to read \nhistory, philosophy, and fiction. He devoted a lot of his last years to \nhis art, sculpting solely from found objects from the creek that ran by \nhis house in upstate New York.\n  Tom was an original. Some time ago, Tom and I talked about writing \nsomething for this occasion, but about a year or so ago he wrote a \npiece for a literary magazine that, to me, said what needed to be said. \nIt was Tom and his take on what he was facing. It is called ``The Dark \nSide of Death.'' I decided to read from it, with a few edits for the \nSenate floor, and I ask that the piece in its entirety, with some other \nedits, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRANKEN. ``The Dark Side of Death'' by Tom Davis.\n\n       The good news: my chemotherapy is working and I'm still \n     buying green bananas.

I've always been good at that, but \n     now I'm getting really good at that.\n       I wake up in the morning, delighted to be waking up, read, \n     write, feed the birds, watch sports on TV, accepting the fact \n     that in the foreseeable future I will be a dead person. I \n     want to remind you that dead people are people too. There are \n     good dead people and bad dead people. Some of my best friends \n     are dead people. Dead people have fought in every war.

After \n     surgery, I elected to go with radiation therapy sans \n     complementary chemo, which was probably a big mistake. The \n     malignancy unexpectedly spread to the bones of my pelvis and \n     lower spine, where it has been munching away without thought \n     of its host's well-being. It's now described as ``exotic and \n     aggressive,'' but it's getting its cancerous ass kicked by \n     taxotere, a drug that imitates the chemistry of the European \n     Yew tree. Made in China, of course. I'll be using it, or a \n     related drug ``for the rest of my life,'' which could be as \n     long as two more high-quality-of-life years. I'd be thrilled \n     with that.\n       There are side effects, the two weirdest being a ``recall \n     effect,'' in which radiation sores reappear, and neuropathy \n     in my fingernails, which are in the unpleasant process of \n     falling off. Ow. I've lost hair from all over my body. With \n     only a little bit of white fluff on my head, I visited my \n     mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease in Minneapolis.\n       ``Now I want you to take all your medicine and your hair \n     will grow back,'' she said cheerfully. ``I think you look a \n     little like that bird Woodstock in Peanuts.'' I'll take that; \n     better than Uncle Fester.\n       My old comedy partner (Senator) Al Franken, volunteered to \n     draw my hair back on with a magic marker, which would be \n     funny for about two days. We're planning to write something \n     for him to read once I de-animate, the final Franken and \n     Davis piece. We'll see. Typically, we would wait until the \n     last minute.\n       I've lost about 50 pounds. (I needed to lose 49.) It's \n     great to wear jeans from the 70s, although I remember making \n     a few people laugh when I said I would save them in case I \n     got cancer. Once, in the early eighties, Franken and Davis \n     appeared on the David Letterman Show as ``The Comedy Team \n     that Weighs the Same,'' a piece so stupid it was really \n     funny. We dressed in bathrobes and Speedos for the final \n     weigh-in on a huge scale. David asked if any other comedy \n     team had weighed the same, and I said ``Laurel and Hardy, but \n     only near the end of Ollie's life,'' which got a good groan \n     laugh. Maybe I tempted fate a little too often.\n       My grocer at the Claverack Market, Ted the Elder, recently \n     asked if I had heard that there are two stages in life: \n     ``youth,'' and ``you look great.'' Wish I'd thought of that.\n       Several close friends have asked if I was aware of \n     alternative medicines, therapies, protocols, doctors, \n     clinics, and books. One offered personal testimony. His colon \n     cancer was supposed to have killed him several years ago. He \n     attributes his survival to an exclusive diet of blueberry \n     smoothies.\n       My fear is not death; my fear is spending my last years \n     slurping blueberry, whey and soy powder shakes in a rock star \n     hospital in Houston, surrounded by strangers. No.\n       False hope is my enemy, also self pity, which went out the \n     window when I saw children with cancer.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate passed a farm bill a few \nweeks ago--a pretty good farm bill. The House Agriculture Committee has \nreported out of its committee a farm bill, and now the discussion of \nwhether we have a farm bill is a decision to be made by the leadership \nof the House, of whether a farm bill should come up. So I wish to speak \nabout the necessity of a farm and nutrition bill being passed.\n  It is called a farm and nutrition bill because about 80 percent of a \nfarm bill's expenditures are related to the food stamp program. If we \ncan get this bill completed and to the President's desk, it will be the \neighth farm bill I have had a chance to participate in.\n  Every 5 years or so, Congress debates, changes, argues over, and \nultimately passes a farm and nutrition bill--not always of that title \nbut pretty much of that content. This time should be no different. We \nneed to get the job done. I understand there are folks who want to see \nmore cuts here or there, and there are folks who want to spend more \nhere or there. Those are very important discussions to have. We should \nhave a healthy debate on how to tweak, reform, and reshape the policies \nin the bill, whether it is in regard to programs affecting farmers or \nthe portion of the bill that receives the overwhelming share of the \ndollars, as I said, the nutrition title.\n  We had those debates in the Senate Agriculture Committee. We had \nthose debates on the Senate floor. The House Agriculture Committee has \nhad those debates. Now I hope their product can be brought up on the \nSenate floor. In fact, I am more than happy to debate these various \nissues with some of my friends on the House Agriculture Committee--why \nsetting high target prices, as they did, is the wrong direction for \nCongress to take and how the House should adopt the payment limit \nreforms the Senate has embraced, provisions of the farm bill in the \nSenate that I got included. I am sure many on the House Agriculture \nCommittee would be more than happy to debate with me the merits of \nhaving a more balanced approach to where we find savings in the bill by \ntaking an equal portion from the nutrition title and the farm-related \ntitles. We should find more savings for sure than what is contained in \nthe Senate-passed farm bill, including saving more out of the nutrition \ntitle, as the House Agriculture Committee has been able to do.\n  But the fact is we have to keep moving the ball forward, regardless \nof how we feel about all these separate parts of a farm bill. We need \nto get to finality. We have a drought gripping this Nation and that is \ngoing to be tough on Americans. It is going to affect every American, \nnot just the 2 percent of the people who are farmers, because it is \ngoing to cause food prices to go up. But the drought has drawn into \nfocus just how important our farmers are to our food supply.\n  Americans enjoy a safe and abundant food supply. That is because of \nthe hard work and dedication of so many farming families throughout our \ncountry. Sometimes weather conditions or other events outside farmers' \ncontrol can make it difficult to keep farming. Farmers aren't looking \nfor a handout, but when faced with conditions such as a near-historic \ndrought, many farmers may need assistance to get through. Men and women \ngo into farming for all sorts of reasons, but at the heart of farming \nis the desire to be successful at producing an abundant crop to feed \nthe Nation and the world.\n  Farmers have many tools to manage their risks so they can keep \nproducing food. They have adopted advanced\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\ntechnology such as drought-resistant crops. Farmers buy crop insurance. \nIn my State of Iowa, about 92 percent of the farmers have crop \ninsurance. Livestock farmers help animals manage heat by building \nclimate-controlled buildings. But when faced with weather conditions \nsuch as we are currently dealing with, even the best laid plans may not \nkeep the farming operation afloat. That is where the Federal Government \ncomes in. We help provide a safety net.\n  Let me say just how that drought affects crops. I just read in the \nnewspaper something put out by some government agency that said about \n55 percent of the landmass of the United States is in a drought \ncondition right now. In my State of Iowa and many other Midwestern \nStates, on an average of about 22 years, we face drought situations \nthat are catastrophic for crops. Actually, the last one was in 1988, so \nnow we are having one in my State of Iowa and that is 24 years. But, on \naverage, it happens about that long. So we see the need for something \nthat is beyond farmers' control. We can't do anything if it doesn't \nrain when it is supposed to rain, and right now is one of those most \nimportant times when crops need rain. So why do we provide the safety \nnet? Because the American people understand how important the \nproduction of food is to our food supply and farmers doing that \nproduction.\n  It is a matter of national security. It has been said we are only \nnine meals away from a revolution. If people were without food, this \nargument goes, they would do whatever it takes to get food for \nthemselves and their families. It has only been 3 years, I believe, in \nsome places in the world where they had riots that were national \nproblems--not just local problems but national problems--because of a \nshortage of rice. That is a staple in many countries; I suppose \nparticularly of Asia. So we have to have a stable food supply if we are \nnot going to have social upheaval.\n  The need for food can also be illustrated by looking at military \nhistory. In other words, a food supply is very important for our \nnational security. It may be a joke, but Napoleon supposedly said ``an \narmy marches on its stomachs.'' But we also know from modern history, \nif we consider World War II on this very day, 60 or 70 years after \nWorld War II, why the Japanese and the Germans protect their farmers so \nmuch with safety nets of various sorts. Because they know what it was \nlike during wartime not to have adequate food as a part of national \nsecurity. A well-fed military is one ready to fight and to defend.\n  There is nothing more basic than making sure the Nation's food supply \nis secure, whether it is to prevent social upheaval or for our national \nsecurity or maybe for a lot of other reasons. In order to have \nstability in our food system, we need to have the safety net available \nto assist farmers through the tough times so they can keep producing \nfood.\n  I have not always agreed with the policies set in each and every farm \nbill Congress has passed--of the eight I have been involved in. In \nfact, there have been times in which I voted against individual farm \nbills because I didn't agree with the policy being set. However, I \nsupport, to a large extent, what we accomplished in the Senate-passed \nfarm bill last month. Obviously, I didn't agree with everything, \nparticularly with the lack of savings we captured from the nutrition \ntitle. But, for the most part, we passed a bill that embraced real \nreform in the farm program that still provides an effective safety net.\n\n  Whether it is the Senate bill that cut back $23 billion from the \npresent farm program or whether it is the House bill that seems to cut \nback $35 billion, I will bet this is the only piece of legislation that \ncan possibly get to the President's desk this year that is going to \nsave money rather than if it had just been simply extended. I would \nthink people who want to set a record of fiscal conservatism for the \nupcoming election would be very anxious to take up a bill the \nCongressional Budget Office says saves either $23 billion or $35 \nbillion.\n  So I say mostly to the other body, because right now that is where \nthe action is and where we hope it will take place, we should not delay \nany longer. The farm bill is too important to all Americans to leave it \nin limbo. We need to get a farm bill to the President. The farm bill is \napproximately 80 percent nutrition programs. Most of the people who \nbenefit are not farmers. Then, the other 20 percent is a safety net for \nfarmers but also for all the programs the Department of Agriculture \nadministers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before I go into the closing business, \nlet me say I had the pleasure of presiding in this body during the \nremarks that were just made by the distinguished chairman of the \nHomeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, the \ndistinguished ranking member of that committee, Senator Collins of \nMaine, and the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee and, \nuntil recently, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nRockefeller of West Virginia.\n  I simply want, briefly, to add my voice to theirs and echo the three \npoints they emphasized: One, we absolutely must take action on \ncybersecurity; two, it is a genuine and undeniable matter of our \nAmerican national security; and, three, we cannot claim to have done \nthe job, we cannot claim to even have attempted the job seriously if we \ndo not address the question of the critical infrastructure on which \nAmerican life and our economy depend that is in private hands and, \ntherefore, cannot be protected under the existing regime in place \nprotecting our government and military networks. We have to solve that \nproblem. Anything that does not solve that problem is a clear failure \nof our duty, as national security experts from Republican and \nDemocratic administrations alike have very clearly explained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I know that you and all of our colleagues \nwill want to join me today in paying tribute to Dr. Sally Ride, the \nfirst American woman to fly in space, who died peacefully on Monday at \nher home in San Diego, CA. Sally Ride was 61 years old.\n  Dr. Ride was a physicist, an astronaut, a science writer, and the \npresident and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a nonprofit company dedicated \nto realizing her lifelong passion for motivating young people to stick \nwith their interests in science and to consider pursuing careers in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math.\n  Sally Ride was born and grew up in Encino, CA. As a young girl, she \nwas encouraged by her parents to pursue her two passionate interests: \nscience and sports. At Stanford University, she studied physics, \nastrophysics, and English literature while becoming the school's number \none women's tennis player. When asked what had made her choose science \nover tennis, she joked, ``A bad forehand.''\n  In 1977, as she was about to complete her Ph.D. in physics, Sally \nread that NASA was looking for astronauts and, for the first time, was \nallowing women to apply. From a group of 8,000 applicants, NASA \nselected 29 men and 6 women--including Sally Ride--as astronaut \ncandidates in January 1978. The following year, she qualified for \nassignment on a space shuttle flight crew.\n  On June 18, 1983, Sally Ride made history as the first American woman \nin space, part of a 147-hour mission aboard the shuttle Challenger. She \nlater said, ``The thing that I'll remember most about the flight is \nthat it was fun. In fact, I'm sure it was the most fun I'll ever have \nin my life.''\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n  Sally Ride's historic space flight riveted the Nation and made her a \nhousehold name--a symbol of women's ability to break barriers and \nachieve any goal, no matter how lofty. She immediately understood and \nappreciated her place in history, crediting the women's movement of the \n1970s with paving her way into the space program.\n  Dr. Ride made another space flight in 1984 and was preparing for a \nthird when the Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff on January 28, \n1986. She served on the Presidential commission investigating the \nChallenger tragedy and worked at NASA headquarters as special assistant \nto the administrator before retiring from NASA in 1987.\n  After serving as a science fellow at Stanford's Center for \nInternational Security and Arms Control, Dr. Ride joined the faculty at \nthe University of California, San Diego as a physics professor and \ndirector of the California Space Institute.\n  In 2001 she founded Sally Ride Science to create educational programs \nthat entertain, engage, and inspire young people. She served on the \nPresident's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, the \nNational Research Council's Space Studies Board, and the boards of the \nCongressional Office of Technology Assessment, the Carnegie Institution \nof Washington, and the NCAA Foundation.\n  Sally Ride pushed the limits of knowledge, courage, and \naccomplishment for all Americans, especially for girls and young women. \nAs a pioneer in the final frontier of space, she showed millions of \nAmerican girls that there was truly no limit on what they can do or \nwhere they can go.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have been so moved and \ninspired by Sally Ride's life and legacy, I send my deepest \nappreciation and condolences to her partner of 27 years, Tam \nO'Shaughnessy; her mother, Joyce; her sister, Bear; her niece, Caitlin; \nand her nephew, Whitney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5368-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHRISTENING OF THE USS SOMERSET\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, this Saturday, July 28, 2012, the U.S. \nNavy will perform a christening ceremony in New Orleans for the future \nUSS Somerset. The USS Somerset is a special ship, bearing the name of \nthe Southwest Pennsylvania county where United Airlines Flight 93 \ncrashed on September 11, 2001.\n  On that infamous day, a group of defiant and determined Americans \nchallenged a group of al-Qaida hijackers hell bent on crashing the \nplane into the U.S. Capitol, the White House, or another sensitive DC-\narea target. The terrorists' goal was not achieved, thanks to the \nbravery of the Americans onboard. We will never forget their actions in \nthe face of horror.\n  The USS Somerset will serve as an ongoing emblem of their heroism as \nit races to the aid of our friends and defends American liberty against \nour foes. This ship also embodies the American spirit local \nPennsylvanians demonstrated shortly after the crash, when they raised \nthe Stars and Stripes atop a dragline near the crash site as an \nunforgettable symbol of our country's resolve during a time of national \nsorrow.\n  Wherever the USS Somerset goes, so will a piece of southwest \nPennsylvania. The bow of the ship includes steel from the dragline \nadjacent to the crash site in Stonycreek Township, where it was a \nsilent witness to an indelible act of American courage and strength in \ndefiance of those who would do us harm.\n  I wish the U.S. Navy and the future crew of the USS Somerset safe \ntravels and successful missions defending America and freedom \nworldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5368-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. NEOSHA A. MacKEY\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Neosha A. \nMackey, who retired earlier this summer as dean of university libraries \nat Missouri State University after 27 years of service. During her \nyears of dedicated service, Mackey oversaw the expansion of the Meyer \nLibrary to meet the needs of the academic community with improved \naccess to local archives, manuscripts and photographs. The MSU library \nsystem also improved its access to other research materials with a \nSpecial Collections and Archives section available to internet users \nthat was previously only accessible to view at the MSU Library.\n  Mackey started at Missouri State as the head of reference in 1985. \nLater she served as associate dean of library services, 1987-2009; \nacting dean, 1993-1995, and was appointed dean of library services in \n2009.\n  During her tenure, the library enhanced services with a $28 million \naddition and renovation project. Mackey has also been a presence in the \nclassroom teaching both undergraduate and graduate level courses while \nmonitoring budgets and coordinating personnel matters. As Missouri \nState reached out to establish programs and classes for students in \nChina, Mackey and her husband John took a leadership role in the \ndevelopment of those programs.\n  Mackey also directed an expansion of the Meyer Library's local \narchives and collections with a loan agreement to house, preserve, and \nprovide access to manuscripts and photographs owned by The History \nMuseum for Springfield-Greene County. The History Museum holds a \ncomprehensive collection of photographs and personal documents \ncapturing decades of history and changing cultures in Springfield and \nGreene Counties. The new campus location promises improved access for \nresearchers and the general public as well as a safer climate- and \ntemperature-controlled location for these priceless archives.\n  Before arriving at Missouri State, Mackey was at the Ohio State \nUniversity from 1978-1985 as personnel librarian and head of the home \neconomics library. She served as assistant to the dean, 1975-1977, and \nas head of the Parish Business Library, 1970-1975, at the University of \nNew Mexico. Mackey has a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's \nin library science from the University of Oklahoma and an MBA from the \nUniversity of New Mexico.\n  Mackey's achievements and her personal commitment to excellence have \nguided the Missouri State Library program to a place of national \nprominence. I thank her for her efforts and wish her well in her well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5368-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5368-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2012 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend three \nVermonters who will be representing the United States in the Olympic \nGames in London. One hundred years ago Albert Gutterson of Springfield, \nVT, won Olympic Gold in the broad jump. This year, Lea Davison, Trevor \nMoore and Andrew Wheating are the latest in a long line of Vermonters \nto compete in the world's most prestigious athletic competition.\n  Lea Davison won the first mountain bike race she ever entered when \nshe was 17 years old. A native of Jericho, VT, Lea competed in cross \ncountry and was a Division I alpine ski racer at Middlebury College \nbefore becoming the youngest woman to join the professional mountain \nbiking tour. Lea has become one of the dominant forces in professional \nwomen's mountain biking but still takes time to give back to the \ncommunity, running a summer camp for girls from Vermont who are \ninterested in cycling.\n  Trevor Moore began sailing with his father and brother at a very \nyoung age. When he moved to North Pomfret, VT, as a teenager his \npassion for competition led him to play for Woodstock Union High's \ntennis and soccer teams. At Hobart College, Trevor was an accomplished \nsailor and a three-time All American, in addition to being named the \n2007 College Sailor of the Year. He will be competing with Erik Storck \nin the 49er category in London.\n  London will mark Andrew Wheating's second Olympic Games. He competed \nfor the track team in the 800 meter race at the Beijing Olympics in \n2008. Andrew is originally from Norwich, VT. Recruited by the \nUniversity of Oregon, he was the NCAA champion in the 800 meters in \n2009 and 2010 and in the 1600 meters in 2010. Andrew is renowned for \nhis ability to come from behind in races and will be competing in the \n1600 meters in London.\n  Vermont is proud of Lea, Trevor, and Andrew, and I and the citizens \nof my State wish them the best of luck at the 2012 Olympic \nGames.\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/25/senate-section/article/S5369-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DEREK MILES\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Derek \nMiles of Tea, SD, who will compete in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games \ntaking place in London, England. This will be his third consecutive \ntrip to the Summer Olympic Games. Derek has a long history of success \nas a pole vaulter, including three U.S. National Championships, 10 \nyears ranked in the top 10 in the U.S.--4 of which he has been ranked \nNo. 1, and 6 years ranked in the top five in the world.\n  Derek is currently working as an assistant pole vault and jumps coach \nat the University of South Dakota where he graduated from in 1996 as a \nfour-time NCAA Division II All-American with a bachelor's degree in \nhistory. Derek also earned his master's in athletic administration at \nthe University of South Dakota in 1998 and was inducted into the Henry \nHeider Coyote Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. In addition to his personal \naccomplishments, Derek has coached multiple conference champions and \norganized the Miles Pole Vault Summit bringing the world's best pole \nvaulters to Vermillion, SD, in 2007.\n  Derek should be very proud of all his accomplishments. On behalf of \nthe State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say congratulations on \nanother Olympic qualification.

The town of Big Lick was first established in 1852 \nand eventually became the city of Roanoke in 1884. Since its early days \nas a railroad hub, Roanoke has been an economic and cultural focal \npoint for the western part of Virginia. Today, the New York Times \nrecognized Ed Walker for his efforts in revitalizing Roanoke. For more \nthan 10 years, Ed has worked to improve Roanoke by investing in \nhistoric structures and renovating them for residence, dining, and \nentertainment. Ed's work led to the creation of cultural programs, \nfounded an innovative music center for young adults, and revitalized a \nonce derelict downtown street.\n  Ed's investment in the community paid off. The hundredfold increase \nin downtown residents supported the opening of dozens of new businesses \nand increased demand for cultural attractions. By bringing residents \nand businesses closer together, Ed's projects have helped spur the \nRoanoke economy and brought new energy to the city.\n  Thanks to Ed's work, Roanoke serves as a model to similar communities \nacross the Commonwealth. Roanoke was recognized recently as one of \n``America's Most Livable Communities'' by the nonprofit Partners for \nLivable Communities. Ed created the CityWorks (X)po to bring together \nentrepreneurs, advocates, and developers from across the country to \nshare ideas about renewing and improving cities such as Roanoke.\n  I would like to congratulate Ed Walker on his achievements and thank \nhim for making the city of Roanoke a better place to work and live. I \nwould ask unanimous consent that today's New York Times article be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 25, 2012]\n\n         Virginia Developer Is on a Mission To Revive His Town\n\n                           (By Melena Ryzik)\n\n       Roanoke, Va.--The Kirk Avenue Music Hall, a four-year-old \n     club named for its downtown block here, offers an unexpected \n     perk to its performers: an apartment. For a night or so, \n     before or after gracing the stage, artists stay at no charge \n     in a loft a block away, signing the guest book with notes of \n     gratitude.\n       ``We don't have money, we don't have fame, so hospitality \n     is really critical,'' said Ed Walker, the club's landlord and \n     a founder.\n       It is hard to miss Mr. Walker's brand of hospitality on \n     Kirk Avenue. He owns nine of its storefronts, turning what \n     was a forlorn block not long ago into a social destination. \n     The music hall doubles as a microcinema and event space. \n     There is Lucky, a restaurant run by a touring rock band that \n     decided to stay put, and Freckles, a cafe and vintage shop \n     with monthly craft nights, whose owner called Mr. Walker the \n     town's Jimmy Stewart, a favorite son and guiding light.\n       It is hard to miss Mr. Walker in many corners of Roanoke, a \n     valley town of 97,000 about four hours from Washington. \n     Ringed by the Blue Ridge Mountains and for generations a \n     successful rail hub, it now has a median income of about \n     $35,000 and is trying to reinvent itself for a different \n     economy: a medical school opened in 2010, and a bike shop is \n     planning to move into the massive old transportation museum.\n       And Mr. Walker, 44, a former outsider-art dealer and a \n     third-generation lawyer from a prominent local family, has \n     emerged as a commercial developer with an unusual civic \n     conscience. In less than a decade, he has bought more than a \n     dozen disused historic buildings, renovated them and enticed \n     people to live in them.\n       Thanks to Mr. Walker and other developers who followed \n     suit, Roanoke's downtown has a livelier pulse, with nearly \n     1,200 residents this year, where once there were fewer than \n     10. Mr. Walker has made his spaces welcoming, handpicking \n     chefs for restaurants and furnishing a pocket park with his \n     children's swing sets. Coming attractions include a rock \n     climbing gym.\n       With his wife, Katherine, and two young sons, he lives \n     downtown himself and evangelizes about it to any visitor. \n     Last fall he started what will be an annual conference in \n     Roanoke, CityWorks (X)po, billed as exploring ``big ideas for \n     small cities.''\n       ``People think this is too good to be true,'' said Chris \n     Morrill, the city manager. ``You have this developer who \n     knows the finances, knows the law, knows how to do these \n     historic renovations and is really committed to the \n     community. It's real.''\n       Mr. Morrill added: ``When folks from other communities come \n     in here and I show them some of the stuff that's Ed's doing, \n     they're like, How can we clone this guy and bring him back to \n     our community?' ``\n       Mr. Walker's conference is intended to share his blueprint \n     for urban redevelopment, a field known as placemaking; he \n     will study it at Harvard's Graduate School of Design this \n     year, with a prestigious Loeb fellowship. But many towns \n     already have their own version of Ed Walker, said Bruce Katz, \n     a vice president at the Brookings Institution and founding \n     director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, which \n     focuses on cities. ``This is happening across the country,'' \n     Mr. Katz said.\n       ``What you're seeing is a group of vanguard developers and \n     vanguard businesspeople who basically spot a trend and then \n     double down or triple down with their own resources'' to buy \n     property cheap, collaborating with like-minded leaders ``on \n     the placemaking agenda,'' he said.\n       Examples abound: Mr. Katz pointed to changes in Buffalo and \n     Detroit and plans by Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tycoon, to remake \n     Las Vegas. ``It has been one or two people in particular \n     cities taking the risk,'' he said.\n       ``There's a profit motive for sure, but these are people \n     committed to place,'' Mr. Katz added. ``This is no longer an \n     idea or an aspiration. It's an out-and-out trend.''\n       In Roanoke, it started in 2002, when Mr. Walker began \n     redeveloping Kirk Avenue. His first major residential \n     renovation opened downtown in 2006, with million-dollar \n     condominiums.\n       Old-guard Roanokers were quickly convinced that downtown \n     was livable when Mr. Walker sold one of the first to Warner \n     Dalhouse, a retired bank chairman, and his wife, Barbara, who \n     use it as a Southern pied-a-terre. At 4,800 square feet, it \n     is larger than their lake house nearby. ``We wanted it to \n     look like a New York loft, and it does,'' Mr. Dalhouse said.\n       Mr. Walker's company converted an old cotton mill and a \n     department store into apartments, some at the low end of \n     market rates and some at the top. The next units will be in a \n     former ice house on the Roanoke River, where the city's first \n     waterfront restaurant will open.\n       Last year, after a $20 million renovation, the company \n     reopened the Patrick Henry,\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\n     once one of Roanoke's grandest hotels; its disrepair had \n     taken a toll on civic pride. Now it once again has an elegant \n     lobby, complete with a bar. Some of its 132 apartments are \n     leased by a nearby nursing school for its students.\n       The building also houses the Music Place, an FM radio \n     station that Mr. Walker bought last year just before it was \n     forced to change formats. With its mix of indie, country and \n     folk--and thrice-weekly interviews with community leaders--it \n     fit with his notion to give Roanoke the feel of, as he \n     grinningly puts it, a funky college town.\n       The radio station is just breaking even. The conference \n     lost money, but Mr. Walker will hold it again--it ``succeeded \n     on a human level,'' he said. Otherwise, he is adamant that \n     his projects must serve the bottom line.\n       He is keen to talk financing--Virginia has generous tax \n     credits for historic renovation, so he helped get a landmark \n     designation for the Wasena neighborhood, where his river \n     project is--in hopes that it will teach others to follow in \n     his footsteps as social entrepreneurs. ``Roanoke is a really \n     good small-city laboratory,'' he said.\n       Mayor David Bowers praised Mr. Walker but said the city \n     still had economic, educational and tourism challenges. \n     ``We're not the destination that we should be,'' he said.\n       Even downtown, all is not rosy. Studio Roanoke, a nonprofit \n     black box theater, closed this month because of a lack of \n     money. (``It's not even bare bones,'' Melora Kordos, its \n     artistic director, told The Roanoke Times. ``We're just a \n     couple of femurs.'') And there are other signs of struggle, \n     especially in areas that ring the city center, like southeast \n     Roanoke.\n       Jason Garnett, a former projectionist and theater manager \n     who programs Shadowbox, the movie night at Kirk Avenue Music \n     Hall, makes ends meet with a job as an audio-visual \n     coordinator at a local college.\n       ``I can't afford to live downtown,'' said Mr. Garnett, a \n     36-year-old father of two. Still, he and his friends are \n     committed to staying, starting even more community-run art \n     spaces. ``We're trying to make Roanoke cool,'' he said.\n       There are indications that it is working. Since 2009, 25 \n     restaurants have opened across 10 blocks downtown, many \n     serving farm-to-table fare, bolstered by a long-running \n     farmer's market. A glossy monthly devoted to the art scene, \n     Via Noke Magazine, began publishing in June. There is an \n     adult kickball league. It adds up to the kind of do-it-\n     yourself creative change that Mr. Walker, a sometime \n     skateboarder whose ethos is more Joe Strummer than Jane \n     Jacobs, advocates.\n       For Mr. Morrill, the city manager, the developments have \n     already had an impact on the town's psyche. ``Roanoke has \n     this inferiority complex,'' he said. ``People would say, `We \n     could've been Charlotte if we'd had a bigger airport, or \n     Greensboro or Asheville.' And Ed helped them realize, Roanoke \n     is a pretty good place.''\n       He added: ``People aren't talking about what we're not \n     anymore. Now they're talking about what we are.

A Concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing concerns over portions of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012; to \n     the Committee on Armed Services\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States passed the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 \n     (``2012 NDAA'') on December 15, 2011;\n       Whereas, the President of the United States of America \n     signed the 2012 NDAA into law on December 31, 2011;\n       Whereas, Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA affirms the \n     authority of the Armed Forces of the United States to detain \n     covered persons pending disposition under the law of war and \n     defines covered persons to include persons associated with \n     the attacks on September 11, 2011 or members and supporters \n     of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or other associated forces that are \n     engaged in hostilities against the United States;\n       Whereas, Section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA requires that \n     members of al-Qaeda captured in the course of hostilities be \n     detained in military custody pending disposition under the \n     laws of war, except that it is not a requirement to detain a \n     citizen of the United States or lawful resident alien of the \n     United States on the basis of conduct taking place within the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, there is disagreement about the impacts of \n     Sections 1021 and 1022 of the 2012 NDAA;\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution and the Utah \n     Constitution provide for due process and a speedy trial;\n       Whereas, the indefinite military detention of a citizen in \n     the United States without charge or trial violates the right \n     to be free from deprivation of life, liberty, or property \n     without due process of law guaranteed by the United States \n     Constitution, Amendment V and Utah Constitution, Article I, \n     Section 14; and\n       Whereas, it is indisputable that the threat of terrorism is \n     real and that the full force of appropriate and \n     constitutional law must be used to defeat this threat; \n     however, winning the war against terror cannot come at the \n     great expense of mitigating basic, fundamental, \n     constitutional rights:Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, reaffirms our rights guaranteed \n     by the United States Constitution and the Utah Constitution, \n     and urges the United States Congress to clarify, or repeal if \n     found necessary, Sections 1021 and 1022 of the 2012 NDAA to \n     ensure protection of the rights guaranteed by the United \n     States Constitution and the Utah Constitution; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution should be sent to \n     the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-107. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing support for interconnection \n     of the seven Salt Lake County and Summit County ski resorts; \n     to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, tourism is one of Utah's major ``export \n     industries'' that sells services or products to destination \n     visitors and brings money into the state to support our local \n     economy and provide jobs for current and future Utahns;\n       Whereas, over 20 million people visited the state of Utah \n     in 2010, spending over $6.5 billion, or 5.5% of Utah's gross \n     domestic product, contributing over $840 million in state and \n     local taxes, and sustaining as much as 10% of the jobs in the \n     state;\n       Whereas, the ski and snowboard industry is a major \n     contributor to Utah's tourism industry, contributing over \n     $1.2 billion to the state's economy as a result of over 4 \n     million skier days, and growth in the ski and snowboard \n     industry will bring additional spending, revenue, and jobs to \n     the state;\n       Whereas, tourists who ski or snowboard in Utah spend money \n     on lift tickets, equipment rentals, hotels, restaurants, car \n     rentals, and other matters, and this money circulates through \n     the economy, supporting over 20,000 local jobs;\n       Whereas, the seven ski resorts in Summit County and Salt \n     Lake County are all located in close proximity to one \n     another, offering\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\n     the opportunity to connect these resorts, an opportunity that \n     leading competing winter tourism states do not have;\n       Whereas, connecting the ski resorts in Summit County and \n     Salt Lake County will create a skiing experience unavailable \n     anywhere else in North America and reposition Utah's ski and \n     snowboard experience to be even more competitive and \n     attractive relative to other states, leading to increased \n     tourist visitation and spending, which will in turn lead to \n     an increase in revenue and jobs;\n       Whereas, it is recognized that Big and Little Cottonwood \n     Canyons are critical watersheds from which more than 500,000 \n     Utah residents, businesses, and visitors throughout Salt Lake \n     County receive their drinking water, and that best management \n     practices would be required in any potential resort \n     connections;\n       Whereas, the balance of multiple uses in the Wasatch \n     Mountains, including developed recreation, such as skiing and \n     picnicking, and dispersed recreation, such as hiking, \n     mountain biking, and back country skiing, are highly valued \n     by residents, visitors, and businesses in Utah and contribute \n     significantly to the state's economy and quality of life;\n       Whereas, the roads to ski areas in Summit County and Salt \n     Lake County are congested during certain times of the year, \n     and studies should be conducted by numerous federal, state, \n     local, and private sector entities to comprehensively \n     evaluate alternatives to solve transportation problems;\n       Whereas, connecting the ski resorts in Summit County and \n     Salt Lake County will improve access to the ski resorts and \n     allow the unique opportunity of skiing at multiple resorts in \n     a single day;\n       Whereas, connecting the ski resorts in Summit County and \n     Salt Lake County is an issue of state concern because the \n     connection will cross county boundaries, have a tremendously \n     positive impact on the state economy, and may contribute \n     positively to state roadways and airsheds;\n       Whereas, connecting ski resorts will allow the winter \n     sports industry to grow while making the most efficient and \n     sustainable use of ski terrain, roads, facilities, and \n     parking lots;\n       Whereas, connecting the ski resorts in Summit County and \n     Salt Lake County may require review and approval of permits \n     by Summit County, Salt Lake County, Salt Lake City, Park \n     City, the town of Alta, and the United States Forest Service;\n       Whereas, the public will be engaged in meaningful and \n     balanced ways in any potential decision-making processes \n     regarding resort interconnections, and these processes will \n     be open and transparent;\n       Whereas, many skiers drive from Summit County to ski in the \n     Cottonwood Canyons, or from one Cottonwood Canyon resort to \n     ski in Summit County or at another Cottonwood Canyon resort, \n     contributing to congestion on canyon roads;\n       Whereas, connecting the ski resorts in Summit County and \n     Salt Lake County will decrease traffic on congested canyon \n     roads and lead to cleaner air and water by reducing \n     automobile-related pollution, and provide emergency \n     evacuation options for Big and Little Cottonwood canyons;\n       Whereas, the 1988 Governor's Task Force on Interconnect \n     concluded that 3 kA)47 S.C.R. 10 Enrolled Copy \n     interconnecting the Wasatch ski resorts ``would provide a \n     substantial boost to Utah's ski industry and have a positive \n     influence on the state's economy''; and\n       Whereas, the Wasatch Mountains Inter-Resort Transportation \n     Study, completed by Mountainland Association of Governments \n     in 1990, found that connecting the Wasatch resorts ``hold[s] \n     the promise of substantial public benefits in the form of \n     reductions in automobile traffic on congested canyon \n     roadways, watershed and environmental pollution abatement, \n     increased slow-season occupancy of existing facilities, and \n     the potential for future economic expansion'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, support connecting the seven ski \n     resorts in Summit County and Salt Lake County with an inter-\n     resort transportation system based on sound research and \n     balanced public input, and careful evaluation of its impact \n     on transportation, the economy, job creation, the \n     environment, multiple uses, and visitor experience; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and Governor encourage \n     Summit County, Salt Lake County, Salt Lake City, Park City, \n     the town of Alta, and the United States Forest Service to \n     fairly consider the benefits of connecting the various \n     resorts and expeditiously approve a low-impact inter-resort \n     transportation system based on appropriate analysis and \n     balanced public input; and be it further\n       Resolved,  That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Summit County Council, the Summit County Manager, the mayor \n     of Park City, the Park City Council, the Salt Lake County \n     Council, the town of Alta, the Mayor of Salt Lake County, the \n     Salt Lake City Council, the Mayor of Salt Lake City, the \n     Chief of the National Forest Service, the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache \n     National Forest Supervisor, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the United \n     States Senate, and all members of the Utah Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-108. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah petitioning the federal government to \n     transfer title of public lands to the state of Utah; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, in 1780, the United States Congress resolved that \n     ``the unappropriated lands that may be ceded or relinquished \n     to the United States, by any particular states, pursuant to \n     the recommendation of Congress of the 6 day of September \n     last, shall be granted and disposed of for the common benefit \n     of all the United States that shall be members of the federal \n     union, and be settled and formed into distinct republican \n     states, which shall become members of the federal union, and \n     have the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and \n     independence, as the other states: . . . and that upon such \n     cession being made by any State and approved and accepted by \n     Congress, the United States shall guaranty the remaining \n     territory of the said States respectively. (Resolution of \n     Congress, October 10, 1780)'';\n       Whereas, the territorial and public lands of the United \n     States are dealt with in Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of \n     the United States Constitution, referred to as the Property \n     Clause, which states, ``The Congress shall have Power to \n     dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \n     respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the \n     United States.'';\n       Whereas, with this clause, the Constitutional Convention \n     agreed that the Constitution would maintain the ``statu quo'' \n     that had been established with respect to the federal \n     territorial lands being disposed of only to create new states \n     with the same rights of sovereignty, freedom, and \n     independence as the original states;\n       Whereas, under these express terms of trust, the land \n     claiming states, over time, ceded their western land to their \n     confederated union and retained their claims that the \n     confederated government dispose of such lands only to create \n     new states ``and for no other use or purpose whatsoever'' and \n     apply the net proceeds of any sales of such lands only for \n     the purpose of paying down the public debt;\n       Whereas, with respect to the disposition of the federal \n     territorial lands, the Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, \n     provides, ``The legislatures of those districts or new \n     States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of \n     the soil by the United States in Congress assembled, nor with \n     any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing the \n     title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers'';\n       Whereas, by resolution in 1790, the United States Congress \n     declared ``That the proceeds of sales which shall be made of \n     lands in the Western territory, now belonging or that may \n     hereafter belong to the United States, shall be, and are \n     hereby appropriated towards sinking or discharging the debts \n     for the payment whereof the United States now are, or by \n     virtue of this act may be holden, and shall be applied solely \n     to that use, until the said debt shall be fully satisfied'';\n       Whereas, the intent of the founding fathers to eventually \n     extinguish title to all public lands was reaffirmed by \n     President Andrew Jackson in a message to the United States \n     Senate on December 4, 1833, where he explained the reasons he \n     vetoed a bill entitled ``An act to appropriate for a limited \n     time the proceeds of the sales of the public lands of the \n     United States and for granting lands to certain States'': ``I \n     do not doubt that it is the real interest of each and all the \n     States in the Union, and particularly of the new States, that \n     the price of these lands shall be reduced and graduated, and \n     that after they have been offered for a certain number of \n     years the refuse remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the \n     States and the machinery of our land system entirely \n     withdrawn. It can not be supposed the compacts intended that \n     the United States should retain forever a title to lands \n     within the States which are of no value, and no doubt is \n     entertained that the general interest would be best promoted \n     by surrendering such lands to the States'';\n       Whereas, in 1828, United States Supreme Court Chief Justice \n     John Marshall, in American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, \n     26 U.S. 511 (1828), confirmed that no provision in the \n     Constitution authorized the federal government to \n     indefinitely exercise control over western public lands \n     beyond the duty to manage these lands pending the disposal of \n     the lands to create new states when he said, ``At the time \n     the Constitution was formed, the limits of the territory over \n     which it was to operate were generally defined and recognised \n     (sic). These limits consisted in part, of organized states, \n     and in part of territories, the absolute property and \n     dependencies of the United States. These states, this \n     territory, and future states to be admitted into the Union, \n     are the sole objects of the Constitution; there is no express \n     provision whatever made in the Constitution for the \n     acquisition or government of territories beyond those \n     Limits.'';\n       Whereas, in 1833, referring to these land cession compacts \n     which arose from the original 1780 congressional resolution, \n     President Andrew Jackson stated, ``These solemn compacts, \n     invited by Congress in a resolution declaring the purposes to \n     which the proceeds of these lands should be applied, \n     originating before the constitution, and forming the basis on \n     which it was made, bound the United States to a particular \n     course of policy in relation to them by ties as strong as can \n     be invented to secure the faith of nations'' (Land bill veto, \n     December 5, 1833);\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court, in State of Texas \n     v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1868), clarified that a state, by \n     definition, includes a defined sovereign territory, stating \n     that ``State,'' in the constitutional context, is ``a \n     political community of free citizens, occupying a territory \n     of defined boundaries, and organized under a government \n     sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and \n     established by the consent of the governed'', and added, \n     ``This is undoubtedly the fundamental idea upon which the \n     republican institutions of our own country are established'';\n       Whereas, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), the \n     United States Supreme Court confirmed that all federal \n     territories, regardless of how acquired, are held in trust to \n     create new states on an equal footing with the original \n     states when it stated, ``Upon the acquisition of a Territory \n     by the United States, whether by cession from one of the \n     States, or by treaty with a foreign country, or by discovery \n     and settlement, the same title and dominion passed to the \n     United States, for the benefit of the whole people, and in \n     trust for the several States to be ultimately created out of \n     the Territory.'';\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that \n     the federal government must honor its trust obligation to \n     extinguish title to the public lands for the sovereignty of \n     the new state to be complete, stating once ``the United \n     States shall have fully executed these trusts, the municipal \n     sovereignty of the new states will be complete, throughout \n     their respective borders, and they, and the original states, \n     will be upon an equal footing, in all respects. . .'' \n     (Polland v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212 (1845));\n       Whereas, the enabling acts of the new states west of the \n     original colonies established the terms upon which all such \n     states were admitted into the union, and contained the same \n     promise to all new states that the federal government would \n     extinguish title to all public lands lying within their \n     respective borders;\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court looks upon the \n     enabling acts which create new states as ``solemn compacts'' \n     and ``bilateral (two-way) agreements'' to be performed ``in a \n     timely fashion'';\n       Whereas, under Section 3 of Utah's Enabling Act, Utah \n     agreed to the same solemn compacts as states preceding in \n     statehood, that until the title to unappropriated public \n     lands lying within the state's boundaries ``shall have been \n     extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and \n     remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and \n     said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute \n     jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United \n     States; . . . that no taxes shall be imposed by the State on \n     lands or property therein belonging to or which may hereafter \n     be purchased by the United States or reserved for its use'';\n       Whereas, the trust obligation of the federal government to \n     timely extinguish title of all public lands lying within the \n     boundaries of the state of Utah is made even more clear in \n     Section 9 of Utah's Enabling Act as follows: ``That five per \n     centum of the proceeds of the sales of public lands lying \n     within said State, which shall be sold by the United States \n     subsequent to the admission of said State into the Union, \n     after deducting all the expenses incident to the same shall \n     be paid to the said State, to be used as a Permanent Fund, \n     the interest of which only shall be expended for the support \n     of the common schools within said State'';\n       Whereas, the federal government confirmed its trust \n     obligation to timely extinguish title to all public lands \n     lying within the boundaries of the state of Utah by and \n     through the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act, which declared that the \n     act was established ``In order to promote the highest use of \n     the public lands pending its final disposal'';\n       Whereas, in 1976, after nearly 200 years of trust history \n     regarding the obligation of Congress to extinguish title of \n     western lands to create new states and use the proceeds to \n     discharge its public debts, the United States Congress \n     purported to unilaterally change this solemn promise by and \n     through the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA), which \n     provides, in part, ``The Congress declares that it is the \n     policy of the United States that the public lands be retained \n     in Federal ownership, unless . . . it is determined that \n     disposal of a particular parcel will serve the federal \n     interest'';\n       Whereas, at the time of Utah's Enabling Act the course and \n     practice of the United States Congress with all prior states \n     admitted to the union had been to fully extinguish title, \n     within a reasonable time, to all lands within the boundaries \n     of such states, except for those Indian lands, or lands \n     otherwise expressly reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah did not, and could not have, \n     contemplated or bargained for the United States failing or \n     refusing to abide by its solemn promise to extinguish title \n     to all lands within its defined boundaries within a \n     reasonable time such that the state of Utah and its permanent \n     fund for its common schools could never realize the \n     bargained-for benefit of the deployment, taxation, or \n     economic benefit of all the lands within its defined \n     boundaries;\n       Whereas, from 1780 forward the federal government only held \n     bare legal title to the western public lands in the nature of \n     a trustee in trust with the solemn obligation to timely \n     extinguish title to such lands to create new states and to \n     use the proceeds to pay the public debt;\n       Whereas, the federal government complied with its promise \n     and solemn obligation to imminently transfer title of public \n     lands lying within the boundaries of all states to the \n     eastern edge of the state of Colorado and also with the state \n     of Hawaii;\n       Whereas, by the terms of Utah's Enabling Act, Utah \n     suspended its sovereign right to eventually tax the public \n     lands within its borders, pending final disposition of the \n     public lands;\n       Whereas, the federal government has repeatedly and \n     persistently failed to honor its promises and has refused to \n     abide by the terms of its preexisting solemn obligations to \n     imminently extinguish title to all public lands;\n       Whereas, had Congress honored its promise to Utah to timely \n     extinguish title to all public lands within Utah's \n     boundaries, Utah would have had sovereign control over lands \n     within its borders;\n       Whereas, Congress, by and through FLPMA, unilaterally \n     altered its duty in 1976 to extinguish title to all public \n     lands within Utah's borders by committing to a policy of \n     retention and a process of comprehensive land management and \n     planning coordinated between the federal government, the \n     states, and local governing bodies for access, multiple use, \n     and sustained yield of the public lands;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that the federal government had \n     not divested all public lands within Utah's borders by 1976, \n     this did not alleviate the federal government from its duty \n     to extinguish title and divest itself of federal ownership of \n     remaining public land in Utah by ceding such land directly to \n     the state as it did with other states;\n       Whereas, since the passage of FLPMA, the federal government \n     has engaged in a persistent pattern and course of conduct in \n     direct violation of the letter and spirit of FLPMA through an \n     abject disregard of local resource management plans, failure \n     and refusal to coordinate and cooperate with the state and \n     local governments, unilateral and oppressive land control \n     edicts to the severe and extreme detriment of the state and \n     its ability to adequately fund education, provide essential \n     government services, secure economic opportunities for wage \n     earners and Utah business, and ensure a stable prosperous \n     future;\n       Whereas, under the United States Constitution, the American \n     states reorganized to form a more perfect union, yielding up \n     certain portions of their sovereign powers to the elected \n     officers of the government of their union, yet retaining the \n     residuum of sovereignty for the purpose of independent \n     internal self governance;\n       Whereas, by compact between the original states, \n     territorial lands were divided into ``suitable extents of \n     territory'' and upon attaining a certain population, were to \n     be admitted into the union upon ``an equal footing'' as \n     members possessing ``the same rights of sovereignty, freedom \n     and independence'' as the original states;\n       Whereas, the federal trust respecting public lands \n     obligates the United States, through their agent, Congress, \n     to extinguish both their government jurisdiction and their \n     title on the public lands that are held in trust by the \n     United States for the states in which they are located;\n       Whereas, the state and federal partnership of public lands \n     management has been eroded by an oppressive and over-reaching \n     federal management agenda that has adversely impacted the \n     sovereignty and the economies of the state of Utah and local \n     governments;\n       Whereas, federal land-management actions, even when applied \n     exclusively to federal lands, directly impact the ability of \n     the state of Utah to manage its school trust lands in \n     accordance with the mandate of the Utah Enabling Act and to \n     meet its obligation to the beneficiaries of the trust;\n       Whereas, Utah has been substantially damaged in its ability \n     to provide funding for education and the common good of the \n     state and to serve a sustainable, vibrant economy into the \n     future because the federal government has unduly retained \n     control of nearly two-thirds of the lands lying within Utah's \n     borders;\n       Whereas, Utah consistently ranks highest among all the \n     states in class size and lowest in the nation in per pupil \n     spending for education;\n       Whereas, had the federal government disposed of the land in \n     or about 1896, Utah would have, from that point forward, \n     generated substantial tax revenues and revenues from the \n     sustainable managed use of its natural resources to the \n     benefit of its public schools and to the common good of the \n     state and nation;\n       Whereas, the federal government gives Utah less than half \n     of the net proceeds of mineral lease revenues and severance \n     taxes generated from the lands within Utah's borders;\n       Whereas, Utah has been substantially damaged in mineral \n     lease revenues and severance taxes in that, had the federal \n     government extinguished title to all public lands, Utah would \n     realize 100% of the mineral lease revenues and severance \n     taxes from the lands;\n       Whereas, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) failure to \n     act affirmatively on definitive allocation decisions of \n     multiple use activities in resource management plans has \n     created uncertainty in the future of public land use in Utah \n     and has caused capital to flee the state;\n       Whereas, during the process of finalizing the most recent \n     six Resource Management Plans, the BLM refused to consider \n     state and\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n     local government acknowledgments of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     or other evidence of the existence of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     in the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument;\n       Whereas, the BLM has demonstrated a chronic inability to \n     handle the proliferation of wild horses and burros on the \n     public lands, to the detriment of the rangeland resource;\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is \n     proposing to extend its jurisdiction to regulate the waters \n     of the United States to areas traditionally dry, except \n     during severe weather events, in violation of the common \n     definition of jurisdictional waters;\n       Whereas, in 1996, the president of the United States abused \n     the intent of the Antiquities Act by the creation of the \n     Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument without any \n     consultation with the state and local authorities or \n     citizens;\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is \n     making decisions concerning various species on BLM lands \n     under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act without \n     serious consideration of state wildlife management activities \n     and protection designed to prevent the need for a listing, or \n     recognizing the ability to delist a species, thereby \n     affecting the economic vitality of the state and local \n     region;\n       Whereas, the BLM has not authorized all necessary rangeland \n     improvement projects involving the removal of pinyon-juniper \n     and other climax vegetation, thereby reducing the biological \n     diversity of the range, reducing riparian viability and water \n     quality, and reducing the availability of forage for both \n     livestock and wildlife;\n       Whereas, Utah initially supported placing into reserve the \n     six National Forests in Utah--Ashley, Fishlake, Manti La-Sal, \n     Dixie, Uinta, and Wasatch-Cache, because Utah was promised \n     this action would preserve the forest lands as watersheds and \n     for agricultural use--namely timber and other wood products, \n     and grazing;\n       Whereas, this vision and promise of agricultural production \n     on the forest lands is the reason that the United States \n     Forest Service was made part of the United States Department \n     of Agriculture as opposed to the Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas, the promise of preservation for agricultural use \n     has been broken by the current and recent administrations;\n       Whereas, logging, timber, and wood products operations on \n     Utah's National Forests have come to a virtual standstill, \n     resulting in forests that are choked with old growth \n     monocultures, loss of aspen diversity, loss of habitat, and a \n     threat to community watersheds due to insect infestation and \n     catastrophic fire;\n       Whereas, these conditions are the result of a failure to \n     properly manage the forest lands for their intended use, \n     which is responsible and sustained timber production, \n     watersheds, and grazing;\n       Whereas, the only remedy for federal government breaches of \n     Utah's Enabling Act Compact and breaches to the spirit and \n     letter of the promises of FLPMA is for the state of Utah to \n     take back title and management responsibility of federally-\n     managed public lands, which would restore the promises in the \n     solemn compact made at statehood;\n       Whereas, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the \n     United States Constitution, the federal government is only \n     constitutionally authorized to exercise jurisdiction over and \n     above bare right and title over lands that are ``purchased by \n     the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same \n     shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, \n     dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings'';\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that the \n     federal government only holds lands as a mere ``ordinary \n     proprietor'' and cannot exert jurisdictional dominion and \n     control over public lands without the consent of the state \n     Legislature, stating ``Where lands are acquired without such \n     consent, the possession of the United States, unless \n     political jurisdiction be ceded to them in some other way, is \n     simply that of an ordinary proprietor (emphasis added). The \n     property in that case, unless used as a means to carry out \n     the purposes of the government, is subject to the legislative \n     authority and control of the states equally with the property \n     of private individuals.''(Ft. Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 \n     U.S. 525 (1885));\n       Whereas, in a unanimous 2009 decision, the United States \n     Supreme Court, in Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 \n     U.S. 163 (2009), affirmed that Congress has no right to \n     change the promises it made to a state's Enabling Act, \n     stating, ``. . . [a subsequent act of Congress] would raise \n     grave constitutional concerns if it purported to `cloud' \n     Hawaii's title to its sovereign lands more than three decades \n     after the State's admission to the Union. . . `[T]he \n     consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores \n     the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to \n     suggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish what has \n     already been bestowed'. And that proposition applies a \n     fortiori [with even greater force] where virtually all of the \n     State's public lands. . . are at stake'' (emphasis added, \n     citation omitted);\n       Whereas, citizens of the state of Utah have a love of the \n     land and have demonstrated responsible stewardship of lands \n     within state jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah is willing to sponsor, evaluate, \n     and advance the locally driven efforts in a more efficient \n     manner than the federal government, to the benefit of all \n     users, including recreation, conservation, and the \n     responsible and sustainable management of Utah's natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah has a proven regulatory \n     structure to manage public lands for multiple use and \n     sustainable yield;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress disposed of lands \n     within the boundaries of the states of Tennessee and Hawaii \n     directly to those states;\n       Whereas, because of the entanglements and rights arising \n     over the 116 years that the federal government has failed to \n     honor its promise to timely extinguish title to public lands \n     and because of the federal government's breach of Utah's \n     Enabling Act and breach of FLPMA, among other promises made, \n     and the damages resulting from such breaches, the United \n     States Congress should imminently transfer title to all \n     public lands lying within the State of Utah directly to \n     the State of Utah, as it did with Hawaii and Tennessee;\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah, upon \n     transfer of title by the federal government of the public \n     lands directly to the state, intends to cede the national \n     park land to the federal government on condition that the \n     lands permanently remain national park lands, that they not \n     be sold, transferred, left in disrepair, or conveyed to any \n     party other than the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah, upon \n     transfer of title by the federal government of the public \n     lands directly to the state, intends to cede to the federal \n     government all lands currently designated as part of the \n     National Wilderness Preservation System pursuant to the \n     Wilderness Act of 1964;\n       Whereas, in order to effectively address the accumulated \n     entanglements and expectations over Utah's public lands, \n     including open space, access, multiple use, and the \n     management of sustainable yields of Utah's natural resources, \n     a Utah Public Lands Commission should be formed to review and \n     manage multiple use of the public lands and to determine, \n     through a public process, the extent to which public land may \n     be sold, if any; and\n       Whereas, to the extent that the Public Lands Commission \n     determines through a public process that any such land should \n     be sold to private owners, that 5% of the net proceeds should \n     be paid to the permanent fund for Utah's public schools, and \n     95% of the net proceeds should be paid to the federal \n     government to pay down the federal debt: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved that in order to provide a fair, justified, and \n     equitable remedy for the federal government's past and \n     continuing breaches of its solemn promises to the State of \n     Utah as set forth in this resolution and to provide for the \n     sufficient and necessary funding of Utah's public education \n     system, the Legislature of the state of Utah demands that the \n     federal government imminently transfer title to all of the \n     public lands within Utah's borders directly to the state of \n     Utah. Be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress in the most strenuous terms to \n     engage in good faith communication, cooperation, \n     coordination, and consultation with the state of Utah \n     regarding the transfer of public lands directly to the state \n     of Utah. Be it further\n       Resolved, that, upon transfer of the public lands directly \n     to the state of Utah, the Legislature intends to \n     affirmatively cede the national park lands to the federal \n     government, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the \n     United States Constitution, on condition that the lands \n     permanently remain national park lands, that they not be \n     sold, transferred, left in substantial disrepair, or conveyed \n     to any party other than the state of Utah. Be it further\n       Resolved, that, upon transfer of the public lands directly \n     to the state of Utah, the Legislature intends to \n     affirmatively cede to the federal government all lands \n     currently designated as part of the National Wilderness \n     Preservation System pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1964. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature calls for the creation of a \n     Utah Public Lands Commission to review and manage access, \n     open space, sustainable yields, and the multiple use of the \n     public lands and to determine, through a public process, the \n     extent to which public land may be sold.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine urging the President of the United States \n     and the United States Congress to enact the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2011; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, under current federal law, an individual who \n     receives a Social Security benefit and a public retirement \n     benefit derived from employment not covered under Social \n     Security is subject to a reduction in the individual's Social \n     Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, these laws, known as the Government Pension Offset \n     and the Windfall Elimination Provision, greatly affect public \n     employees and the Government Pension Offset requires a \n     reduction in the spousal benefit received under Social \n     Security equal to 2/3 of the surviving spouse's benefit under \n     another government pension plan even though the spousal \n     benefit was fully earned; and\n       Whereas, the Windfall Elimination Provision reduces the \n     Social Security benefit of a person who is also receiving a \n     pension from a public employer that does not participate in \n     Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision are particularly burdensome on the \n     finances of low-income and moderate-income public service \n     workers such as school teachers, clerical workers and school \n     cafeteria employees; and\n       Whereas, the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision both unfairly reduce benefits for those \n     public employees and their spouses whose careers cross the \n     line between the private and public sectors; and\n       Whereas, since many lower-paying public service jobs are \n     held by women, both the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision have a disproportionately \n     adverse effect on women; and\n       Whereas, in some cases, additional support in the form of \n     income, housing, heating and prescription drug assistance and \n     other safety net assistance from state and local governments \n     is needed to make up for the reductions imposed at the \n     federal level; and\n       Whereas, other participants in Social Security do not have \n     their benefits reduced in this manner; and\n       Whereas, to participate or not to participate in Social \n     Security in public sector employment is a decision of \n     employers, even though both the Government Pension Offset and \n     the Windfall Elimination Provision directly punish employees \n     and their spouses; and\n       Whereas, although the Government Pension Offset was enacted \n     in 1977 and the Windfall Elimination Provision was enacted in\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n     1983, many of the benefits in dispute had been paid into \n     Social Security prior to the enactment of those laws; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 1332, the Social Security Fairness Act of \n     2011, a bipartisan bill introduced in the United States House \n     of Representatives, would repeal these 2 unfair federal \n     pension offsets, which penalize so many people in Maine and \n     the rest of the Nation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress work together to enact the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2011, permitting retention of a \n     combined public pension and Social Security benefit with no \n     applied reductions; and be it further\n       Resolved: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States; the President of the United States Senate; the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; and \n     each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-113. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Colorado memorializing Congress to modify certain \n     reporting procedures for small nonprofit organizations to \n     require the Internal Revenue Service to adequately notify \n     such organizations of the procedures and to allow such \n     organizations to remedy reporting deficiencies; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Senate Joint Memorial No. 12-003\n\n       Whereas, in 2004, the United States Senate Finance \n     Committee issued a white paper proposing reforms to federal \n     oversight of nonprofit organizations; and\n       Whereas, Senator Charles Grassley, Chair of the Senate \n     Finance Committee, encouraged formation of a panel of \n     nonprofit leaders to examine these issues in the white paper \n     and submit recommendations to Congress; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, the Panel on the Nonprofit Sector (panel) \n     issued a ``Report to Congress and the Nonprofit Sector on \n     Governance, Transparency, and Accountability''; and\n       Whereas, as part of its report, the panel recommended that \n     small nonprofit organizations be required to file an annual \n     notice with the Internal Revenue Service. The report also \n     recommended that the Internal Revenue Service should have the \n     authority, ``[a]fter an appropriate phase-in period, . . . to \n     suspend the tax-exempt status of organizations that fail to \n     file the required notification form for three consecutive \n     years''; and\n       Whereas, the panel recommended the annual notice because it \n     ``. . . will assist the IRS in providing more accurate \n     information to the public about organizations eligible to \n     receive tax-deductible contributions''; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Congress adopted the ``Pension Protection \n     Act of 26'' (act), which was based in part on the panel's \n     recommendations; and\n       Whereas, section 1223 of the act, codified at 2006 U.S.C. \n     sec. 6033, created new and unfamiliar annual filing \n     requirements for many small nonprofit organizations by \n     requiring those organizations to annually file Form 990-N, \n     also known as the e-Postcard; and\n       Whereas, the act requires that an affected organization's \n     tax-exempt status ``be considered revoked'' rather than \n     ``suspended'' after failing to file the e-Postcard for three \n     consecutive years; and\n       Whereas, although the Internal Revenue Service sent an \n     initial mailing in 2007 and has since developed other \n     resources to alert these affected nonprofit organizations of \n     the new filing requirements, nonprofit organizations with \n     outdated contact information with the Internal Revenue \n     Service did not receive these notices, and many others were \n     not sufficiently aware of how to comply with their new \n     reporting duties; and\n       Whereas, based on some constituent conversations with \n     Internal Revenue Service representatives and contrary to \n     statements on the Internal Revenue Service's web site, the \n     Internal Revenue Service does not send reminder notices to \n     organizations that do not file their e-Postcards on time and \n     only notifies affected organizations after such revocation \n     has occurred; and\n       Whereas, approximately 400,000 nonprofit organizations \n     across the United States, including thousands of \n     organizations in Colorado, many of which have annual budgets \n     of less than $25,000, have had their tax-exempt status \n     automatically revoked by the Internal Revenue Service for \n     failing to file an annual notice for three consecutive years. \n     Although many of these organizations no longer do business, \n     many other organizations continue to operate and could have \n     successfully maintained their tax-exempt status if they had \n     received more timely notice of the impending revocation; and\n       Whereas, although the Internal Revenue Service allows \n     revoked organizations to apply for retroactive reinstatement \n     of their tax-exempt status, the application process is \n     burdensome and costly for these nonprofit organizations; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-eighth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein,\n       That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly, \n     hereby memorialize the United States Congress to amend 26 \n     U.S.C. sec. 6033 so that:\n       (1) The Internal Revenue Service is required to send timely \n     notification to remind small nonprofit organizations when \n     they have not filed the e-Postcard on time and to inform them \n     of any impending revocation or other action affecting their \n     tax-exempt status due to their failure to file an annual \n     notice for three consecutive years; and\n       (2) The Internal Revenue Service is required to suspend, \n     not revoke, the tax-exempt status of any nonprofit \n     organization that fails to file for three consecutive years \n     so that a nonprofit organization's tax-exempt status may be \n     simply and retroactively restored without the organization \n     being required to reapply for a determination of tax-exempt \n     status; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to \n     each member of Colorado's congressional delegation, Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner, \n     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Secretary of the United \n     States Senate Nancy Erickson, Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives Karen L. Haas, and Treasury \n     Secretary Timothy Geithner.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-114. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging the United States Congress to pass \n     legislation for the fair and constitutional collection of \n     state sales tax by both in-state and remote sellers; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, United States Supreme Court decisions in National \n     Bellas Hess v. Department of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753 (1967) and \n     Quill Corp. v. N.D., 504 U.S. 298 (1992), have ruled that the \n     Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution denies \n     states the authority to require the collection of sales and \n     use taxes by remote sellers that have no physical presence in \n     the taxing state;\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court also declared in \n     the Quill v. North Dakota decision that Congress could \n     exercise its authority under the Commerce Clause of the \n     United States Constitution to decide ``whether, when, and to \n     what extent'' the states may require sales and use tax \n     collection on remote sales;\n       Whereas, states and localities that use sales and use taxes \n     as a revenue source may not collect revenue from some portion \n     of remote sales commerce;\n       Whereas, since 1999, various state legislators, governors, \n     local elected officials, state tax administrators, and \n     representatives of the private sector have worked together as \n     a Streamlined Sales Tax Project and Governing Board to \n     develop a streamlined sales and use tax system currently \n     adopted in some form in 24 states;\n       Whereas, between 2001 and 2002, 40 states enacted \n     legislation expressing their intent to simplify the states' \n     sales and use tax collection systems, and to participate in \n     discussions to allow for the collection of states' sales and \n     use taxes;\n       Whereas, the actions of these states arguably provide some \n     justification for Congress to enact legislation to allow \n     states to require remote sellers to collect the states' sales \n     and use tax;\n       Whereas, any federal legislation should be fair to both in-\n     state and remote sellers, whether such legislation requires \n     sales and use taxes to be collected on a point-of-sales or \n     point-of-delivery basis;\n       Whereas, Congress, in considering federal legislation, \n     should consider the following principles: 1) state-provided \n     or state-certified tax collection and remittance software \n     that is simple to implement and maintain; 2) immunity from \n     civil liability for retailers utilizing state-provided or \n     state-certified software in tax collection and remittance; 3) \n     tax audit accountability to a single state tax audit \n     authority; 4) elimination of interstate tax complexity by \n     streamlining taxable good categories; 5) adoption of a \n     meaningful small business exception so that small businesses \n     that sell remotely are not adversely affected by the \n     legislation; and 6) fair compensation to the tax-collecting \n     retailer;\n       Whereas, the Utah State Legislature and some of its sister \n     legislatures in other states have acknowledged the \n     complexities of the current sales and use tax system, have \n     formulated varied alternative collection systems, and have \n     shown the political will to make changes in their respective \n     sales and use tax systems;\n       Whereas, the enactment of legislation by Congress and the \n     President that allows states to require remote sellers to \n     collect the states' sales and use taxes, will facilitate the \n     states' ability to enforce their current laws for collecting \n     sales and use taxes on remote sales;\n       Whereas, requiring remote sellers to collect the sales and \n     use taxes may broaden Utah's sales tax base and potentially \n     enable the Utah State Legislature to lower sales and use tax \n     rates; and\n       Whereas, empowering states to collect sales and use taxes \n     on in-state and remote sales is consistent with the 10th \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution and is a states' \n     rights issue: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Utah State Legislature urges the United \n     States House of Representatives and the United States Senate \n     to pass, without delay, and the President of the United \n     States to sign, federal legislation that provides for the \n     fair and constitutional collection of state sales and use \n     taxes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     that, in passing such legislation, Congress consider the \n     following principles: 1) state-provided or state-certified \n     tax collection and remittance software that is\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\n     simple to implement and maintain; 2) immunity from civil \n     liability for retailers utilizing state-provided or state-\n     certified software in tax collection and remittance; 3) tax \n     audit accountability to a single state tax audit authority; \n     4) elimination of interstate tax complexity by streamlining \n     taxable good categories; 5) adoption of a meaningful small \n     business exception so that small businesses that sell \n     remotely are not adversely affected by the legislation; and \n     6) fair compensation to the tax-collecting retailer; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, \n     recognizing that such legislation may not include all of \n     these principles, declares that Congress's passage of the \n     legislation will help create consistent standards for \n     retailers forced to collect state sales and use taxes whether \n     on a point-of-delivery basis or a point-of-sale basis, thus \n     leveling the playing field between in-state and remote \n     sellers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution be sent to the President of \n     the United States, the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-115. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah supporting Social Security reform measures; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is the largest single item in the \n     federal budget;\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 2011, the federal government spent \n     $730 billion on Social Security, or 20% of the total $3.6 \n     trillion federal budget;\n       Whereas, over the next 75 years, Social Security's unfunded \n     liability is $6.5 trillion;\n       Whereas, Social Security has been running a deficit since \n     2010 and will be incurring annual deficits permanently unless \n     the system is reformed;\n       Whereas, opponents of Social Security reform argue that \n     Social Security has a $2.6 trillion trust fund that is backed \n     by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, \n     but these government bonds are simply obligations that the \n     federal government owes itself, so redeeming these Treasury \n     IOU's requires the federal government to cut spending \n     elsewhere, raise taxes, issue more debt to the public, or \n     monetize debt through the Federal Reserve;\n       Whereas, reform opponents have also falsely claimed that \n     Social Security has not added a single penny to the deficit \n     because Social Security is legally prohibited from deficit \n     spending, but Social Security is now operating at a deficit \n     on a cash basis;\n       Whereas, while reform opponents counter that the Social \n     Security Trust Fund paid $118 billion in interest in 2010 and \n     about $115 billion in interest in 2011, but these payments \n     are not real money, but are accounting mechanisms that \n     transfer phantom money from one government account to \n     another;\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office projects federal \n     government non-interest spending to reach 25% of the Gross \n     Domestic Product in 2035;\n       Whereas, including interest, federal spending will reach \n     34% of the Gross Domestic Product;\n       Whereas, since these levels are not sustainable, Congress \n     must slow the growth in federal spending;\n       Whereas, Representative Jason Chaffetz has announced his \n     proposals for Social Security reform that he plans to \n     introduce as legislation in the United States Congress;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform implements longevity indexing \n     by increasing normal retirement age from 67 for those born in \n     1960, to 68 for those born in 1966, and to 69 for those born \n     in 1972;\n       Whereas, in years after 1972, the normal retirement age is \n     increased one month every two years, while keeping early \n     retirement age unchanged at 62;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform changes the cost of living \n     allowance calculation from the Consumer Price Index for Urban \n     Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to chained CPI-W \n     which is a more accurate representation of inflation;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform adds an additional bend point \n     at the 50th percentile for calculating the primary insurance \n     amount;\n       Whereas, for workers with lifetime earnings above the 50th \n     percentile, the primary insurance amount grows across \n     generations by a combination of the CPI-W growth and average \n     wage growth instead of just average wage growth;\n       Whereas, change begins for newly eligible retirees in 2016 \n     and ends in 2055;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform increases the number of years \n     from 35 to 40 that are included for calculation of Average \n     Indexed monthly earnings by adding one additional \n     computational year for those becoming eligible in 2012, 2014, \n     2016, 2018, and 2020;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform indexes the special minimum \n     benefit to wages instead of CPI beginning in 2012;\n       Whereas, in 2011, the special minimum benefits were $791 \n     per month for 30 years of coverage and $394 per month for 20 \n     years of coverage;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform allows for five years of child \n     care to be included as creditable coverage if not already \n     creditable;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform increases benefits by 5% for \n     beneficiaries starting at age 85;\n       Whereas, the proposed reform implements an annual means \n     test that reduces the benefit up to 50% for couples earning \n     more than $360,000 in the most recent tax year;\n       Whereas, total Social Security benefits would continue to \n     grow but at a slower rate, allowing the system to avoid \n     insolvency;\n       Whereas, the vast majority of retirees, particularly those \n     with average or below average lifetime earnings, would \n     receive a larger check than they are getting today;\n       Whereas, some will actually receive an increase over what \n     they would be getting without reform;\n       Whereas, using current benefits as a baseline and adjusting \n     these benefits for inflation, middle and lower income \n     retirees in future years will get essentially the same or \n     better benefits than current retirees; and\n       Whereas, these measures must be taken very soon in order \n     for the Social Security system to avoid an otherwise \n     inevitable collapse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses support for the Social Security reform measures \n     proposed by Congressman Jason Chaffetz, and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing support for the establishment \n     of a fund for the assistance of families of fallen police \n     officers in Utah; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the Utah 1033 Foundation is named for the police \n     radio code for an officer in trouble;\n       Whereas, this non-profit foundation was established with \n     private donations and is sustained through a combination of \n     continuing\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\n     donations, corporate donors, institutional grant funding, and \n     fundraising events;\n       Whereas, the primary purpose of the 1033 Foundation is to \n     help the families of slain police officers in Utah;\n       Whereas, the day after the death of a police officer in the \n     line of duty, someone from the Foundation will visit the \n     widow or widower and deliver a $25,000 check;\n       Whereas, eventually, the Foundation hopes to have an \n     endowment to provide college scholarships for the children of \n     living and deceased Utah police officers;\n       Whereas, it is also hoped that in the future it will be \n     possible to extend the Foundation's service to include the \n     families of fallen firefighters;\n       Whereas, the fund began as an idea of Tore and Mona Steen, \n     residents of Park City;\n       Whereas, a native of Norway, Tore received a scholarship \n     after serving in that nation's air force and moved to the \n     United States to attend college;\n       Whereas, Tore enjoyed great success in the banking and \n     financial industries, and while living in New York, he was \n     involved in advisory capacities with the departments of \n     police, corrections, and housing;\n       Whereas, as a result of these experiences, and after being \n     invited to ride with two New York City police officers who \n     were called to a domestic dispute, Tore realized, in a small \n     but very real and personal way, what dangers police officers \n     can face every day;\n       Whereas, many years later, the husband of Mona's daughter's \n     former college roommate, a Colorado Springs police detective, \n     was slain while trying to apprehend a suspect wanted for \n     attempted murder;\n       Whereas, these brushes with the tragedy and devastation \n     brought to the families of officers killed in the line of \n     duty drove the Steens to form the 1033 Foundation;\n       Whereas, their efforts continue with the help of many \n     others, including Wade Carpenter, Park City Police Chief; the \n     Law Firm of Van Cott, Bagley, Cornwall & McCarthy, P.C.; and \n     Zions Bank;\n       Whereas, the 1033 Foundation has made it easy for \n     individuals and organizations to donate to the fund by going \n     to utah1033.org; and\n       Whereas, by providing financial and, eventually, \n     scholarship assistance, the 1033 Foundation hopes to provide \n     a means to lift some of the crushing burdens upon the \n     families of Utah's police officers killed in the line of \n     duty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, expresses support for the \n     efforts of the 1033 Foundation to assist the families of \n     fallen police officers in Utah in their moments of greatest \n     need; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     appreciation to Tore and Mona Steen, who saw a need and \n     became personally invested in serving the families of slain \n     police officers in Utah, and wish them well in their \n     continuing efforts to serve the citizens of Utah; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     appreciation to those who have participated in the efforts of \n     the 1033 Foundation and made donations to help those in need; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to Tore \n     and Mona Steen; Park City Police Chief Wade Carpenter; the \n     Law Firm of Van Cott, Bagley, Cornwall & McCarthy; Zions Bank \n     President Scott Anderson; Park City Mayor Dana Williams; \n     Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds; KPMG Salt Lake City; Utah \n     Department of Public Safety Director Lance Davenport; Colonel \n     Danny Fuhr of the Utah Highway Patrol; the Utah Chiefs of \n     Police Association; the Utah Sheriffs Association; the Utah \n     Peace Officers Association; the Utah Highway Patrol; Utah \n     Fraternal Order of Police; Howard Wallack; and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-125. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California calling on the United States Congress \n     to pass the Violence Against Women Act of 2011; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was \n     developed with the input of advocates from around the country \n     and from all walks of life, and addresses the real and most \n     important needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, dating violence, and stalking. VAWA is responsive, \n     streamlined, and constitutionally and fiscally sound, while \n     providing strong accountability measures and appropriate \n     federal government oversight; and\n       Whereas, VAWA represents the voices of women and their \n     families, and the voices of victims, survivors, and \n     advocates; and\n       Whereas, VAWA was first enacted in 1994, and has been the \n     centerpiece of the federal government's efforts to stamp out \n     domestic and sexual violence. Critical programs authorized \n     under VAWA include support for victim services, transitional \n     housing, and legal assistance; and\n       Whereas, Domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and stalking, once considered private matters to be \n     dealt with behind closed doors, have been brought out of the \n     darkness; and\n       Whereas, VAWA has been successful because it has had \n     consistently strong, bipartisan support for nearly two \n     decades; and\n       Whereas, The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n     2011 will provide a five-year reauthorization for VAWA \n     programs, and reduce authorized funding levels by more than \n     $144 million, or 19 percent, from the law's 2005 \n     authorization; and\n       Whereas, While annual rates of domestic violence have \n     dropped more than 50 percent, domestic violence remains a \n     serious issue. Every day in the United States, three women \n     are killed by abusive husbands and partners. In California in \n     2010, there were 166,361 domestic violence calls, including \n     more than 65,000 that involved a weapon; and\n       Whereas, The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n     2011 includes several updates and improvements to the law, \n     including the following:\n       (a) An emphasis on the need to effectively respond to \n     sexual assault crime by adding new purpose areas and a 25 \n     percent set-aside in the STOP (Services, Training, Officers, \n     and Prosecutors) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program \n     (STOP Program) and the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies \n     and Enforcement of Protection Orders Program.\n       (b) Improvements in tools to prevent domestic violence \n     homicides by training law enforcement, victim service \n     providers, and court personnel to identify and manage high-\n     risk offenders and connecting high-risk victims to crisis \n     intervention services.\n       (c) Improvements in responses to the high rate of violence \n     against women in tribal communities by strengthening \n     concurrent tribal criminal jurisdiction over perpetrators who \n     assault Indian spouses and dating partners in Indian \n     countries.\n       (d) Measures to strengthen housing protections for victims \n     by applying existing housing protections to nine additional \n     federal housing programs.\n       (e) Measures to promote accountability to ensure that \n     federal funds are used for their intended purposes.\n       (f) Consolidation of programs and reductions in \n     authorization levels to address fiscal concerns, and renewed \n     focus on programs that have been most successful.\n       (g) Technical corrections to update definitions throughout \n     the law to provide uniformity and continuity; and\n       Whereas, There is a need to maintain services for victims \n     and families at the local, state, and federal levels. \n     Reauthorization would allow existing programs to continue \n     uninterrupted, and would provide for the development of new \n     initiatives to address key areas of concern. These \n     initiatives include the following:\n       (a) Addressing the high rates of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, and sexual assault among women 16 to 24 years of \n     age, inclusive, by combating tolerant youth attitudes toward \n     violence.\n       (b) Improving the response to sexual assault with best \n     practices, training, and communication tools for law \n     enforcement, as well as health care and legal professionals.\n       (c) Preventing domestic violence homicides through enhanced \n     training for law enforcement, advocates, and others who \n     interact with those at risk. A growing number, of experts \n     agree that these homicides are predictable, and therefore \n     preventable, if we know the warning signs: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature calls on the United \n     States Congress to pass the Violence Against Women \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011, Senate Bill No. 1925 authored by \n     Senators Leahy and Crapo, and ensure the sustainability of \n     vital programs designed to keep women and families safe from \n     violence and abuse; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, and to the author for appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-126. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to prevent the \n     retirement of A-10 aircraft assigned to the 917th Fighter \n     Group, based at Barksdale Air Force Base; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 115\n\n       Whereas, established in 1932, the Barksdale Air Force Base \n     (AFB), a United States Air Force Base located approximately \n     4.72 miles east-southeast of Bossier City, Louisiana, is \n     named for World War I aviator and test pilot 2nd Lieutenant \n     Eugene Hoy Barksdale (1896-1926); and\n       Whereas, Barksdale Air Force Base has proudly served \n     Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas for more than sixty-seven \n     years and is home to the 2d Bomb Wing, 2d Mission Support \n     Group, 2d Operations Group, 2d Maintenance Group, the 2d \n     Medical Group, 8th Air Force Museum, and the Air Force \n     Reserve's 917th Wing; and\n       Whereas, in December 1999, the 917th Wing received the Air \n     Force outstanding Unit Award, for winning the Chief of Staff \n     Team Excellence Award and Secretary of Defense Award for \n     Self-Inspection Tracking System. The award noted the unit's \n     sponsorship of the Starbase program, which creates interest \n     for local children in math, science, and technology by using \n     an aviation theme; and\n       Whereas, Barksdale Air Force Base has grown into a major \n     source of revenue and employment for the region by providing \n     jobs for nearly ten thousand military and civilian employees \n     and in 2006, under Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the \n     917th Wing\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\n     gained eight A-10 aircraft and a number of full-time and \n     part-time employment positions; and\n       Whereas, as part of a wide-ranging plan to reduce its total \n     aircraft inventory, the Obama administration intends to \n     propose in the 2013 budget request, the elimination of \n     twenty-four A-10 aircraft that comprise the Air Force \n     Reserve's 917th Fighter Group at Barksdale Air Force Base; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Air Force plans to rebalance its overall ratio \n     of regular, reserve, and Air National Guard forces at about \n     sixty installations in thirty-three states and retire two \n     hundred twenty-seven aircraft to support a new defense \n     strategy known as the ``Air Force Strategy and Structure \n     Overview''; and\n       Whereas, for nearly eighty years the 917th Wing at \n     Barksdale Air Force Base and the Shreveport-Bossier community \n     have enjoyed a strong partnership, which provides jobs to the \n     community and programs for the local children, and the \n     elimination of the A-10 aircraft will have an adverse effect \n     on not only the economy but the community as well. Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize congress to take such actions as are necessary to \n     oppose the elimination of A-10 aircraft assigned to the 917th \n     Fighter Group, based at Barksdale Air Force Base; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-127. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the United States Congress to \n     immediately enact the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act \n     of 2011; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 18\n\n       Whereas, Many families are searching for a way to plan for \n     the future of a child with developmental disabilities, which \n     are costly to society and to families; and\n       Whereas, The Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2011 \n     (ABLE Act), proposed in H.R. 3423 and S. 1872 and currently \n     debated by Congress, would create disability savings accounts \n     for individuals with developmental or other disabilities and \n     their families, as a way to save for future needs with funds \n     that could accrue interest tax free; and\n       Whereas, The ABLE Act would give individuals with \n     developmental or other disabilities and their families an \n     option for saving for their future financial needs in a way \n     that supports their unique situation and makes it more \n     feasible to live full and productive lives in their \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, While many families are currently able to save for \n     the educational needs of children through ``529'' college \n     tuition plans, these plans do not fit the needs of children \n     with developmental or other disabilities; and\n       Whereas, Many families recognize that loved ones with \n     developmental or other disabilities may live for many decades \n     beyond the ability of the parents or other family members to \n     provide financial assistance and support; and\n       Whereas, Many families also want to ensure the financial \n     security of family members who have the level of disability \n     required for Medicaid eligibility, but for now, are managing \n     to function without the use of those benefits and state \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, The ABLE Act would create a savings fund for those \n     with developmental or other disabilities that could be drawn \n     upon for a variety of essential expenses, including medical \n     and dental care, education and employment training and \n     support, assistive technology, housing and transportation, \n     personal support services, and other expenses for life \n     necessities; and\n       Whereas, Savings accounts opened under the ABLE Act would \n     provide substantial flexibility to meet the specific needs of \n     the individual, with a broad array of allowable expenses and \n     no age limitations so that these funds can be used whenever \n     they are needed; and\n       Whereas, The flexibility in expenses would also allow \n     families to save with confidence even though they cannot \n     always predict how independent their child will become: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to immediately enact \n     the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2011 (ABLE \n     Act); and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the President pro Tempore of the United \n     States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     author for appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-128.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to more \neffectively regulate anabolic steroids; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nHatch in introducing the bipartisan Designer Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct of 2012. This measure will help keep American children and families \nsafe from dangerous designer drugs that masquerade as healthy dietary \nsupplements. This legislation is based on Senator Specter's work in the \nprevious Congress, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Doctors and scientists have long recognized the health hazards of \nnon-medical use of anabolic steroids. For that reason, Congress has \npreviously acted to ensure that these drugs are listed as controlled \nsubstances. Nonetheless, according to investigative reporting and \nCongressional testimony, a loophole in current law allows for designer \nanabolic steroids to easily be found on the Internet, in gyms, and even \nin retail stores.\n  Designer steroids are produced by reverse engineering existing \nillegal steroids and then slightly modifying the chemical composition, \nso that the resulting product is not on the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's, DEA, list of controlled substances. When taken by \nconsumers, designer steroids can cause serious medical consequences, \nincluding liver injury and increased risk of heart attack and stroke. \nThey may also lead to psychological effects such as aggression, \nhostility, and addiction.\n  These designer products can be even more dangerous than traditional \nsteroids because they are often untested, produced from overseas raw \nmaterials, and manufactured without quality controls. As one witness \ntestified at a Crime Subcommittee hearing in the last Congress, ``all \nit takes to cash in on the storefront steroid craze is a credit card to \nimport raw products from China or India where most of the raw \ningredients come from, the ability to pour powders into a bottle or \npill and a printer to create shiny, glossy labels.''\n  The unscrupulous actors responsible for manufacturing and selling \nthese products often market them with misleading and inaccurate labels. \nThat can cause consumers who are looking for a healthy supplement--not \njust elite athletes, but also high school students, law enforcement \npersonnel, and mainstream Americans--to be deceived into taking these \ndangerous products.\n  Loopholes in existing law allow these dangerous designer steroids to \nevade regulation. Under current law, in order to classify new \nsubstances as steroids, the DEA must complete a burdensome and time-\nconsuming series of chemical and pharmacological testing. As a DEA \nofficial testified before Congress: ``in the time that it takes DEA to \nadministratively schedule an anabolic steroid used in a dietary \nsupplement product, several new products can enter the market to take \nthe place of those products.''\n  The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012 would quickly \nprotect consumers from these dangerous products. First, it would \nimmediately place 27 known designer anabolic steroids on the list of \ncontrolled substances. Second, it would grant the DEA authority to \ntemporarily schedule new designer steroids on the controlled substances \nlist, so that if bad actors develop new variations, these products can \nbe removed from the market. Third, it would create new penalties for \nimporting, manufacturing, or distributing anabolic steroid's under \nfalse labels.\n  Senator Hatch and I have worked closely with a range of consumer and \nindustry organizations to ensure that this legislation would not \ninterfere with consumers' access to legitimate dietary supplements. I \nam pleased that the measure has been endorsed by the United States \nAnti-Doping Agency, the Alliance for Natural Health, the Council for \nResponsible Nutrition, the American Herbal Products Association, the \nNatural Products Association, the Consumer Health Products Association, \nand the United Natural Products Alliance.\n  I thank these organizations for their support, and look forward to \nworking with them, with Senator Hatch, and with colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle to enact this common sense measure into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                          American Herbal Products\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, July 23, 2012.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Whitehouse, This letter is to \n     communicate to you the support of the American Herbal \n     Products Association (AHPA) for your pending legislation, the \n     Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012. AHPA \n     recognizes the need to more effectively regulate anabolic \n     steroids, as this bill's amendment of the Controlled \n     Substances Act would do. The expanded controls on these \n     substances that would be implemented by your legislation \n     would protect consumers by better ensuring that these are not \n     misrepresented as legitimate dietary supplements, when \n     clearly they are not.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything \n     that AHPA and its members can do to assist in the passage of \n     this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael McGuffin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Natural Products Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2012.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Hatch, I write today on behalf of the Natural \n     Products Association (NPA) to thank you for introducing the \n     Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012 (DASCA). As the \n     leading representative of the dietary supplement industry \n     with over 1,900 members, including suppliers and retailers of \n     vitamins and other dietary supplements, NPA works to ensure \n     that consumers have access to safe dietary supplements. We \n     believe that this bill will make the marketplace safer.\n       Our support for this legislation demonstrates NPA's \n     commitment to removing anabolic steroids, which are not \n     dietary ingredients, from the market. NPA has worked in \n     conjunction with the FDA to bring attention to spiked \n     products masquerading as dietary supplements. This bill helps \n     protect consumers who believe they are purchasing ``legal'' \n     supplements but may suffer health effects from steroid use.\n       Even with the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act \n     of 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has \n     removed very few substances. The DEA has to follow a strict \n     set of testing standards to schedule a substance and remove \n     it from the market. This process can take up to three years \n     to complete; but while this process is taking place, the \n     products remain on the market. This bill gives the DEA the \n     power to temporarily remove products from the market while \n     testing is completed, giving them the ability to stay ahead \n     of the individuals who are creating these designer drugs.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation and \n     your tireless work on behalf of the dietary supplement \n     industry.\n           Regards,\n                                                        John Shaw,\n                                   NPA Executive Director and CEO.\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                            Council for Responsible Nutrition,\n\n                                                    July 20, 2012.\n     Re Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act (DASCA).\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Whitehouse: On behalf of the \n     Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) \\1\\ and its members, \n     I am writing to express our support for the Designer Anabolic \n     Steroid Control Act (DASCA). We want to thank you both for \n     your commitment to providing the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA) with new authority to place designer \n     anabolic steroids on the Controlled Substance Schedules more \n     expeditiously and providing that agency with new tools to \n     quickly respond when new anabolic substances are introduced. \n     This legislation will provide DEA with new enforcement tools \n     to prosecute irresponsible and disreputable companies that \n     develop and market anabolic steroids as products labeled as \n     dietary supplements. Your efforts in this regard are \n     laudable, and CRN stands in support of your legislation.\n       Misbranded products that contain designer anabolic steroids \n     present serious health risks to consumers, particularly young \n     men who are unaware of the dangers of anabolic steroid use. \n     Maintaining the trust of consumers in the safety and benefit \n     of dietary supplements is essential to preserving a vibrant \n     market for legitimate dietary supplements. Currently, \n     unscrupulous companies can design these illicit substances \n     and illegally introduce them into the dietary supplement \n     marketplace before DEA can demonstrate their anabolic effects \n     and declare them controlled substances under the present law. \n     We believe DASCA's provisions will go a long way to help DEA \n     more quickly identify and restrict new designer anabolic \n     steroids by declaring them to be ``controlled substances.'' \n     It will allow DEA to target substances whose chemical \n     structures mimic other anabolic steroids and whose \n     manufacturers and marketers promote their anabolic or muscle-\n     building effects. This legislation will assuage concerns of \n     Americans who use sports supplements, and foster an even \n     greater working relationship between FDA, DEA and \n     responsible, mainstream industry. DASCA is strong step \n     forward, adding teeth to prevention and enforcement efforts \n     in the battle against steroid abuse.\n       CRN understands that you intend to request this legislation \n     be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose \n     jurisdiction traditionally handles DEA and controlled \n     substance issues. We hope the committee will give the \n     legislation expedient and thoughtful consideration on its way \n     to passage by the full Senate, and are eager to work with \n     your office to ensure that the Judiciary Committee \n     understands the concerns of industry and consumers that have \n     led to this bill. CRN stands ready to work with you and all \n     of Congress to deliver a strong bill to the President.\n       Please don't hesitate to contact me or Mike Greene on my \n     staff at 202-204-7690 or mgreene@crnusa.org if CRN may be of \n     any assistance in your endeavors.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Steve Mister,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             United Natural Products Alliance,\n\n                                Salt Lake city, UT, July 23, 2012.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Whitehouse and Hatch: Thank you for your \n     considerable efforts to draft the ``Designer Anabolic Steroid \n     Control Act of 2012'' and to close loopholes that might allow \n     continued sale of anabolic steroids, steroid lookalikes or \n     steroid precursors--all of which are a significant threat to \n     public health. We greatly commend your work.\n       The United Natural Products Alliance has appreciated the \n     opportunity to work with you in developing this bill. As you \n     know, sale of the products it would address are a significant \n     concern to our members who believe, quite simply, these \n     products should be outlawed.\n       We have reviewed your most recent legislation and wanted to \n     advise you we are completely in support of the goals of this \n     legislation. We do have minor drafting concerns, which have \n     been shared with your staff, and we appreciate their \n     commitment to address these issues as the legislation moves \n     forward.\n       Thank you again for your work on this important issue.\n           Kind regards,\n                                                  Loren Israelsen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Consumers Healthcare\n\n\n                                         Products Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2012.\n     Hon.

Orrin Hatch,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Whitehouse and Hatch: On behalf of the more \n     than 200 members of the Consumer Healthcare Products \n     Association, the 131-year-old trade association representing \n     the leading U.S. manufacturers and distributors of over-the-\n     counter (OTC) medicines and dietary supplements, thank you \n     for sponsoring the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act \n     (DASCA).\n       This important legislation would designate additional \n     chemicals as anabolic steroids, and increase the penalties \n     for violators of anabolic steroid labeling laws, specifically \n     those rogue supplement manufacturers that ``spike'' their \n     products with anabolic steroids and attempt to pass them off \n     as dietary supplements. We applaud introduction of this \n     legislation to further protect the public health of our \n     citizens, and pledge to work closely with you and your staff \n     to advance this bill.\n       Please do not hesitate to call on us if you need any \n     assistance, and thank you, again, for your leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                Scott M.

Orrin Hatch,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Alliance for Natural Health USA \n     strongly supports the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act \n     (DASCA) of 2012. Not only are anabolic steroids masquerading \n     as nutritional supplements illegal, they also risk the health \n     of those who use them, and tarnish the reputation of the \n     dietary supplement industry. The harm from these steroid-\n     tainted supplements is real. Health risks include serious \n     liver injury, stroke, kidney failure, and pulmonary embolism.\n       It is clear that the complex and cumbersome regulatory \n     system has failed to stop designer anabolic steroids. We \n     understand that your bill closes the loopholes in laws that \n     currently allow the creation and easy distribution of \n     anabolic steroids masquerading as dietary supplements.\n       We are thankful for the opportunity to discuss the bill \n     with your staff, and support its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gretchen DuBeau,\n     Executive and Legal Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             United States Anti-Doping Agency,\n\n                              Colorado Springs, CO, July 23, 2012.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch and Senator Whitehouse: On behalf of the \n     United States Anti-Doping Agency (``USADA''), I am writing to \n     express our full support for the Designer Anabolic Control \n     Steroid Act of 2012. As the Congressionally recognized \n     independent anti-doping agency for the U.S. Olympic, \n     Paralympic and Pan American movement, USADA represents \n     literally millions of participants including athletes, \n     coaches and sports organizers who want to ensure sport in \n     this country continues to be a teacher of life lessons for \n     participants at all ages, is safe and drug free and that \n     clean athletes can compete and win without having to resort \n     to using dangerous performance enhancing drugs.\n       As we have seen over the last few years the current law \n     regulating dietary supplements has been exploited by rogue \n     manufacturers who have produced and sold products \n     masquerading as otherwise safe and legitimate dietary \n     supplements that are not but are in fact illegal products \n     containing steroids and other prohibited performance \n     enhancing drugs. This legislation is important to USADA and \n     our mission in order to close this loophole and ensure these \n     fly-by-night operations cannot easily and without risk \n     continue to produce these products.\n       We greatly appreciate your efforts in drafting and \n     introducing the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012 \n     and look forward to assisting you in any way possible to \n     achieve its passage into law at the earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Travis T. Tygart,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Designer \nAnabolic Steroid Control Act of 2012, DASCA, introduced by Senator \nWhitehouse. The use of anabolic steroids or dietary supplements that \ncontain designer steroids may trigger numerous adverse health effects, \nand thus Congress has passed legislation over the years to address \nthese chemicals.\n  The Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, continues to investigate and \nuncover dietary supplement products that contain either controlled \nanabolic steroids or designer steroids that are structurally similar to \ntestosterone. In the tin that it takes the DEA to administratively \nschedule an anabolic steroid used in a dietary supplement product, \nseveral new products can enter the market to take its place. Certain \nindividuals have taken advantage of this\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nlengthy DEA administrative process by continuing to create and market \nnew derivative products by substituting and altering the testosterone \nmolecule and then marketing them as ``dietary supplements.'' Very \noften, these new formulations have not been adequately tested.\n  I worked in the previous Congress on legislation to address this \nissue and continued that work with Senator Whitehouse to develop a bill \nthat would amend the Controlled Substances Act to expand the list of \nsubstances defined as anabolic steroids, and authorize the Attorney \nGeneral to issue a temporary order adding a drug or substance to the \nlist of anabolic steroids. The bill would also create new criminal and \ncivil penalties for importing, manufacturing, or selling any product \ncontaining an anabolic steroid unless it bears a label clearly \nidentifying the chemicals contained in the product.\n  This bill is supported by American Herbal Products Association, AHPA, \nNatural Products Association, NPA, Council for Responsible Nutrition, \nCRN, United Natural Products Alliance, UNPA, Consumer Healthcare \nProducts Association, CHPA, Alliance for Natural Health, ANH, and the \nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 3433. A bill to require a radio spectrum inventory of bands \nmanaged by the Federal Communications Commission and the National \nTelecommunications & Information Administration; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Warner, to \nreintroduce the Radio Spectrum Inventory Act. Simply put, in order to \nmake more spectrum available to meet the growing demand for wireless \nbroadband and other radio-based services, decision makers at the FCC, \nNTIA, and Congress must have a clear, detailed, up-to-date \nunderstanding of how spectrum is currently being used and by whom--data \nessential to sound policy decisions.\n  Specifically, the Radio Spectrum Inventory Act directs the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, with assistance from the Office of \nScience and Technology, to create a comprehensive and accurate \ninventory of each spectrum band, at a minimum, between 300 Megahertz to \n6.5 Gigahertz. The information collected would include the licenses \nassigned in that band, number and type of end-user devices deployed, \namount of deployed infrastructure, type of missions and activities \nsupported in the band, as well as any relevant unlicensed end user \ndevices operating in the band. This information is fundamental to \nconstructing a comprehensive framework for spectrum policy.\n  The Radio Spectrum Inventory Act also provides more transparency \nrelated to spectrum use by creating a centralized website or portal \nthat would include relevant spectrum and license information accessible \nby the public. Given that radio spectrum is a public good, we are \nobligated to provide the public more clarity and accountability on how \nit is being utilized by both Federal and non-Federal licensees. But let \nme be clear, given the sensitive nature of some spectrum assignments \nand allocations, this bill makes the appropriate disclosure exceptions \nfor spectrum utilized or reserved for national security and public \nsafety activities.\n  A comprehensive inventory is a critical step in reforming our \nspectrum policy and management. The FCC manages over 2 million active \nlicenses and NTIA administers more than 450,000 frequency assignments. \nAnd while I appreciate the FCC's effort in conducting a ``baseline'' \ninventory and NTIA's evaluation--both the fast track and ten year \nplan--I do not believe they are sufficient substitutes to conducting a \nfull inventory since those efforts were limited in scope and seemingly \ndidn't capture or make available more detailed data on spectrum use.\n  In addition, there has been a growing call for a comprehensive \nspectrum inventory from Members of Congress, former FCC officials, and \nindustry--even the House Energy & Commerce Committee bipartisan Federal \nSpectrum Working Group requested what amounts to a complete inventory \nof Federal frequency assignments between 300 MHz and 3 GHz. But if we \nare to examine Federal use, we must also look at non-Federal use in \norder to gain a truly comprehensive picture and understanding of the \nheterogeneous spectrum ecosystem.\n  The ultimate goals this legislation sets the path towards achieving \nare to implement more efficient use of spectrum and to locate \nadditional spectrum to meet the future demands of all spectrum users--\ncommercial, Federal, and military. A comprehensive inventory would \nyield a significant amount more of data that would be extremely useful \nfor conducting measurements, implementing more robust management, and \ndeveloping greater strategic planning of spectrum resources.\n  With the enactment of P.L. 112-96 earlier this year, Congress took a \nnotable but incremental step in an effort to free up additional \nspectrum to meet the growing demand of wireless broadband. As I have \nstated before, I believe more can and must be done to meet the future \nneeds of all spectrum users and properly address existing spectrum \nchallenges. This includes a comprehensive spectrum inventory, more \nstrategic and longterm planning of spectrum resources, and greater \ncollaboration between the FCC and NTIA. In addition, we must also \ncontinually promote more investment in infrastructure and foster \ngreater technical innovation. That is why I sincerely hope that my \ncolleagues join Senator Warner and me in supporting this critical \nlegislation and continuing our focus on implementing spectrum reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 3439. A bill to amend title 40, United States Code, to direct the \nAdministrator of General Services to install Wi-Fi hotspots and \nwireless neutral host systems in all Federal buildings in order to \nimprove in-building wireless communications coverage and commercial \nnetwork capacity by offloading wireless traffic onto wireline broadband \nnetworks; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Warner, to \nreintroduce pro-consumer wireless legislation, which will improve \nwireless coverage indoors. Specifically, the Federal Wi-Net Act would \nrequire the installation of small wireless base stations, such as \nfemtocells or similar technologies, and Wi-Fi hot-spots in all publicly \naccessible Federal buildings to improve wireless coverage and network \ncapacity.\n  Over the past several years, there has been growing concern about a \nlooming spectrum crisis given the significant growth in the wireless \nindustry. Currently, there are more than 331 million wireless \nsubscribers in the U.S., and American consumers used more than 2.3 \ntrillion minutes in 2010--that is more than 6.4 billion minutes per \nday. And while the foundation for wireless services has been voice \ncommunication, more subscribers are utilizing it for broadband. \nAccording to Cisco, global mobile data traffic grew 159 percent in \n2010, nearly tripling for the third year in a row. That growth is only \nexpected to continue--there is expected to be over seven billion mobile \ndevices globally by 2015 producing more than six exabytes per month. To \nput it in context, all the words ever spoken by human beings would \nequate to five exabytes worth of data.\n  To meet this growing demand, a multi-faceted solution is required \nthat includes fostering technological advancement and more robust \nspectrum management. Technologies, such as femtocells, distributed \nantenna system, DAS, and Wi-Fi hotspots, will help alleviate growing \nwireless demand by offloading that traffic onto wireline broadband \nnetworks. The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission \nrecently announced plans to open a proceeding on utilizing small cells \nin the 3.5 GHz band. And a recent spectrum report by the President's \nCouncil of Advisors on Science and Technology, PCAST, highlighted how \nreducing cell sizes of wireless networks to femtocell or Wi-Fi ranges \ncould provide 400 times as much aggregate network capacity than current \nmacro cells network topologies.\n  To that point, the need is there--approximately 40 percent of cell \nphone\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\ncalls are made indoors and more than 26 percent of U.S. households have \n``cut-the-cord,'' relying solely on cell phones to make voice calls. On \nthe data side, Cisco's Virtual Network Index reports approximately 60 \npercent of mobile Internet use is done inside--either at home or at \nwork. Consumers are also utilizing Wi-Fi more frequently--more than 80 \npercent of smartphone users prefer Wi-Fi connections over cellular for \nmobile data usage, and approximately 75 percent of tablet users use Wi-\nFi connections only. In addition, several new tablets, such as the \nMicrosoft Surface, Google Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy Tab, were \nintroduced as Wi-Fi only versions.\n  As the FCC's National Broadband Plan highlights, most smartphones \nsold today have Wi-Fi capabilities to take advantage of the growing \nubiquity of Wi-Fi routers and devices. According to a May 2011 report \nfrom comScore, approximately 48 percent of all iPhone traffic was \ntransported over Wi-Fi/LAN networks. So installing more mini-base \nstations, such as femtocells, DAS, and Wi-Fi hotspots will improve \nindoor coverage and wireless network capacity. It will also increase \nbattery life of phones and tablets since the indoor signal will be \nstronger so devices will use less power.\n  The increasing importance of wireless communications and broadband \nhas a direct correlation to our nation's competitiveness, economy, and \nnational security and therefore demands we make the appropriate changes \nto current spectrum policy and management to avert a spectrum crisis \nand continue to realize the boundless benefits of spectrum-based \nservices. Congress has taken some steps but more must be done. That is \nwhy I sincerely hope that my colleagues join Senator Warner and me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3442. A bill to provide tax incentives for small businesses, \nimprove programs of the Small Business Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nimportance of small businesses in the United States. It cannot be \nstated enough that small businesses are the economic engines of our \ncountry. Small businesses also represent the essence of the American \nDream. They are creators of new jobs and innovative technologies. In \nfact, over the last 15 years, businesses employing less than 500 people \nhave created 93 percent of all new jobs and employed 58.6 million \nworkers. Businesses employing less than 20 people alone employed 21.3 \nmillion workers. In my home state of Louisiana, small businesses make \nup about 98 percent of businesses. As Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I remain focused on the needs of \nthese small businesses. That is why I am here today to introduce a bill \nthat I believe will help spur job creation among small businesses.\n  As you know, right now our country is still mired in an historic \neconomic downturn. This economic downturn is disproportionately \naffecting small businesses and, in turn, stifling opportunities for \nthem to generate economic growth for the country. Sadly, since November \n2008 80 percent of the job losses have come from small businesses. 2.16 \nmillion jobs were lost in the private sector from July to February \n2008--nearly half from businesses with less than 50 employees. While \ncorporate layoffs get the headlines, small business layoffs increase \nthe breadlines. Ten jobs lost here and five jobs there add up. These \nare the job losses that hurt our economy, our communities and our \nfamilies.\n  With this in mind, I was proud to lead Congressional efforts to enact \nthe Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Public Law 111-240. President \nObama signed this legislation into law on September 27, 2010. This \nlegislation focused on the three ``C's'' important to small businesses: \nCapital, Contracting, and Counseling. 332 community banks in 47 states \nhave received $4.01 billion in funding from the Small Business Lending \nFund in the bill, which is $9.3 billion in leverage potential for small \nbusinesses. Furthermore, a total of 54 states/territories applied for \nfunding through the Small Business State Credit Initiative Program to \nsupport State-run small business lending programs. Approximately, $1.3 \nbillion for 47 states and territories has been approved. Lastly, $30 \nmillion of Round 1 of State Trade and Export, STEP, export grant \nfunding was awarded in the Fall 2011 to 52 states and territories to \npromote small business exports. To date, the Small Business Jobs Act \nhas provided an important boost to small businesses looking to get \ncredit or open new markets overseas.\n  Given the importance of small businesses to our economy, I believe \nthat there is no better time than now for Congress to build off the \nsuccess of the Small Business Jobs Act. But the key question is how to \nbest assist our country's 28 million small businesses? This is \ncomplicated because Federal law defines a small business as ``those \nhaving 500 employees or less.'' They may all fit under the same broad \ncategory of small business, but they are not all the same. So it makes \nno sense for the Federal government or Congress to have a ``one size \nfits all'' policy for helping them grow. We must put a special focus on \nmaximizing strategies to help those small firms that have the capacity \nto grow in the near term.\n  The approach I have taken is to focus on the entrepreneurial \necosystems in our communities. This is because an ecosystem is defined \nas ``a system formed by the interaction of a community of organisms \nwith their environment.'' I am particularly interested in the \nrelationship between entrepreneurs, the current environment for \nentrepreneurship, and how we can make them more robust. In my view \nstrengthening these ecosystems is an avenue to spur small business \ngrowth, create jobs, and grow our economy.\n  Babson College, one of the country's top colleges for undergraduate/\ngraduate entrepreneurship programs, has looked into what makes up an \nentrepreneurial ecosystem. Babson has identified the ``six domains'' of \nany entrepreneurial ecosystem: a conducive culture that rewards \ninnovation, creativity and experimentation; enabling policies and \nleadership that provide regulatory and capital support; availability of \nappropriate finance, including micro-loans, private equity and public \ncapital; quality human capital that include both skilled and unskilled \nworkers from at home and abroad; venture-friendly markets for products \nby creating distribution channels and entrepreneurship networks; and a \nrange of institutional and infrastructural supports, including \nincubation centers and legal and accounting advisers.\n  Building off this research and with feedback from other stakeholders, \nlate last year my committee began preparations to conduct a series of \nroundtables on strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem for small \nbusinesses. The goal of these roundtables, which were conducted between \nFebruary and April 2012, was to take the ideas that come out of these \ndiscussions and use them as the foundation for a major piece of \nlegislation to support the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The first \nroundtable on February 1, 2012, was entitled ``Developing and \nStrengthening High-Growth Entrepreneurship.'' This roundtable set the \nstage for our discussions by exploring the recent success of high-\ngrowth firms in job creation and why it is so important that we \nreplicate that success. The second roundtable was on March 22, 2012, \nand was entitled ``A Spotlight on Small Business Investment Companies \nand Their Role in the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem.'' That roundtable \nlooked at how we could enhance an already successful program that gets \ncapital into the hands of America's job creators. The last roundtable \nwas on April 18, 2012, and was entitled ``Perspectives from the \nEntrepreneurial Ecosystem: Creating Jobs and Growing Businesses through \nEntrepreneurship.'' That roundtable discussed how different \nstakeholders in the entrepreneurial ecosystem are creating new \nentrepreneurs and growing businesses. It brought together key \nstakeholders from different levels of an entrepreneurial ecosystem: \nuniversities and entrepreneurship programs, Federal and local \nofficials, investors, private sector accelerators, mentors, and \nsuccessful entrepreneurs.\n  As a result of these three roundtables, my committee received almost \n60 specific policy recommendations from the 41 participants. Some of \nthese recommendations fell under the\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\njurisdictions of other Senate committees, while other proposals had a \nsignificant cost associated with them or lacked the strong bipartisan \nsupport necessary to move them forward in the Senate. After further \nconsulting with my colleagues on the committee, I was able to identify \nour own six ``domains'' of proposals to focus our efforts on: Tax and \nFinance; Access to Capital; Access to Global Markets; Access to \nMentoring, Education and Strategic Partnerships; Access to Government \nContracting; and Transparency, Accountability, and Effectiveness. These \ndomains form the six titles of the Success Ultimately Comes from \nCapital, Contracting, Education, Strategic Partnerships, and Smart \nRegulations, SUCCESS, Act of 2012.\n  First, Title I of the SUCCESS Act provides almost $12 billion in tax \nincentives to assist small businesses. All five tax provisions within \nthe SUCCESS Act were based on parts of legislation, S. 2050, that was \nintroduced in January by Senator Snowe and myself. S. 2050, the Small \nBusiness Tax Extenders Act, reflects the work of many of my Senate \ncolleagues, including Senators Snowe, Kerry, Merkley, Cardin, Isakson, \nand Shaheen.\n  Section 102 of the SUCCESS Act extends the 100 percent exclusion from \ntax the gain on the sale of qualified small businesses, QSB, stock that \nnon-corporate taxpayers purchase in 2012 and 2013 and hold for 5 years. \nQualifying small business stock is stock of C-corporation whose gross \nassets do not exceed $50 million, including the proceeds received from \nthe issuance of the stock, and who meets a specific active business \nrequirement. The amount of gain eligible for the exclusion is limited \nto the greater of ten times the taxpayer's basis in the stock or $10 \nmillion of gain from stock in that corporation. Until 2009, non-\ncorporate taxpayers were allowed to exclude 50 percent of the gain from \nthe sale of stock of QSB if the taxpayers held the stock for 5 years. \nThe Recovery Act of 2009 increased the 50 percent exclusion to 75 \npercent and the Small Business Jobs Act and subsequent legislation \nincreased and extended the exclusion to 100 percent through 2011. \nHowever, as of January 1, 2012, the 100 percent exclusion has reverted \nto 50 percent and startup investments are no longer entitled to \npreferential capital gains treatment.\n  Senator Kerry, a senior member of my committee as well as the Finance \nCommittee, has been a leader in the Senate in getting this provision \nextended in previous Congresses. I also note that this proposal has \nbipartisan and White House support. President Obama has repeatedly \ncalled on Congress to make permanent the 100 percent capital gains \nexclusion and included this proposal in his Startup America Legislative \nAgenda. Senators Moran, Warner, Coons and Rubio have all called for \nmaking this provision permanent and included a version of this \nprovision in S. 3217, the Startup Act 2.0 that was introduced in May. \nAccording to a Kauffman Foundation paper published earlier this year, \nthe 100 percent exclusion ``boosts the after-tax returns on such \ninvestments in startups and should induce substantial levels of new \ninvestments in startup firms.'' They further estimate that making this \nprovision permanent would increase risky investments by conservatively \n50 percent more than overall cost of the provision.\n  Section 103 of the bill extends the increased deduction for business \nstart-up expenditures in 2012 and 2013 from $5,000 to $10,000, subject \nto a $60,000 threshold. Under current law, taxpayers can elect to \ndeduct up to $5,000 of ``start-up expenditures'' in the taxable year in \nwhich they start a trade or business. The $5,000 is reduced--but not \nbelow zero--by the amount by which start-up costs exceed $50,000. \nExamples of startup costs include studies of potential markets, \nproducts, labor markets, or transportation systems; advertisements for \nthe opening of a new business; compensation for consultants and \nemployees undergoing training and their instructors; and travel for the \npurpose of securing suppliers, distributors, and customers.\n  The Small Business Jobs Act temporarily increased the amount of \nstart-up expenditures entrepreneurs could deduct from their taxes in \n2010 from $5,000 to $10,000, with a phase-out threshold of $60,000. We \nneed to bring this provision back to aid our small businesses.\n  I note that there is also support within this chamber and from the \nWhite House for this proposal. As part of his Startup America \nLegislative Agenda, President Obama has called for making permanent the \nincreased deduction for start-up expenditures. Senator Merkley \nsuccessfully fought for the initial increase in deduction to be \nincluded in the Small Business Jobs Act. Over the past several years, \nthis proposal has been repeatedly endorsed by the National Association \nfor the Self-Employed and the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, NFIB. Furthermore, according to a Kauffman Foundation \nsurvey, on average, new firms inject about $80,000 into their business \nduring the first year of operation. The vast majority of small business \nowners--between 80 percent and 90 percent--also invest significant \namounts of their own money into their businesses. These budding \nenterprises are also more dependent on personal capital at startup than \nafter they become established businesses. Doubling the deduction for \nstart-up costs puts cash in the hands of small businesses owners who \nneed it most--those who are just getting started. According to \nestimates from Third Way, a non-partisan group, this proposal would \nhelp the more than 600,000 Americans who start their own business every \nyear.\n  Under current law, when a corporation becomes an S-Corporation, it is \nrequired to hold its business assets for 10 years or pay punitive \ntaxes. This 10- year holding period is too long and ties up assets that \ncould be sold to raise capital. In 2010, Congress reduced this holding \nperiod to 5 years to better match business planning cycles. Section 104 \nof my bill will extend the 5-year holding period for 2012 and 2013, \ncosting $251 million over 10 years. As with other provisions in the \nSUCCESS Act, this provision has bipartisan support. Senator Cardin has \nfought to make this proposal permanent. Senators Snowe, Vitter, and \nRoberts have also been long-time supporters and are co-sponsors of \nlegislation introduced by Senator Cardin to make this provision \npermanent. By granting this extension, we will give the more than 4 \nmillion S-Corporations in the U.S. the flexibility they need to raise \ncapital.\n  Section 105 would allow sole proprietorships, partnerships and non-\npublicly traded corporations with less than $50M in average gross \nannual receipts for the prior 3 years, to carryback unused general \nbusiness credits earned in 2012 and 2013 for 5 previous years. Under \ncurrent law, if a business has no tax liability in its current tax \nyear, it may carry the general business tax credit back to the previous \ntax year to offset taxes paid in the previous year and obtain a refund. \nIf the current credit exceeds taxes paid in the previous year, the \nremaining credit may be carried forward for 20 years, without interest, \nand used to offset tax liability in future years. The general business \ncredit is limited to the difference between the regular tax liability \nof a business and the greater of its tentative minimum tax or 25 \npercent of regular tax liability in excess of $25,000. The general \nbusiness tax credit is comprised of several different tax credits \nincluding the R tax credit, energy credits, the Low-Income Housing \nTax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.\n  This extension would provide tax refunds to businesses that were \npreviously healthy but are currently running losses. It would improve \nthe effectiveness of business credits that are intended to expand \ninvestment and employment, in the case of the Work Opportunity Tax \nCredit. It would also allow businesses greater immediate benefit from \ncredits designed to encourage specific types of economic activity, such \nas hiring disadvantaged workers or investments in renewable energy. By \nproviding businesses with greater opportunity to claim business \ncredits, the provisions would also give an infusion of cash to \nbusinesses, which might promote investment. This could be particularly \nimportant if businesses have trouble borrowing because of financial \nmarket problems.\n  Section 106 of the SUCCESS Act extends a generous Section 179 \nprovision that allows small businesses to immediately write-off up to \n$500,000, up from $250,000, for tangible personal property\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nand up to $250,000 for improvements to leasehold property and retail \nproperty.\n  Under the Small Business Jobs Act and other subsequent legislation, \nfor taxable years beginning in 2010 and 2011, small businesses could \nwrite-off for capital expenditures for ``qualifying Sec. 179 property'' \nup to $500,000 and the phase-out threshold has been increased to \n$2,000,000. These thresholds were up from prior law thresholds of \n$25,000/$200,000. In addition, for the first time, the Small Business \nJobs Act allowed taxpayers to expense $250,000 of the cost of \nimprovements to real property including qualified restaurant property \nand qualified retail property. To qualify for the section 179 \ndeduction, property must have been acquired for use in the trade or \nbusiness. Examples of qualifying property include machinery and \nequipment; property contained in or attached to a building, other than \nstructural components, such as refrigerators, grocery store counters, \noffice equipment, printing presses, testing equipment, and signs.; \ngasoline storage tanks and pumps at retail service stations.; \nlivestock, including horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, and mink and \nother furbearing animals.\n  Extending the enhanced Section 179 deduction has bipartisan Senate \nsupport, White House support, and industry support. The President \nsupports extending Section 179. My colleague Senator Snowe is a strong \nsupporter of the enhanced Section 179 provision that allows businesses \nto expense improvements to restaurant and retail property. She \ndeveloped this particular proposal in connection with her work on the \nSmall Business Jobs Act. Finally, 26 National business groups such as \nthe NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nHomebuilders, and the National Association of the Self-Employed \nendorsed extending Section 179 and including expensing for real \nproperty improvements in a May 21, 2012 letter to Congress.\n  The next title of the SUCCESS Act focuses on improving access to \ncapital for small businesses. In particular, Subtitle A under Title II \nwas previously introduced as S. 3253, the Expanding Access to Capital \nfor Entrepreneurial Leaders, EXCEL, Act. It provides necessary and \ntimely enhancements to the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, \nprogram. SBICs are government backed and regulated private equity funds \nwhich invest in U.S. small businesses. The SBIC program was created in \n1958 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson and Senator William Fulbright, and \nsigned into law by President Eisenhower. During a Senate hearing on the \ncreation of the program, Senator Joseph Clark said the legislation is \n``necessary to increase the availability of long-term credit and equity \ncapital for small businesses.''\n  Since 1958, SBICs have invested $56 billion in over 100,000 small \nbusinesses. The core debenture program operates at no cost to \ntaxpayers. SBIC success stories include: Apple Computer, Callaway Golf, \nCostco, Outback Steakhouse, Jenny Craig, Annie's food company, and \nCenter Rock of Berlin, PA, the manufacturers of the drill bit that \nsaved the Chilean miners in October 2010.\n  The SBIC program has seen strong growth in the past few years. For \nexample, the program grew 50 percent in fiscal year 2011 alone. \nHowever, the authorization level has not been permanently raised since \n2003. To continue fulfilling the intent of the original legislation, it \nis time to make some improvements. The Landrieu-Snowe EXCEL Act has two \nmain components. First, it raises the statutory cap for the SBIC \nProgram from $3 billion to $4 billion. Second, it increases the amount \nof leverage by SBIC licensees under common control from $225 million to \n$350 million ``Family of Funds''. The components of this provision were \nalso included in the President's Startup America legislative package.\n  Subtitle B of Title II was originally introduced as S. 2364 by \nSenators Snowe, Landrieu, Isakson and Shaheen. The 504 loan program is \na long-term financing tool for economic development that provides small \nbusinesses with long-term, fixed-rate loans to help them acquire major \nfixed assets and real estate for expansion or modernization. The Small \nBusiness Jobs Act allowed small businesses to use the 504 loan program \nto refinance certain qualifying existing debt for two years, but the \nSBA did not promulgate regulations to implement the refinancing \nprovision until February 17, 2012.\n  This subtitle would extend for a year and a half a provision allowing \nsmall business owners to use Small Business Administration, SBA, 504 \nloans to refinance existing commercial mortgages. Extending the 504 \nrefinancing program is a common-sense way to help small businesses and \ncreate jobs. By allowing small businesses to refinance qualified \ncommercial real estate debt, this program lowers their monthly mortgage \npayments at no cost to taxpayers. That's right, this provision has zero \nsubsidy cost. At a time when we are still facing high unemployment, \nthis extension is one of many things that we should be doing to put \nmore capital in the hands of America's job creators.\n  Subtitle C of Title II is a new proposal introduced for the first \ntime as part of the SUCCESS Act. SBA currently releases some \ninformation publicly about SBA lending activity, but it is almost \nimpossible to find and comprehend if you are not an SBA lending \nprofessional. If a small business, mayor, or governor wants to \ndetermine SBA lending activity in their area, they lack the ability to \ndo so easily.\n  This subtitle would require the SBA to post a user friendly Lender \nActivity Index on the SBA website. Users will immediately be able to \naccess the following data for any given bank: name of bank, number of \nSBA loans each bank made, total dollar amount of SBA loans of each \nbank, zip code of bank activity, not where every single loan was made, \nbut a list of every zip code where the bank has made an SBA loan, \nindustries lent to, hospitality, manufacturing, service, software, \netc., stage of business cycle, new, or existing business, and business \nspecific information, i.e. Women Owned Businesses, Minority Owned \nBusinesses, or Veteran Owned Businesses. Data will be available for the \nyear to date and users will be able to compare to 3 previous fiscal \nyears. Both quarterly and annual data will be included.\n  Title III of the SUCCESS Act focuses on promoting exports from small \nbusinesses. The Small Business Jobs Act made major changes to the \ninternational trade work done by the SBA. Now that those provisions \nhave been in place for several years, there are additional refinements \nand direction needed. I would like to specifically thank Senators \nShaheen and Ayotte for their bipartisan export contributions to this \neffort. The export provisions of Tile III are taken from S. 3218, their \nSmall Business Growth Act of 2012, as well as S. 3277, the Go Global \nAct of 2012 that Senator Shaheen and I authored this year.\n  95 percent of the world's customers are located outside of the \nborders of the United States, and in the last twelve months we have \nexported more than $2 trillion of goods and services to these \nconsumers. Yet only 1 percent of our approximately 28 million small \nbusinesses export. Our agencies need to be working together to ensure \nour small businesses have the resources they need to expand their \ncustomer base and be part of the more than $180 billion in exports that \nthe United States sends around the world each month.\n  This title aids our small business exporters by addressing federal \ngovernment coordination, resources for rural businesses, and export \ncontrol education. It establishes, in Section 306, an interagency task \nforce of SBA, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Export-Import \nBank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation on export \nfinancing to review, improve, and increase collaboration on current \nfinance programs. Then, to further coordination, Section 307(a) begins \na cross training program with SBA and USDA to inform their respective \nexport finance specialists more about each other's programs. Our small \nbusinesses face enough challenges--we should be bringing our resources \nto them. In Section 304, this bill requires SBA, in coordination with \nother agencies, to do at least one export outreach event per year in \neach state. Section 307(b) also aids our rural small businesses by \nposting a list of rural lenders who participate in SBA and USDA loan \nprograms and a list of rural small businesses counseling and technical \nassistance resources. Jobs created by exports pay, on average, 15 to 20 \npercent more than jobs created by goods and services sold\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nin the United States. This bill will continue to support entrepreneurs \nwho want to create and grow these employment opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n  Title IV of the bill focuses on promoting small business access to \nmentoring, education and strategic partnerships. Subtitle A of this \ntitle was originally introduced by Senator Snowe and I as S. 3198, the \nStrengthening Resources for America's Entrepreneurs Act of 2012. The \nSBA Office of Entrepreneurial Development, OED, oversees a network of \nprograms and services that support the training and counseling needs of \nsmall business. According to the SBA, OED helps hundreds of thousands \nof small business clients start, grow and compete in global markets by \nproviding quality training, counseling and access to resources. SBA \ndelivers these services through non-profit, college and university, and \ncommunity-based organization resource partners. Through its network of \nover 1,000 resource partners across the country, OED programs include \nSmall Business Development Centers, SBDCs, Women's Business Centers, \nSCORE, and Entrepreneurship Education. However, it is currently \ndifficult to track effectiveness and ensure our resources are being \nused in the best ways possible. To solve this challenge, this subtitle \nhas four primary components. First, it requires the SBA to coordinate \nand make consistent data collection and outcome metrics for \nEntrepreneurial Development programs. Second, it increases planning for \nutilizing Entrepreneurial Development programs to create jobs. Third, \nit increases coordination between Entrepreneurial Development programs \nand Resource Partners at the national level. Finally, it increases \naccountability measures and reports to Congress regarding the \neffectiveness of Entrepreneurial Development programs.\n  Subtitle B of the bill comes from S. 3197, the Women's Small Business \nOwnership Act which was sponsored by Senator Snowe and myself. This \nsubtitle is focused on the SBA Women's Business Center (WBC) program. \nThe WBC program was established in 1988 and implemented through the \nSBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership. It provides quality \ncounseling and training services to all entrepreneurs, primarily women, \nespecially those who are socially and economically disadvantaged. \nThrough a network of over 100 non-profit organizations, WBCs help more \nthan 150,000 clients annually to start and grow small firms in the \nlocal area in which they serve and to stimulate economic growth. \nSubtitle B reauthorizes the WBC program through Fiscal Year 2015 and \nmakes improvements to the program, including a Government \nAccountability Office review of Women's Business Center program \nperformance as compared with other SBA Entrepreneurial Development \nprograms.\n  Subtitle C of the SUCCESS Act is Senator Snowe's Strengthening \nAmerica's Small Business Development Centers Act. Small Business \nDevelopment Centers (SBDCs) are considered to be the backbone of the \nSBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development efforts, and are the \nlargest of the agency's OED programs. SBDCs are the university based \nresource partners that provide counseling and training needs for more \nthan 600,000 business clients annually. From 2007 to 2008, the \ncounseling and technical assistance services they offered lead to the \ncreation of 58,501 new jobs, at a cost of $3,462 per job. Additionally, \nthey estimate that their counseling services helped to save 88,889 \njobs. This subtitle would reauthorize SBDC program at the current $135 \nmillion authorization level through fiscal year 15. Beyond \nreauthorizing the SBDC program, this provision also encourages SBDCs to \nimprove outreach and communications to universities, community \ncolleges, and junior colleges and allows the SBA Administrator to \nauthorize out-of-state SBDCs to provide assistance in declared disaster \nareas.\n  Subtitle D of Title IV was originally introduced as S. 3281 by \nSenators Snowe, Kerry, and Coburn. This subtitle repeals Federal \nauthorization of the National Veterans Business Development \nCorporation, TVC, eliminating an ineffective government program. The \nNational Veterans Business Development Corporation, also known as The \nVeterans Corporation or simply TVC, has been ineffective and \ncontroversial since its inception as part of the Veterans \nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act, P.L. 106-50, in \n1999. In December of 2008, former Small Business Committee Chairman \nKerry and Ranking Member Snowe investigated TVC, and issued a report \ndetailing the organization's blatant mismanagement and wasting of \ntaxpayers' dollars. Since the issuing of the Small Business Committee's \nreport, Congress has appropriated no further funding for TVC, and the \nSmall Business Administration has incorporated the Veteran Business \nResource Centers, VBRCs, that TVC previously funded into its existing \nnetwork of Veteran Business Outreach Centers, VBOCs. At present, TVC \nstill exists as an organization, and it is still technically federally \nchartered. At the same time, it receives no Federal funds, has no \nDepartment or Agency oversight. It is time for it to be eliminated.\n  Title V of the SUCCESS Act focuses on promoting Federal government \ncontracting opportunities for small businesses. Section 511 under \nSubtitle A of Title V was originally introduced by Senators Cardin, \nLandrieu and Snowe as S. 2187, the Small Business Administration Surety \nBond Increase Act. The SBA administers a surety bond guarantee program, \ndesigned to encourage sureties to issue bonds when they would otherwise \ndetermine that a small business presents an unacceptable degree of \nrisk. Under the program, SBA may guarantee bid, performance, and \npayment bonds for individual contracts of $2 million or less for small \nbusinesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial \nchannels. In the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, Senator \nCardin was able to temporarily increase the size of SBA surety bond \nguarantee from $2 million to $5 million. Section 511 would make that \npermanent. It would ensure that small businesses have the means to the \nsecure the necessary surety bonding to compete for contracts during the \neconomic downturn.\n  Subtitle B of Title V was originally introduced by Senators Snowe, \nLandrieu, Enzi, Brown, Merkley, Cantwell and eight other senators as S. \n633, the Small Business Contracting Fraud Prevention Act. Fraud in \nsmall business contracting programs has starkly increased over the \nyears. Recently we have all read about instances where large businesses \nmisrepresent their size and status to receive the benefits of SBA \nprograms designed for small businesses. Firms that engage in this \nactivity have long been subject to civil and/or criminal penalties \nunder various laws and government-wide policies.\n  The provisions in Subtitle B provide the SBA Inspector General with \nenhanced tools to eliminate fraud in small business contracting \nprograms by: imposing greater penalties for fraud; requiring that firms \nbe debarred for five years if they misrepresent their status as \nveteran-owned for purposes of programs under the act; and requiring the \nSBA to submit annual reports to Congress on the number of persons \ndebarred or suspended from government contracting, or considered for \ndebarment or suspension from government contracting, for violations of \nthe bill. This will deter fraud in government small business \ncontracting and will keep Congress in the loop on small business fraud \nissues.\n  Subtitle C under Title V was originally introduced by Senators Snowe, \nLandrieu, Gillibrand and seven other senators as S. 2172, the Fairness \nin Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Act. Currently, the Women-\nOwned Small Business, WOSB, contracting program caps contract awards to \nwoman-owned businesses at $4 million for goods/services and $6.5 \nmillion for manufacturing. In addition, sole-source contract awards \nunder the program are prohibited. In other words, this program has \nlimits that no other contracting program has.\n  The provisions in Subtitle C would remove the contract award price \nlimits for women-owned small businesses, create a provision allowing \nsole-source contract awards to WOSBs, direct the SBA to periodically \nconduct a study to identify any U.S. industry in which women are \nunderrepresented, and every five years report the study results to \nCongress. From these improvements, more contracting opportunities will \nemerge for women-owned businesses in the Federal marketplace.\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\n  Subtitle D of the Title V of the SUCCESS originated with our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives as H.R. 3851, the Small \nBusiness Champion Act. The Small Business Act established an Office of \nSmall and Disadvantaged Business, OSDBU, within all major Federal \nExecutive Agencies. The OSDBU is the primary advocate within each \nAgency responsible for promoting the maximum use of all small business \nprograms within the Federal contracting process. The OSDBU is tasked \nwith ensuring that each Federal agency and their large prime vendors \ncomply with federal laws, regulations, and policies to include small \nbusinesses as sources for goods and services, both as prime contractors \nand subcontractors. Approximately 35 Federal Agencies have fully \nfunctioning OSDBU offices.\n  In an effort to assist agencies with meeting contracting goals, \nSubtitle D makes three major modifications to OSDBU offices. First, it \nelevates the OSDBU Director at each agency to the Senior Executive \nService, SES, rank. Second, it prohibits combining the duties of the \nOSDBU Director with unrelated duties. Finally, it requires that \nagencies consult with the OSDBU office on decisions to insource work \nperformed by small businesses. I would note that the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Small Business approved H.R. 3851 by voice \nvote on March 7, 2012.\n  The final title of the SUCCESS Act is focused on improving Federal \nGovernment transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. A key \ncomponent of this title is a result of the work of my colleague Senator \nHagan from North Carolina. In particular, Subtitle A of Title VI is \nbased upon Senator Hagan's legislation, S. 3194, the Small Business \nCommon Application Act of 2012.\n  Whether it is applying for a grant, seeking technical assistance, or \nbidding on a contract, small businesses face a dizzying array of \npaperwork when interacting with the Federal government. As a result, \nmany small businesses avoid Federal programs altogether, missing out on \npotentially lucrative business opportunities. Senator Hagan's bill aims \nto streamline assistance for small businesses facing layers of \npaperwork when they apply for a grant, seek technical assistance or bid \non a contract from the Federal government.\n  Furthermore, according to a 2010 study from the SBA Office of \nAdvocacy, it costs small businesses with 20 employees or less more than \n$10,500 per employee to comply with Federal regulations. When compared \nto their larger counterparts, it costs small firms over $2,800--or \napproximately 36 percent more--for each employee.\n  Subtitle A builds off provisions in S. 3194 by establishing an \nExecutive Committee of 12 Federal agency representatives, headed by the \nSBA Administrator, to review the feasibility of establishing a Small \nBusiness Common Application. This Executive Committee would then \nprovide recommendations to the Executive Branch and Congress within 270 \ndays on establishing a common application and web portal for small \nbusinesses.\n  The small business ``common app'' would function much like the one \nthat students complete to apply to multiple colleges and universities \nsimultaneously. It would ensure that small businesses across the \ncountry can concentrate on growing and creating jobs--not wasting time, \nfilling out mountains of repetitive paperwork.\n  Lastly, I recognize that it is important to provide sufficient \noversight of the programs and assistance authorized in this bill. \nSubtitle B of Title VI would authorize a GAO review of the bill--\nincluding whether programs receive necessary funding, have been \nsuccessfully implemented, and are promoting job creation among small \nbusinesses. This report would go to the House and Senate Small Business \nCommittees not later than 2 years after the date of enactment.\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate that the SUCCESS Act is a \ncombination of numerous bipartisan bills that have been introduced this \nCongress. So these proposals are neither new nor untested--they are \nready for prime time. On July 12, 2012 the Senate voted on the SUCCESS \nAct as part of Senate Amendment 2521 to S. 2237, the Small Business \nJobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012. Although the amendment came up short \nof the 60 votes needed to end debate, Senate Amendment 2521 did receive \na strong 57 bipartisan votes. My Republican colleagues Senators Snowe, \nCollins, Vitter, Scott Brown, and Heller all voted in support of the \namendment. I thank them for joining with us to try to move this \nlegislation forward in the Senate. It is my understanding that some of \nmy Republican colleagues may have voted for the amendment if it did not \ncontain the underlying provisions from S. 2237. Procedurally, it was \nnecessary to include these provisions to ensure a vote on the SUCCESS \nAct. However, recognizing these concerns, our bill that is being \nintroduced today only includes Subtitle B of Senate Amendment 2521--the \nbipartisan SUCCESS Act provisions. I hope that additional colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle will now support the SUCCESS Act, \nespecially as we are only a few votes short of being able to move it \nforward here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 464, S. 285.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 285) for the relief of Sopuruchi Chukwueke.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment, as follows:\n  (The part of the bill intended to be inserted is shown in italics.)\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Sopuruchi Chukwueke shall be deemed \n     to have been lawfully admitted to, and remained in, the \n     United States, and shall be eligible for adjustment of status \n     to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an application for such adjustment \n     of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Sopuruchi Chukwueke, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 1, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the birth of Sopuruchi \n     Chukwueke under section 202(a)(2) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(a)(2)).\n       (d) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for \n     Certain Relatives.--The natural parents, brothers, and \n     sisters of Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke shall not, by virtue of \n     such relationship, be accorded any right, privilege, or \n     status under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for S. 285, \na private relief bill for Soptuuchi ``Victor'' Chukwueke.\n  Mr. Chukwueke has a compelling story. He has suffered a serious \nmedical condition, was abandoned by his parents, and was brought to the \nU.S. at a young age. He has endured several surgeries as a result of \nhis serious medical condition, and has overcome many barriers to get \nwhere he is today.\n  Despite his personal story and achievements, members of the Judiciary \nCommittee were informed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he \nwas an orphan and had no family in the U.S. or in Nigeria, his home \ncountry. We were led to believe that he had no family because that is \nhow he represented himself during interviews with Federal agents. We \nfound out later, however, that he still had a mother and father, and \nsix siblings in Nigeria. Upon learning of this discrepancy, I \nimmediately asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement to clear up these \nconflicting statements, and to provide any other background information \nor paper in his files, including interview notes to understand the line \nof questioning that took place between ICE and Mr. Chukwueke. ICE \nrejected sharing the file with members of the Judiciary Committee. \nAfter weeks of a standstill, ICE agreed to show committee staff what \nwas in his alien file. The file was helpful because we could review \ninterview notes, visa applications, pictures, and other notes on Mr. \nChukwueke.\n  Upon completing the review of the file, committee staff held a \nconference call with Mr. Chukwueke. During that interview, Mr. \nChukwueke stated that he told investigators that he believed he was an \norphan and that he had no intention of lying. For the record, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the sworn \naffidavit that was provided by Mr. Chukwueke to ICE and to members of \nthe Judiciary committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The committee reported S. 285 out of committee on July \n19. The committee-reported bill includes a provision that prohibits Mr. \nChukwueke from using his status to sponsor immediate family for \nbenefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The language in my \namendment is identical to language used in other private relief bills. \nSimilar language was included in bills in 1999 and 2000. Senator Levin, \nthe sponsor of this private relief bill, supported the amendment.\n  We always consider private relief bills on a case-by-case basis. In \nthe case of Mr. Chukwueke, we were told that he did not have parents or \nfamily in the U.S. or in Nigeria. It turned out that was not the case. \nThose statements were inaccurate. He says he did not mean to mislead \nICE agents about his family, but the fact is that he did. He did not \ntell the whole truth.\n  As I said, in previous private relief bills, we have excluded private \nbill recipients from sponsoring immediate family members. That is not \nto say that the family members are barred from ever entering the \ncountry. It simply means they cannot use the private bill recipient's \nspecial status to provide them a benefit or to gain derivative status.\n  There are many worthwhile people who want to come or remain in the \nUnited States. However, there are bad actors and people who will \nperpetuate fraud in order to do so. People will go to great lengths to \ncome to the United States. We need to be worried about individuals who \nwill take advantage of our open door policies and manipulate the system \nto get a benefit. We need to be watchful for potential fraud and abuse \nof the system.\n  If S. 285 passes the House and is sent to the President, Mr. \nChukwueke may be able to attend medical school in the fall. He has the \nsupport of many upstanding individuals, including Senator\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nLevin. Mr. chukwueke is also supported by a number of people in his \ncommunity. We received letters of recommendation from Wayne State \nUniversity and the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy.\n  I wish Mr. Chukwueke the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n\n                               Exhibit #1\n\n                Affidavit of Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke\n\n       I, Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke, swear under penalty of \n     perjury that the following is true and accurate to the best \n     of my knowledge and belief:\n       1. My name is Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke. I write this \n     statement in support of S.B. 285, a private bill introduced \n     on my behalf by U.S. Senator Carl Levin.\n       2. I was born in Nigeria on February 10, 1986. During my \n     early childhood, I developed a benign tumor caused by \n     Neurofibromatosis, which grew on my frontal and right facial \n     area, subsequently resulting in a very significant facial \n     deformity.\n       3. My mother took me to different hospitals for treatment \n     but we were unable to find a facility or surgeon to treat my \n     condition. At some point, she heard of a Catholic nun called \n     Rev. Mother Paul Offiah who ran a handicap (orphanage) center \n     for orphans, abandoned and neglected disabled children. The \n     name of the center is called St. Vincent de Paul Handicap \n     Center located in Umuahia, Abia, Nigeria. My mother took me \n     there, explained the situation to Mother Offiah, and left me. \n     I do not remember how old I was at that point, but I felt \n     abandoned.\n       4. Rev. Mother Paul Offiah took me in, fed and clothed me \n     and became my sole parental figure, offering both emotional \n     and financial support. My mother kept in contact with Mother \n     Paul Offiah and came a few times to visit me at the center. I \n     spent all my time there and Mother Paul Offiah started making \n     arrangements for me to come to United States for life-saving \n     treatment.\n       5. Dr. Ian Jackson at Providence Hospital in Michigan \n     agreed to perform the surgery free of charge. Several \n     generous Nigerians assisted with the effort to raise funds to \n     that I could travel to the U.S. for treatment.\n       6. On August 21, 2001, when I was 15, Mother Offiah brought \n     me to the United States on a B-2 visa and left me in the care \n     of Sister Immaculata Osueke and other nuns in Lansing, \n     Michigan. She then went back to Nigeria. I was authorized to \n     stay in the U.S. until August 29, 2002.\n       7. My application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status was \n     rejected twice, because I could not afford the visa fee at \n     the time. Also, the evidence submitted was signed by a \n     clinical social worker instead of a licensed physician. The \n     delay in filing for the third time was in part because I was \n     having surgery during that time. I had my second major \n     surgery on January 14, 2003. That period was a very difficult \n     and stressful time in my life, because I had to prepare for \n     surgery, undergo the painful surgery and post-operative \n     recovery, and at the same time worry about my visa status. I \n     was just 16 years old at the time.\n       8. In February 2003, my mother and father signed sworn \n     affidavits to give up their parental rights, so I could be \n     adopted here in the United States.\n       9. In November 2003, I began to study for the GED at home \n     while receiving treatment for Neurofibromatosis. In January \n     2004, I took the GED and passed it.\n       10. A few years later, in 2006, Mother Offiah died of a \n     brain tumor, leaving me with no parental figure in Nigeria \n     who could provide for and support me with my medical \n     condition.\n       11. In May 2006, I enrolled at the Oakland Community \n     College in Southfield, Michigan. My education was paid for by \n     a Catholic benefactor, Mr. Jerry Burns.\n       12. In August 2008, I graduated from Oakland Community \n     College with an AA in Science and in September 2008, I \n     transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan to \n     pursue a Bachelor's Degree.\n       13. I had been abandoned by my family in an orphanage in \n     Nigeria, and I felt I have no one to care for me there, \n     especially after Mother Paul Offiah passed away. As I grew up \n     in the United States and received medical treatment for my \n     condition, I realized that my mother knew she could not \n     provide for me and so she had entrusted me to the people who \n     could take care of me. I realized that she had done the right \n     thing at the time, given the circumstances. So I decided to \n     reach out to my family again, especially my mother.\n       14. Sister Immaculata Osueke reached out to other nuns at \n     the orphanage in Nigeria to get my mother's telephone number, \n     so that I could try to reconnect with my family.\n       15. I was chosen to give the commencement speech at the \n     Wayne State University graduation in 2011. Dr. Kenneth Honn, \n     my research professor, said that he want to bring my mother \n     to witness ``her son's graduation.'' He wrote an invitation \n     letter for my mother to come visit me, but all of the travel \n     arrangements were done by a Wayne State administrator, Mr. \n     Christopher Harris. With the help of Dr. Honn, Mr. Harris, \n     and Senator Levin's letter to the U.S. Consulate in Nigeria, \n     my mother came to visit me at my graduation from Wayne State \n     last year. It was the first time I had seen her in more than \n     ten years. She arrived a few hours before my graduation and \n     returned to Nigeria on May 16, 2011.\n       16. Since my arrival in Michigan in 2001, 1 have been in \n     and out of the hospital, and ahve had seven major surgeries \n     between 2002 and 2011 to remove the Neurofibromatosis and \n     reconstruct my face.\n       17. In November 2011, I applied and was accepted by the \n     University of Toledo, College of Medicine, conditioned on \n     receiving lawful permanent residence in the United States on \n     or before August 1, 2012.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                       Sopurucki Victor Chukwueke.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
