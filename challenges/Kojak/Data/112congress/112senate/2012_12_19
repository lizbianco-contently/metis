Madam President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nbe in a period of morning business for 1 hour; the Republicans will \ncontrol the first half, the majority the second half.\n  Following morning business, we will resume consideration of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I mentioned last night we are going \nto have to move forward on this bill. I have been told the Republicans \nwant to have a substitute, and we look forward to whatever that might \nbe. We can set up a series of votes to satisfy those people who want to \nchange this bill in some manner.\n  I would note that in the Northeast--other States but principally New \nYork and New Jersey--there are about 700,000 people who have lost their \nhomes. Tens of thousands of those homes have been destroyed, and other \npeople are still living in very difficult situations.\n  When we had the devastation in the Gulf, we got the aid to those \nStates very quickly. The population of those States--Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama--is very sparse compared to New York and New \nJersey. We have to make a decision on this very important legislation \nbefore we leave this week, and we are going to do that. I hope everyone \nwould cooperate, but we have to do this. It is very unfair to the \nmillions of people who are suffering as a result of this devastation.\n  We have had some devastating wildfires in the West. They are terribly \ndamaging to the environment and on occasion there is lost life and \noften there are property losses. But relatively speaking, compared to \nthe millions of people involved in this storm, we have to get our \npriorities right. It is unfair to those people who are suffering. It is \nnot only individual people, but it is also businesses. I hope we can \nfinalize this matter in the next day or two.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8155-7", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8155-S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is often said a man is only as good as \nhis word. In this new world we live in, the same applies to women. This \nis a world we live in where men and women, as much as we can, are \ntreated equally. A good man is somebody who has his word that is good. \nA good woman is a person who has their word that is good. I believe \nthat is true.\n  If that fact is true, then Mr. Kent Conrad, the Senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota, is a good man, indeed.\n  When he was running for the Senate the first time, he promised the \npeople of North Dakota he would not run for reelection if the Nation's \nbudget deficit was higher at the end of his term than at the beginning \nof it.\n  We came to the Senate together. I can remember 27 years ago in the \nLBJ Room where I first met Kent Conrad--we were running for the \nSenate--this studious man, very intense. I can still remember that. We \nhave been friends now for all those many years. But think what he did. \nHe could have been reelected so easily and he probably could have \nfigured out some way around it: It was my intention to reduce the debt, \nbut we weren't able to do it.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n  But he didn't follow that path. He said: I am not running for \nreelection, and he didn't. It is amazing what he did. He takes the \nnational debt personally. He takes it very seriously. Kent announced he \nwouldn't seek reelection. I was stunned. Kent, how could you do that? \nHe said: I gave my word. But fate, as we know--and we are feeling it \ntoday with these flowers here behind me--fate is rarely anticipated. \nAfter his first term was set to expire and he had announced he wasn't \nrunning for reelection, Quentin Burdick, with whom I had the pleasure \nof serving, died, and so he ran for his seat and was elected. So he has \nheld both Senate seats in North Dakota. He ran in that special election \nto replace Senator Burdick and won. The Senate, the people of North \nDakota, and every American who cares about controlling the Federal debt \nhave benefited from his faithful service.\n  Every time we have done something dealing with the debt in the last \n26 years, Kent Conrad has been at the forefront. ObamaCare, he was on \ntop of that. He was one of the Gang of 6, it was called at the time, \nand took months and months. He came up, of course, with the magnificent \nidea, he and Judd Gregg--two people who know the finances of this \ncountry as well as any other two men in the world--they were going to \ndo something about it, and they introduced legislation. It was \npatterned after the base closing commissions. They would do their \nwork--the Commission--come back to the Senate, no filibusters, no \namendments. That was Kent Conrad and Judd Gregg's idea. As we know, the \nproblem was the Republicans who supported the legislation, cosponsored \nit, wouldn't let us get it on the floor; six or seven of them voted \nagainst that. The Bowles-Simpson Commission; the Obama-Boehner talks, \ntwo rounds of those; Biden-Cantor, he was involved in every one of \nthose; the Gang of 6, the Gang of 8. Even though he wasn't personally \none of the three people on the supercommittee, Chairperson Murray was \nleaning on him all the time for information.\n  He has been terrific. As chairman of the Budget Committee, no one \ncould do more than he did. I can remember he managed the bills we had \non getting budgets. He was here, my seat was there, and he wanted me to \nhelp him. Why? Because he didn't have time to deal with procedure. He \nwas dealing with substance. I still joke with him about this. He was so \nintense; we could see that mind of his working. So he was happy I was \nhere working with him to get the budgets through.\n  He has been a powerful voice against runaway deficits but always \nbeing totally reasonable, recognizing that we are in a time of economic \nslowdown and we have to do something about the debt. But he also \nbelieves that during any of these periods of time, we need stimulation \nof the economy; they go together.\n  As I have indicated, no one cares more about addressing the national \ndebt than Senator Conrad. But he also understands the balance between \nfiscal responsibility and funding our national priorities.\n  Kent Conrad has been bipartisan. Sometimes some criticize him for \nbeing so bipartisan. He has never been afraid to reach across the aisle \nto keep our country on a responsible path. He is a person who is not an \nideologue. I could be wrong, but I think he was the first person to \nendorse Obama. Obama was a Senator who gave indication he wanted to run \nfor President. I think Senator Conrad was the first to endorse him. We \nknow Senator Obama didn't sell very well in North Dakota, but that \ndidn't stop Kent Conrad. He thought he was the best person to be \nPresident of the United States.\n  The proposal I mentioned with Senators Conrad and Gregg was a \nblueprint for what the Bowles-Simpson Commission then came up with. As \nI have indicated, every bipartisan deficit reduction since then--and \nsome partisan efforts--anytime there was involvement with the debt, he \nwas there.\n  Although we have yet to reach a solution or a conclusion to the very \nserious fiscal challenges this country faces, I credit Kent Conrad for \nthe progress we have made to this point. He will continue to be a voice \nfor reason and moderation even in his retirement. See, Kent has always \nhad a brilliant mind for numbers. He is a step above an accountant's \nmind. I truly like accountants. My daughter-in-law is an accountant, \nbut he is a step above that. He is of the mathematician's caliber; he \nis so very smart.\n  After graduating from college, he worked for the North Dakota State \nTax Commission. The person who ran that tax commission was Byron \nDorgan, who later joined him in the Senate. In 1980, Kent succeeded \nByron as the commissioner of taxes in North Dakota. They are the best \nof friends. He served as tax commissioner for 6 years.\n  He is a fifth-generation North Dakotan, born in Bismarck. Kent Conrad \nwas raised by his grandparents. When he was 5 years old, his parents \nwere killed by a drunk driver and so he was raised by his wonderful \ngrandparents and he has told me so many times about how good they were \nto him.\n  He was always interested in politics. At his retirement party, he \ntalked about coming to Washington, DC, and he went back to his room or \nwherever he went that evening and wrote on a piece of paper that he was \ngoing to be a Senator. He was just a boy, a little kid. He was a \nteenager, but at least in my view of a 16-year-old today he was still a \nlittle kid. He said he wanted to be a Senator to himself. ``It so \ninspired me that I thought someday I'd like to be down on that floor \nand I'd like to debate the great issues of the day.''\n  He has done it. He has done it for 24 years.\n  Today Kent doesn't just debate the great issues of the day, he also \nis famous for making sure people understand what he is talking about. \nHe has visual aids--we call them charts--that explain all his numbers \nand make them understandable. In 2001, the Rules Committee gave him his \nown printer since he was producing more charts than all the rest of the \nSenators combined--and that is the truth. He is famous for his charts.\n  He is renowned for his dog. He loves that little dog named Dakota. It \nis a fluffy white dog, a bijon frise. Everywhere Kent goes, Dakota is \nwith him. They love that dog like only people can love animals. I often \nquestion how--I used to question; I don't anymore. I have a daughter. \nMy oldest child is a daughter. She is allergic to cats. Her husband, \ntrying to be nice to her, bought her a cat that had no hair. Frankly, \nit was kind of an ugly little animal, but my daughter loves that cat. \nThey named the cat Olivia. The cat got out at night--they live in a \nsuburb here--and a racoon attacked the cat so the cat was never the \nsame after that. But my daughter spent lots of money on this cat.\n  I finally said: Lana, why are you spending money on the cat?\n  She said: Dad, I love that animal.\n  So that was the beginning; I don't question it anymore. If my \ndaughter feels that strongly about a cat, I am going to stop \ncriticizing people who spend money on animals.\n  I am reminded of my daughter every day I see him with Dakota because \nshe loved Olivia like he loves Dakota. He and his lovely wife Lucy have \nspent lots of money on that little dog. They love that dog. He calls \nhim Little Guy; that Little Guy.\n  I am going to miss Kent a lot. He is my friend, my pal. I wish him \nand his family well. He has a lovely family. His wife Lucy was the \nlong-time chief of staff for Byron Dorgan--two Senators, both \nrepresenting the same State, one Senator's wife is the chief of staff \nfor his colleague. She went out in the private sector fairly recently \nand has done a great job. She has been involved in Major League \nBaseball. She and Kent love baseball. Kent always talks about he talked \nto Pete Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles; that he is looking \nforward to his retirement because Angelos promised him a tryout. He is \ngoing to try to play professional baseball. He loves baseball. They go \nto spring training when they can. I hope they will still have a \npresence in Washington. I think so much of both of them. They are \nwonderful people.\n  They have two children, a daughter who wrote a book about politics, \nand one grandson. Kent always boasts about how smart his daughter is. I \nwent to the book signing. I am sure she is smart because she has such a \nbrilliant father.\n  I value both Kent's friendship and leadership. While he will be \nmissed in the Senate, he should rest assured that his legacy will \nremain long after he leaves.\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8157-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there is still time to prevent \nfurther damage to the economy and to stop the automatic tax hike on \nevery American that's scheduled to go into effect at the beginning of \nthe New Year. The President has a real opportunity, the second in 2 \nyears, to do something significant about our debt crisis and jumpstart \nour economy. He has a real opportunity to show he can govern. He is \nletting that opportunity slip away.\n  Senate Democrats and the White House now say that a ``balanced \napproach'' is one that can pass both the House and Senate. But we know \nthat neither the Democrat bill in the Senate, nor the President's plan \nfor more than a trillion dollars in tax hikes meets their own new test \nof `balance.'\n  Speaker Boehner, like me, would like to prevent a tax hike on \neveryone. But given the President's failure to act, the House will soon \nvote on legislation to prevent a tax hike on anyone making less than a \nmillion dollars a year--rather than letting taxes go up on every \nAmerican taxpayer; in other words, a plan that 53 of our Democrat \ncolleagues here in the Senate already voted to support. It is a plan \nthat would ensure far more American families and small businesses are \nprotected from tax hikes than anything our Democrat friends have \nproposed.\n  Democrats will have an opportunity to offer and vote on changes if \nthey no longer agree with their previous positions. But what they \ncannot do is sit on their hands and let taxes go up on every American \ntaxpayer. Senate Democrats have wasted precious time all year with show \nvotes designed to fail. That has left us with little time to do the \nreal work that needs to be done. But there is still enough time for us \nto finish all of our work before this weekend, if we are all willing to \nstay late and work hard. For the sake of the people who sent us here, \nit can and should be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8157-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8157-S8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Jim DeMint\n\n  Madame President, I would like to speak this morning in tribute to an \nunexpected addition to the list of retirees on the Republican side of \nthe Senate, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina.\n  They say success has many fathers, but it is hard to think of anyone \nwho has done more than Jim DeMint to raise the public's awareness on \nspending and debt, and the threat that big government poses to our \nliberties.\n  Jim has been a powerful voice for conservatism during his time in the \nHouse and the Senate. I have no doubt he will be extremely effective in \nhis new post over at the Heritage Foundation. I wish him every success. \nBecause the truth is, the Nation simply cannot continue on its current \npath, and if Jim can help more people understand that from his new \nperch on Massachusetts Avenue, then it will clearly have been worth it.\n  And so while Jim's voice will be missed here in the Senate, we are \nglad to see he will be putting his considerable talents to good use by \nhelping to arm his former colleagues and many others with the arguments \nthey will need to make the case for constitutional conservatism in the \nyears ahead.\n  As a young boy, Jim developed a knack for sales by necessity. His mom \nran a ballroom dancing school out of their home as a way to keep food \non the table for her four children, and part of Jim's job was to \nrecruit the students. He says he still runs into people who attended \nthe DeMint Academy of Dance and Decorum. ``Our home sometimes seemed \nlike boot camp,'' Jim once said, because to survive as a single parent \nhis mom enlisted all four kids for daily duties starting at 6 a.m. It \nwas ``the closest I would come to basic training.'' Interestingly, part \nof Jim's responsibilities involved filling in for folks who did not \nhave a dance partner.\n  When Jim wasn't busy in the ballroom, he was working his two paper \nroutes or bagging groceries at the grocery store. On weekends, he fed \nhis love of music as the drummer for a band called ``Salt and Pepper.'' \nHe was best known for his vocals on the song ``Wipe-out'' and the \nsong's distinctive opening cackle. Jim says he could have been a rock \nstar, if it weren't for the fact that he had no voice or musical \ntalent. So as an adult, he stuck with sales, and it was from there that \nhe launched his political career.\n  It has not been easy. Jim has always worked hard to ensure that \nDebbie and the kids remained at the center of his life. I know how much \nhe admires Debbie for keeping her focus on their kids over the years. \nTheirs has been a true partnership almost since the day they first met \nall the way back in the seventh grade.\n  Jim was not always all that political. In fact, those who know him \nbest say that one of the most surprising things about his career is how \nsuch a shy and gentle spirit could be viewed by so many as a take-no-\nprisoners firebrand. As a young marketing executive, he recalls \nthinking that he had a wife, kids and a business--and that was \nbasically his universe. He did not even know who his congressman was. \nTo this day, one of the things Jim enjoys doing most is working on his \nlawn back in Greenville. And while he has gotten his share of awards in \nWashington over the years, I don't think any of them compare with the \none his neighborhood association gave him a few years back for ``best \nlawn.'' He is really proud of that one.\n  Jim's interest in politics came about when the government started to \nintrude more and more into his business, and when he started to notice \nhow it unwittingly harmed others. ``The more I learned about how things \noperated,'' he once said, ``the more I understood how problems in our \nsociety such as broken homes, crime, and school dropout were a direct \nresult of well-intended but misdirected government policies.''\n  So he got involved.\n  In 1992, Bob Inglis walked into his office and asked for his help in \nrunning a race in South Carolina's 4th District. Jim took the job and \nfor the first time began to think about running for political office \nhimself. When Inglis retired, Jim decided to run as his replacement. He \nwas 47 years old, he had never run for anything in his life, and Debbie \nthought he was crazy. But the voters liked what he was selling, and so \ndid his colleagues in the House. They voted him President of their \nfreshman class in 1999.\n  Six years later, Jim was elected to the Senate. And he has been a \nleader here as well, working to cut Federal spending and reform how we \nspend taxpayer dollars. A conservative stalwart, Jim leaves with a \nstellar 98.77 lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union. \nAnd, crucially, he has made a difference. One member of the press corps \nonce referred to Jim as the patron saint of lost causes in the Senate. \nAnd, frankly, I don't think we will be abolishing the tax code anytime \nsoon, as Jim has suggested, but that's to miss the point. Great causes \nalmost always start out with a constituency of one, and Jim has never \nbeen afraid to take up important and unpopular causes early, and let \nthe polls and punditry take care of themselves.\n  After becoming what he called a ``recovering earmarker,'' he \nsucceeded in convincing others to give up the practice. As a member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, he was also instrumental in resolving \na serious problem in Honduras a few years ago after the Obama \nAdministration misconstrued the legal ouster of a president with a \npolitical coup. Jim enlisted Miguel Estrada to figure out what was \nreally going on down there, and I was happy to help him travel to \nHonduras to investigate in person. Jim soon reported back that it was \ninstantly obvious it was not a coup. The story eventually had a happy \nending: the Honduran people held a new election and inaugurated a new \npresident and the Obama administration grudgingly backed down. But none \nof this would have happened without the leadership of Senator DeMint. \n``The senator kept the administration honest,'' Estrada later said. \n``He was invaluable.''\n  Senator DeMint and I share a profound commitment to free speech, and \nhe has written eloquently on its importance for our Nation. ``Good \ngovernment,'' he has written, ``is a result of freedom debated.'' He \nhas called the\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nright to free speech the ``most treasured benefit of living in a free \nand democratic nation.'' And he has certainly exercised that right to \nthe fullest both here in the Senate and across the country.\n  Throughout his political career, Jim has always been guided by an \nunwavering commitment to freedom, and I know it is that same commitment \nto defend and enlarge our freedom that led him into this next chapter \nin his life. It is this passion to defend freedom, both for Americans \nhere at home and for our allies around the world, that has struck a \nchord with so many Americans and helped make Jim a national figure--not \nto mention a best-selling author.\n  In addition to the fact that he and his staff have helped address \nmore than 30,000 constituent inquiries during his time here in the \nSenate, it is also why Jim has remained so popular with his \nconstituents back home, and it is why his colleagues here in the Senate \nare so sad to see him go.\n  Jim leaves with a legacy. He has been a real champion for limited \ngovernment and constitutional conservatism on the national stage. But \nwhat has always guided him most over the years is the conviction that \nmost decisions are best made at the local level. And whether it is his \nwork with veterans, in promoting adoption, or in reforming education, \nthat is what he has always stressed.\n  So I want to thank the Senator from South Carolina for his sterling \nservice to the Palmetto State and to our country.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about important \nissues facing us as we work to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families Program, the TANF Program. Poverty has risen to a crisis \nlevel in our country. In 2011 there were 16.1 million children in \nfamilies with incomes below the poverty level.\n  The pernicious effects of poverty have implications for children's \nhealth, education, and well-being. Research has demonstrated that there \nare significant associations between poverty and problems with \nchildren's health, cognitive development, behavior, emotional well-\nbeing, and school achievement. These problems are exacerbated for \nfamilies in extreme poverty, where the annual income is less than half \nof the poverty level. In 2011 there were over 7 million children in the \nUnited States living in extreme poverty.\n  Poverty is also a risk factor for child abuse and neglect. Data \nassembled by the Center for Law and Social Policy reveals that poverty \nis the single best predictor of child maltreatment. Children living in \nfamilies with annual incomes below $15,000 were 22 times more likely to \nbe abused or neglected than those living in families with annual \nincomes of $30,000 or more.\n  According to a report from the Children's Defense Fund, ``Children of \ncolor continue to suffer disproportionately from poverty.'' The \nChildren's Defense Fund cites data showing that more than one in three \nAfrican-American children and more than one in three Hispanic children \nwere poor in 2011, compared to a 1-in-8 ratio among White non-Hispanic \nchildren.\n  These families face huge challenges navigating the bare necessities \nof daily life. Fresh healthy food can be rare. Unsafe housing \ncontributes to chronic child health issues such as asthma. \nTransportation to and from work, the grocery store, and the doctor can \nbe infrequent and unreliable.\n  Programs funded through TANF--the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies Program--provide cash assistance to families struggling in \ndeep and persistent poverty. TANF is a block grant to States for their \nuse in ending dependence on government benefits and, more broadly, to \npromote child well-being. TANF Programs can also provide work support \nsuch as transportation assistance and childcare for families working to \nget themselves out of poverty and into decent-paying jobs. In addition \nto safety net and work support programs, TANF also funds a number of \nchild welfare programs that, when effective, reduce the number of \nchildren in foster care and help keep families together.\n  When TANF was enacted, many States used the funding stream in an \neffort to move welfare recipients into work. However, over time the \nfocus of TANF in many of these States has shifted from working with \njob-ready adults to a funding stream largely dedicated to funding \npurposes unconnected to job readiness.\n  For many years I have expressed concern that nationwide over 50 \npercent of able-bodied adults receiving cash assistance are reported to \nengage in zero hours of work-related activity. Additionally, I have \nraised concerns that most States are not able to meet the Federal work-\nparticipation rate. This work-participation rate requires that a State \nengage half of its cash assistance caseload in specified work-related \nactivities for a certain number of hours each week.\n  If you ask the average middle-class American how many able-bodied \nadults receiving welfare should be engaged in work or work-related \nactivities, my guess is the answer would be all of them. It should be \nshocking to the American people that most States are not able to engage \nhalf of their welfare caseloads in such activities.\n  Furthermore, I have raised concerns that there is a considerable \namount of TANF spending on child welfare programs that goes unaccounted \nfor and is not coordinated with possibly duplicative spending \nadministered by State child welfare agencies.\n  Authority for TANF expired at the end of 2010. Unfortunately, \nalthough this is a matter of serious concern, the Obama administration \nhas never proposed a 5-year reauthorization of the TANF Program. \nInstead, on July 12, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services \nreleased a document, which they inaccurately described as an \n``Information Memorandum,'' to the States claiming on behalf of the \nObama administration unprecedented waiver authority over TANF work \nrules.\n  This action provoked a swift and strong condemnation from members of \nthe legislative branch and rightly so.\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\n  Many Members of Congress believe the welfare waiver document \nconstitutes an excessive and unwarranted overreach on the part of the \nexecutive branch. The Government Accountability Office agreed with us \nand has determined that the July 12, 2012, document is, in fact, a rule \nas defined by the Administrative Procedures Act and as such should have \nbeen submitted to Congress for review.\n  Since the welfare waiver is considered a rule, like all rules, it is \nsubject to a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional \nReview Act. The Senate Parliamentarian agrees with the GAO, and she has \nadvised that for purposes of the CRA, that is, the Congressional Review \nAct, this rule should be considered to have been received by Congress \non September 10, 2012, even though the administration failed to submit \nit as required by law.\n  The CRA provides the Senate with a procedure for expedited \nconsideration and a vote on a resolution of disapproval during a \ncertain window of time so long as at least 30 Senators have signed a \ndischarge petition to bring the resolution to the floor. I have \nintroduced such a resolution, S.J. Res. 50, which provides for \ncongressional disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services relating to the authority to waive Federal \nwelfare work requirements under section 407 of the Social Security Act. \nHaving introduced it within the required timeframe under the CRA and \nhaving obtained enough signatures on a discharge petition, it is within \nmy rights as a Senator to call for a vote on my resolution prior to the \nSenate's adjournment this year.\n  Now, I am not naive, nor am I overly idealistic. I am well aware that \nthe vote on S.J. Res. 50 would likely fall along party lines, and this \nis disappointing. It is clear that the administration's purpose in \ngranting themselves this waiver authority is to undermine a work-first \napproach to getting welfare recipients or clients off the rolls. This \nhas been the desire of many critics of Clinton-era welfare reforms \nsince they were enacted.\n  The administration has not been forthcoming at all about what they \nwant to substitute for a work-first approach. In the past, absent \nstrong Federal performance standards, States have allowed activities \nsuch as journaling, exercise, or assisting a neighbor, just to name a \nfew, to count as work for the purposes of welfare eligibility.\n  Here is why I have such a problem with this shift in policy: I \nbelieve most people receiving welfare are unhappy with their situation \nand want to be able to work. Even with assistance, families trying to \nsurvive on cash-assistance welfare are living in desperately \nimpoverished circumstances. The reasons some families have to go on \nwelfare can be, of course, complicated. Many adults on welfare struggle \nwith mental health and substance abuse issues. These barriers to work \nprevent adults on welfare from having work-readiness skills. \nAdditionally, inactivity and the lack of attachment to the workforce \ncan exacerbate mental health and self-medicating tendencies and create \na downward spiral for these families, and it can be very hard to \nreverse course.\n  Over the years, research has consistently revealed that a work-first \napproach to welfare, combining an intense effort to engage recipients \nin work-related activities to foster an attachment to work with a \nblended array of work supports, such as education and training, has the \ngreatest degree of success in getting clients off of welfare.\n  The reason I am so vehemently opposed to the administration's scheme \nto undermine the welfare work requirements is that I believe it will \nhinder, not help, the effort to get adults off welfare and into the \nworkforce. Put simply, allowing activities that are not work to count \nas work will not get people off welfare.\n  The administration and their apologists have not even tried to make a \npolicy case for their non-work-first approach. Instead, apologists of \nthe administration's welfare waiver rule generally attempt to obfuscate \nand distract from the fact that the Obama administration granted \nthemselves waiver authority to bypass the legislative branch with the \ngoal of weakening welfare requirements.\n  Let's take a look at some of their arguments. Right out of the gates, \nsupporters of the administration's policy argue that members of the \nlegislative branch asserting their rights in the face of executive \noverreach were simply trying to give the Romney-Ryan campaign an issue.\n  Well, in case anyone hasn't heard, the country recently held an \nelection, and President Obama was reelected. There is no longer a \nRomney-Ryan campaign, so that distraction falls away.\n  Apologists of the executive overreach have also tried to muddy the \nissue by suggesting that the administration is giving the States what \nthey asked for. For example--and I take this a little personally--in an \neffort to create a false justification for their power grab, the Obama \nadministration has repeatedly misrepresented the views of the State of \nUtah. It is true that when asked by the administration what they wanted \nin a TANF reauthorization, some States indicated the desire for more \nflexibility, but there was never any indication that the States wanted \nthe administration to go around Congress to provide this flexibility.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, between 2000 and \n2009--during the Clinton, Bush, and even the Obama administration--HHS \nconsistently told States that they had no waiver authority under TANF. \nSo States naturally and rightly assumed that any requests for waivers \nwould have to go through Congress. This is evidenced by the fact that \nin the 6 months since HHS granted itself authority to waive welfare \nwork requirements, not a single State has applied for one of these \nwaivers. In other words, any argument that the need for State \nflexibility is so urgent that the administration had to bypass Congress \nto give it falls by the wayside. Once again, we see a distraction \ncrumble under the weight of the facts.\n  Another distraction raised by supporters of the administration is \ncomments from a former House Ways and Means staffer to the press \nindicating that he thought additional flexibility for States might not \nbe a bad idea. Of course, this same staffer also said that unilaterally \nestablishing these waivers without consulting Congress was not the way \nto go. If that is the best expert opinion supporters of the \nadministration can come up with to support this shift in policy, they \nhave clearly failed to make their case.\n  Once we cut through all of these distractions the administration and \nits allies have tried to throw in our path, we are left again with the \nheart of the matter. The Obama administration is trying to bypass \nCongress and enact policies that are not provided for under current \nlaw. Whether or not one agrees with the administration's change in \npolicy, that simple fact remains and we ought to stand up for the \nprerogatives of the legislative branch. That is why we have three \nseparate branches of government, so that we have some checks and some \nbalances in our society.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I simply cannot stand by and watch the \nadministration undermine the relevance of the legislative branch. I \ncannot stand by and see Members of the House of Representatives who \nhave worked for years to develop expertise on welfare policy turned \ninto potted plants.\n  But there is more than one way to stand up for the U.S. Congress. The \ncountry has been through an exhaustive and highly partisan election. \nSome call it a status quo election. The country has elected a Democrat \nto the White House and sent back a divided Congress. No one side can \nclaim a mandate, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of most \npeople. What the American people want is for Democrats and Republicans \nand the President to work together to get things done for the American \npeople, and get things done right for the American people. One of the \nthings we need to get done is a comprehensive overhaul and \nreauthorization of TANF. Welfare-work requirements need to be updated \nand strengthened, certain loopholes need to be closed, and there must \nbe increased transparency and accountability relative to TANF spending \non child welfare programs and services.\n  In order to begin bringing all sides together, particularly after \nsuch an acrimonious political period, someone must make the first move. \nTherefore, as an act of good faith, in order to facilitate a collegial \nbipartisan working\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nrelationship on TANF, I am putting my colleagues on notice that earlier \ntoday I sent President Obama a letter informing him that I will not \ninsist on a vote on my resolution of disapproval during this session of \nCongress. In the spirit of compromise and bipartisanship, I have asked \nPresident Obama to respond to my action by instructing Health and Human \nServices Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to withdraw the welfare waiver \nrule and submit a 5-year TANF reauthorization proposal to the Congress. \nIf there are aspects of the welfare waiver rule the administration \nwishes us to consider, I hope they will include them in their proposal \nso they can be debated and negotiated here in Congress.\n  I have written to the President and told him I am committed to \nworking with his administration as well as Chairman Camp and Chairman \nBaucus to enact comprehensive and meaningful welfare reauthorization \nearly on in the 113th Congress. I made this offer to President Obama \nwith good will and in good faith. However, if the President rebuffs my \noverture, the Congressional Review Act will afford me this opportunity \nfor another vote on a resolution of disapproval next year. This is \nbecause even if the Senate meets in legislative session every day until \nJanuary 3--including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, New \nYear's Day, and all weekends--there will not have been 60 session days \nbetween the date the welfare waiver rule is deemed to have been \nsubmitted to the Senate and the convening of the 113th Congress. Since \nthe 112th Congress will end before the full 60-session-day period has \nelapsed, the Congressional Review Act provides for another 60-day \nperiod to act on a disapproval resolution regarding this rule in 2013. \nI hope it doesn't come to that. Therefore, if President Obama does not \nwithdraw the welfare waiver rule, submit a 5-year TANF reauthorization \nplan, and then work with Congress to enact meaningful, comprehensive \nwelfare reform that strengthens work requirements and provides for \nimproved accountability of TANF spending, I will be right back here in \na few months exercising my right to demand a vote on a new resolution \nof disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.\n  I sincerely hope it does not come to that. As my colleagues know, I \nhave a long history of forging bipartisan compromises on welfare, among \nmany other things. I was a key player during the 1996 consideration of \nwelfare reform that was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a \nDemocratic President. In 2002, Senator Breaux and I worked with \nRepublicans and Democrats to draft the so-called ``tripartisan'' \nagreement on welfare reauthorization. I stand willing to work again on \na bipartisan basis on this important issue at this most critical time.\n  As Members of Congress, I believe we have a moral obligation to do \nwhat we can to help those facing staggering challenges and deep and \npersistent poverty. We can begin to meet this moral obligation by \nstrengthening and improving the TANF Programs for the working poor, the \nmiddle class, and children in the child welfare system.\n  In America today we have women who take their children with them \nrummaging through trash cans, hoping to find discarded soda cans so \nthey can sell them back to stores. In America today we have families \nwho every month must make painful decisions about whether to buy food \nor medicine or whether to pay to heat their home or put gas in their \ncar. Many single moms have no good choices when it comes to providing \nchildcare for their children while they attempt to find work. I can \nthink of no group of Americans more deserving of having the Senate's \ntime and attention directed toward crafting policies designed to help \nimprove their lives.\n  If my colleagues look over my past 36 years, I have been there for \nthese Americans. I was there in enacting TANF. I was there on a number \nof child welfare programs. I was there on the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. I was there on the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, and countless other bills. These bills I worked on have helped to \nmake a difference.\n  But I am concerned that increasingly, we are becoming a welfare \nsociety. A lot of people aren't going to go to work, and every time, \nevery quarter, we find more and more people who won't even look for a \njob anymore. That is not the way to run a great country. That is not \nthe way to help people to be self-sufficient, it is not the way to help \npeople to be self-reliant, and it is not the way to keep a country \ngreat.\n  This is an important issue. I believe everybody in the Senate ought \nto stand up for the rights of the Congress. And I believe the President \ncan show great good will here if he would do what I have suggested, \nwhich I think my Democratic colleagues would appreciate as well, and \nthat is send up the 5-year reauthorization of TANF and of course \nwithdraw that particular approach toward waivers that literally should \nnot ever be granted without congressional consent. I think the \nPresident would come a long way by doing that and it would mean a lot \nto me personally. Let's hope we can get the President to consider these \nremarks this day because they have been delivered in good faith, hoping \nwe will find solutions to these problems and, above all, hoping we can \nhelp our people.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Madam President, in every corner of the globe--from \npole to pole, and from the top of our atmosphere to the depths of our \noceans--we see evidence of the fundamental changes that are taking \nplace across our Earth.\n  In 2012, North America experienced a number of unusually severe \nevents and passed several ominous milestones. These episodes have \ndriven a shift in attitude--a realization, really, among Americans. As \nwe head home for the holidays this year, each of us is likely to find \nback in our home States that more and more people are convinced that \nclimate change is happening, and that it is deadly serious.\n  Here are just some of the extraordinary events that occurred as we \nlook back on this year, 2012.\n  January 2012 was the fourth warmest January experienced in the \ncontiguous United States since we began keeping records. And we began \nkeeping records in 1895. By the end of January, snowpack in the Sierra \nNevada Mountains was 50 percent less than normal.\n  February 2012 marked the end of the fourth warmest winter on record--\nan above-average start to the year but not extremely so.\n  Then this happened: March 2012. March 2012 was the warmest March on \nrecord. Every State in the Nation experienced a record daily high \ntemperature in March. There were 21 instances of nighttime \ntemperatures--nighttime temperatures--being as warm or warmer than the \nexisting daytime record temperature.\n  It was also in March that a University of Texas poll asked \nrespondents if they thought climate change was occurring. Madam \nPresident, 83 percent of Democrats said yes; 60 percent of Independents \nsaid yes; 45 percent of Republicans said yes.\n  As 2012 went on, things did not slow down much for the lower 48 \nStates.\n  April 2012 would become the third warmest April on record. I came to \nthe floor in April to speak about another milestone surpassed that \nmonth. For the first time--for the first time--one of NOAA's remote \nmonitoring sites--this one in the Arctic--recorded a concentration of \n400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, \ncrushing records that go back 8,000 centuries. For 8,000 centuries \nmankind has inhabited a planet with an atmosphere with carbon \nconcentration being 170 and 300 parts per million. We have broken out \nof that. For the\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nfirst time, in April, we hit 400 parts per million.\n  By May, it was no surprise that spring 2012 was a full 2 degrees \nFahrenheit warmer than the next warmest spring in recorded history. May \nwas the second warmest ever.\n  June was only the eighth warmest June, but it officially marked the \nend of the warmest 12-month period the United States of America has \never experienced.\n  Across the lower 48, July was not only the warmest July on record, it \nwas the all-time warmest month in America in recorded history. \nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 62.9 percent of the contiguous \nU.S. was experiencing moderate to exceptional drought by the end of the \nmonth--nearly two-thirds. Madam President, 62.9 percent was \nexperiencing moderate to exceptional drought as a result of this being \nthe all-time warmest month.\n  As the mercury climbed in July, so did agreement among Americans on \nthe crisis of climate change. That University of Texas poll was taken \nagain, and the percentage of Democrats convinced of global climate \nchange had risen to 87 percent in July, up from 83 percent in March. \nAmong Independents, the percentage went from 60 percent up to 72 \npercent. And Republican believers in climate change became a majority. \nThey went from 45 percent to 53 percent.\n  By August we had experienced the third hottest summer in the history \nof the continental United States. In the West, 3.6 million acres were \nablaze with wildfires--nearly twice the August average, and the most in \nthe 12-year period of record.\n  August also brought bad news from the North. The University of \nColorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center and NASA announced that \nArctic sea ice had reached a record low area of 1.58 million square \nmiles--nearly 70,000 square miles smaller than the previous modern \nrecord low. Over the past three decades, average annual temperatures \nhad increased twice as much over the Arctic as over the rest of the \nworld. The average extent of the Arctic sea ice has declined by 25 to \n30 percent in that time, and the rate of decline is accelerating.\n  September 2012. September 2012 was the 16th month in a row that the \ncontiguous United States recorded an above 20th century average \ntemperature.\n  October finally ended that record streak with a temperature across \nthe lower 48 that was 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit below the long-term \naverage. But October also brought us, as the Acting President pro \ntempore so well knows, Hurricane Sandy, Superstorm Sandy. It was the \nlargest Atlantic hurricane on record, claiming more than 100 lives, and \nthe second costliest. The cleanup in my home State of Rhode Island and \nacross the east coast--I know most agonizingly in New York and New \nJersey--is still underway. This week in the Senate we are working to \napprove a $60 billion aid package which will help restore that damage.\n\n\n                           Hazard Mitigation\n\n  Let me step aside of my climate remarks and speak for 1 minute to \nthat because as we consider this supplemental appropriations bill, \nlong-term mitigation must be part of this discussion. We should not \nreplace and rebuild what was damaged just as it was. We need to replace \nand rebuild smarter. Sandy is a preview of what is to come. \nInfrastructure that failed or flooded should be replaced to higher \nstandards; at-risk roads, wastewater treatment plants, and other \nutilities need to be relocated to safer places.\n  If disaster strikes, as it has, and we do not plan ahead, as we are \nbeing urged not to, we will squander Federal dollars. A 2005 study by \nthe National Institute of Building Sciences showed FEMA hazard \nmitigation efforts yielded an average cost-benefit ratio of 4 to 1--$4 \nsaved for every $1 spent. Let's not be foolish.\n  A prime example of this sort of smart planning was in the Acting \nPresident pro tempore's home State at Point Lookout, Lido Beach, and \nAtlantic Beach. These communities invested in sand dune buffers--sand \ndune habitat buffers. When Sandy came, they suffered relatively little \ndamage compared to nearby Long Beach, which had decided against \nmaintaining a sand dune buffer and ended up with an estimated $200 \nmillion in property and infrastructure damage.\n  Coastal wetlands act like sponges during flooding events. They absorb \nwater. They dissipate wave energy. They protect against storm surge. \nThey are an important part of our coastal defenses in coastal States. \nNatural dune systems on barrier islands and beaches do the same. They \nare part of our natural defense against coastal storms. These natural \ndefenses must be protected and strengthened for our future safety. And \nI hope that even Senators who come from landlocked States can \nappreciate what this means in coastal States.\n  So back to Sandy. While it is impossible to say specifically that \nclimate change caused Superstorm Sandy, we know that warmer oceans, \nwarmer, moister air, and higher sea level all add to the power and \ndanger of these extreme storms. We know that climate change ``loads the \ndice'' for such storms.\n  Madam President, 2012 marched us past even more portentous \nmilestones. NOAA reported that November 2012 was the 333rd month in a \nrow--the 333rd month in a row--that the global monthly temperature was \nabove the 20th century average. The Earth has not seen a single month \nbelow 20th century average temperatures since February of 1985. Some of \nthese interns and pages here were born after that. They have lived \ntheir entire lives in that environment.\n  According to the National Climate Data Center, 2012 is set to be the \nwarmest calendar year on record for the contiguous United States. \nDecember would have to be one full degree Fahrenheit colder than the \ncoldest December on record to prevent that from happening and make up \nfor the exceptionally hot first 8 months of the year.\n  The overwhelming majority of scientific research indicates that these \nobserved changes in the Earth's atmosphere are the direct result of \nhuman activity; namely, the emission of carbon dioxide from the burning \nof fossil fuels.\n  Just last week, Dr. James Powell, former Reagan and George H.W. Bush \nappointee to the National Science Board, released a new review of the \nscientific literature, in which he searched for articles that expressly \nreject human-caused global warming or propose an alternate explanation. \nHe looked at 13,950 peer-reviewed climate articles--nearly 14,000 peer-\nreviewed climate articles. Madam President, 24--24--either rejected \nglobal warming trends or denied the human contribution to warming.\n  I am not even sure if viewers looking at this on C-SPAN can see it, \nbut on this circle pie graph I have in the Chamber, this little red \nline depicts the 24 articles out of the 14,000. It is a tiny fringe.\n  The science is clear, and more and more Americans accept that the \nscience is clear behind climate change. An AP poll out just last week \nfound that 78 percent of Americans accept the reality of climate \nchange.\n  The findings, like the University of Texas poll, break it down by \npolitical party: 83 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Independents, \nand 70 percent of Republicans. So the real debate in this country is \nnot whether humans are altering our climate but how severely we will do \nso and how as a society we will respond to this challenge.\n  Although some Members of this Chamber continue to deny the existence \nof climate change, Americans are aware that our Nation is vulnerable to \nextreme weather events. They are aware that climate change loads the \ndice. They are aware that carbon pollution continues unabated, and they \nare aware that Congress has failed to act.\n  The public is ready for us to take action, but we are not. We are, as \nI have said in a previous speech, sleepwalking. As Congress sleepwalks, \nAmericans actually are taking action on their own. In coordination with \nthe nonprofit organization 350.org, for example, students at more than \n150 colleges and universities across the country are pressing those \ninstitutions to sell off the portions of their endowment portfolios \nthat are invested in fossil fuel companies. These students are \nimploring their schools to weigh the real cost of climate change \nagainst the drive for greater financial returns and divest from the \npolluters.\n  This type of divestment campaign was employed effectively in the \n1980s to pull investment from South Africa during apartheid. With \nAmerican college\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\nand university endowments estimated to total more than $400 billion, \nthis movement by students deserves significant attention.\n  In the Senate key legislation such as the Water Resources Development \nAct must reflect the reality that our climate and environment are \nchanging, that we need to prepare for these changes. We should take \ndirect legislative action to mitigate climate change. We should defend \nthe administration's carbon pollution standards which will require new \nand existing powerplants to clean up their smokestacks.\n  The United States must support the Department of Defense, the world's \nsingle largest consumer of oil, as a leader in energy efficiency and \nalternative fuel development for our national security sake. We must \nextend the production tax credit as our colleague, Senator Mark Udall \nof Colorado, has so often and so eloquently pressed us to do. The \nAmerican Wind Energy Association is pushing for a 6-year extension of \nthe production tax credit to grow a vibrant wind power industry in \nAmerica.\n  A greener economy provides a cleaner and safer future for Americans. \nMore Americans already work in the green industries than in the fossil \nfuels industry. A Brookings Institution report found the clean economy \nemploys 2.7 million workers. That is manufacturing and exports, the \nkind of jobs that support a strong middle class. But in Congress we are \nsleepwalking through history. We are sleepwalking through history, and \nwe must wake up; awaken to our duties, awaken to our responsibilities, \nawaken to the plain facts that lay all around us if only we would open \nour eyes and see them.\n  The public has every reason to want to grab us and give us a good \nshake. We are sleepwalking through this era, lulled as we sleepwalk by \nthe narcotics of corporate money, corporate money out of the polluters \nand their allies. We are lulled by the narcotics of manufactured doubt \nplanted in a campaign of disinformation by those same polluters and \nallies. But history is calling us loudly and clearly. History is \nshouting in our ears. We are oblivious, sleepwalking along.\n  The people across the country and around the world are counting on \nus. They are imploring us. We have responsibilities to them. Yet in \nCongress, we ignore the facts. We ignore our duties. We sleepwalk on. \nIt is irresponsible and it is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8162-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8162-S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to say a few words about \nour close, beloved friend, colleague, Danny Inouye. I am hard pressed \nto think of anyone in this body I respected and loved more than Danny \nInouye. His broad smile, his desire to work with you, help you, his \ninterest in finding common ground, his decency, his honesty, his \nforthrightness, and his dedication to service is unsurpassed.\n  Someone pointed out to me that when Dan was first chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee, he passed all of the measures through \nhis committee virtually unanimously. We should stop and think about \nthat for just a second. This place is now so polarized, it is so \ndifficult to get measures passed. But Dan, as committee chairman, \nworked with his members so virtually every bill in his first year was \npassed unanimously. There was one that was 29 to 1.\n  If only we would stop and reflect on that a bit, it would help us to \nwork better together. Dan also worked very closely with Ted Stevens. \nOne time Ted was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, another time \nthe ranking member. The two of them worked very closely together to get \nmeasures passed through the Appropriations Committee. Other committees \ndo the same; the chairman and the ranking member work well together. \nRegrettably, those measures then come out to the floor and become very \npolarized. That toxic dynamic of this echo chamber, Washington, DC, \ntakes over once measures get on the floor.\n  Everyone will talk about Danny as a military hero. He certainly was \nin so many respects. When Pearl Harbor was bombed, he tried to sign up, \nand he was refused because he was Japanese American. The Japanese were \nthe enemy. But he and others petitioned the President and he was able \nto finally sign up.\n  Danny served his country, our country, fully over in Italy, losing an \narm. He was such a hero, storming several German machine-gunner nests. \nHe was so brave because he was American. He was fighting for his \ncountry.\n  Some may have mentioned, or some might in the future mention, Danny's \nstatement to many of us who went to a Prayer Breakfast a few months \nago. Dan did not ever go to any Prayer Breakfasts, but he went to one. \nHe wanted to explain why he did something. It was one of the more \ntouching moments in my memory here. It is when Danny went through a bit \nof his life, explaining how he was--in Hawaii, in a foster home or an \norphanage, something similar to that, and a bishop would come by \nmonthly to each of the young children, and say: What can I do for you, \nyoung lady; you, young man?\n  Danny right away said: I want a home. And Danny explained how he then \nwent to live in the Security home, raised by nuns. That went a long way \nto help Danny appreciate and understand decency, working together, \ncommunity. It meant a lot to him.\n  Later, at Pearl Harbor he wanted to sign up. He did and served. But \nwhen he explained all of this to us, he then mentioned how he stormed--\nhe was a very good shot. He was an excellent shot. He was a marksman. \nHe was a sharpshooter. He recounted the first German he shot and killed \nin Italy.\n  At that moment he was pretty proud of himself, very patriotic. I am a \ngood shot. I am an American. I got that German. They were engaged with \nthe enemy frequently. He shot a few more Germans. One time he stormed a \ntower. There was a machine gunner up in the tower. Danny rushed up. \nPrior to that time, one of the solders threw a grenade or shot a \nbazooka. It blew up most of the Germans there in that tower.\n  Danny stormed up the stairway, got up there and there was one still \nalive. Danny's immediate reaction was to use the butt of his gun to hit \nthe soldier so the soldier could not shoot him. Well, at that moment, \nthe soldier then reached into his pocket and pulled out photographs, \nphotographs of the soldier's family, the soldier's mother, the \nsoldier's brothers and sisters and children.\n  Danny, in that instant, it was like an epiphany. He then realized he \nwas not shooting the enemy, he was not shooting soldiers, he was not \nracking up statistics, he was killing people, a person, a real live \nperson. It hit him so hard he then decided he had to leave. He had to \nstop this. He could not go on killing people.\n  He went to the chaplain and said: Chaplain, I have to leave.\n  The chaplain said: Well, I understand. That is your right. But maybe \nit is best if you stay in the service.\n  Danny stayed. Danny said a lot of people count sheep going to sleep \nat night. Danny stayed awake at night. He could not sleep. He was \ncounting the soldiers he shot and killed, and that had a huge, profound \neffect on him.\n  Years later, the Senate was debating the Iraq war resolution. Senator \nByrd walked up to Senator Inouye. Senator Byrd, as we will recall, was \nvery much opposed to the United States entering the war in Iraq. He \nstood up on the Senate floor and very eloquently explained why it was \nthe wrong thing to do--the United States should not send troops over to \nIraq.\n  Well, Senator Byrd walked over to Danny and said: Danny, I have to \nask you if you can support this resolution. I know you cannot because, \nmy gosh, you are a war hero and given your military service.\n  Danny right away said: Oh, no, I will vote with you because it is the \nright thing to do. It is wrong for the United States to send troops \nover to Iraq.\n  Danny said it was largely because of that experience, when that \nsoldier reached in his pocket and showed him photographs of his family, \nthat it just changed him. It changed Danny and made Danny realize the \nimportance of not going to war unless it is absolutely, totally \nnecessary, and going to Iraq was not necessary.\n  I was so impressed with Danny in so many different ways. When I was \nfirst here, Danny was assigned to defend Harrison Williams who was \ncharged with ABSCAM violations. I remember,\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\nright over here on the side over here, Danny set up; that was his \nresponsibility as a lawyer on the floor to defend Senator Williams. I \nwas stunned at Danny's presentation. It was so good. It was so \nthoughtful. He spoke with such authority. Sure, he was a lawyer doing \nwhat lawyers are supposed to do, but as I said, it was stunning. He was \nan amazing man. It may be kind of a small thing. It may not be \nsomething that is repeated terribly often on the floor of the Senate, \nbut I was stunned at how good he was. Other things I have also dealt \nwith him personally on, matters dealing with the Appropriations \nCommittee and sometimes on matters dealing with Montana.\n  I was really honored; we have this tradition around here called the \nsecret Santa where we give presents secretly to one of our colleagues. \nI drew Danny Inouye's name. I was Danny's secret Santa. I thought: My \ngosh, what am I going to do to sufficiently honor Danny?\n  I thought a little bit. Years ago there was something in Montana \ncalled the Devil's Brigade. During World War II the U.S. military \njoined with Canadians and set up secret training for rugged men, \nmountaineers, miners and loggers, and so forth to go over to Europe and \nhelp fight the war.\n  It is interesting, this is a precursor to all of special operations: \nNavy SEALs and Rangers and all of the special operations sprung from \nthis secret, joint U.S.-Canadian effort in Montana. It was called the \nDevil's Brigade.\n  They went over in their first big operation to scale a cliff that was \noutside Rome, a hill held by the Germans. The Germans thought no way in \nthe world would someone come up the cliff, so we will not defend the \ncliff.\n  Sure enough, the Devil's Brigade climbed that cliff at night. They \nbeat the Germans up on the top. I thought this was a great gift for \nDanny since World War II and Italy meant so much for him.\n  But, regretfully, when I went to the little ceremony, Danny was not \nthere and I could not give him my Secret Santa gift--but it is a small \nthing. As I walked over here, the secretary in my office said: Senator, \nyou should see this. A letter came in today, just today, this morning. \nIt is from Danny, and it was wishing me happy birthday. My birthday is \n4 days after Pearl Harbor, and it just poignantly hit me. This was \nsomething thoughtful Danny did. He did it himself. It wasn't an office \nletter. It was something he wrote himself.\n  I will just finish. There were a lot of things about Danny, but the \none thing I think that is so appropriate, again, Dan was such a \nstatesman. He was beloved, obviously a hero, and all the things we like \nto talk about.\n  I would like to read a little excerpt from a book. It is a preface \nDan wrote. Dan wrote his own personal history. It is a ``Journey to \nWashington'' by Senator Danny Inouye.\n  There is a preface, written by Senator Mike Mansfield, at the \nbeginning of the book, and I would like to read this preface. It \nsummarizes Danny.\n\n       The life of Danny Inouye has carried him from the streets \n     of Honolulu into war, into law and political leadership in \n     Hawaii, and, now, into the Senate of the United States as the \n     first American Senator of Japanese ancestry. Dan Inouye's \n     life is a personal triumph, a triumph of a man's courage and \n     determination. But his triumph is, in the end, the triumph of \n     America. The recognition which has come to Dan Inouye, like \n     others before him, reveals the resilient capacity of this \n     nation for replenishment, with energy and wisdom drawn from \n     the many wellsprings of the human race. The story of Daniel \n     Ken Inouye, an American, is, in truth, an enduring chapter in \n     the story of America.\n\n  So, Danny, aloha.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to compliment the Senator from Montana on \nhis deeply moving and so personal reminiscences. It was both touching \nand manly. Thank you very much. It was inspirational.\n\n\n                            Hurricane Sandy\n\n  Madam President, I come to the floor--and I am so glad the Senator \nfrom New York is the Presiding Officer--because here we are, the \nChamber is vacant. It looks like the Senate is not moving. The \nPresiding Officer is a Senator from New York, along with Senator \nSchumer. I am a Senator from Maryland, and we have been hit by a \nhurricane. We have been hit by Hurricane Sandy.\n  I come to the floor to say, as we reflect on the life and times of \nSenator Danny Inouye, we should also reflect on his work, which is to \nmove appropriations bills in a timely way--and particularly when that \nappropriations bill deals with the supplemental appropriations to meet \nthe compelling human needs of our communities and our people when they \nhave suffered a natural disaster.\n  The clock is ticking. We have businesses that need to restart. We \nhave homes that need to be rebuilt. In my own State of Maryland, we had \na double whammy. As the hurricane came forth on our coastal areas along \nthe beloved Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, we were hit by the \nhurricane. Then up in western Maryland, Garrett County, called the \nSwitzerland of Maryland, we were hit by a blizzard--a blizzard.\n  Where are we now? It has been days. The TV cameras have left, but the \ncompelling human need has not.\n  What is the Senate facing? Inertia, parliamentary roadblocks, and we \nare fussing about the budget. I believe we need to have a more frugal, \nsensible government, but these are the American people. Sometimes I am \nfor helping other nations around the world, but after a natural \ndisaster, while we have been busy rebuilding Afghanistan, how about if \nwe rebuild New York, New Jersey. How about getting my communities up \nand running along the coast of the Chesapeake Bay and communities such \nas Crisfield. These people are not asking for a handout; they are \nasking for a hand up. These are the American citizens who pay their \ntaxes on time. Then why doesn't the Senate act on time? I am deeply \nfrustrated by the inertia and the parliamentary roadblocks for nothing.\n  Look what this would mean. We could show hope and help. Actually, \nalong the way, the very things we will do will be creating jobs in the \nlocal community because this is physical reconstruction--and, I might \nadd, the reconstruction of human lives.\n  The Senator from New York knows so well; she told me the moving \nstories of the firefighters themselves, our gallant first responders \nwho suffered terrible fires in their own home communities. What a \nhorrible thing. I know if the Presiding Officer came over with me to \nthe Eastern Shore and went down to the community of Crisfield, she \nwould be touched. This is a wonderful community, but they have had some \nhard times. They have a 94-percent unemployment rate. Our agriculture \nand our seafood industries have been hit by drought and declining \nspecies. Our industries have been hard hit. In these rural areas, these \nhomes have been in these communities for generation after generation \nafter generation.\n  The western shore lobbyists who come in or appraisers who are looking \nfor Gucci waterfront property might value these small, tidy, well-\nmaintained homes for appraisal value, but the appraisal was in the \nhearts of my people of Crisfield. Generations have lived there. \nGenerations have worked there. Generations have sent their sons to \nfight the wars--and now their daughters. All they want is for their \ncountry to help them rebuild, get the mold out, get some assistance \ncoming in so they can buy their crab pots and get back to work. They \nwant their homes. They want to get their lives back, and they want to \nget their livelihoods back.\n  What do we have here? Inertia.\n  When all is said and done, I am very tired that more gets said than \ngets done. This is the time to act. My constituents truly need help, \nand we have been here.\n  I am going to congratulate Senator Murray and Senator Landrieu, who \nchair the subcommittees in Appropriations on FEMA and THUD because it \nwill be FEMA money and community development block grant money that \nwill help these communities. Now we are going to need the Corps of \nEngineers for beach replenishment, public investments that will protect \nprivate property. It has been 2 months since Sandy, 2 months. Surely, \nwe can act.\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n  The President has made a request. Yes, it is a hefty $60 billion. But \nlook at who was hit, a big city that is one of the heartbeats of \nAmerica, New York, and a little community such as Crisfield. But no \nmatter whether someone lives in New York City or in Crisfield, MD, they \ndeserve the help from their government.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us think of the people we were sent to \nrepresent. We weren't sent to represent a bottom line; we were sent to \nrepresent people. I would hope we would put into place, that we would \npass the President's request. We have great policies that were arrived \nat--and if you truly want to honor Senator Inouye, let us honor his own \ncode of conduct, a gentle way, a civil way, a consensus builder, a \nbipartisan builder, and a worker to move this bill.\n  Senator Inouye chaired the full Committee on Appropriations these \nlast couple years. His own staff shared a story with me, and it is \nrelevant today.\n  He said: I chaired the Defense subcommittee, and that is how the \nFederal budget defends America. But my other committees, like Labor-\nHHS--and I might add housing, Federal disaster assistance--is how we \ndefine ourselves. So those who say let us make sure we defend America, \nlet us also make sure we put the money in the Federal budget on how it \ndefines America.\n  The way we define America is when one community is hit, all \ncommunities are hit. If New York is hit, Crisfield or Ocean City, all \ncommunities have been hit. We need to act like the United States of \nAmerica because the disaster the Chair and I faced 2 months ago could \nbe somebody else's disaster tomorrow. And the real disaster should not \nbe in the Senate because we failed to act.\n  I call my colleagues to the floor, and I call them forth to pass \nthese appropriations. I look forward again to working on both sides of \nthe aisle to have a safer country from either a defense or a disaster \nperspective, and I also look forward to moving this bill in a way that \nwe will define our country, that we are a country that helps, neighbor \nhelping neighbor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to praise the senior Senator from \nMaryland. I was out here listening to what she said but not just the \nwords. She believes them. It is a passion. She cares.\n  She and I have served on the Appropriations Committee for about 100 \nor 200 years, I think. She was a child when she went there, but we have \nserved there together. We both have lost one of our dearest friends, \nSenator Inouye.\n  But over and over in that committee, I have heard her stand and say: \nPeople are involved. These are human beings, and we ought to stand up \nfor them.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, because she represents \nNew York State, when we have a disaster of this unbelievable amount, \nthe whole Nation is supposed to come together. We are the United States \nof America. We are not the State of New York, the State of Maryland, \nthe State of Vermont; we are the United States of America.\n  We have come together as a country. Whether the disaster has been in \nCalifornia, on the east coast or in Southern States or in the West, we \ncome together, and that is what we are trying to do. I would defy any \nSenator who has worried about coming together to help these people to \ngo to one of the homes. Go to one of the homes on Long Island. Go to \none of the homes that has been devastated. Go to one of the businesses \nwhere we have a couple who spent their whole life building up their \nbusiness, hoping to have something to leave to their children, and now \nthey are looking at rubble. Come on. These are real people. This is the \nUnited States of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8164-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

APPROVAL OF THE 2010 U.S.-PALAU AGREEMENT IN \n                   RESPONSE TO SUPER TYPHOON BOPHA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The agreement entitled ``The Agreement \n     Between the Government of the United States of America and \n     the Government of the Republic of Palau Following the Compact \n     of Free Association Section 432 Review'' signed on September \n     3, 2010 (including the appendices to the agreement) (referred \n     to in this section as the ``Agreement'') is approved (other \n     than Article 7 to the extent it extends Article X of the \n     Federal Programs and Services Agreement) and may only enter \n     into force after the Secretary of State, in coordination with \n     the Secretary of the Interior, enters into an implementing \n     arrangement with the Republic of Palau that makes the \n     adjustments to dates and amounts as set forth in Senate \n     Amendment 3331.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 105(f)(1)(B)(ix) of the Compact of \n     Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (48 U.S. C. \n     1921d(f)(1)(B)(ix)) is amended by striking ``2009'' and \n     inserting ``2024''.\n       (c) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--There are appropriated to the Secretary of \n     the Interior such sums as are specified to carry out sections \n     1, 2(a), 4(a), and 5 of the Agreement for each of fiscal \n     years 2014 through 2024.\n       (2) Availability.--Amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) \n     shall remain available until expended.\n       (3) Emergency designation.--Amounts appropriated under \n     paragraph (1) are designated by Congress as being for an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of the \n     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139; 2 \n     U.S.C. 933(g)).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment offered by myself\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nand cosponsored by Senators Webb and Wyden. It would provide for the \napproval of an agreement between the United States and the Republic of \nPalau in response to Supertyphoon Bopha.\n  Few people are aware that as Hurricane Sandy was making its landfall \nin the northeastern part of our country, the United States, a \nsupertyphoon known as Bopha was tracking a path of destruction across \nthe western Pacific. The Republic of Palau, which is one of our closest \nallies and with which we are tied by a strategic alliance known as the \nCompact of Free Association, was struck by Bopha on December 2, causing \nextensive damage. The President of Palau declared a state of emergency, \nand the U.S. President, acting through the Department of State, issued \na disaster declaration for Palau.\n  This massive storm went on to kill over 1,000 people in the \nPhilippines. Fortunately, there were no deaths in Palau, but high winds \nand storm surge and torrential rains caused widespread damage.\n  A week ago the Ambassador from Palau, the Honorable Hersey Kyota, \nwrote to me as the chair of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, which has jurisdiction for assistance to nations that are in \nfree association with the United States. The Ambassador asked for my \nhelp in responding to the disaster, but he did not ask for additional \nfunding. Instead, the Ambassador asked that the agreement on future \nassistance that was signed between the United States and Palau in 2010 \nbe added to this emergency supplemental so the funding already agreed \nto by representatives of the United States would become available for \ndisaster relief and recovery in Palau.\n  I fully support the request by the Ambassador. I am glad to have the \ncosponsorship of my colleagues Senator Webb, who is chairman of the \nAsia-Pacific subcommittee, and Senator Wyden, who, of course, is the \nincoming chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and I \nurge my colleagues' support of the amendment.\n  The amendment tracks S. 343, which was introduced by me in February \nof 2011. At that time it was cosponsored by Senators Murkowski, Akaka, \nand Webb. The agreement to be approved would revise and update the \nCompact of Free Association that has governed U.S.-Palau relations \nsince 1994 by extending and phasing out financial assistance over 11 \nyears.\n  Palau is an island nation located strategically between the U.S. \nterritory of Guam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Captured in World \nWar II, Palau became part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of \nthe Pacific Islands. In 1994 Palau became a sovereign nation in free \nassociation with the United States under a 50-year compact that grants \nthe U.S. military rights that the Department of State calls ``vital to \nour national security.''\n  The compact also provided Palau with an initial 15-year term of \nassistance that ended in 2009. The agreement would extend and phase out \nU.S. assistance by 2024. Congress has provided stop-gap funding since \n2009, but the Department of Defense wrote to our committee--the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources--in April of 2011 stating:\n\n       Failure to follow through on our commitments to Palau, as \n     reflected in the proposed [agreement], would jeopardize our \n     defense posture in the Western pacific.\n\n  The agreement provides for the phaseout of financial assistance for \noperations, construction, and maintenance. The Congressional Budget \nOffice's 10-year budget estimate for direct spending is $171 million. \nThis U.S. commitment to future funding would make a crucial \ncontribution to Palau's efforts to respond and recover from this \npresent disaster.\n  U.S. failure to respond to the needs of this strategic ally in its \ntime of need by simply approving the already signed agreement would \nsignal to Palau and to most other nations in the Pacific that the \nUnited States is an unreliable partner. So I urge the support of my \ncolleagues for this amendment and for approving the agreed-to \nassistance to Palau so they may have the resources needed to respond to \nSupertyphoon Bopha.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8165-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8165-S8169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to address this Chamber \nfor possibly the last time as the senior Senator from the great State \nof Texas.\n  I have to say it is an ironic note that if I had given my farewell \naddress last week, there would have been so much joy in the halls of \nthe Capitol, ringing with the laughter and the anticipation of our \nseason's happiest time. But in just one weekend, a sadness has set in \nwith the news of a massacre of innocent children in Newtown, CT, \nfollowed by the loss of our wonderful colleague, Senator Danny Inouye.\n  So I will leave this extraordinary institution and experience with a \nheavy heart for those who have been lost in the last few days.\n  I want to thank the people of Texas for asking me to represent them \nin Washington. I want to thank the many people who have served on my \nstaff for almost 20 years. I have to say I am touched that both benches \non both sides of this room are filled with my staff members who have \nbeen so hard-working and so loyal and have produced so much in 20 years \nfor our State and Nation, and I thank them.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and all the people who work here, the \nSenators, but also those who work behind the scenes to make our lives \nas good as they can be with the hard hours we all have; those who keep \nour buildings safe and clean, who work in the libraries, the shops, the \ncafeterias, and who guide tens of thousands of tourists through our \nNation's beautiful Capitol each year.\n  I want to thank my husband Ray and our two children Bailey and \nHouston. They are 11 years old now, and so many of my colleagues who \nwere here when I started bringing my children as babies have watched \nthem grow up. The Senate isn't easy on families. They have sacrificed \nso I could serve the people of Texas, and I am grateful for their \npatience and generosity. They have loved coming to the Capitol--11 \nyears for the children and 20 for my husband Ray. And I know my \nchildren's fondest memory, if I ask them what do they remember most \nabout visits to the Capitol, is playing soccer in the Russell \nBuilding's hallways in the evenings when the coast is clear.\n  I would not be here today if it were not for my parents who gave me \nthe gifts of strong values, unwavering support, and education to be \nwhatever I wanted to be. I must say that my parents were surprised when \nthey saw what I wanted to be. They would never have thought that their \ndaughter, growing up in LaMarque, TX--a town of 15,000 good people--\nwould think she could be a United States Senator. We had a wonderful \npublic school system, and I am proud to say I am a product of public \neducation. My public schools in LaMarque--which were excellent--and my \nUniversity of Texas and University of Texas Law School prepared me to \nbe what I could be.\n  It has been a privilege to walk these halls in the Capitol of the \nworld's greatest and longest serving democracy.\n  I think back to the days that stand out in our memories. September \n11, 2001, of course, is the one none of us will ever forget. We know \nexactly where we were the minute we knew there was a terrorist attack \non America. And though we suffered a horrific attack, the strength, \nresilience, and extraordinary acts of kindness of the American people \nshowed the world that attempts to destroy our way of life would never \nsucceed. On that day, no one could get in or out of Washington and many \ncommunications networks were inoperable. So when the Pentagon was hit \nand the Capitol was evacuated, my staff and I walked one block to my \nhome on Capitol Hill. Just as an example, the husband of my office \nmanager worked in the section of the Pentagon that had been hit, so we \nwere on the one phone that we had to hospitals, the police, anyone we \nthought might be able to tell us if he was safe. Thankfully, he was \nfine. But there were so\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nmany who waited for hours, who called hospitals, to hear from their \nloved ones. Sometimes the news was a relief and sometimes they waited \nin vain for good news.\n  I have to say it was an incredible moment when the Senators who could \nfind each other, wherever they had gone from the Capitol, finally \ngathered late afternoon in the Capitol Police headquarters to talk to \nour leaders who had been taken to an undisclosed location. They said, \nWe don't want anyone to come, but we were going to the steps of the \nCapitol to hold a press conference. We don't want anyone there because \nwe don't know if it is safe, but we want to tell the press that we are \ngoing to open for business tomorrow and do the Nation's business, even \nthough there was suspicion that the Capitol had been on the terrorists' \nlist of targets.\n  Every single one of the Senators--and I think there were 60 to 70 who \nhad made it to the Capitol Police headquarters--did come to the Capitol \nsteps, as did Members of the House of Representatives. After the press \nconference was held by the leaders, all of the several hundred who had \ngathered spontaneously broke out singing ``God Bless America.'' That \nwas a time that said this is the strength of our country and we will \nnot be defeated.\n  As I exit the Senate, I am aware that we are divided as a legislative \nbody and as a country. I do not think we have different goals--not \nhere, and not in America--but we do have different ways of reaching \nthem. Congress suffers a great deal of criticism for partisan acrimony. \nBut while we may disagree politically and air our opposition in this \nChamber, it is the conversation behind the scenes that cements and \ndefines our relationships. I will leave the Senate knowing I have \nworked with men and women of great patriotism, intellect, and heart on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, for the many \nwonderful years working together. We seconded one another at times and \nengaged in rigorous debate in others. Yet the American people should \nknow that either way, we are collegial and we all understand that our \nStates have different needs and there will be differences in \npriorities. But in the Senate, an adversary today will be an ally \ntomorrow. It is a rare occasion for acrimony to turn personal.\n  It would be my parting hope that this collegiality will not be lost. \nProtecting the rights of the minority has assured that every Senator's \nvoice is heard and every State represented is heard, as intended by our \nConstitution. Open debate and open amendments are what differentiate \nthe Senate from the House.\n  When our committees function, we pass bills in vigorous markups, we \nput the bills in shape for floor debate. If they don't go through \ncommittees and are not allowed floor amendments, the quality of the \nlegislation suffers and mistakes are often made.\n  Let me give you some examples of how relationships can produce \nresults.\n  During the anthrax scare, the Hart Building was closed for a month, \nwhich made it very difficult, of course, for Senators based there to do \ntheir work. So Senator Dianne Feinstein's staff joined in my offices in \nthe Russell Building. My chief of staff at the time gave them full \naccess. One of Senator Feinstein's staff members commented on that: A \nRepublican office giving Democrats free rein? But my chief of staff \nsaid, They had full access because we trusted them.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have teamed up to pass important \nlegislation--the Hutchison-Feinstein Overseas Basing Commission--that \nstudied the training capabilities and costs of overseas military bases \nto determine their value compared to American bases. This resulted in \nconsolidation and closures that brought thousands of troops back to the \nUnited States where training and rapid deployment were superior. We \npassed the Feinstein-Hutchison Breast Cancer Research Stamp bill that, \nthrough voluntary purchase, has raised $72 million for breast cancer \nresearch. That was Senator Feinstein's idea. And Senator Feinstein and \nI took the Amber Alert for abducted children nationwide, which has \naccounted for rescuing almost 600 children since its passage.\n  I remember when Senator Hillary Clinton stopped by with her chief of \nstaff to wish me happy birthday the first year she was in the Senate. \nIt was just a few months after she had arrived, and my staff was \nsurprised--and possibly a bit star-struck--to see the former First Lady \nwalk into the room. We went on to work together on Vital Voices, a \nglobal partnership dedicated to supporting and empowering women leaders \nand social entrepreneurs in emerging economies. We also teamed up with \nSenators Mikulski and Collins to assure public schools had the option \nto offer single-sex schools and classes, after I visited with Secretary \nof Education Rod Paige the Young Women's Leadership Academy in the \nHarlem area of New York City--one of the first and most successful \npilot projects for girls' public schools, with which I know the \nPresiding Officer is very familiar.\n  I remember the time I invited Senator Barbara Mikulski to Texas, \nbecause she and I have worked together supporting NASA for so many \nyears, and this year she has been chair and I ranking member of the \nAppropriations subcommittee funding NASA. We went to visit the Johnson \nSpace Center because I wanted her to see the great work they are doing \nthere. Then I took her to the Houston rodeo because I wanted her to see \nthe Texas culture. Well, I am not sure the Senator who grew up in the \ninner city of Baltimore knew exactly how people would dress at the \nrodeo, but suffice it to say there were a lot of rhinestones and cowboy \nboots and big hair and big hats. Senator Mikulski whispered to me \nduring this time, Kay, if we were here Monday and we went to the \nChamber of Commerce, would these people look like this? And I said, \nYeah, pretty much.\n  Senator Mikulski and I also teamed up to pass the Homemaker IRA, to \nmake sure our stay-at-home moms and dads would have the same \nopportunity for retirement security savings that those who work outside \nthe home have, and it has been a huge success. We also cosponsored the \nNational Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. She is a \nskilled legislator and a dear friend.\n  Senator Jay Rockefeller has been an outstanding chairman of the \nCommerce Committee. We don't always agree, but as the lead Democrat and \nRepublican we have worked hard to reach consensus, and we have gotten \nthings done--the FAA bill, started the planning for the next generation \nof air traffic control systems; the highway bill; the NASA \nreauthorization that ensured we would keep the focus on our space \nprogram that has been instrumental in our national security and \neconomic development, with tremendous help from Senator Bill Nelson, \nwho is the only one among us today who has actually been into space.\n  In a Congress that has been marked by little progress, we have found \na way forward. For some, that might not be something to take pride in. \nBut we have served the American people by passing legislation that \nkeeps the country running, and I am very proud of what we have been \nable to accomplish. Our Commerce Committee has been one of the most \nproductive in the whole Congress. And I count him as a friend.\n  Maria Cantwell and Harry Reid and I have worked to address the issues \nof our State's taxpayers to have the same deductions as those who have \nincome taxes, though we do not, and that parity has been so important.\n  Leader Mitch McConnell has guided our party and our conference \nthrough the past 6 years. He is a gifted leader and one whom I have \nwitnessed time and time again come up with strategies that have gotten \nthings done in the right way.\n\n  Senator Jon Kyl and I have worked on immigration and death tax \nrelief. Senator Lamar Alexander and I have championed the America \nCompetes Act, so we would continue the priority of scientific research \nand that we would never fail to invest in research because it is the \nsequel for our economy.\n  I am very pleased the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Finance Committee--Finance Committee now and \nJudiciary before--is also on the Senate floor. He has been a wonderful \nfriend to me, helping me in my very first election when he was the rock \nstar at my fundraisers in Texas. I thank Senator Orrin Hatch for his \nlong membership in this body.\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n  I have had the wonderful, good fortune to serve with two colleagues \nfrom my home State. First, Senator Phil Gramm, who was a wonderful \nmentor and colleague. They broke the mold after Senator Gramm. We \nalways enjoyed our school rivalry--he being a Texas Aggie and me being \na University of Texas alum--they like to call them hopeless Tea-sips, \nbut we are proud Longhorns.\n  I have had a great relationship with my other Senator, who is soon \ngoing to be the senior Senator from Texas, John Cornyn. John Cornyn, I \nam very pleased to say, is going to get the opportunity that I have had \nall these years when people trip up and introduce me as the senior \ncitizen of Texas. I turn that mantle over to my colleague, Senator \nCornyn.\n  I am very proud he is going to be the deputy Republican leader in the \nnext Congress. I know he is going to be a steady hand at the wheel as \nwe try to steer the ship of state in the right direction. He has proven \ntime and again that his steady leadership is the one that rises to the \ntop. I thank him for being on the floor as well today.\n  In fact, I want to praise our entire Texas congressional delegation. \nWe call it Team Texas. It is a spirit that holds our delegation \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats. I have noted that there are those \nin Washington who think Texans are a little too loud, and we have a \nlittle too much fun, but I can assure everyone that Team Texas' hearts \nare as big as our mouths.\n  It has been a long and wonderful 19-plus years. We hit the ground \nrunning, and we have never stopped. When I was first elected in a \nspecial election in 1993, we had two--actually four full planeloads of \npeople flying up for my swearing in. Because it was a special election, \nwe filled the entire gallery. Those rowdy Texans were so happy to watch \nmy little swearing in ceremony. It was a great day for me, as well as \nmy wonderful and loyal friends and supporters.\n  I started having weekly constituent coffees that first year because \nthere were so many visitors from Texas and I wanted to make sure at \nleast there was one time every week that any Texan who was here who \nwanted to see me could come and visit and was welcome. So every \nThursday morning around 9 or 9:30, the person in charge of this first \neffort was the wife of a three-star general who volunteered her time in \nour offices. I think it was as much her handling of the event as the \nidea itself that has led many other Senators to take up this practice \nand get a chance to always visit with their constituents at least once \na week if they were otherwise going to committee meetings or having to \ndo their work and were not able to see everyone. I want to thank Gert \nClark for putting her stamp on our Senate hospitality.\n  Some of the most powerful moments that will stay with me forever were \nspent with our members of the military. Visiting with them where they \nare in harm's way across the world is one of the most moving of all \nexperiences. I will never forget the first time, in the early 1990s, \nflying into Sarajevo in an undercover C-130 that was disguised as a Red \nCross delivery of peas--2,000 pounds of peas that we actually had on \nthe C-130--and I have to say my good friend, Danny Inouye, was on that \ntrip with us, as I look over at his empty desk with the white flowers, \nas was Senator Ted Stevens. We flew in to see our troops in Bosnia.\n  Later I went back to Bosnia to spend Easter with our troops where we \nhad the most beautiful Easter sunrise service I have ever attended or \never will. It was in an open-air hangar with our service men and women \nwho were deployed there. For the first time it was a Texas Guard unit \nthat was in command of the base, and it was the first time since the \nKorean war that we had a Guard unit in command of an operation \noverseas. They did a great job, which led to many Guard units from \nother States also to take command of bases and operations.\n  I flew out of Baghdad--this was in the last few years--in another C-\n130 when there were no lights on the plane and no lights on the runway \nto make sure there was no clue to the enemy that we were leaving when \nthey were firing missiles around the airport. Or the times I had \nvisited Afghanistan, where the first time I visited with Senator \nMcCain, our troops were sleeping on cots. There were probably 600 or \n700 cots in an old Russian-built aircraft hangar, before anything had \nbeen brought in for living quarters for our troops. All of their \nbelongings were under their cots, and that was all they had for that \nfirst mission into Afghanistan.\n  I have always been one who has such great respect and gratitude for \nour men and women in uniform. They put their lives on the line and \npledge to give their all for our freedom. The power to wage war is an \nenormous one, and the weight of its responsibility should rest heavy on \nour shoulders.\n  I leave this Chamber proud to have worked to assure our men and women \nin uniform have the best training, the best equipment, and the quality \nof life to do the job we are asking them to do. Because of my deep \nrespect for our Armed Forces, my first choice of committees when I came \nin 1993 was Armed Services, and I was honored to be the first woman in \n20 years to chair a subcommittee on Armed Services. The woman before me \nwas Margaret Chase Smith. As the only woman to chair the Senate \nRepublican Policy Committee, I was pleased to be a part of Republican \nleadership for many years--again, the first since Margaret Chase Smith.\n  When I was first running for office I said I wanted to make things \nbetter for our sons and open for our daughters. I leave the Senate \nknowing that January will see the greatest number of female Senators in \nour Nation's history. I know the torch will be carried on by the next \ngeneration.\n  It is no secret that Texans have a particular sense of state pride. I \nam no exception. I have deep Texas roots. The Senate seat that I hold \nfirst belonged to Thomas Jefferson Rusk, my great-great-grandfather's \nlaw partner and good friend. They both signed the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence from Mexico in 1836. That history reminds me every day \nthat we must protect the freedom that so many of our ancestors fought \nto produce and retain. My colleague sitting on the Senate floor is in \nthe Sam Houston line, and that is a proud line too. Thomas Jefferson \nRusk and Sam Houston were the Commander in Chief and Secretary of War \nof the Texas Army when we fought for independence. It is so fitting \nthat those two were our first two selected Senators when Texas became a \nState in 1845.\n  Each summer I take a week to tour one part of Texas on a bus. It has \nbeen so much fun. We did the first one, which was the El Camino Real de \nlos Tejas that we had just passed a bill to designate as a national \nhistoric trail, and we went from the Louisiana border to the Mexican \nborder. It took us a week on the bus. It was so great that we have done \nit every year since in a different part of Texas. It is my State \nstaff's favorite week of the year as well.\n  I am one of the few to have had the opportunity and the absolute \npleasure to visit all 254 counties in Texas. I have met Texans from all \nwalks of life who have opened their homes, their businesses, and shared \ntheir stories.\n  I will be sad to leave, but it is time. I believe strongly that we \nshould keep the lifeblood of Congress pumping. It is good to have new \nwaves of legislators come in with fresh ideas and perspectives after \nevery election. But while I believe that new generations should \ninvigorate Congress, I also want to say a few words of praise for \nexperience.\n  Knowing the history of an issue is essential to monitor progress. \nKnowing what an agency should be doing, knowing what was put in law and \nwhy allows for better oversight. The expertise of our longer serving \nMembers is an essential part of good governance.\n  I hope some of the priorities I have championed will continue. \nInvestment in science, technology, and higher education and encouraging \nmore young people to study science, technology, engineering, and math, \nknown as STEM, will make sure we are bringing forward those young minds \nwith the creativity and the engineering background to create the \neconomies for the future. It is so important. This has been the \nlifeblood of our economy, and it must continue.\n  Saving the manned space exploration program and ensuring the long-\nterm future of NASA is an essential generator for our economy. Ensuring \nthat stay-at-home moms and dads who worked so hard raising children and\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\ncontributing to the community have spousal IRAs to save for retirement, \nand easing the marriage penalty by doubling the standard deduction--\nthese are a few of the things I hope will continue to be championed as \nI leave.\n  It has been such an honor to serve in the Senate. I leave with the \nhope that the values that built America into the greatest Nation on \nEarth will be protected so that future generations will have the same \nopportunities we have had in this great country, opportunities for \nwhich our forebears sacrificed so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, Texans have a profound sense of history, \nand it is only appropriate that Senator Hutchison should mention the \nfact that we both come from long lines of Texans, starting with Thomas \nJefferson Rusk, who first held her Senate seat, and Sam Houston, who \nheld the Senate seat I hold. I will never forget Senator Hutchison \ncoming to the floor of the Senate every March 2, Texas Independence \nDay, and regaling the Chamber with Travis' letter from the Alamo, \nreminding everyone about another important event in Texas history, a \ntradition which she carried on after Senator John Tower did for so many \nyears when he served here.\n  This is a historic moment for many reasons. First, because we are \npaying tribute to an extraordinary woman who has made history by being \nthe first Texas female United States Senator and someone who has spent \nthe last two decades fighting for commonsense values in our Nation's \nCapitol. While it is hard to summarize Senator Hutchinson's great work \nin just a few short minutes, I am going to try. I am going to try to \nhighlight some of her signature achievements and explain why she enjoys \nsuch outstanding support from her constituents back in our great State.\n  To start with, I cannot think of any Senator serving in this Chamber \nwho works harder than Kay Bailey Hutchison. Sometimes I affectionately \nrefer to her as the Energizer Bunny of the Texas delegation. She is \ntireless and she is relentless in her pursuit of what she believes is \nin the best interests of the constituents in our State.\n  As she mentioned, she has been a tireless advocate for Texas military \nfamilies. We take great pride in the fact that 1 out of every 10 \nindividuals who wears the uniform of the U.S. military calls Texas \nhome. Of course, some of the most powerful tributes to Kay's legacy are \nwhat I have heard from our men and women in uniform.\n  It is no exaggeration to say every military base in Texas has felt \nthe impact of her work on various Senate committees. I know how deeply \nproud Kay is of the work she has done to help the troops stationed in \nTexas from Fort Bliss in the west to the Red River Army Depot in the \neast--which I dare say she pretty much singlehandedly saved from being \nBRACed the last time that occurred--from Sheppard Air Force Base in \nWichita Falls to the Naval Air Force Base in Corpus Christi in the \nsouth. Not only has Kay worked to provide our troops with the resources \nthey need, she has done a whole lot to help returning veterans and, of \ncourse, their families.\n  We always talk about supporting our troops when they are deployed \noverseas, but we spend less time--indeed not enough time--discussing \nways to help them assimilate back into civilian life. As the son of a \nU.S. Air Force veteran who spent 31 years in the Air Force, I am \nacutely aware, as Kay is, it is not just those who wear the uniform who \nserve but their families as well.\n  Many returning vets and their families encounter a whole range of \nsocial and economic hardships that can be hard to overcome. Most \nnotably, the unemployment rate among our returning vets from \nAfghanistan and Iraq is significantly higher than for the general \npopulation, something I know Kay has worked on extensively. She has \nalso worked to get our veterans the medical assistance, the job \ntraining, and the financial support they need. Indeed, I don't know of \nany Senator who has done more to help America's heroes adjust to life \nafter the military. That is just one of the reasons why she will be \nsorely missed.\n  Here is another reason Kay will be missed. She has fought time and \ntime again to promote tax relief for hard-working Texas families. In \nthe mid-1990s, as she alluded, she helped to create the so-called \nhomemaker IRA to make sure stay-at-home moms and dads were able to save \nfor their retirement on an equal basis with their counterparts who \nworked outside the home. I know it is one of her proudest achievements, \nand I am proud to join with the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Barbara \nMikulski, in attempting to rename this IRA the Kay Bailey Hutchison \nspousal IRA in her honor. I hope we can join together and honor Senator \nHutchison by getting that done before we close out our business this \nyear.\n  Kay, of course, has always championed the State sales tax deduction, \nwhich may not seem like a big deal to others in this Chamber, but it is \na big deal back home in Texas as a matter of fundamental fairness \nbecause we don't have a State income tax. I daresay we never will have \na State income tax as long as I draw a breath. However, we do pay State \nsales taxes, and it is only fair that Texas enjoys the same sort of \ndeductibility for the State sales tax that other States have enjoyed \nfor the State income taxes.\n  Kay has also worked to reduce the marriage penalty tax. She has been \na strong defender of taxpayer interests, and her efforts have made the \nTax Code less hostile to saving and to families.\n  She alluded to her great work with NASA. She is one of the Senate's \nleading supporters of NASA and human space flight. NASA has contributed \nhistorical technological breakthroughs that have benefited all \nAmericans. Kay appreciates the vital importance of basic scientific \nresearch, long-term American prosperity, and she appreciates the role \nNASA has played in fostering innovation. She has long said and \nadvocated for support for NASA because she believes that when we \nsupport NASA, we are supporting technologies and the jobs of the \nfuture. That is why Kay has done so much to help the Johnson Space \nCenter and our universities to promote Texas as a research State.\n  Her beloved University of Texas is grateful for her support over the \nyears, which is one reason they will soon launch the Kay Bailey \nHutchison Center for Latin American law.\n  Kay has also crafted legislation that has benefited some of the most \nvulnerable Americans. Her work on behalf of missing and exploited \nchildren includes the national AMBER Alert Network, which she \nintroduced back in 2003. As she said earlier, this law has helped to \nrescue more than 570 abducted children who would not have benefited but \nfor her work. That is a remarkable achievement, and it is more than \njust a number when we count the human lives which have been so \ndramatically affected by her work.\n  A final note. As I said, Senator Hutchison has made history serving \nas a first woman to serve the great State of Texas in the Senate. Kay \nhas always been a pioneer of sorts. As a father of two daughters, that \nmeans a lot to me. I am used to being surrounded at home by strong, \nintelligent women, but having served with Kay, I have also been a \npartner with a strong, intelligent Texas woman. Kay has been a role \nmodel for so many young women, not just in Texas but throughout the \nUnited States. I am honored to be her colleague and I am proud to be \nher friend.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison leaves behind a tremendous legacy of \nwhich she, Ray, and her children can be proud. She has a legacy that \nwill long be celebrated by Texans from El Paso to Caddo Lake and from \nAmarillo to Brownsville. Everyone in this Chamber will miss her, and I \nknow I speak for all my colleagues when I wish her the very best in the \nnext exciting chapter of her life.\n  I join with my colleagues in saying to the Senator, vaya con dios.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to join everyone here in thanking \nKay for her great service in the Senate. I have worked closely with her \non a wide variety of issues. I have to say she is a fierce advocate. In \nfact, I have to say all our women Senators have been fierce advocates, \nand we have benefited from them being here.\n  Kay has paved the way for Senators--both male and female--to truly \nbecome\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nbetter Senators and in many cases great Senators. Kay Bailey Hutchison \nis a great Senator. She worked her guts out the whole time she was \nhere. She is still here, but she is going to retire at this time and \nshe has represented Texas well.\n  All I can say is she has been my friend all this time. When I needed \nhelp from her, she was always there. I tried to be there for her when \nshe needed help as well. She has not only been a delightful person to \nbe around but a very intelligent lawyer. She fought for what she \nbelieved--most of which I believed in--in a way nobody could truly ever \nget mad at Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  She is a wonderful person, wonderful mother, and we are going to miss \nher terribly. This is a body where we could use a few more women \nSenators--maybe a lot more than a few. They are very good people who \nwork very hard and not the least of whom is Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  I remember at times when I had difficulties with the BRAC system and \ndifficulties with special NASA problems, and so forth, we always worked \ntogether. We could always count on her to come up with intelligent \nsolutions to some of the problems that should not have existed but did.\n  I have personally appreciated her very much during those times and in \nso many other ways as we worked together on legislation to help this \ncountry and as we worked to represent our respective States. I have so \nmuch respect for Texas, the people of Texas, and what they stand for. I \nhave great respect for these Texan Senators who are two of the best we \nhave ever had in the Senate.\n  Senator Hutchison has been an exemplary Senator, not just for women \nbut for all of us. She has also set some standards that I think both \nwomen and male Senators are going to have to try to emulate.\n  I just want say to the Senator that we love her, we appreciate her, \nand we wish her the very best. We are going to miss her. This is one \nSenator who will miss her greatly, and I want her to know that. All I \ncan say is God be with her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased in joining my colleagues in \ncommending and congratulating our distinguished colleague from Texas. \nHer service in the Senate has truly been outstanding and she has made \nan impact in our Committee on Appropriations. We have deliberated about \nthe funding of all the Federal agencies and departments of the Federal \nGovernment. She has been very careful. She is very serious about her \nresponsibilities, and I am glad to be here today to wish her well in \nthe years ahead and compliment her on a very distinguished career in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Michigan and Texas have much in common, \ndespite the fact they are North vs. South, cowboy boots vs. snowshoes, \nmesquite vs. pine.\n  One of the things we have in common is water. Our States are, \neconomically, historically, and culturally tied to great waters: Texas \nto the Gulf of Mexico, Michigan to the Great Lakes. And this shared \ninterest has afforded me the pleasure of working alongside Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, a true Texas pioneer.\n  As the lead cosponsor of the Harbor Maintenance Act, Senator \nHutchison has been an invaluable ally in the effort to ensure that \nAmerica's harbors receive the maintenance funding they need to help our \neconomy grow. Her efforts were instrumental in recruiting 37 cosponsors \non our bill and in securing language regarding harbor maintenance for \nthe first time in a transportation bill. Her efforts have made a \nsignificant difference in the lives of the thousands of American \nworkers whose jobs are directly tied to well-maintained harbors, from \nthe Port of Galveston to the scores of ports dotting Michigan's \nshoreline.\n  Senator Hutchison has shown important leadership on other \ntransportation issues, such as a more equitable formula for Federal \nsurface transportation funding, and for adequate funding for State \nmaritime academies, including academies in Texas and Michigan, that \nhelp meet the needs of our commercial shipping industry as well as the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  She has been an able and dedicated advocate for our Nation's \nveterans. She pioneered the concept of the homemaker IRA, which helped \nmillions of American women achieve greater retirement security. She has \nenergetically pushed for stronger science and educational programs, \nincluding the establishment of a groundbreaking medicine, engineering, \nand science academy in her State.\n  We shouldn't be surprised at these and other successes. When she \nfirst graduated from the University of Texas Law School, she bumped up \nagainst the misguided tendencies of the law firms at the time to \ndismiss female candidates, no matter how talented. Undaunted, she \nwalked into a local TV station and asked for a job as a reporter and \nbecame the State's first female television reporter. She took a detour, \nbut her experience covering politics led to the Texas House of \nRepresentatives, the State treasurer's office, and eventually to become \nthe first Texan woman elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senate will miss her dedication, her quite effectiveness, her \nability to seek practical, bipartisan solutions. She has made a habit \nof making history, and I wish her the best in whatever history-making \nendeavors she turns to next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise also to congratulate and thank a \nterrific Senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and to wish her much success in \nher further efforts. I know she will provide great leadership in \nwhatever she is doing. It has been wonderful to watch over the years, \nseeing the pictures of Bailey and Houston and how they have grown, \ncelebrating and going to baby showers. On top of all the other \naccolades today, Senator Hutchison is a devoted and wonderful mother to \ntwo beautiful children.\n  As everyone has said, she is the first and only woman to represent \nTexas in the Senate and will always have that distinction of opening \ndoors and barriers. I know she agrees with me that once the doors open, \nwe want to make sure more women are able to walk through that door as \nwell.\n  I wish to congratulate her for all she has done. We have come \ntogether to fight for opportunities for women around the world at the \nSenate Women's Caucus on Burma and other efforts she has led. I am very \nsupportive of adding her name to the spousal IRA law. I think that is a \nvery fitting tribute, and I am hopeful we can get that done as well.\n  I just want to congratulate her.\n  I do want to have the opportunity to talk about something else, but I \nsee my friend wanting to say a few words.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for just a \nmoment to let me say thank you to all the wonderful Senators who have \nspoken and said nice things. It is one of the few times Senators sort \nof pause and wish someone well, as they are leaving. It has truly been \nvery touching, and I appreciate the kind words of the Senator from \nMichigan. It has been a distinct pleasure to have colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle feel we have done so much together. My hope is that \nas I am going out the door, the collegiality of the Senate will never \nchange.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8169-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8169-S8179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT--Continued\n\n\n                             the Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I also wish to speak about the \nimportance of passing a farm bill today and thank the Senator from \nTexas for her support as we passed a strong bipartisan farm bill in the \nSenate back in June when sent it over it the House of Representatives.\n  We have had 80 days since the farm bill expired. That is 80 days that \nfarm families and small businesses have been holding their breath and \nwanting to know what is going to happen in rural America and \nagriculture across the country. I have not given up, nor have other \ncolleagues here. Certainly, my partner here in the Senate, Senator \nRoberts, and our partners in the House, including Chairman Lucas and\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\nRanking Member Peterson, all stand ready if we can get a positive \nsignal from the House Republican leadership to get this done. There is \nno doubt in my mind that we can do it. For everyone listening, the \nissue is not differences in the commodity title, which I have every \nconfidence we can come together on and work out; the question is, as we \nare seeing efforts being worked on for a larger deficit reduction \npackage, whether the House leadership will think rural America and \nagriculture are important enough to include. That is the question. It \nis whether the savings we have achieved in deficit reduction by \neliminating unwarranted taxpayer subsidies and creating other \nefficiencies and tackling waste, fraud, and abuse, whether that is \nworthy of a priority in the effort that is being worked on. We have \ncontinued to point out the fact that the 16 million people across \nAmerica who work because of agriculture deserve to be a priority.\n  I thank our leadership and the leadership across the aisle for making \nit a priority of this Senate back in June. I thank my colleagues on the \ncommittee in the House for making it a priority and for passing a \nbipartisan bill in July. For the life of me--I am appalled continually \nthat the Republican leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives \ndoes not consider the security and the livelihood of 16 million people \nwho live in rural America across this country to be a priority.\n  We are including a final list of things that need to get done. We are \nnot giving up. We are coming back next week, and we are going to be \nhere, and we are ready at any moment to be able to do what we need to \ndo.\n  Across this aisle, colleagues have worked in good faith in the \nSenate, and I am very grateful. I appreciate the support of the \nPresiding Officer in urging that we get this done. We have colleagues \non both sides of the aisle who have come together to make tough \ndecisions. We are willing to make some more, but we are not willing to \ngive up on 16 million people who live in rural communities--small towns \nsuch as where I grew up in Claire, MI--who are counting on us to do the \nright thing and to give them the ability to plan, the ability to get \nhelp for the disasters they have seen, and the ability to know they can \nmove forward and care for their families.\n  We have a disaster bill right now on the floor. As chair of the \nAgriculture Committee, there is no way I am going to allow a disaster \namendment without being able to offer an amendment that relates to \nagriculture disaster which we have fully paid for in the farm bill.\n  So we are willing to do two tracks here if we come together, which I \nhope we will, on a disaster package. Certainly, people in rural \nAmerica--farmers, ranchers across this country--have felt the disasters \nother communities have felt. So I am proud to join with Senator Merkley \nand Senator McCaskill and others in putting forward the portions of the \nfarm bill that deal with disaster relief as part of this package which \nis now moving forward. I hope we will have an opportunity to vote and \ncome together on that, which is so important. That does not negate the \nneed to get a farm bill done or our desire to do that or the fact that \nwe are laser-focused until the last moment we have available on getting \nit done.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that farming is the riskiest business in \nthe world. There are a lot of risky things we can do. There are a lot \nof disasters that have happened.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to join with our colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Menendez, last week to visit some of the coastline \nin New Jersey and to be a part of a group that looked at the \ndevastation there. And there is no question, it is up to our country at \ntimes such as these, when people are wiped out, their homes are wiped \nout, it is our responsibility to come together and to act on behalf of \ncitizens in those States. I strongly support doing that. It is also our \nresponsibility to acknowledge and recognize and help others around the \ncountry who have similar disasters.\n  As I said before, there is no business that is riskier than farming. \nThank goodness we have people who are willing to stay in farming and \nranching regardless of what happens with the weather. Thank goodness we \nhave a strong crop insurance system in place, and we strengthened that \neven more, which is incredibly important, in this farm bill. But we \nhave had disasters happen that need to be addressed for those who farm \nfor us.\n  In the spring we experienced late freezes in Michigan and in New York \nand in Pennsylvania that wiped out food crops. A lot of small family \nfarms, farms in northern Michigan, were wiped out. In my home State, \nlate freezes and a spring frost caused them to lose practically their \nentire crop right off the bat. It warmed up, the buds came out, and \nthen they had a deep freeze that killed everything. Our growers produce \n75 percent of the U.S. supply of cherries. That is around 270 million \npounds. The cherry producers experienced a 98-percent loss.\n  In our amendment in the disaster bill and in the farm bill, we give \nthem some help because they spent the rest of the crop year this year \nhaving to pay to maintain the orchards and the trees, eating the costs \nand hoping the trees will bounce back next year and produce a crop. So \nthey have all the costs of maintaining everything but no revenue coming \nin.\n  Cherry producers were also forced to fight spreading diseases such as \ncherry leaf spot and bacterial canker, making the trees even more \ncostly to maintain and at risk of loss. They didn't just lose their \ncrop this year; they had to invest a lot of money to save their \norchards without having any dollars coming in. We give them some help. \nIt doesn't cover all the losses but some help to be able to stay in \nbusiness. We do that through the farm bill.\n  Apple producers in most areas of Michigan and in New York and in \nPennsylvania had about a 40-percent production, so they lost 60 \npercent. Think about a business losing 60 percent of its income for a \nyear or, in the case of cherries, 98 percent. We have things in place \nto support them when that happens. That is why we have disaster \nassistance, and that is why we have other things as well. We have \nsomething called the farm bill when things like this happen in \nagriculture or disaster assistance for agriculture, as we are proposing \nassistance for.\n  Also, in the summer we saw record-breaking drought, as we know. We \nheard story after story about families whose crops were left withering \nin the fields, entire corn crops devastated in Iowa, and wildfires in \nColorado killing 2 people and forcing residents to evacuate over 34,000 \nhomes. Drought and wildfires cost the State of Oklahoma more than $400 \nmillion this year alone according to a report that has just been \nproduced by Oklahoma State University. That includes crops and \nlivestock, property loss from wildfires, and emergency costs.\n  I have heard so many times from my friend, the distinguished ranking \nmember from Kansas, about what has happened in Kansas. We had the \nopportunity to be there and to hear from people directly in Kansas. My \nstaff has walked in the field and seen that there is nothing there \nbecause of the drought and what it means.\n  This year represented the worst drought since 1956. That is a \ndisaster. At the height of the drought this summer, over 80 percent of \nthe contiguous United States experienced drought conditions--80 \npercent. We still have 11 States with exceptional drought conditions \nand 17 States with severe drought conditions. Seventeen States across \nthe country, in the Northeast, the Midwest, the South, the Great \nPlains, the Southwest, and on the west coast--every region except the \nPacific Northwest has suffered from long-term drought.\n  Sixty percent of the farms in the United States experienced drought \nthis year, and we saw severe droughts in 57 percent of farmland acres. \nBy the end of this last October, over half of the pastures and ranges \nin the United States were rated poor to very poor. And 1,692 counties \nin the country, spread across 36 States, were declared a primary \ndisaster area because of the drought.\n  By the way, there are a whole lot of issues around weather that we \nneed to be talking about and dealing with, and we need to be doing that \nin the new year.\n  So this is what is happening for farmers and ranchers. On May 20 only \n3 percent of our corn crop was rated poor or very poor, but by the end \nof September over 50 percent was rated poor or very\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\npoor. Our cattle inventories were at a 60-year low as farmers and \nranchers have had to sell off their breeding stock because they don't \nhave the hay or grazing land to feed them. Low water levels in the \nMississippi are affecting grain shipments, threatening to affect \nshipments early next year as farmers try to plant their crops. We have \nseen reports that grain is piling up in elevators while farmers try to \nfigure out alternative routes of shipping their products to market.\n  Hurricane Isaac left hundreds of thousands of acres underwater. \nHurricane Isaac caused destruction like nothing we could have imagined. \nAs I said, I saw the damage up close from Hurricane Sandy. Weather \ndisasters have destroyed millions of acres of farmland and affected \nmillions of families in every State and corner of this country.\n  We are considering a disaster bill today. Well, the farm bill is a \ndisaster bill because it not only has disaster assistance but it \ncreates 5-year certainty for our growers, who deserve it. They deserve \nto know what is going to be happening. They deserve to know so they can \ngo to the banker and talk about their financing for the coming crop \nyear and be able to plan as well as get immediate help.\n  I support passing a disaster bill, and agriculture should be a part \nof this, but it is not enough. We need to do that, and we need to have \na 5-year farm bill in order to create the certainty we need.\n  We have spent so much time focusing on how we move forward with \nagriculture today and create the right kind of risk management tools \nfor the future. I am very proud of what we have been able to do.\n  We--the members of the Agriculture Committees--have also been, \nfrankly, the only committee to step up voluntarily and say: We will put \nmoney on the table for deficit reduction. We did it during deficit \nreduction talks. We have done it in the House and the Senate as we have \nwritten the farm bills. We are willing to be a part of the solution. We \nare part of the solution.\n  One of the things I find very frustrating is that if, in fact, it \ndoesn't get done this year, those who don't want reform, those who want \ngovernment payments even in good times may very well get another year \nof government payments that we can't afford and taxpayers should not be \npaying for. So this really is about reform.\n  I hear colleagues talking on the other side of the aisle all the time \nabout the things we shouldn't be doing and the things we shouldn't be \npaying for. Well, I would encourage them to join us in the fight to get \na farm bill done to stop an area where we have all agreed we should not \nbe providing government payments in the area of direct payments. I know \nthere are those in the House who want to keep that going as long as \npossible, but it is not right in an era when we have to make tough \nchoices for families and every other part of the budget to allow that \nto happen.\n  We passed a reform bill. We tackled fraud and abuse in nutrition. We \nconsolidated conservation and saved money. We tackled payments that \nhave been given out for years that don't make sense and that the \ngovernment can't afford. We listened to farmers to strengthen risk \nmanagement tools, predominantly crop insurance. With all the weather \ndisasters I have described this year, if we can strengthen crop \ninsurance, we are going to give them a better safety net going forward \nfor whatever comes in the coming year.\n  So there is a lot on the line. There is a lot on the line for 16 \nmillion people who have jobs because of agriculture and the food \nindustry. There is a lot on the line for people who go to the grocery \nstore and eat and want to know food prices are not going to go up, that \nmilk prices are not going to go up. There is a lot on the line for \npeople who just want us to come together and work together. In light of \neverything going on, we did that kind of a farm bill. They did that in \nthe House in committee.\n  All the Speaker and the leadership have to do is say: We care about \nrural America. We care about 16 million people who work every day, who \nare folks who do their jobs, and when the job has to get done, whether \nit is early in the morning or late at night, they do it, and they \nexpect us to do the same thing.\n  There is no excuse--none--that makes any sense not to get a 5-year \nfarm bill done, not to make sure we have the disaster assistance that \nis needed for farmers and ranchers, and not to get reforms that cut \nback on taxpayer subsidies we should not be providing, and the deficit \nreduction that is critically important as we come up to this fiscal \ncliff.\n  I wish to thank everyone in this body for working with us to get a \nbill done of which I think we should all be very proud. We are going to \ncontinue to push as we go forward, hoping that at some moment the House \nRepublican leadership will look around at the small towns in their \ndistricts and decide they matter and that they will pass a 5-year farm \nbill.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                              Chained CPI\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we continue to debate how to prevent \nthis so-called fiscal cliff and how to go forward in deficit reduction, \nmy Republican friends, apparently, want the American people to believe \nthat making the wealthiest people in this country pay a few dollars \nmore in taxes would amount to some kind of terrible sacrifice, and they \nare vigorous and unanimous in opposing the President's initial proposal \nto do away with all of Bush's tax breaks for people making $250,000 a \nyear or more. I guess their new proposal coming out of the House is \nthat only people making $1 million a year or more would see their tax \nrates go up.\n  Let me say a word about hardship and a word about sacrifice and it is \nnot about the problems of millionaires and billionaires who are doing \nphenomenally well and who are being asked to pay a few dollars more to \nhelp us deal with deficit reduction, at a time when their tax rates are \nat a historically low rate. Let me tell you about sacrifice, and let me \ntell you about on whom we should not be balancing the budget.\n  This morning, in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I held a press \nconference, which included every major veterans organization in this \ncountry, representing millions and millions of veterans, people who \nhave put their lives on the line to defend our country and many of whom \nhave suffered as a result.\n  The organizations that were there with me to say no to the so-called \nchained CPI--which would cut benefits for disabled veterans, which \nwould cut benefits for widows and kids who lost their husband or their \nfather in Iraq or Afghanistan and would see a chained CPI cut back on \ntheir limited benefits--we had at this press conference the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, the Blinded Veterans Association, the Wounded Warrior Project, \nthe Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Military Family \nAssociation, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the National Guard \nAssociation, the National Association of Uniform Services, the Jewish \nWar Veterans, the Military Officers Association of America, AMVETS, the \nAssociation of the United States Army, the Commissioned Officers \nAssociation of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Naval Enlisted \nReserve Association, the United Spinal Association, VetsFirst.\n  What all of them said--and some of them made this statement far more \npoignantly than I can--is when we talk about sacrifice, they are there; \nthey have already done it. Some of them have come back from our wars \nwithout arms or legs or maybe they have lost their eyesight. They have \nsacrificed, and it is morally absurd to be equating on one hand the \nsacrifice of a multimillionaire, asking him to pay a few dollars more \nin taxes, with asking people who have lost their limbs defending this \ncountry to make a sacrifice. That is not equivalent sacrifice.\n  Let me talk about this so-called chained CPI. I know there are some \nfolks out there--and I think we have had Wall Street CEOs worth \nhundreds of millions of dollars, who were bailed out by the taxpayers \nof this country, who have the most extravagant retirement benefits \nimaginable--they have come to Washington, DC, to tell Congress we \nshould cut Social Security\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nbenefits for disabled veterans, raise taxes on low-income workers.\n  Let me tell you what this--what some call a tweak--would do. In terms \nof the chained CPI, more than 3.2 million disabled veterans receive \ndisability compensation from the Veterans' Administration--3.2 million \nveterans. They would see a reduction--a significant reduction--in their \nbenefits. Under the chained CPI, a disabled veteran who started \nreceiving VA disability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits \ncut by more than $1,400 at age 45, $2,300 at age 55, and $3,200 at age \n65.\n  Does anybody in their right mind think the American people want to \nsee benefits cut for men and women who sacrificed, who lost limbs \ndefending their country? Are we going to balance the budget on their \nbacks?\n  I challenge anyone who supports a chained CPI to go to Walter Reed \nhospital, visit with the men and women who have lost their legs, lost \ntheir arms, lost their eyesight as a result of their service in \nAfghanistan or Iraq. Come Veterans Day and come Memorial Day, all the \npoliticians go out and give speeches of how much we love our veterans. \nIt is great to give a good speech on Memorial Day or Veterans Day but \nwhat about standing up for them now?\n  I know the Wall Street CEOs and the big money lobbyists are \ndescending on Washington trying to protect the wealthy and the \npowerful. But maybe now is the time--not just Veterans Day, not just \nMemorial Day--that we stand with veterans, we stand with disabled \nveterans. They have sacrificed, and I think it is unseemly, I think it \nis immoral to be balancing the budget on their backs.\n  We have also made a commitment to the surviving spouses and children \nwho have lost a loved one in battle by providing them with Dependency \nIndemnity Compensation benefits that average less than $17,000 a year. \nDo my colleagues truly think we should be cutting benefits for \nsurviving spouses who lost their husband in Iraq or Afghanistan?\n  Further, we have made a promise to every American; that is, that \nabove and beyond benefits for disabled vets, what we have said is a \ncouple things: For those who are older, we have said Social Security \nwill be there for them in their old age, in their time of need or if \nthey become disabled, and we have said those benefits will also keep up \nwith inflation.\n  Today, over 9 million veterans receive Social Security benefits as \npart of the tens of millions of Americans who receive Social Security, \nand more than 770,000 veterans receive Social Security disability \nbenefits.\n  We are talking now about the ``Greatest generation,'' the people who \nsaved this country in World War II. I just met last week--and it chokes \nme up every time I meet these guys--a fellow from Winooski, VT, who was \nin the Battle of the Bulge, that hugely important battle at the end of \nWorld War II to stop the Nazi advance. He was also at Normandy.\n  Do you truly want to balance the budget on his back?\n  We are talking about the brave men and women who served in Korea, \nVietnam, and other conflicts as well.\n  Let us be clear what this chained CPI would do because I think there \nare some people--I guess if someone is a Wall Street CEO guy and is \nmaking millions of dollars a year and has a great retirement package, \nwhen we are talking about hundreds of dollars a year, that is what they \nuse for lunch. They do not have to worry about keeping their house warm \nor buying food. That is not within their world view.\n  Under the chained CPI--we should all understand this is no small \ntweak; this is not some administrative issue--under the chained CPI, \naverage seniors who retire at age 65 would see their Social Security \nbenefits cut by about $650 a year when they reach age 75. Again, I \nunderstand if someone is a Wall Street CEO, if one is a millionaire, \nhey, $650 a year is not a lot of money. But let me tell you, if you are \na senior citizen living in Vermont or Minnesota and you have to worry \nabout heating your home, you have to worry about putting gas in your \ncar, you have to worry about prescription drugs, $650 a year is a lot \nof money, if you are living on $15-, $16-, $18,000 a year of income, \nmost of that coming from Social Security. So if you retire at age 65, \nit is about a $650 cut when you reach age 75, and it is more than \n$1,000 a year when you turn 85.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart which \ntalks about annual cuts in Social Security benefits under the chained \nCPI.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS19DE12.001\n\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. What the chart shows is that at age 75 the cut would be \n$653, a 3.7-percent cut; at age 85 it would be $1,139, a 6.5-percent \ncut; and at age 95, it would be $1,1611, a 9.2-percent cut.\n  The rich are getting richer. We have growing wealth and income \ninequality in America. The wealthiest people in this country are paying \nthe lowest effective tax rate in decades. We are going to balance the \nbudget on the backs of seniors trying to get by on $15,000, $18,000 a \nyear? Is that what this Congress stands for? I certainly hope not.\n  The fact of the matter is, the current formula for calculating COLAs \nis not too generous. And whenever I speak in Vermont, I say to \nseniors--and I speak to them quite often--there are some folks in \nWashington who think that your COLA--the formulation and how we reach a \nCOLA for you--is too generous. Do you know what happens. They laugh. \nThey invariably break out in laughter because they know that in the \nlast 3 years, two out of those years they got zero COLA. They know this \nyear they are going to get a 1.7-percent\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nCOLA, which is one of the lowest COLA increases ever.\n  They also know the current formulation for a COLA does not fully take \ninto account the escalating costs of prescription drugs and health \ncare, which is where most seniors spend their money. They are not \nspending their money on flat-screen TVs or iPhones or iPads. They are \nspending their money heating their homes, buying food, paying for \nprescription drugs, and paying for health care. These costs are going \nup much faster than general inflation. I think what most economists \nwould tell you is that the current formulation for determining COLAs \nwith Social Security is inadequate, too low, rather than, as the \nadvocates of the chained CPI would suggest, that they are too high.\n  Furthermore--this has not been widely discussed--moving to a chained \nCPI would also result in an across-the-board tax increase of more than \n$60 billion over the next 10 years that will disproportionately hurt \nlow-income and middle-income families the most. In fact, two-thirds of \nthe tax increase under a chained CPI would impact Americans earning \nless than $100,000 a year, and many would be impacted by losing the \nearned income tax credit and the childcare tax credit.\n  Maybe I am missing something, but I thought I heard from the White \nHouse and here on the floor of the Senate that we are not going to \nraise taxes for people earning less than $250,000 a year. Maybe I am \nwrong. But I thought I heard that many times. Well, if you vote for the \nchained CPI, in fact you are raising taxes on a whole lot of people, \nincluding low-income working families. Under the chained CPI, low-\nincome workers would see their taxes go up by 14\\1/2\\ percent, mainly \nby cutting the earned income tax credit and the refundable childcare \ntax credit. So if we are going to keep faith with what we have said \nhere, I say to my Democratic and Republican friends: No tax increases \nfor workers making less than $250,000 a year. We better reject this \nchained CPI.\n  Furthermore, I must tell you that I am disappointed, because I \nthought I heard a few weeks ago my friends in the White House telling \nus that Social Security--telling us truthfully, correctly--has nothing \nto do with deficit reduction, because Social Security is funded by the \npayroll tax, and that Social Security should be off the table in terms \nof deficit reduction. I heard that many, many times. So I wonder how \nSocial Security has suddenly gotten back on the table, including a \nchained CPI, with devastating cuts to seniors and disabled vets.\n  I think we should deal with Social Security. I think Senator Dick \nDurbin made a good point: Let's deal with it. Let's deal with it \nseparately. Let's determine how, in a fair way, we can make Social \nSecurity solvent for the next 50 or 75 years without cutting benefits.\n  I have ideas on that, Senator Begich has ideas on that, Senator \nHarkin and others. And the Presiding Officer has been thinking about \nways that we make Social Security solvent and strong for 75 years \nwithout cutting benefits. Let's have that discussion, but not as part \nof a deficit reduction bill when Social Security has had nothing to do \nwith deficit reduction.\n  I do not often quote Ronald Reagan, but this is what Ronald Reagan \nsaid on October 7, 1984. He was absolutely right. Ronald Reagan:\n\n       Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social \n     Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on \n     employer and employee. If you reduce the outgo of Social \n     Security, that money would not go into the general fund to \n     reduce the deficit, it would go into the Social Security \n     Trust Fund, so Social Security has nothing to do with \n     planning the budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\n\n  October 7, 1984. Reagan was right. I have to tell you that when \nBarack Obama was campaigning for President in 2008, he told the AARP on \nSeptember 6, 2008, that:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost of living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear. I will do neither.\n\n  September 6, 2008, Barack Obama. One of the astounding things about \nCongress and the inside-the-beltway mentality is how out of touch it is \nwith what the American people are thinking and what the American people \nare believing. Yesterday there was a poll in the Washington Post. I ask \nunanimous consent that that poll be printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  MR. SANDERS. What that poll said--I hope my colleagues are \nlistening--this is yesterday in the Washington Post, and this is \nabsolutely consistent with every other poll I have seen--60 percent of \nthe American people believe it would be unacceptable to change the way \nSocial Security benefits are calculated so that benefits increase at a \nslower rate than they do now in order to strike a budget deal. Only 34 \npercent would find this acceptable. Sixty percent of the American \npeople believe it would be unacceptable to raise the age of Medicare \neligibility, 68 percent of the American people believe it would be \nunacceptable to cut spending on Medicaid. But 74 percent of the \nAmerican people said in this poll that they would accept raising taxes \non Americans with incomes of over $250,000 a year. This is consistent \nwith every other poll that is out there. The American people are \nsaying: Wait a minute. The middle class, the working class is hurting. \nDo not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. That is what they said \nyesterday in the poll.\n  What they also said, at a time when the rich are getting richer, yes, \nthey should be asked to contribute more in taxes. I mentioned earlier \nthat to the best of my knowledge, every single veterans organization \nhas made it clear that they are strongly opposed to the so-called \nchained CPI, which would cut benefits for disabled vets.\n  The AARP and the every other seniors organization, including the \ngroups to protect Social Security, the National Committee to Protect \nSocial Security and Medicare, and others are saying do not cut Social \nSecurity benefits. The AFL-CIO has been very vigorous in protecting \nworking families and saying do not cut Social Security, do not cut \nMedicare, do not cut Medicaid.\n  Here we are, the American people overwhelmingly want the wealthy to \npay more in taxes and not cut Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid, organizations representing tens of millions of people are \nsaying, ask the wealthy to pay more in taxes, not cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid.\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about cutting Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, and asking the wealthy to pay more \nbut nowhere near as much as they should be asked to pay.\n  We wonder. We wonder why Congress has a 9-percent favorability \nrating. I will tell you that my phones today--and I do not think this \nis an organized effort, by the way--my phones in my office--and you \nmight want to check your offices, but my office phones are bouncing off \nthe hook from people in Vermont and all over this country saying: Do \nnot cut Social Security.\n  So I would say to the American people, right now a deal is being \nhatched which would cut Social Security and benefits for disabled \nveterans, raising taxes on low-income workers. If you think that is a \nbad idea, you might want to get ahold of your Senator or Member of the \nHouse.\n  Let me conclude by saying, in my view, deficit reduction is a serious \nissue. We, as you know, have already cut $1.5 trillion in programs as a \nresult of the agreements in 2010 and 2011, and up to this point the \nmillionaires and billionaires have not contributed one nickel--one \nnickel--more in taxes. So deficit reduction is a serious issue. I look \nforward to playing an active role in making sure that we address that \nserious problem. But I will do everything in my power to make sure we \ndo not balance the budget on the backs of veterans, the elderly, the \nchildren, the sick, and the poor, and low-income working people\n\n                              (Exhibit 1)\n\n    Public Wants Compromise on Fiscal Cliff, But Specifics Unpopular\n\n\n                             In this poll:\n\n       With the end of the year approaching, Americans give Obama \n     his highest approval ratings in over a year and key \n     advantages over Republicans in the battle over the so-called \n     `fiscal cliff.' Still, majorities say both Obama and \n     Republicans are not willing enough to compromise to reach a \n     deal.\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n                             Poll Questions\n\n       Q.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart. When we \nfirst heard of the horrific shooting in Newtown, CT, on Friday, it was \nimpossible for me not to react, not just as a Senator but as a parent, \nas a father. And as my wife and I spent the weekend reflecting on the \nheartbreaking loss of 20 innocent children and 6 of their teachers and \nfaculty, as we talked to our own 3 young children about what had \nhappened, we thought about the grief and the anguish for a whole range \nof different parents deeply touched by this tragic incident.\n  The first, of course, are the parents who lost their precious \ninnocent children, their 6- and 7-year-olds in the massacre at Sandy \nHook Elementary School last Friday. Joel and JoAnn Bacon lost their \nprecocious, outgoing, red-haired daughter Charlotte, just 6 years old. \nJoAnn had recently bought Charlotte a new holiday dress in her favorite \ncolor--pink--and a pair of white boots. Charlotte had begged and begged \nto wear her new outfit early, and on Friday, December 14, the last day \nof Charlotte's young life, her mother JoAnn agreed.\n  Steve and Rebecca Kowalski lost their active and athletic 7-year-old \nson Chase. Just 2 days before the shooting, Chase's next-door neighbor \nhad asked him what he wanted for Christmas, and I understand he pointed \nto his two missing front teeth.\n  Any of us who have had the special blessing and joy of raising young \nchildren, especially at holiday time, can\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nonly imagine the unbearable sorrow of these families who now and \nforever will have a child-sized hole in their hearts and their lives.\n  We offer you whatever small measure of comfort we can in knowing that \nyou are not alone, that all across this country and around the world \npeople pray for your healing, and we all hope that with time you and \nyour families can come to understand and live through the grief of this \nmoment.\n  We also think of other parents, parents who years before raised their \nyoung adult children to give back to their community and the next \ngeneration--young adults who chose to become teachers. In addition to \nthe heroics of school principal Dawn Hochsprung, school psychologist \nMary Sherlach, and teacher Anne Marie Murphy, a mother of four herself, \nthree other very young teachers gave their lives to protect the \nstudents in their care: Lauren Rousseau, a 30-year-old substitute \nteacher; Victoria Soto, a heroic 27-year-old teacher; and Rachel \nDavino, a 29-year-old whose boyfriend was planning to propose on \nChristmas Eve. Their parents too, their families are in our prayers.\n  Also in our hearts today are the families of the courageous first \nresponders who rushed toward danger as everyone else rushed away. In \nany emergency, Mr. President, as you know, being a former attorney \ngeneral, our law enforcement officers face unknown danger with \nextraordinary courage. At Sandy Hook Elementary, police officers rushed \nto the site knowing full well that an armed gunman awaited them. What \nthey found was unimaginable. Thank God they arrived as quickly as they \ndid or the carnage might have been worse. But we need but reflect for a \nmoment on what those police officers and firefighters and folks from \nthe ME's office ultimately found--unspeakable carnage. These heroes \ncould not react as parents, as community members. They had to choke \nback their own grief and horror to carry out their professional \nresponsibilities to catalogue, investigate, and document every detail \nof this tragic scene so that justice could be done and lessons learned. \nThe scars of those long hours on a crime scene like this last a \nlifetime, and first responders all across this country in situations \nsuch as this bear them with honor and dignity and without complaint.\n  This tragedy, of course, also has ripple effects far beyond Sandy \nHook and far beyond Newtown, CT. All over this country there are \nparents whose children struggle with mental illness, with mental health \nchallenges, who don't have the resources they need to cope. My office \nhas had many calls from worried parents since Friday's shootings, \nworried for many reasons, but one that stood out for me was a dad from \nNewark, DE, whose own child is struggling with mental illness and who \nis working hard to try to find the resources to ensure appropriate care \nso that he won't someday be watching the television with horror as the \ntragic actions of his child unfold.\n  We think of the story also shared online of the mother in Idaho, \nterrified her own son has the capacity to kill someday and yet without \nthe ability to give him the intensive medical care, treatment, and \nintervention she believes he needs.\n  Across this country, mental health care is a growing challenge for \nus. Between 2009 and 2011, States cut more than $2 billion from \ncommunity mental health services. Two-thirds of States have \nsignificantly slashed funding in these difficult economic times, \nleaving parents seeking help for their mentally ill children often with \nnowhere to turn.\n  We must do better for all these parents--the parents who lost their \nchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary, the parents who lost their children \nwho were teachers and faculty, the families of those who were first \nresponders, and families who struggle with children with mental illness \nand mental health problems.\n  But, frankly, this week I also think about parents all over our \ncountry who have lost their children, just as precious and just as \ninnocent as those at Sandy Hook, to gun violence, outside the media \nspotlight. The truth is gun violence knows no boundaries of race or \nclass, but our national response at times seems to.\n  There were 41 murders in Delaware alone last year, 28 of them where \nguns were used as the murder weapon.\n  Sixteen-year-old Alexander Kamara was playing in a soccer tournament \nat Eden Park in my hometown of Wilmington this summer when he was shot \nand killed in execution style.\n  Dominique Helm, age 19, was standing with his teenage cousins on the \nsteps of his Brandywine Village rowhouse last September when a gunman \nopened fire. He stumbled through the doorway and died in his living \nroom as his mother Nicole ran to him.\n  Stories like this are tragically, appallingly, common across our \ncountry every day. Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with a gun. It \nhappens in our streets and in our neighborhoods. It happens in movie \ntheaters in Aurora, CO, and houses of worship at Oak Creek, WI. It \nhappens in high schools in Littleton, CO, and at a college campus in \nBlacksburg, VA. It happens outside a supermarket in Tucson, AZ, where \none of the six people killed was 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green--a \nchild herself born on 9/11, imbued with a sense of hope and a call to \npublic service, who wanted to meet her Congresswoman Gabbie Giffords in \norder to learn more about public service.\n  They say nearly 40 percent of Americans know someone directly who has \nbeen a victim of gun violence. In Christina's case, her father was my \nhigh school classmate back in Delaware. Gun violence touches families, \ncommunities, and neighborhoods all over this country.\n  So what do we owe these parents? What can we offer their families \nbesides our thoughts and prayers? I believe we must fulfill our central \nresponsibility of protecting the safety of our children and our \ncommunities, while also preserving the individual liberties guaranteed \nin our Constitution.\n  On Sunday night, we watched President Obama speak to a community \nreeling in shock and grief, for the fourth time in his time as \nPresident. He asked us as a Nation whether we are doing enough to \nprotect our children, and he gave us the painfully honest answer that \nwe did not give ourselves after Fort Hood, after Tucson, after Aurora. \nHe said, No, we are not. We are not doing enough to protect our own \nchildren.\n  Horrible crimes like these have a very complex web of causes--\nincluding, of course, mental illness. This complexity presents us with \na complicated challenge. But the reality is the United States has the \nhighest rate of gun deaths in the industrialized world, nearly 20 times \nhigher than comparable nations.\n  In my view, this calls out for a comprehensive approach, for a \nthorough and searching examination of the causes of this uniquely \nAmerican crisis. I believe it requires action by this Congress and our \nPresident.\n  I have received calls and letters, e-mails and Facebook posts, from \nDelawareans around the State, Republicans and Democrats, doctors and \nteachers, parents and children. They have shared with me their grief \nand their ideas, and they have called for action.\n  The United States has a long and proud tradition of independence, of \nprotecting ourselves, of exercising our right to self-determination, of \nhunting and of a sporting tradition that is enshrined in our second \namendment. And we have to recognize the importance--the legitimacy--of \nthe concerns of gun owners to know that in the debate that can and will \nand should unfold in this Chamber we will respect their right to bear \narms and that we will respect and honor this most important part of \nAmerica's fabric. But every constitutionally protected right has its \nboundaries, its limitations.\n  I am troubled in particular by the thread that ties together too many \nof these tragic mass shootings: that the perpetrator had clear mental \nhealth problems, unaddressed, untreated mental illness challenges, and \nused military-style weapons and clips that have no place in everyday \ncivilian life.\n  Several of my colleagues have already come forward with proposals--\nSenators Manchin, Lautenberg, Warner, Feinstein, and others, and I will \ntouch on a few.\n  I believe reinstating the ban on high-capacity magazines, focusing on \nammunition and on the outrageously devastating impact of military clips \nand military ammunition particularly on children across all these \ninstances--I\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\nthink we should focus on that, and reinstate the ban on high-capacity \nmagazines in the next Congress.\n  In addition, Senator Lieberman just the other day on the floor--and \nhe has been joined by Senator Rockefeller--has called for a study to \ngain a better understanding of the linked issues of mental health, mass \nshootings, and the desensitization of violence in our culture. \nPresident Obama has picked that up and carried it forward, and is \nproposing a new commission which the Vice President--Delaware's own Joe \nBiden--will be chairing. It is my hope that out of this important work \nwe can find a path forward that marries the crying need to deal with \nmental health issues with cultural concerns about violence and \ndesensitization with responsible limitations on the excessive use of \nmilitary-style weapons and clips.\n  Last, in my view, we can and must do more to keep guns out of the \nhands of those with a history of violent crime or demonstrated mental \nillness. Our database system is broken and has to be repaired.\n  At Virginia Tech, 32 students and professors were murdered by a young \nman who got a gun he should have been prohibited from buying. A court \nhad already ruled he was mentally ill and posed an imminent danger, but \nthese findings simply weren't reported to the FBI's gun background \ncheck system. That is a travesty. The parents of those 32 murdered in \nBlacksburg, VA should be crying out for justice.\n  We should ensure that no gun sold in this country is sold to someone \nwe know to be dangerous or who poses a direct threat to innocent \nAmericans' lives. Today, an estimated 40 percent of all gun sales--some \n6 million weapons a year--are sold by unlicensed dealers who aren't \nrequired to conduct any criminal background check under Federal law. \nThis is how 12 students and 1 teacher were murdered at Columbine High \nSchool in Colorado, with guns bought from an unlicensed seller--no \npaperwork, no questions asked.\n  It is my hope, it is my prayer, that we will work to address this and \nmany other complex but important issues in the coming weeks and months, \nand that we will consider all these proposals carefully and reach a \nbalanced but effective solution.\n  I will apply the test of balance to find ways that we can continue to \nrespect our traditions and protect constitutional liberties while still \nadvancing our moral requirement to keep our kids and our communities \nsafe.\n  As parents, we can't help but react with horror at the slaughter of \ninnocent children in their classrooms. We all have to take time first \nto grieve with our families and our communities; but as policymakers, \nwe also have a calling to react to the facts as we see them. And in \nthis regard a reaction will have three stages: We need to reflect, we \nneed to debate, and then we need to act.\n  The reflection and the debate have already begun. The action is still \nto come. I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that this time we \nact. The victims of Newtown, CT, deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we have Senators who have talked \nabout bringing amendments to the floor. I know the distinguished \nmajority leader is trying to get a finite list and a time to vote on \nthem. I hope that can be done. I hope Senators who have amendments will \nbring them up, debate them, and vote them up or down so we can get on \nwith this bill.\n  If you are a person whose home has been devastated or your children's \nschool has been destroyed in this storm or your business is only a pile \nof rubble--those people really find it pretty difficult to see us, \nwhether it is the U.S. Senate or the other body, standing around saying \nwe may have amendments, we may not have amendments, we may have \nsomething that is not germane to what we have here but we want to make \na message amendment. They are saying: We are Americans--we are \nAmericans and we are suffering. Do something for us, just as this body \nalways has. Whether the disaster has been in the Midwest, the West, the \nNortheast, the Southeast, or the South, we have come together for our \nfellow Americans.\n  Time is running out, and we should get moving. I urge Senators, bring \nyour amendments. If you really think they have merit, if you really \nthink they have anything to do with this disaster relief, if you really \nthink they are going to be able to help, bring them in and let's vote \nthem up, vote them down. But let's not just sit here thinking that \nmaybe we can wait longer.\n  We get paid our salaries. I don't know of any Senator who has lost \nhis or her home, certainly not his or her business. They are still \nhere, and they still get paid every couple of weeks. That is not the \ncase for hundreds of thousands of people. Let's start acting to take \ncare of them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the ongoing \nsituation with the so-called fiscal cliff. To millions of Americans, \nwhat's happening here in Washington must be a mystery.\n  In less than 2 weeks, almost every single taxpaying citizen will face \na massive tax hike if we don't act. For weeks now, the Speaker of the \nHouse, John Boehner, has been trying to get this President to come up \nwith a fair, reasonable and balanced solution so we don't go over this \ncliff.\n  The President, thinking he has some sort of mandate after his \nreelection, has been less than reasonable. In fact, this President has \nproposed more and more spending, and more and more tax hikes in his \nproposals to the Speaker, while the Speaker is trying to stop these tax \nhikes and deal with our over $16 trillion debt. The President just \ncan't take yes for an answer. He must think that if he keeps slow-\nwalking these proposals that Republicans will get the blame--and \nmembers of his administration have even reveled that they would be more \nthan happy if we went over the cliff.\n  What kind of cruel Christmas gift is that?\n  After the Speaker and the President exchanged offers this week, House \nRepublicans are looking at having votes on two competing pieces of \nlegislation as early as tomorrow. The first is legislation that passed \nthis body over the summer--deeply-flawed legislation that every \nDemocrat in this body supported.\n  I should note that I put forward a more common-sense alternative that \nwould have extended all the current tax policy for 1 year during which \ntime we could undertake a comprehensive overhaul of our bloated, broken \ntax code. I think I characterized it as putting it over for 1 year and \ndedicating that year to tax reform, which we all know needs to be done.\n  The second piece of legislation that the House will vote on is \nlegislation that Speaker Boehner has called ``Plan B''--a more limited \npiece of legislation that extends almost all the current tax policy as \nis in the law today.\n  I understand that this ``Plan B'' is a plan of necessity. And while I \nunderstand that the Speaker continues to negotiate with the President \nto try and reach an agreement, the Speaker has put this forward to \nforce action from this intransigent White House.\n  What does the Speaker's plan do?\n  The Speaker's plan would provide seamless permanent tax relief for \nAmerican taxpayers who earn less than $1 million. For taxpayers earning \nabove $1 million, the statutory rates on ordinary and capital gain \nincome would be set at the level President Obama and Congressional \nDemocrats have insisted on.\n  My preference is clear. I have legislation that this body voted on in \nAugust that shows what I believe is the better path.\n  I oppose tax increases very strongly and have said over and over that \nwe should not be touching tax rates. But I\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nalso understand, given the reality before us, that the Speaker has to \nmove forward with a plan to force action.\n  Is it perfect from my perspective? No, but we cannot let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good.\n  The Speaker, in my view, is the only person in these negotiations \ntrying to find a resolution. I commend him--I admire him--I back him--\nand I know he is working hard discussing this legislation with the \nmembers of the House Republican Conference as they move towards a vote.\n  I hope they support this plan. However, it turns out, if I was a \nmember of the House, I would.\n  But I am a Member of the Senate and this leads me to ask: after the \nHouse passes ``Plan B'' and defeats the Senate Democrats' tax bill, \nwhat is it that Senate Democrats want to do?\n  The House will presumably send its bill to the Senate. Senator Reid \nand the White House have already said it is dead on arrival in the \nSenate. I find that very curious indeed since so many Democrats seem to \nhave wanted exactly what the Speaker is giving them. Then they complain \nthat the Speaker's plan isn't ``balanced,'' despite the fact that the \nPresident in a proposal was calling on more stimulus spending and for \nthe continuation of so-called temporary stimulus tax provisions that \nthe President now somehow wants to make permanent.\n  So I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, what is \nit exactly that you want to do?\n  What is it that Senate Democrats and the White House want?\n  We are all waiting.\n  The American people are waiting.\n  Enough of the games. Put your money where your mouth is, and tell us \nwhat you think is better than what Speaker Boehner is ultimately going \nto put forward.\n  If I were in the House, I would be supporting Speaker Boehner. \nFrankly, I do support Speaker Boehner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3367, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto my amendment, No. 3367.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I have a modification at the desk. I ask that my \namendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment is as follows: \n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 101.

Mr. President, I am deeply honored to have served for 18 \nyears as Arizona's 10th Senator and for four terms in the House of \nRepresentatives before that. Now it is time to move on. My successor, \nSenator-elect Jeff Flake, is a good and honorable public servant who \nwill work hard on behalf of our great State of Arizona, and my \ncolleague John McCain will continue his long and dedicated public \nservice as well. I appreciate the remarks he delivered here yesterday.\n  I say thank you to my colleagues for your friendship. It has been a \nprivilege working with so many of you on both sides of the aisle. While \nit is true that Washington would benefit from more civility, the Senate \nbehind the scenes is an extraordinarily collegial institution, and I \nwill certainly miss that aspect of the job.\n  I also thank my staff, past and present, for working so many long \nhours and for spending so much time analyzing the issues that will \ndetermine America's future.\n  Farewell speeches offer the opportunity to reminisce about the past. \nI actually do not believe that would be the best use of either your \ntime or mine. Instead, I am going to comment on some of the biggest \npublic policy changes America faces and recommend principles to guide \nthe way forward.\n  I was first elected to public office when the Reagan revolution was \nin full swing. Maximizing freedom guided the policies of that era, with \ntremendous success. My goal as a public servant has been to advance and \nmaintain a consensus in favor of the so-called three legs of the Reagan \npublic policy stool.\n  One, dynamic, growth-oriented economics; two, the social values that \nmake limited government possible; and three, a national security \ncommitment that emphasizes a strong and sovereign America. In each of \nthe three areas, maximizing freedom and the positive results that flow \nfrom that is the goal.\n  Let's turn first to economic freedom. The Reagan years showed us that \nexpanding economic freedom should be the North Star, the guiding light \nof U.S. policy because it is the best way to achieve sustained and \nbroad-based prosperity for all. Free markets, low taxes, and limited \ngovernment allow citizens to use their talents and resources in \nwhatever way they choose and keep more of the fruits of their labor.\n  I encourage people to invest, work, start businesses, and hire \nothers. In other words, free markets promote economic well-being for \nall. Cutting taxes at the margins; that is, reducing the rate of tax on \nthe next $1 earned, encourages growth. Raising taxes can have the \nopposite effect. Nobel economist Edward Prescott of Arizona has found \nthat higher marginal tax rates are the reason Europeans work one-third \nfewer hours than Americans.\n  When marginal rates are lower, prosperity flows to other sectors of \nsociety, allowing businesses to create jobs and new products, compete \nfor workers, raise wages, invest their profits, which then can be lent \nto other entrepreneurs. Everyone gains in a free economy. As John F. \nKennedy put it, a rising tide lifts all boats.\n  Look at what free enterprise has achieved. After President Reagan \ndramatically lowered tax rates and trimmed regulation, income increased \nin every quintile. Millions of new private sector jobs were created and \nthe stock market soared, tripling in value over 8 years. The lower tax \nrates, reduced regulatory burden produced a more robust economy and a \nmore robust economy meant more revenue for government. Similar results \nattended the tax rate reductions during the Presidency of George W. \nBush.\n  In recent years, many policymakers have forgotten these lessons. \nSince 2008, America's score in the Index of Economic Freedom has \ndeclined significantly to the point that we are no longer considered a \nfree economy but, rather, a mostly free economy. That is what happens \nwhen we dramatically increase government spending and regulations. Now \nwe are on the verge of a massive tax increase which could undermine \nsmall businesses and stifle economic growth America badly needs.\n  Policymakers must focus on the basic laws of economic input. A faulty \nview has gained traction in recent years that consumption fueled by \ngovernment spending actually creates economic growth. It doesn't. It \njust moves money around by taking from people who produced it and could \nproductively spend or reinvest it and giving it to government to spend. \nConsumption is the wrong target.\n  People only change their spending habits when they know they will \nhave greater consistent income over time; for example, when they \nreceive a raise at work or get a permanent tax cut. That is why \ntemporary stimulus tax gimmicks don't work.\n  If the problem with the economy is supposedly a lack of consumption, \nthe government cannot solve that problem by spending for us. After all, \nit is our tax money that is being taken out of the economy and spent. \nWhen government borrows, it will eventually have to tax the people to \npay back what it has borrowed. There is no free lunch. For the \ngovernment to spend, taxpayers have to give up wealth they could have \nspent or invested. Keynesian demand-side economics assumes the \ngovernment is more efficient at spending our money than we are. That \nassumption has proved to be incorrect time and again.\n  Wise policymakers will find the right balance between the need for \nmore tax revenue and the need for more economic freedom. They will \nremember there is no fixed economic pie that legislators should try to \ndivide. They will remember that labor, capital, and technology are the \nreal factors that drive long-term economic growth, not government \nspending. They will stop shackling would-be entrepreneurs and job \ncreators with ever more burdensome regulations.\n  Here is some more good news about growth-based free enterprise. It is \nthe most moral economic system ever devised for three reasons. First, \nit is premised on the truth that success only comes by supplying \nsomething to others that they need or want. In the bargain, both sides \nbenefit. Second, this system has produced incredible wealth around the \nworld, lifting millions out of poverty. No economic system can come \nclose in helping that many people. So it is the most moral economic \nsystem in providing material benefits, but that is only part of the \nstory.\n  Free enterprise provides more than increased income and material \nprosperity. Those things help, but they are not what make humans \nthrive. The key determinant of lasting happiness and satisfaction is \nwhat American Enterprise Institute president Arthur Brooks has called \nearned success. People are happiest when they do something they are \ngood at, when they create value in the lives of others, and genuinely \nearn their income regardless of how much it is.\n  Brooks put it very well in his book ``The Battle,'' and I quote:\n\n       Earned success gives people a sense of meaning about their \n     lives. And meaning also\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n     is key to human flourishing. It reassures us that what we do \n     in life is of significance and value, for ourselves and for \n     those around us. To truly flourish, we need to know that the \n     ways in which we occupy our waking hours are not based on \n     mere pursuit of pleasure or money or any other superficial \n     goal. We need to know that our endeavors have a deeper \n     purpose.\n\n  The earned success that comes from doing a job well explains why \nfabulously wealthy people often choose not to retire after they have \nearned their fortunes. They are motivated by the satisfaction that \ncomes from spending the day productively by creating, innovating, and \nsolving problems. They are creating purpose-driven value in their own \nlives and oftentimes tangible value in the lives of others.\n  The effect of earned success also explains why people who win the \nlottery often become depressed when they find out that free money \noffers hollow joy. Free enterprise promotes freedom to achieve and, \ntherefore, more opportunities to earn success. It is the most moral \neconomic system ever created. It is also the fairest system because it \nrewards merit, hard work, and achievement. This is what brought my \ngrandparents to this country, along with millions of other immigrants. \nIncidentally, real free enterprise has no place for crony capitalism \nbecause it doesn't have government picking winners and losers.\n\n  The biggest economic favor policymakers can do for Americans is to \nfollow the Reagan legacy and support free market policies that create \nmore opportunity, more mobility and more earned success and therefore \nmore human flourishing possible for every American. Free enterprise is \nthe only economic system that gives us so many opportunities to pursue \nfundamental happiness and lasting satisfaction.\n  This brings us to the second leg of the Reagan stool--the question of \nvalues. President Reagan devoted his Presidency--and indeed his entire \ncareer in public life--to the expansion of economic freedom. He also \nunderstood that economic freedom depends on certain cultural \nunderpinnings, such as marriage, family, and personal responsibility. \nHe understood that family breakdown and social pathologies would \nultimately make people more reliant on government and thus more eager \nfor government to expand, sapping them of individual responsibility and \nthe need to care for others in the family or community.\n  In short, Reagan understood that economic conservatism would not and \ncould not survive unless social conservatism survived too.\n  The United States has a stronger philosophical attachment to freedom \nand limited government than any other Nation on Earth. Yet I also \nrecognize that many cultural trends are working against us. For \nexample, nearly 41 percent of all American children are now born to \nunmarried women, compared with fewer than 11 percent in 1970. Without \nstable, two-parent families, the government bears more of a burden of \ncaring for these children. The growth in food stamps and other support \nprograms makes the point. At some point, this makes it harder to \nmaintain a political consensus that favors limited government, economic \nfreedom, and programs that help people out of poverty rather than \nentrenching it. Why?\n  To quote Princeton scholar Robert P. George, limited government:\n\n       Cannot be maintained where the marriage culture collapses \n     and families fail to form or easily dissolve. Where these \n     things happen, the health, education, and welfare function of \n     the family will have to be undertaken by someone or some \n     institution, and that will sooner or later be government.\n\n  In other words, in the absence of two-parent families, the government \nfills the financial role of the father, to say nothing of the critical \nroles fathers play. Over time, more and more Americans have come to \nrely on the government to provide for their most basic needs, needs \nthat two-parent families have traditionally supported. Those Americans \nare now competing for increasingly scarce resources.\n  This is not to judge the status of these families or to suggest it is \nin any way inappropriate for government to provide the help. It is \nprecisely because we do care that we provide help through government \nand other institutions. But that is an action to ameliorate the effects \nof a condition, not to change the underlying condition.\n  I believe we must do all we can to revive the marriage culture, \nincrease family stability, and ensure that more children grow up in \ntwo-parent households. Strong families have always been the key to \nupward mobility and economic security.\n  If we want to remain an aspirational society, a society where \nchildren have the opportunities and the resources to pursue their \ndreams and create a better life, we must encourage young Americans to \nembrace what Ron Haskins and Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings \nInstitution have called the success sequence. That sequence is very \nsimple: Complete high school, get a full-time job, get married before \nhaving kids. If we follow that sequence, we are virtually guaranteed to \navoid poverty.\n  The marriage culture is fighting an uphill battle against forces that \nthreaten to overwhelm them. I urge everyone who believes in limited \ngovernment, economic freedom, and the real self-worth and well-being of \nour children to do their part in rebuilding the institution of \nmarriage. No other social cause or campaign is more vital to America's \nfuture.\n  When it comes to shaping our culture, we must also improve the \nquality of our students' civic education. I fear that many American \nstudents are graduating from high school and college with only the \nvaguest knowledge of our founding and our Constitution and what it \nmeans to be an American. It is hard to defend rights if we don't know \nwhat they are and where they came from.\n  Schools shape students' views about our priorities as a society and \nwhat principles are worth standing for. Instead of teaching history and \nthe fundamentals of America's founding, many curriculums focus on \nsmall, politically correct topics such as gender, class, diversity, and \nethnicity. The entertainment industry and many major media outlets, \ntoo, dwell on these topics and lend them outsized importance.\n  These topics tend to be political and emphasize what divides us. They \nignore our common heritage of freedom, equality, self-reliance, human \ndignity, faith, and community. As William Bennett recently wrote: When \nwe look at what students are being taught, it is easy to see why more \nof them prefer socialism over free market capitalism. He writes: \n``Politics is downstream from the culture.''\n  Bennett also noted that Plato said the two most important questions \nin society are: Who teaches the young and what do we teach them.\n  I believe we need to think long and hard about these two questions. \nIt is time to have a serious discussion about civics education. If \nAmericans don't understand or appreciate the foundations of our \nrepublican government, those foundations will gradually erode. In that \nsense, political and historical literacy is critical to the \npreservation of our constitutional freedoms.\n  As President Reagan famously said:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on \n     for them to do the same.\n\n  Moving to the last leg of the Reagan policy stool: national security. \nI have tried to follow the Reagan legacy of pursuing peace through \nstrength. As President Reagan once said, ``Of the four wars in my \nlifetime, none came about because America was too strong.''\n  President Reagan knew that weakness tempts aggression, and he \nbelieved that deterrence meant ``making sure any adversary who thinks \nabout attacking the United States . . . concludes the risks to him \noutweigh any potential gains. Once he understands that, he won't \nattack. We maintain the peace through our strength; weakness only \ninvites aggression.''\n  American strength remains the best guarantor against major armed \nconflict between nation-states. While it is not our role to police the \nworld--and we couldn't do it in any event--it is also true that we are \nthe indispensable Nation to help safeguard liberal values around the \nworld.\n  For America to continue its leadership role, however, we must have a \nmilitary with both the capability and the flexibility to address a wide \nrange of challenges. And, yes, it means adequately funding the military \nrequirements, among other things, by avoiding the devastating \nsequestration of\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nnecessary defense investments. I wish to speak to four of our \nchallenges: nuclear modernization, missile defense, terrorist threats, \nand transnational law.\n  For the first time in the history of U.S. nuclear policy, the \nPresident has placed nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, rather \nthan nuclear deterrence, ``atop the U.S. nuclear agenda.''\n  Ironically, more treaties or unilateral actions that take us closer \nto nuclear disarmament will not help us reduce the dangers we face \ntoday. Such actions will only serve to make our allies who depend on \nU.S. nuclear guarantees more nervous, while potentially weakening the \ncredibility of U.S. nuclear deterrence. Senate support for the 2010 New \nSTART treaty was based upon a commitment to modernize our aging nuclear \ncomplex and weapons. As that commitment starts to decay, it will become \nincreasingly difficult to rebuild the responsive nuclear infrastructure \nthat even the President agreed is necessary for further nuclear \nreductions as well as the continued credibility of the U.S. nuclear \narsenal. Note that I said ``for further nuclear reductions.'' They are \nliterally dependent upon the U.S. modernization.\n  The New START proceedings made it clear that the nuclear balance \nbetween the United States and Russia under New START force levels would \nbe stable--except, of course, for the huge diversity--or disparity, I \nwould say--in tactical nuclear weapons that Russia enjoys. But under \nthis stability, there would be no incentives to strike first during a \ncrisis nor would there be incentives to grow our respective nuclear \narsenals in the future. We should, therefore, think very carefully \nbefore we contemplate any changes to longstanding U.S. nuclear \ndeterrence policies or pursue further reductions in support of the \nPresident's disarmament agenda.\n  We absolutely cannot know for certain that fewer numbers of weapons \nwill make us safer. In fact, Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft \nrecently reminded us ``that strategic stability is not inherent with \nlow numbers of weapons; indeed, excessively low numbers could lead to a \nsituation in which surprise attacks are conceivable.''\n  Policymakers would do well to heed the advice of Winston Churchill \noffered in his last address to the United States Congress. He said:\n\n       Be careful above all things not to let go of the atomic \n     weapon until you are sure, and more than sure, that other \n     means of preserving peace are in your hands.\n\n  Against the backdrop of more than 100 million war casualties from \nconventional weapons in just the 30 years before development of the \natomic weapon, Churchill's advice is sobering indeed.\n  The second challenge we face is with respect to missile defense. \nRecent events illustrate the importance of missile defense in today's \nsecurity environment. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system \nprotected its population against rocket attacks, giving Israeli \nmilitary and political authorities the time and the space necessary to \navoid a devastating ground war, which is ultimately what made a truce \npossible.\n  As Secretary of Defense Panetta said at the time, ``Iron Dome does \nnot start wars, it helps prevent wars.''\n  Elsewhere in the world, Turkey has requested NATO Patriot batteries \nto protect it against Syrian ballistic missiles potentially armed with \nchemical weapons. Meanwhile, Japan, South Korea, and the United States \nrecently activated their ballistic missile defense systems in response \nto North Korea's long-range ballistic missile launch--yet another \nreminder that the threat doesn't stand still.\n  In response to Iran's development of nuclear weapons and longer range \nballistic missiles, NATO has agreed to support the deployment of short, \nmedium, and long-range missile defense systems to protect alliance \nterritory and thereby avoid potential Iranian nuclear blackmail. So the \nbenefits of defense are well appreciated, especially by those most \ndirectly affected or threatened.\n  We have proven that it is possible to hit a bullet with a bullet, and \nwe have debunked the Cold War-era argument that missile defense \ncontributes to a new arms race. In fact, since the United States \nwithdrew from the ABM Treaty, we have reduced the number of deployed \nnuclear weapons from 6,000 under START to 1,700 under the Moscow Treaty \nto 1,550 under the New START treaty. We must continue to disabuse some \nof the notion that U.S. vulnerability to the Russian and Chinese \nnuclear arsenals is a source of stability when, in fact, the most \nimportant constitutional and moral duty of any President is to protect \nthe American people.\n  We have made some progress in deploying domestic missile defenses \nsince the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002, though we \nhave also squandered opportunities to do more. Here are just a few \nmissile defense challenges for the future.\n  First, over the past 4 years, the Obama administration has \nconsistently reduced funding for missile defense. Second, it has \nrefocused funding on regional missile defenses that protect others at \nthe expense of protecting the homeland of the United States and \ndeveloping future technologies. Third, the administration has scaled \nback the number of ground-based interceptors protecting the homeland \nfrom 54 to only 30--numbers that do not begin to meet the standard \nestablished by the Missile Defense Act of 1999, which required a \ndefense capable of addressing accidental and unauthorized attacks from \nany source. And, fourth, the administration has no plans to modernize \ninterceptors that are more than 20 years old. That is the technology \nthat is protecting America today, and it is, therefore, unlikely to \nkeep up with future threats.\n  As I said, there is very little funding devoted to new breakthrough \ntechnologies that could provide even more effective defenses for the \nUnited States, such as lasers and space-based interceptors.\n  We should remember, as NORTHCOM Commander General Jacoby has \nexplained to Congress, that ``no homeland task is more important than \nprotecting the United States from a limited ICBM attack. . . . ''\n  Finally, one of the greatest challenges we face today stems from \nRussian attempts to limit the development and deployment of U.S. and \nallied missile defense systems. The United States cannot allow Russia \nto dictate to us limits on the capabilities of U.S. missile defenses. \nIf they could be effective against a Russian launch, then so be it. \nThat is what it means to protect Americans from potential threats. If \nthe Russians argue that they pose no possible threat, then our missile \ndefense should be irrelevant to them.\n  From negotiations on the New START treaty to threatening the United \nStates and NATO in an attempt to limit our planned deployments in \nEurope, the Russians have never abandoned their goal of limiting the \neffectiveness of U.S. missile defense. The answer is not ``reset'' but \nrecommitment to the principle that the most moral way to protect the \nAmerican people from missile attacks is by missile defense.\n  The third national security challenge I wish to briefly discuss is \nthe threat of political Islam. To defeat an enemy, we must first know \nthe enemy, and that includes calling them by their name: radical \nIslamists who seek to impose their ideology to rule others--to govern \npolitical, social, and civic life, as well as religious life.\n  Intelligence is key to defeating political Islam. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and the PATRIOT Act are good \nexamples of the tools we need to know what our enemies are planning and \nwho they are before they strike. These tools cannot be allowed to \nexpire.\n  The PATRIOT Act reflects a recognition that investigators charged \nwith preventing acts of terrorism should have at least the same \ninvestigative tools as Federal agents charged with targeting mobsters \nor health care fraud.\n  The fourth and last national security challenge I will mention is the \nrise of transnational law, which poses a serious threat to American \nsovereignty. Our government was founded on the principle that laws \nshould be made through the democratic process so that the people could \nhold their legislators accountable. The American people elected their \nown representatives and, therefore, control their own affairs. That is \nthe theory.\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n  Americans want the benefits of global cooperation based on widespread \nacceptance of useful international ``rules of the road,'' of course. \nBut such rules, like our domestic laws, should be adopted through \ndemocratic processes that assure accountability on the part of the \nlegislators. They should not be imposed by international bodies with \nzero accountability to the American people.\n  The rise of global governance, I believe, challenges this principle. \nBy ``global governance'' I mean the use of multilateral treaties and \nother agreements to delegate power on matters such as the environment, \nnatural resources, and individual rights to new international bodies \nwith broad powers and little or no political accountability. Such \nissues have traditionally been decided by the laws of individual \nnations, not by international bureaucracies. Some treaties would \ndirectly implicate U.S. national security flexibility or capability.\n  One such treaty was defeated by the Senate in 1999--the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which would have jeopardized America's nuclear \ndeterrent by preventing us from ever again conducting tests of our \nnuclear weapons. We should never give up the right to verify that our \nnuclear deterrent works. It is critical that we know, that our allies \nwho rely on these weapons know, and that our potential adversaries \nknow, or our weapons will not have deterrent effect. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this treaty again should it come up before the \nSenate in the President's second term.\n  In conclusion, in all three areas I have discussed here, we have had \nsuccesses and we have had failures. I think of what Margaret Thatcher \nsaid as she was leaving public office; that there are no permanent \nvictories in politics. What she meant was one can leave office having \nupheld their principles and having accomplished some of their policy \ngoals, but that doesn't mean there will always be a consensus in favor \nof their preferred policies or that their accomplishments would not be \nreversed in the future.\n  As I look back on my 26 years in Congress and my 18 years in the \nSenate, I am deeply proud of everything we have accomplished--from tax \nrelief and welfare reform to missile defense and nuclear policy, not to \nmention things of primary importance to my State. But I also understand \nthat political victories can be ephemeral because in a democracy, a \ndebate over these issues never really ends. It is always ongoing.\n  I will miss being involved in these important debates and decisions \ndirectly. From now on, my role in these matters will be as a private \ncitizen, but I still aim to be involved.\n  It has been an honor--really the privilege of a lifetime--to serve, \nand it is difficult to say goodbye. But I will depart Capitol Hill with \nenormous faith in the American people, a profound appreciation for the \nmiracle of the American Republic, and a resilient optimism about \nAmerica's future.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about our \ncolleague, Senator Jon Kyl. I have always appreciated his comments, his \nthoughtfulness, his patriotism, and his intellectual leadership in the \nSenate. He will be sorely missed after 18 years in the Senate. I am \nsorry the Senate will be losing Senator Kyl's extraordinary talents, \nbut as he retires from politics at the end of this month, I know he \nwill remain a powerful force in the world of ideas.\n  Time magazine named Jon one of the 10 best Senators in 2006. At the \ntime, he said: ``You can accomplish a lot if you're not necessarily out \nin front on everything.'' That echoes Ronald Reagan's comment--one of \nhis favorite slogans: ``There is no limit to what a man can do . . . if \nhe doesn't mind who gets the credit.''\n  Over the last 18 years, Jon Kyl has accomplished a lot in this \nChamber, and he has never seemed to care one bit about who got the \ncredit. When he announced his retirement, the Wall Street Journal said \nJon ``has been as consequential as any Republican in Congress over the \nlast decade and a half.'' That is quite a compliment and thoroughly \ndeserved.\n  As you could tell from his comments, Jon has spent a career promoting \nthe Reagan legacy. After he leaves, many of us will be promoting the \nKyl legacy.\n  He is a person of strong principle, a man deep in knowledge of public \npolicy, and a person--uncharacteristic in politics--of remarkable \nhumility. Here is how one writer described his unique skill set. \nSenator Kyl, he wrote, ``is one of those rare breeds who seem to make \nno strong enemies even while holding firm to a consistent philosophy.'' \nAs you have heard, he has been a leader on things ranging as wide as \nmissile defense to criminal justice to tax policy.\n  One of the things I have admired about Senator Kyl is he always seems \nto be among the most knowledgeable people in any room at any given time \non any given topic that is under discussion. When he speaks, people \nlisten. But he often willingly pushes others into the spotlight rather \nthan himself. It is because he thinks tactically: How can I advance \nthis policy or this idea, not: How can I advance myself in the public \nspotlight.\n  That certainly has been my experience with Senator Kyl. But I would \nadd something else. He has also been a courageous intellectual leader. \nHe has consistently led on complex issues that other Senators have \nignored or neglected or just have a difficulty understanding, complex \ntopics such as nuclear modernization, missile defense, and \ntransnational law, each of which he mentioned in his remarks just a \nmoment ago. It is not easy to become the Senate's top authority on \nnuclear weapons, but Jon Kyl is, and it is not the best way to get your \nface on cable news. Not a lot of air time is given to people who want \nto talk about such arcane but important topics.\n  I have also watched Senator Kyl over the past couple of years \ncultivate more junior Senators and help them become experts in their \nown right on all of his favorite issues. As a matter of fact, I \nattended a meeting on that just today where he was trying to bring \nalong a number of us on the nuclear issue. Senator Kyl is always \nthinking about the future, always thinking about the next generation of \nAmerican leaders and the challenges they will face.\n  Jon quoted Margaret Thatcher, reminding us there are no permanent \nvictories in politics. He understands that the debate over limited \ngovernment and a robust national defense will never be over, it will \nnever be completely won and, hopefully, never completely lost. That is \nwhy he has worked so hard to educate and encourage other younger \nSenators who will be fighting these battles long after he leaves the \nChamber.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Jon Kyl is tremendously principled. He is a \nproud conservative, but he is also a fairminded and enormously \neffective legislator. Last February the New York Times declared that he \n``may be [one of] the rare member[s] of his party who combines the \ntrust of conservatives, policy smarts, and forcefulness that are needed \nto secure deals that can pass.''\n  It has been my great honor and privilege to work with Jon Kyl on such \nissues as immigration reform and criminal law, among others. He is a \ntrue patriot, a true intellectual in the greatest sense of that term, \nand a truly effective Senator for his State and for the Nation. After \nmore than a quarter century of public service, including 18 years here \nin the Senate, Jon Kyl deserves a happy and healthy and successful \nretirement, but he will be sorely missed by everybody in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to echo the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. I have served with Jon Kyl for his \nwhole time in the U.S. Senate, and he is a lawyer's lawyer. I do not \nsay that lightly. I do not consider many lawyers a lawyer's lawyer. Jon \nis an excellent lawyer, one of the best I have met and certainly one of \nthe best ever to sit in Congress.\n  He also does not go off the deep end. When he speaks, anybody with \nbrains should listen. Plus, he is a tremendous example not just to some \nof us older guys around here but especially to the new Senators and \nothers who have come into this body. He has been a pivotal member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, including when I chaired it and when we did so \nmany interesting\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nthings. He was a pivotal member on leading to a balanced budget in the \nmiddle of the 1990s. Jon has argued for that, has argued for these \ntypes of fiscal restraints and responsibilities like no one I know.\n  Jon is one of the most honest and decent and credible people I have \nknown in the whole time I have been in the U.S. Senate. He has been an \nexcellent leader for our party. As assistant minority leader and \nassistant majority leader, he has been a great, great leader in our \nparty. We have all trusted him because he is a person who is \ntrustworthy. We have all listened to him because he is a person worth \nlistening to. We have all shared the pains of this place with him as \nfriends and brothers working together, we hope in the best interests of \nour country. And there is no question in anybody's mind on either side \nof this floor, when it comes to Jon Kyl, they know he is a true \nAmerican patriot who has done everything he could while he has been \nhere to keep this country strong.\n  I have to say I have always been impressed with Jon Kyl. I have \nwatched him close up for all these years, but I do not know that I have \never been more impressed than when he led the fight with regard to \nnuclear weapons and with regard to START. He not only was well \ninformed, he was the best informed, and this body should have listened \nto everything he said. I am sure most people did.\n  I do not think any of us would fail to try to serve this country to \nthe best of our ability. All I can say, in closing, is that Jon has \nserved this country to the best of his ability, and his abilities are \nextraordinary.\n  I personally count him as a friend. When I had this very interesting \nreelection this last time, with what seemed like the whole world coming \ndown on me for some reason, one of the first people to offer help was \nJon Kyl. He came to Utah, and it meant so much to me.\n  All I can say is, wherever Jon goes after this is over, they are \ngoing to be lucky people to have him around. And I wish him all the \nsuccess in the world. He deserves it. I hope he and his wife and \nfamily--whom I like very much--will have a wonderful, glorious \nexistence from this day onward.\n  We are going to miss you, Jon. We are going to miss your intellectual \ncapacity. I am personally going to miss your legal capacity. And all of \nthese other accolades that have been given your way, I will miss all of \nthose too. But you have a friend here, and this friendship, in my \nopinion, is an eternal one, and anything I can ever do for you, I will \ncertainly try because I know you would never ask for anything that was \nnot accurate or right. So I wish you Godspeed, and know there are a lot \nof us who really, really hate to see you go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of Senator Cornyn and Senator Hatch. Both of them have \nspoken eloquently and correctly about the absolutely unique and \nexceptional contributions Jon Kyl has made to America and to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  There is no Senator I have admired more, no Senator I look to more to \ndecide how to cast my vote, and I mean that absolutely as a fact. The \nwords they have used I am not so eloquent as to say, but they do not \noverstate the value of my friend Jon Kyl.\n  His statement that we just heard is a comprehensive analysis, \noverview of the current situation of this great Republic of which we \nare a part. He meant every word of it. One of the most remarkable \nthings about it is that on every vote, every time an issue came up, \nthose are the values he sought to advance. And sometimes you have to \ntake a step back to gain two steps forward, but Senator Kyl always had \na vision for what America should be. I believe it is the correct vision \nthat we have inherited from our ancestors that has made this country so \nproductive and so valuable. Everything he has done, every effort he has \nmade has been to advance those good values--a great America, a decent \nAmerica. And he has understood it.\n  When he talks about free enterprise, he explains why that is \npreferable to other forms of distribution of wealth. Would you rather \nhave politicians distribute the wealth in this country? He can \narticulate that in a way that emphasizes the moral power of it, the \nneed to have peace in the world, but how do you have it? Do you get \npeace through weakness or do you have peace through strength? And are \nthe nuclear issues necessary to our posture as a strong nation in the \nworld that is resistant and deters attack? Yes, they are. He \nunderstands those issues.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. Jon does not, but he knows \nmore about that issue than I do. And I have found his leadership so \nvaluable because it is a thankless task. People do not want to talk \nabout it, but he has talked about it. He knows it is important, even \nthough no one would give him credit politically for being engaged in \nthose issues. But it is important for America, and he is willing to \ncommit himself to that.\n  I will join with Senator Hatch and Senator Cornyn in my admiration \nfor Jon's service on the Judiciary Committee. That is an important \ncommittee, and he has been a rock-solid member of it. Even though he \nhas been in the leadership, so therefore he did not chair the \ncommittee--which he would have been one of the great chairmen we would \nhave ever had of that committee--but he has moved the committee and \nbrought forth issues and advocated principles that are consistent with \nthe great American rule of law.\n  Today we just got word that Robert Bork died. He had a classical view \nof how the Constitution should be interpreted and one I basically share \nfor the most part. I think Jon has. He understands those issues. He is \nable to communicate the great richness of the American heritage of law \nto the common people in language people can understand, but he is also \ncapable of reading the most complex legal document and being able to \nspot problems with it and advocate changes in law that are \nsophisticated in the most technical details.\n  I guess I would have to say Senator Hatch is correct. This Senate, in \nmy view, has never had a better lawyer than Jon Kyl. He has argued \ncases before the Supreme Court in his private practice days. Not many \nhave been a part of that.\n  So whether we are talking about the crime victims advocacy efforts he \nhas made over a long period of time here, recognizing that the law \nshould be in existence to advance and protect innocent people against \nthe wrongdoers, and that we ought not to become so obsessed with \ndefendants' rights that we do not remember the victims who deserve \nvindication and remuneration for the crimes that have been put upon \nthem.\n  There are other things I could say and other issues we have joined \nin, that we have fought on. On more than one occasion, Jon has felt \nsomething was important. Sometimes those issues were not very popular, \nbut he believed they were important and would rally people. I have \njoined with him. We have had some good battles. We have won a few, \nfrankly, several I never thought we were going to win. But somehow, \nwith his legislative skill, his determination, his feisty spirit, we \nstayed in there and bad things did not occur, at least from my \nperspective, that may have occurred otherwise.\n  It is a great pleasure to have served with Jon. I consider him--I \nknow the grammar is not perfect--our most invaluable Senator. So we are \ngoing to be losing someone of great national importance. I know he will \nbe active. He has got a fabulous wife, Caryll. They have been partners \nfor so many years. I enjoy watching them and how they interact as a \nfamily. He has the values that reflect the highest qualities of \nAmerican life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues in rising today \nto pay honor and respect to the service of Jon Kyl, a tribute to his \npassion for public service and his State of Arizona and his country in \nthis Congress for 26 years. I echo all the sentiments and all the words \nthat have been said by our colleagues. There are not enough adjectives \nto adequately describe the extraordinary service Jon has provided to \nthis country.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving alongside him in the House of \nRepresentatives, in the Senate--two times,\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nas some know. I served before and then was out for 12 years and then \ncame back. In my many years of service here, it is hard to think of a \nperson who has been more influential and been more of someone I wanted \nto emulate and to learn from and to look at as a wise counsel than Jon \nKyl.\n  He has been described as an influential member of the Judiciary and \nFinance Committees. Yes, he has been an outspoken leader on issues of \nvery significant importance to this country--significant issues \nincluding the landmark Crime Victims Rights Act, progrowth tax policies \nthat we have been debating here, patient-centered health care reform, \nand antiterrorism laws, nuclear proliferation, safeguarding our nuclear \nstockpile. On and on it could go.\n  Jon recently called me to his office and said, you know, there are 13 \nseparate things here that have been the highest priority for me. Now \nnot many Senators will tell you they have got 13 high-priority issues \nthey not only are interested in but have drilled down in a unique, in-\ndepth understanding of those particular issues. Jon said: One thing I \nwant to accomplish before I leave is to make sure someone will pick up \nthe ball and take the baton and carry on those issues after I leave.\n  That is an extraordinary statement. First of all, the breadth and the \ndepth of his engagement and his knowledge, which I do not think any one \nperson here--it would take many--could begin to duplicate, but also the \nleadership that he has provided on issues of significant importance to \nthe future of this country. Jon was listed as one of the world's 100 \nmost influential people--well-deserved recognition.\n  In Washington, he has been labeled as one of the 25 hardest working \nlawmakers. I cannot think of anybody who stands higher in that list \nthan Jon Kyl. My mental image of Jon Kyl is Jon striding through the \nHalls of Congress literally leaning into the wind. It is as if there is \na 60-mile gale coming in his face, and Jon is leaning into it with \ndetermination. I see his staff nodding their heads here. It has got to \nbe hard to stay up with Jon when he has his mind on something and he is \ndetermined to get something done. He is leaning in like a ship into a \ngale, moving forward to try to accomplish his mission.\n  We all say when someone leaves here, we are losing someone whom maybe \nwe cannot replace. That may or may not be true. In my first iteration, \nwhen I gave my farewell speech, I think there were probably a lot of \npeople who said: We can find a substitute for Coats; that will not be \ntoo hard. It is true. Finding a replacement for Jon Kyl is a tall task. \nIt is going to be very hard to find someone who has the passion for \nthis, his service, the intelligence and the knowledge of the issues he \nengages in, the leadership qualities he provides, the counsel he \nprovides to all of us. Jon Kyl is the go-to guy. Jon Kyl is the person \nyou go to to say: Jon, how do we get this done? What should our \nstrategy be? If you are on board, I think we can accomplish this. I \nknow I am repeating a lot of what has been said already about Jon and \nwill be said by others here who will come down, but to find someone \nthis grounded in his endeavors is hard to find.\n  Jon is also grounded in his faith, his faith in God, his faith in \nAmerica, his faith in his constituents, his faith in this institution, \nnot a perfect institution, one which we are struggling in right now, \nbut his faith that in the end we are here to do what is best for \nAmerica. In the end, we will need to make hard decisions. Jon has \nalways been one leading that effort, always one willing to stand up to \nmake those decisions.\n  I count him as a friend. Marsha and I wish you, Jon, and Caryll, all \nthe best in this next chapter of your life. I am comforted by the fact \nthat you will not be more than a phone call away, and the fact that I \nam going to need wise counsel on a number of things; more than that, \nthat we can retain a friendship which we have enjoyed in our service \ntogether on two separate occasions interrupted by 12 years. But I am \nlooking forward to continuing to enjoy our time together. I want to \nwish you and Caryll not only our thanks, thanks from the people I \nrepresent and thanks from America for your service, but the very best \nwishes for both of you in the future.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to return to \nCoburn amendment No. 3371.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about per capita \ndamage indicators and initiating a rule process update.\n  The State of Oklahoma, in the last 7 years, has had more declarations \nof disaster named than any other State in the country. The standard \nused to be if we had a disaster that overwhelmed the ability of the \nState to handle it. We have gotten away from that, and this hasn't been \nupdated since 1986. Under the Stafford Act of 1988, the whole purpose \nof our emergency response was for us to step in and provide assistance \nwhen State and local capabilities were overwhelmed. It is clear in New \nYork and New Jersey and in communities that were affected by this \nlatest storm that State and local capabilities were overwhelmed. It is \nclearly an appropriate time for the Federal Government, through the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, to step in and provide assistance.\n  Unfortunately, FEMA has been declaring an increasing number of \ndisasters over the past two decades, including for many storms and many \nevents where State and local capacities weren't overwhelmed. Let me \nmake that statement again.\n  Many of the disasters that have been declared were declared when \nState and local capabilities were not overwhelmed at all. So here we \nare, sitting with this tremendous debt, sitting with tremendous \ndeficits, and we are now applying a lower standard than what we should, \nin my mind. It is not just my opinion; the GAO has actually so decided. \nWe have a GAO report that says this ought to be modified.\n  If we go back in history and look at the Reagan administration, on \naverage they declared 28 events each year in the 1980s. Under the \ncurrent administration, we are averaging 140 disaster declarations a \nyear. My State, as I said, has had the most FEMA disaster \ndeclarations--25 in total.\n  So what I am offering isn't necessarily going to be beneficial for my \nState, but it makes great common sense for our country because if, in \nfact, they update the per capita effect, some of those declared \ndisasters in Oklahoma probably would not now be declared disasters.\n  Let me give an example. In 2011, we felt a little tremble in \nWashington from an earthquake. A disaster declaration was declared for \nVirginia after the earthquake that was felt in the Capitol. But this \nwasn't a disaster that overwhelmed local capabilities. It didn't \noverwhelm the capabilities of the regional capital area, and it didn't \noverwhelm the capabilities of Virginia. Yet we transferred what were \ntruly responsibilities of the State and local communities to the \nFederal Government.\n  So this per capita damage indicator ends up becoming very problematic \nfor two reasons: First, it was established in 1986 and FEMA has failed \nto update it; and, second, simply using a per capita damage indicator \nis an unfair way to assess whether a disaster has occurred.\n  Let me explain why. Suppose you have a small populated State versus a \nlarge populated State where you have a large concentration of people in \nan area. You would not ever attain it if you have a large population, \nwhereas if you have a small population, you will, with the exact same \nevent. So my question is, Should Oklahoma benefit on a per capita basis \nfrom the same event happening in Oklahoma as happens in Los Angeles, \nwhere we get declared an emergency and Los Angeles doesn't? That is \nwhat has happened, since we have not updated this per capita damage \nindicator. It is unfair for the larger, more populous States that we do \nit this way.\n  So all we are saying is we should take the GAO report and follow some \nof the recommendations. And what are those recommendations? FEMA should \nreview the per capita damage indicator and initiate a rulemaking to \nmodernize it. It would require the FEMA Administrator to update the per \ncapita damage indicator for all the years since 1996 by no later than \nJanuary 1, 2016. So we are going to give them over 3 years to update \nit.\n  Second, the amendment requires the FEMA Administrator to report to \nCongress on better and fairer ways to assess States' preparedness and \ncapabilities to respond to a disaster.\n  Finally, I would say this is a reasonable approach based on what \nGAO's analysis and recommendations were, which is to encourage FEMA to \nupdate its process for how it declares disasters so that we can \npreserve and focus more aid for disasters such as Sandy, which is in \nfront of us right now.\n  It is my belief that although this may divide some in this Chamber, \nthis is a smart thing for us to do for the country. It is a fair thing \nfor us to do for every State--to treat them all the same instead of \nadvantaging the smaller States, such as my State, and giving a \ndisadvantage to the larger States.\n  I would be happy to work with the chairman to modify this in a way \nthat would meet with his approval, but it is something that is sorely \nlacking. It is something that is causing us to intercede at times we \nshouldn't be and causing us to not intercede at times we should.\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senators \nfrom Alaska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts be \npermitted to proceed in a colloquy for a period of about 15 minutes, \nwith the understanding that at the end of it we will enter into a \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Fisheries\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I begin by saying very quickly there is an \namendment that has been brought forward to try to strike from an \nemergency assistance bill critical aid, aid that is, frankly, less than \nit ought to be in order to deal with the crisis of the fisheries not of \none State but of the entire New England region and of other regions of \nthe country--the Pacific, also, and other parts of the country that \nhave been hit.\n  The fact is that in Massachusetts we have 77,000 jobs, a billion-\ndollar industry that is a part of our culture and a part of our \nhistory. Fishing is vital to our State. We have local fishermen, we \nhave commercial fishermen, we have a sports fishing industry, and it is \na vital part of the commerce of our State and of the entire history of \nour Nation.\n  We have been hit in the last years by record levels of reduction in \nour fish stocks, and we have also been hit by Federal regulations that \nare trying desperately to hold on to those fish stocks for the long \nterm and for the future, which have, regrettably, reduced our fishing \neffort in certain fisheries by 50 to 80 percent.\n  We have fishermen who have their boats--just like a home--mortgaged. \nTheir homes, their families are entirely dependent on their ability to \nbring in revenue, but because of the regulations they are prevented \nfrom going out and doing that because of the reduction in the stock \nwhich is a God-given effect of nature--just like a drought in the \nWestern part of our country, just like a flood which we respond to, \njust like a fire, just like a storm.\n  Our fishermen are the farmers of the ocean, and they provide an \nunbelievable amount of food to the people of our country. We want to \npreserve that. If they are not going to fish for a few years, we want \nto know they can come back and fish sometime in the future, and that is \nwhat they want to do.\n  Just as we have tide people over in the past in our country--just as \nin Katrina we went and helped people and small businesses that had been \nwiped out temporarily to be able to come back--our fishing people \ndeserve emergency assistance to tide them over and help them through \nthis most critical time.\n  I would turn to the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nAlaska and I ask the Senator from New Hampshire what this means to the \nState of New Hampshire, if she might share with us.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. My friend from Massachusetts understands the challenges \nwe have in New Hampshire, as does Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island \nbecause, in fact, fishing is one of the oldest industries we have in \nNew England. In New Hampshire, it dates back over 400 years. Because we \nhave a much smaller coastline than Massachusetts and Rhode Island, we \nhave a smaller group of people who earn their living through fishing. \nThey have smaller boats, and therefore they are more affected by some \nof the fishing regulations and some of the adverse weather conditions \nthat have affected fishing.\n  About 90 percent of the fishing New Hampshire's fishermen do is for \ncod, and cod is the species that has been most affected by declining \nfish stocks. It is a huge issue for our small remaining fishing \nindustry. The fact that there is funding to help them in this bill is \nabsolutely critical because without this funding we are going to lose \nthat industry in New Hampshire. We have 5,000 jobs affected here, $106 \nmillion in income to the State of New Hampshire.\n  I think it is important to point out that this is a bipartisan \neffort. Last week we had a letter with 13 of our colleagues, including \nSenators Wicker, Murkowski, Collins, Snowe, and Brown, urging the \ncommittee to include this funding in the bill. It is there now. I \ncertainly hope we are going to see bipartisan support for keeping this \nfunding in the bill.\n  Let me just turn----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before my colleague does, if I could ask \nthe Senator from New Hampshire--I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Maryland be able to join us in this colloquy and extend it \nfor about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from New Hampshire wanted to turn to \nthe Senator from Alaska?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. We are from New England. Senator Mikulski is further \nsouth on the east coast. But this is a bicoastal problem because, as I \nknow Senator Begich will tell us, it is a huge issue for people in \nAlaska and for those on the west coast. They have the same problem.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I will tell you, in Alaska it is even magnified in a lot \nof ways. If you think of this country, three-quarters of the coastline \nis Alaska. Fishermen have been fishing there commercially not just for \na few hundred years but for 10,000 years of survival on our oceans.\n  When you think of the value in 76,000 jobs in Alaska directly and \nindirectly connected to the fishing industry, it is over $5 billion. It \ndoesn't matter in a commercial fishery--if you are in McDonald's having \na fish sandwich, the odds are that it comes from our fisheries. If you \nsit in the fanciest restaurants anywhere in the world, the odds are \nthat some of our fish is there.\n  As Senator Shaheen said, this is a bipartisan issue. The disasters \nthat are declared for fisheries in this bill have been declared \ndisasters. It is not some pie in the sky, some pork, or we sit around \nand say: Let's get some money for every State. These are actually \ndeclared disasters by the States and our Federal Government that need \nto be funded.\n  In our situation, it is even more dire--not just the economic impact \nI just laid out, but an elder told me one time that in urban cities, \nyou walk out the door and you go down the street to Safeway for your \nfood. In rural Alaska, you open your door, and what is in front of you? \nThe nature they see is the grocery store.\n  So when they have--in our case, the YK Delta, the Yukon-Kuskokwim \nDelta in the western part of Alaska, had a devastating king salmon \nfishery loss in terms of the quantity of the fish. So when that fish is \nnot able to be harvested, to be put into the storehouses for the \nwinter, then the limited cash that they have, in an area where fuel \ncost to heat their home is $8, $9, $12 a gallon, now has to go to not \nonly heating that they have already set that cash aside for, now they \nhave to get food shipped in. So their limited cash is now split between \nheating their home and putting food on the table.\n  Let me tell you, in Fairbanks, AK, which is urban, outside it was 40 \nbelow yesterday. So heating your home is not like just turning on your \nheater when you come home from work. It is a whole different ball game.\n  But most importantly, they live off the land. It is not some hobby \nthey do on the weekend. It is not a sports event. They harvest the \nfood. The Senator from Massachusetts said it best--we harvest the \nocean. We are no different from any farmer in the Midwest or anywhere \nelse. So when the YK Delta loses its king salmon, a critical piece of \ntheir food supply, it is real. It is not about: We will go fishing next \nyear. This is about: Do we have enough food on the table?\n  When I hear people on the other side and others who say this is a \nbunch of pork and a bunch of this and that, they need to come to \nAlaska. I would enjoy them coming right now in the winter at 40 below \nand seeing what people have to do.\n  To me, this is such a small amount to make such an impact not only to \nus but to all the coastal States that are\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nsuffering with this situation in our fishing industry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maryland, if I can--\nI know the Senator from Rhode Island wants to join in here, but the \nSenator from Alaska made a really important point that I think the \nSenator from Maryland can speak to very specifically; that is, this is \nnot some amount of money that got pulled out of the sky and was put in \nin the dead of night behind a closed door as some kind of backdoor \ndeal. This has been thoroughly vetted through the Commerce Department, \nthrough the fisheries, through the committees, through all of the \nregulators, through the White House. The White House has signed off on \nthis. This is a designated emergency. It has gone through the requests \nof the Governors. The Governors have had to submit their data. It has \nall been through the process.\n  I would ask the Senator from Maryland because she is responsible on \nthe Appropriations Committee for making these judgments--there is not a \nSenator here who would not agree that she does that with rigor and with \nstandards--I ask her what the meaning is, No. 1, to the State of \nMaryland, which has a fishing industry, and, No. 2, to the legitimate \nprocess of the Senate?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senators from New England, and I am happy \nto answer the question and join here with my fellow coastal Senators.\n  First, I would like to respond in my official responsibility in the \nSenate, which is to chair the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nScience. It is in that subcommittee that the NOAA--the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Agency--is funded. It is there that the fisheries money \nis spent. Any fishery disaster, in order to qualify for Federal \nassistance, must be certified by the Secretary of Commerce. Every \nsingle fisheries disaster in this bill has been certified by the \nSecretary of Commerce to meet compelling human need, economic \nnecessity, and be within the criteria established by law.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, well-intentioned, is asking us to violate \nthe law. He wants to make fisheries disasters under the Stafford Act. \nThe Stafford Act, named after the Senator from New Hampshire--a \nwonderful Republican--was for FEMA. If you think you have a FEMA \ndisaster, you go to the Governor. There has to be data collected. It \nhas to go to the President. If you think you have a fishery disaster--\nwhich we coastal Senators experience these days all too often--it has \nto go through the Secretary of Commerce.\n  I assure those of you on the floor, all those Senators, all taxpayers \nlistening, that every one of these fisheries disasters has been \ncertified, has been vetted to really say that in each and every State \nwhere we respond, it meets this criterion.\n  As to the money in the bill, in a $60 billion bill, this is $150 \nmillion. Listen to the jobs, listen to the economy, listen to people \nwho go out in really cold weather and put their hands in that icy \nwater, and they all risk their lives.\n  Everybody wants to go see the movie ``Triple Storm.'' We can't have a \ntriple storm here in the Senate, which is this amendment, rejection of \nthe urgent supplemental, and the inertia of the Senate.\n  I say to my colleagues, your words are well-spoken in defense of your \nState, but you are also exactly following the law.\n  I urge the Senator from Oklahoma to withdraw his amendment because it \nwould make it out of compliance.\n  I say to each and every one of you as a fellow coastal Senator, I \nknow our fishing industries--you call them fishermen, we call them \nwatermen--whether it is oysters, crab, or rockfish, it is part of our \neconomy and it is part of our identity. They asked for help.\n  I will oppose the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I actually \nwould ask him to withdraw it because it is not a matter of debating \npolicy, how to be a smarter and more frugal government, it is actually \nin violation of the current law.\n  I thank Senators for standing up for their own communities, and I \nhope this clarifies this bizarre situation.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for a minute?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Isn't it true that since 1994, Federal fishery failures \nhave been declared on 29 different occasions and that nearly $827 \nmillion in Federal funding has been appropriated for fishery disaster \nrelief?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, the Senator is exactly right. And it happened \nunder both Democratic and Republican Senates. So this has been declared \nunder President Bill Clinton, and we worked with his Secretaries of \nCommerce. This was done under George Bush, and Secretary Gutierrez, \nhimself from a coastal State of Florida--we worked very well together \nbecause the appropriators and the Governors and the economy people have \nto work together with Senators.\n  The answer is yes. Again, you cannot get fisheries disaster \nassistance unless it has been certified by the Secretary of Commerce in \ncompliance with the criteria in current law.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I just take 30 seconds, if I may?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Sure.\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to make it clear to my colleagues as we engage in \nthis colloquy--I asked at the beginning of it if one of my staff folks \nwould go check out some figures for me, and I just got them. I hope the \nSenator from Oklahoma is listening to this because from just 2004 to \n2011--7 years--the Federal Emergency Management Agency region 6, which \nincludes Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico--that is \n5 States--received 68 disaster declarations and almost $40 billion in \ndisaster assistance. For five States, $40 billion. We have more than \nfive States--many more here--asking for $150 million, as the Senator \nfrom Maryland has pointed out.\n  The distinction is so clear. I just say point-blank that this \nlegislation is not going to pass without the inclusion of this fishery \nmoney--point-blank and period. I think the Senator from Rhode Island \nwould agree with me.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would be delighted to agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts. On Rhode Island's behalf, our fisheries disaster, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland said, was declared by the Secretary \nof Commerce. This is not a maybe. This is not trying to sneak something \nin. This is a declaration of the U.S. Government. It was the New \nEngland multispecies groundfish fishery disaster that affected the \nState of Massachusetts. There was great leadership from Senator Kerry \non all of this, as it affected the State of New Hampshire, and great \nleadership from Senator Shaheen on all of this.\n  Governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New \nYork, and Connecticut all signed the request for that disaster \ndeclaration.\n  In Rhode Island's letter our congressional delegation--myself and my \nsenior Senator, Mr. Reed, Congressman Cicilline, and Congressman \nLangevin--wrote:\n\n       In addition to the direct impact on groundfish catch \n     limits, there will likely be indirect impacts on other \n     fisheries that these same permit holders, and many other \n     Rhode Island fisherman, also rely on.\n\n  To the point Senator Begich of Alaska made, economic disaster in the \nfishing industry cascades through the rest of our economy.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is not just the fishermen coming home with empty \nnets because the cod moved offshore, it is the fuel suppliers to their \nboats, the engine repair shops that take care of the mechanics, the net \nrepair and construction groups. So a whole economy stands on this. It \nis really inconceivable that a Senator from a State that has, as one of \na group of five, soaked up $40 billion of disaster assistance would now \nbegrudge us $150 million after this disaster was declared.\n  This is bipartisan. Let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the letter Senator Shaheen mentioned earlier as an exhibit \nfor the end of the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is signed by 35 Republicans and 9 Democrats. It \ncould not be more bipartisan. We are trying to deal with a real problem \nhere, and it is a recurring problem.\n  Our historic New England ground fiduciary is facing significant cuts \nin our catch limits because our populations are not rebounding the way \nthat scientists anticipated they would. Something out there is causing \nthis failure\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nto rebound and unprecedented environmental changes very related to the \nenvironmental changes that whip up giant storms like Sandy are at the \nheart of this.\n  One last quote, and then I will yield back to my colleagues who are \nengaged in this colloquy. Where we are is a big body of water called \nthe Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem which is tracked by NOAA, \nand it extends from the Gulf of Maine all the way down to Cape Hatteras \non our Atlantic coast.\n  Here is what NOAA reports:\n\n       During the first six months of 2012, sea surface \n     temperatures in the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem \n     were the highest ever recorded . . . above-average \n     temperatures were found in all parts of the ecosystem, from \n     the ocean bottom to the sea surface and across the region.\n\n  There is a real physical rationale and reason for the disaster that \nwe are seeking a remedy for in our home State industries that are being \nso grievously stricken.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, may I draw the distinction between a \nfishery disaster and an earmark? Because there is an undercurrent here \nfrom the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, who has said on many \noccasions that he has been the defendant of the taxpayer. Well, so am \nI. The difference between an earmark is a congressionally designated \nproject that meets the criteria that Senator deems appropriate to help \nhis State. That is not what this is. When he says it has to be \ncertified by the Stafford Act, he is implying that these are \nuncertified, unneeded, unwarranted, and are earmarks. Once again I will \nsay that these are certified by the Secretary of Commerce. They meet \nthe criteria for compelling economic and human need as required by law. \nThis is not an earmark, it is certified disaster assistance.\n  Let's get rid of this phony-baloney nonsense that somehow or another \nthat would undermine this bill of $150 million that could restore \nlivelihoods for people who are willing to work out there and risk their \nlives to feed America.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that our time is \njust about up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes under \nthe colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will take 1 minute of it. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland for that important distinction.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Oklahoma--and the other Senator \nfrom Oklahoma--that I think all of us have enormous respect for him and \nfor his intelligence and the way in which he seeks to protect taxpayers \nand cut pork and get rid of earmarks. We all respect that. There are \nlegitimate moments when it is appropriate to do that.\n  I think the Senator may have either not known or not been aware of \nall the details that have been laid out here, and I would plead with \nhim to take a look at the legitimacy of the law, the way in which this \nhas been set up, and hopefully withdraw his amendment.\n  Also, to all of our colleagues, I know we are struggling with the \nfiscal cliff and it is the holiday time. There are a lot of people \nhurting in America. In the wake of what happened in Newtown, CT--a \nmoment that sort of stops our country cold--where we all have to stop \nand think about what is and is not important and what our \nresponsibilities are, it is hard for me to grapple onto the notion that \nin a moment there could be a change in attitude where people could \nbegin to perhaps find a constructive way to work together. There are so \nmany people in so many places who are living by the law. They are \ndependent on this profession and want to stand up and return to it \nbecause it is part of their lifetime and will not get help on a Federal \nbasis the way we have helped people throughout our history.\n  I call on our colleagues to think hard about that as we think about \nthis amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield for a point of inquiry. It was my \nunderstanding that under the unanimous consent that I would get the \nfloor. I don't mind waiting for the time that they have requested, but \nI want to make sure I do get recognized after the conclusion of this \nfor such time as I shall consume under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I think the way we operate \nis that we need to have a time agreement, and we also have to have an \nagreement that at the conclusion of the Senator's remarks, we will go \nback into a quorum call.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I certainly agree to that. Keep in mind I have \nalready asked for unanimous consent not to proceed for more than 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Not to exceed for 20 minutes with the understanding that \nthe quorum call will go into effect at the end of the remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. We reserve our time, and I yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I will be brief because my friend from \nMassachusetts was eloquent in talking about the livelihood of people in \nour fishing industry who have been affected by the disaster, and as a \nresult there have been low species and low catch numbers because of \nregulations in an effort to bring back those fish.\n  I hope if we can support these disaster funds that as the Department \nof Commerce is allocating this funding, that they will do it with a \ncollaborative process that invites fishermen and fishing businesses to \nhave a say in that process. Given that their livelihoods have been \naffected, I think it is important for them to be part of the process of \nhow this funding is given out.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Let me conclude with my comments to say I agree \nespecially with the latter part regarding how to engage people on what \nthese resources will be. I want to commend the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Appropriations on the eloquent description of exactly \nhow this happened. I like earmarks as well, but this is not an earmark. \nThis is a process that has gone through step after step to ensure that \neveryone in my State--Republican Governor and a Republican and \nDemocratic delegation--has an important role here.\n  This takes nothing away from Superstorm Sandy. We recognize--all of \nus on this floor--how devastating that was, but this was also a \ndisaster of a different making. As a matter of fact, at the request of \nSenator Kerry--and as the chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries--I listened to the fishermen there about the many species \nthat are devastated and the quotas they are facing.\n  This is not only critical to be done now, it is also that the amount \nof money is so small and the impact is significant when we think about \nthe thousands of jobs that will be affected by this.\n  In my State it is truly about food and survival for the Alaskan \nNative community in the winter months with temperatures that are not \nzero or 10 above but 40 below.\n  I implore my colleagues on the other side to support this bipartisan \neffort and reject the amendment by Senator Coburn.\n  Again, I thank all of my colleagues for coming down here. This just \nshows one of the roles that we have as a legislative body. When \ndisasters are declared, we unify, no matter where we live, to figure \nout how to make sure the people of this country are taken care of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will close the colloquy by thanking Senator \nMikulski for her leadership, support, and her key role on the \nAppropriations Committee. I want to thank Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts for his leadership on the original disaster declarations \nthat brought us to this point. I want to thank Senator Shaheen of New \nHampshire for pulling this colloquy together. Thank you to Senator \nBegich for his advocacy on that other coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, & \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, \n         and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member Hutchison: We \n     are writing in support of including federal fisheries \n     disaster funding in any emergency supplemental appropriations \n     bill developed in response to Superstorm Sandy. Over the past \n     year, extreme weather and other natural events have wreaked \n     havoc on commercial and recreational fishermen in our states, \n     leading the Secretary of Commerce to declare federal \n     fisheries disasters. Despite these declarations and the \n     ongoing hardship, Congress has not yet appropriated funds.\n       As you know, the Secretary of Commerce is authorized to \n     declare federal fisheries disasters under Section 308(d) of \n     the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act and Section 315 of the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. \n     These designations allow Congress to appropriate federal \n     relief funds to alleviate the harm caused by natural \n     disasters to fisheries and the fishing industry. The disaster \n     assistance funds can be used to repair or restore fishing \n     equipment and infrastructure, compensate for losses, restore \n     fisheries habitat, support workforce education, provide low-\n     interest loans, and conduct monitoring and cooperative \n     research focused on improving stock assessments.\n       Currently, federal fisheries disasters have been declared \n     in nine states in response to four different events:\n       Superstorm Sandy--On November 16, 2012, a federal fisheries \n     disaster was declared for New Jersey and New York due to the \n     damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. The high winds and storm \n     surge devastated marinas, destroyed fishing vessels, and \n     resulted in severe economic losses for both commercial and \n     recreational fishermen.\n       Northeast Multispecies (Groundfish) Fishery--On September \n     13, 2012, a federal fisheries disaster was declared for Rhode \n     Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and \n     Connecticut. The projected reductions in the total allowable \n     catch for certain critical groundfish stocks will have a \n     significant impact on many of the same coastal communities \n     that were hit by Sandy. Despite strict adherence to new and \n     rigorous management practices by fishermen, key fish stocks \n     have not returned. Slow recovery and declining fish stocks \n     will continue to have a negative impact on commercial \n     fishing, harming local communities and economies.\n       Alaska Chinook--On September 12, 2012, a federal fisheries \n     disaster was declared for Alaska Chinook salmon fisheries in \n     the Yukon River, Kuskokwim River, and Cook Inlet. Thousands \n     of Alaskans have been impacted including commercial \n     fishermen, sport fishermen, and subsistence-based residents. \n     Beyond direct impacts, indirect impacts have been felt by \n     communities through reduced tax revenue, reduced work for \n     processor employees, and reduced income for fishery dependent \n     businesses.\n       Mississippi Oyster and Blue Crab--On September 12, 2012, a \n     federal fisheries disaster was declared for commercial oyster \n     and blue crab fisheries in Mississippi. Historic flooding of \n     the lower Mississippi River required opening of the Bonnet \n     Cane Spillway on May 9, 2011. This action released \n     substantial amounts of freshwater into the Mississippi Sound, \n     impacting the entire ecosystem. Mississippi's oyster and blue \n     crab fisheries were extensively damaged, resulting in severe \n     economic hardship for commercial fishermen still recovering \n     from the devastating impacts of Hurricane Katrina and the BP \n     oil spill.\n       Fishing is an integral part of our states' economies and \n     cultures. These disasters have devastated fishing families \n     and coastal communities and there is an urgent need to \n     provide federal assistance. We urge you to move swiftly to \n     appropriate funds for these federal fisheries disaster \n     declarations.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank R. Lautenberg,\n         SusanM. Collins,\n         Robert Menendez,\n         Lisa Murkowski,\n         Jack Reed,\n         Roger F. Wicker,\n         Charles E. Schumer,\n         John F. Kerry,\n         Mark Begich,\n         Kirsten E. Gillibrand,\n         Scott Brown,\n         Jeane Shaheen,\n         Sheldon Whitehouse,\n         Olympia J. Snowe.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to expand my remarks from my \noriginal intent because of what I have been listening to on the floor. \nI really reserved this time to talk about two very significant things \nthat happened.\n  In fact, 53 years ago in 1959--and I have to ask the question as it \ngets closer and closer to Christmas: Why are we here? There is always a \nlot of theater right before Christmastime. The things we are talking \nabout now could well be taken care of afterward. It could be done after \nwe have a chance to look and assess the damages of Sandy.\n  As far as the fiscal cliff is concerned, this is something that we \nhave known about for a long time. Right now it seems that in this \nbody--and the other body down the hall in the House--that they don't \nwant to do anything until it gets close to Christmas, that somehow \npeople are at home watching, and sitting with bated breath and \nwondering what wisdom we are going to extol. I don't know if that is \ntrue in other States, but I know that it is not true in Oklahoma. I \ntold them this was going to happen. I told them before the election in \nOctober. I introduced a bill, S. 3473. I introduced that bill because I \nknew what was going to happen.\n  What we have been talking about here in the last few minutes during \nthe colloquy that I came in and caught the last part of is this Sandy \nissue. This is always interesting. When a disaster occurs in America \nand emotions are high, everybody all of a sudden wants to pour money on \nit, and in this case it will be $60.4 billion. How did they come up \nwith $60.4 billion? I don't know because I wasn't in on that.\n  I come from Oklahoma. We have disasters all the time. We have our \ntornadoes that are very serious, and of course we take care of the \nproblems when they come up. We do get some Federal help, but \nnonetheless we analyze what the damages are and what was caused by the \nparticular disaster. We don't just use that to open the door and have \nsomething in there for everybody, and that is what is happening now. \nThey are asking for $60 billion, and there is something for everyone in \nit. That is what we are talking about today.\n  Again, we should not be talking about it right before Christmas and \nuse this as an excuse to take this right up to Christmas. Right now we \ndon't have time to get all the way through this and analyze the actual \nlosses that were attributed to Sandy. It was a disaster, and I \nunderstand that. People lost their lives and their property. \nNonetheless, we don't know, and we are guessing right now.\n  Some say: Well, how about $60.4 billion? That sounds good. It could \nbe $70 billion, it could be $80 billion, or it could be $30 billion. \nThe Heritage Foundation did an analysis of the damages of Sandy. We \ntalked about the $60.4 billion, which is the amount directly attributed \nto Sandy. We should get the study before it is criticized. The Heritage \nFoundation did the study, and it is actually $12.8 billion. That \nrepresents the amount that individuals lost as a direct result of this \ndisaster called Sandy that tragically hit our east coast.\n  Now what about the other $47.6 billion? As an example, they have $28 \nbillion in there for future disasters. Oh, wait a minute. We are \nsupposed to be addressing a disaster that just occurred. The $28 \nbillion is for future disasters. Here is a good one. There is 3.5 for \nglobal warming. They always have to get global warming in there. That \nis kind of interesting because we actually had several debates and \nseveral pieces of legislation called cap-and-trade. We took it up \nbefore this body and we defeated it. I am talking about going back 12 \nyears ago. The last one was the House bill, and that was called Waxman-\nMarkey. It was defeated because people realized that cap-and-trade \nwould be the largest tax increase in the history of America, somewhere \nbetween $300 and $400 billion a year. That equates to about $3,000 for \neach family in my State of Oklahoma who files a Federal income tax \nreturn. So people realize that is true. Yet at the same time, the \nAdministrator, appointed by President Obama, Lisa Jackson, when asked \nthe question, If you were to pass any bill here for cap and trade in \nOklahoma, would this reduce CO2 worldwide, said: No. That is \nbecause the problem is not here; the problem is in countries such as \nChina, India, Mexico, and other places.\n\n  Nonetheless, how many people in this body even know what this \nPresident has done through his executive powers? He has spent $68.4 \nbillion on global warming initiatives in the 4 years he has been \nPresident and that is without any authority from this body.\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\n  Here is another one: $150 million. I was listening to my good friend \nSenator Begich from Alaska--and I have a great deal of respect for him. \nHe and I have worked on legislation together such as the pilots' bill \nof rights legislation. Nonetheless, fisheries in Alaska were \nsignificant, but they were not on the east coast. This didn't happen--\nthe last time I looked at a map, it was on the west coast, not the east \ncoast, so it should not be in here.\n  Then we go on to the fiscal cliff. We are all here talking about this \nfiscal cliff that is here and all of a sudden we have to do something \nabout it. How many people realize that we knew this was coming a long \ntime ago? I mentioned my bill, which is S. 3473, that showed we don't \nhave to raise $1.4 trillion, we can raise $2.7 trillion without any \ncuts to the military, and it is all right there. Look it up: S. 3473. \nNow, months later, right before Christmas, we come here and say, Oh, \ntrauma has set in; it is going to be a disaster, so we have to come up \nwith $1.4 trillion.\n  How many people realize that this President--and this is not the \nDemocrats, not the Republicans, not the House, not the Senate--it was \nthe President of the United States, in his budget--there were four \nbudgets he had in his 4 years. He had over $1 trillion of deficit in \neach budget. If we add up all of his deficits--this is what the \nPresident gave us now. Again, it was not the Democrats or Republicans, \nHouse or Senate; this was his budget that he drafted and signed, with \n$5.3 trillion of deficit in it--that is more deficit than all budgets \nof all Presidents combined since George Washington--and nobody cares. \nWe say this and people shake their heads and they don't seem to care. \nHe said it so it must be all right.\n  So now after this President has given us $5.3 trillion of deficit, \nnow all of a sudden--he did that in 4 years, but in 10 years we can't \neven come up with $1.4 trillion. It is easy. We could do it. I did it \nin a bill introduced several months ago. We knew it was coming, but \nChristmas is coming too so we are all lined up to grandstand--I don't \nmean grandstand; that sounds demeaning. I don't mean it that way.\n  When we think about the money this President has spent--what about \nthe $800 billion stimulus that didn't stimulate? How many people in \nAmerica--how many Members of this body--know what that $800 billion was \nspent for? I suggest not very many. I do, because I made a point to \nlook. There are things that it did not stimulate. Only 3 percent of it \nwent to roads and highways and that type of thing. But, again, he came \nup with in one fell swoop $800 billion, and now we wonder--that was in \nthe first couple of months and now in 10 years, how can we come up with \nthis much more? So, anyway, I just wanted to say that.\n  While we are talking about the budget, I think it is appropriate to \nsay something else about it, because it was in the budget that was part \nof disarming America. I can remember going over to Afghanistan after \nthe President's first budget because I knew he was cutting the military \nand I knew if I were over there responding with the tanks going back \nand forth that it would get people's attention, and it did. In that \nfirst budget he did away with the only fifth-generation fighter, the F-\n22; he did away with our lift capacity, the C-17; did away with our \nfuture combat system, did away with the ground-based interceptor in \nPoland; all of these things in one budget. That is what took place.\n  Jon Kyl is retiring, and I noticed that when he made his going-away \nspeech today he talked about the disasters we are facing right now. We \nare talking here about weather disasters. What about nuclear disasters? \nWhat about the fact that we had the New START Treaty, which I opposed, \nbut nonetheless, that put levels on both Russia and ourselves. In terms \nof our nuclear stockpile, which was supposed to go down equally to \n1,550 warheads, it is now down, and they are talking about doing away \nwith them altogether. It is another subject for another time, but I \nwill spend some time talking about it later.\n  Anyway, as we started, I mentioned two significant things happened in \n1959. One was--and we are all revering now Danny Inouye. Senator Inouye \nis different than most other Senators. I remember when my daughter \nKatie was much younger and she said, My two favorite U.S. Senators--I \nthought I was going to be one of them--my two favorite ones are Senator \nInouye and Senator Jesse Helms. They are such kind, older guys. She \nwanted to know if they ever got angry at anything. No, they didn't. As \na conservative Republican I have gone to him many times for favors, \nreally, to ask if we could get something done, and he never turned me \ndown during that time. I had a long visit yesterday with his son and \ntold him what we feel about Danny Inouye and how much we are going to \nmiss him. So that happened in 1959. That was when he was first elected \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  The other thing that is significant that happened in 1959, 53 years \nago today, is I was married. So this is my 53rd wedding anniversary, \nand it happened we were married in 1959. In fact, she is watching now. \nShe hardly ever does, but I called and said watch because I can't be \nthere for our anniversary so I have to do it this way, and so she is. \nToday is only the second time in 53 years that we haven't been together \non our anniversary.\n  But I would ask the question: Who will be there today? That is who \nwill be there today, our 20 kids and grandkids. Look at them all. Isn't \nthat neat? Yes, they are going to be there, but I am not, but she won't \nbe alone. Isn't that significant? All of that happened and it started \nwith just us, right there, and there they are. A person might look and \nsee that one little girl is a little bit different than the rest of \nthem. That is the little girl right here. We call her Zegita Marie. \nThere she is. We found her 12 years ago, only 2 days old. She was a \ncute little girl and she was just near death in an orphanage in \nEthiopia and we went back there and got her nursed back to health. My \ndaughter Molly, who had nothing but boys, adopted her.\n  I want to say to my wife who is listening right now, even though I \nwon't be home, 3 days from now on the 22nd--that is Saturday--I want \nyou to watch the ``Mike Huckabee Show'' because she is going to be \ninterviewed and talking about adoption.\n  Senator Landrieu and I head the adoption caucus in the U.S. Senate. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of little kids out there and people who \nwant to adopt little kids, and they can't do it because of the \nproblems. This little girl wouldn't even be alive today and here she is \nnow, 11\\1/2\\, almost 12 years old, reading at college level and doing \nwonderful things. So, Kay, be sure to tune in to Mike Huckabee and \nwatch her being interviewed 3 days from now.\n  The last thing I will say is that this is bad enough not to be home \nduring our anniversary, but it is also bad as we get closer to \nChristmas. If you can only see the celebration that is going on right \nnow, all those kids. They are all there and they are participating.\n  I remember what happened in the year 2009. In 2009, we played the \nsame game here: You know, we were here doing a little theater, making \nsure everybody knew we were working, and we didn't get out until the \nafternoon, just about noon, on Christmas Eve. I remember that was the \nworst snowstorm in the history of northern Texas and of Oklahoma. Where \nis global warming when you need it? It was terrible. I got to DFW and I \nwanted to go on to Tulsa. I was in a hurry to get there because Kay and \nI belong to a church in Tulsa where we were married, all of our kids \nwere married there, and my wife was even baptized there, and every \nChristmas Eve they have the most beautiful setting and three of my \ngrandkids were going to be singing in that and I never missed it in 50 \nyears. We got to Dallas; they weren't going to take off. I pleaded with \nthem. They took off, the only plane that took off from DFW, and went to \nTulsa that day. We went through 6-foot drifts, if my colleagues can \nbelieve it, to get down there to see my little grandkids singing. Well, \nthat is not going to happen this time, because I will be back there.\n  I would say this to my wife. We have had kind of a tradition for 53 \nyears now: I always get Kay roses. She loves roses. So I am not there \ntoday, but I want to say to Kay that if you will go out in our front \nyard now and look under the giant oak tree that you and I planted over \n50 years ago, your roses are there.\n  Finally, I want to say two more things. One is I want to assure Kay \nthat I love her more today than I did 50\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nyears ago; and secondly, I am not Bing Crosby, but I am going to say--\nand all the people in Oklahoma understand this--there may be 99 \nSenators here playing their games on Christmas, but as Bing said, I'll \nbe home for Christmas and you can be sure of that. You can count on it.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Senator Reed and I want to speak \nbriefly, and unless the leader has arrived, we will return the Senate \nto a quorum call at the conclusion of the remarks by Senator Reed and \nmyself. And it is gratifying that the Senator from Pennsylvania is \npresiding.\n  Yesterday, I requested that the cloakroom hotline Senator Casey's \nChildren's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Support Reauthorization \nAct, S. 958, with an amendment important to Rhode Island and to the \ncountry regarding growing our mental health care pediatric workforce.\n  My amendment would make resources available to increase the number of \nresidents trained in child and adolescent psychiatry. Senator Casey's--\nthe Presiding Officer's--bill and my amendment have the unanimous \nsupport of my caucus and I believe have very broad support in the \nRepublican caucus as well. Unfortunately, there has been an objection \nto my unanimous consent request, so I am very disappointed that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are not able to clear this \nparticular bill. I am also disappointed that none of the Republicans \nwho object to this measure have approached me or my staff with their \nconcerns--none of them. If it is just one, then he or she has not. If \nit is more than one, none of them have.\n  I was prepared to come to the floor today and make a live unanimous \nconsent request to find out exactly where the objections to this \namendment lie. But, instead, I will urge my Republican colleagues to \nwork with me and with Senator Casey of Pennsylvania to reach consensus \non this important measure.\n  The CHGME program should be reauthorized. Since its enactment in \n1999, the program has helped address the need for more pediatric \nspecialists. But there is a gap in the field of child and adolescent \npsychiatry.\n  The American Psychiatric Association concluded this year that \n``targeted efforts must be made to encourage medical training and \nresidency in the subspecialties of child and adolescent psychiatry. . . \n. ''\n  I gather my time is very brief, so I am going to yield to Senator \nReed very shortly, but I do want to thank Senator Casey and Senator \nIsakson for their patience and their hard work.\n  The amendment I have proposed and Senator Reed of Rhode Island has \nproposed is an amendment that does not add any additional spending. It \nstays within the existing budgetary limit. It confines the amount \navailable for child and adolescent psychiatry to less than 1 percent of \nthe total. I believe it is a very sensible measure, particularly in the \nwake of the tragedy in Newtown, CT. The idea that there is not room for \nfurther attention to child mental health and psychiatry and adolescent \nmental health and psychiatry seems to me to be an unfortunate outcome.\n  Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island would be a beneficiary of this. They \nare a particularly good hospital in a great number of settings.\n  As I said, I know time is short, so I will yield the remaining \nmoments of our time to Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Whitehouse in \ncommending the Presiding Officer for his underlying legislation, along \nwith Senator Isakson, and commend my colleague and friend, Senator \nWhitehouse, for his leadership on this issue, and begin where he left \noff, which is, in the wake of the unfathomable tragedy in Newtown, CT, \nthe idea that we do not need more trained child psychiatrists and child \ncounselors is difficult to understand. We do need them.\n  The legislation the Senator from Pennsylvania has introduced would \nhelp children's hospitals across the Nation and we are strongly behind \nit. But we also want to make help available to children's psychiatric \nhospitals, such as Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island.\n  One of the facts that emerged from the terrible tragedy in Newtown is \nthat we have young people who need help, desperately need help, and \ntheir parents need help--help to recognize problems, help to not only \ndiagnose them but treat them, and we do not have a sufficient number of \ntrained child psychiatrists in the country to do that.\n  This legislation, this amendment, would allow us to do that. It adds \nno cost, as Senator Whitehouse indicated, and I think it should be \nsomething that we would do almost automatically when it comes to the \nwelfare of our children, but particularly in the wake of the terrible \ntragedy in Connecticut.\n  So I wanted to be here to lend my support to the underlying efforts \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania and to the specific efforts of my \ncolleague, the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Dr. \nGregory Fritz, who is the academic director of the residency program at \nBradley Hospital, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Parity for Kids' Mental Health\n\n       Despite the passage of the federal mental-health parity \n     bill, stigma and prejudice are still alive and well when it \n     comes to legislation affecting children's psychiatric \n     hospitals. The latest example of how our government continues \n     to maintain discriminatory funding policies specifically \n     directed against children with mental-health issues involves \n     federal support for graduate medical education (GME).\n       Although this issue is far overshadowed by the federal debt \n     issue, those who care about the mental health of children \n     need to be aware that achieving true parity still entails \n     overcoming significant obstacles. Getting children's \n     psychiatric hospitals recognized as legitimate sites of \n     medical education is one such obstacle on the road to real \n     parity that has both symbolic and pragmatic importance.\n       The history of federal support for training physicians \n     during their hospital residencies goes back to the \n     establishment of Medicare, in 1965. Recognizing that America \n     needs a steady supply of physicians in all the areas of \n     medicine, and that their training carries substantial \n     additional expense for teaching hospitals, Medicare \n     authorization includes a per-resident reimbursement that is \n     provided to hospitals through a complicated formula. One \n     element for determining GME payments is the percentage of a \n     hospital's reimbursement that comes from Medicare. That \n     children's hospitals would thus be excluded from the program \n     (because Medicare pays virtually zero for children's medical \n     care) was unintentional, but it took 34 years for this \n     oversight to be corrected.\n       The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment \n     Program (CHGME), in 1999, established a pool to provide \n     residency education support to children's hospitals in a \n     system modeled after the Medicare GME system. The \n     unintentional disincentive to train pediatric generalists and \n     specialists was removed and pediatric training accelerated \n     dramatically. This year, a total of $317.5 million offsets \n     the training expenses of 5,500 residents at 46 children's \n     hospitals, and the CHGME program is widely considered a \n     success.\n       Parallel to the initial oversight in the Medicare bill, in \n     the arcane definition of a children's hospital detailed in \n     the CHGME regulations is language making it impossible for \n     children's psychiatric hospitals to qualify. Only the most \n     cynical observer would conclude that this was a deliberate \n     attempt to exclude children's psychiatric hospitals and the \n     child psychiatric and pediatric residents they train, \n     especially since no medical specialty represents a greater \n     shortage area than child and adolescent psychiatry. Yet, \n     steady efforts since 2002 to correct this oversight have thus \n     far been unsuccessful.\n       The CHGME reauthorization needed for the program to \n     continue would seem to offer the ideal opportunity to end \n     this de facto discrimination against children with mental-\n     health problems. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Representatives \n     David Cicilline and James Langevin, all Rhode Island \n     Democrats, have offered similar versions of a brief amendment \n     to the reauthorization that would correct the language to \n     reflect the original bill's intent.\n       If passed, it would admit four or five children's \n     psychiatric hospitals that meet strict criteria into the pool \n     of hospitals eligible for CHGME reimbursement. A larger \n     taxpayer outlay is not requested; rather, the existing money \n     would be spread slightly more thinly (an estimated 30 \n     additional residents would be added to the current 5,500). \n     One would think it a small price to pay to correct an \n     injustice, but passage is far from guaranteed.\n       As a child psychiatrist working at Bradley Hospital, one of \n     the psychiatric hospitals that would finally be included, I'm \n     far from dispassionate about this issue. I see every\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n     day the agony experienced by families with autism, childhood \n     suicide, adolescent substance abuse or pediatric bipolar \n     disorder; it's different, but no less severe, than the pain \n     associated with juvenile diabetes or leukemia. As are all \n     mental-health professionals, I'm troubled by the months-long \n     waiting lists that prevent children's access to child \n     psychiatric services.\n       The distinction between psychological and physiological \n     disorders is artificial and antiquated, reflecting outdated \n     fears and prejudices. In short, I see no valid reason to \n     perpetuate the exclusion of children's psychiatric hospitals \n     from the mechanism designed to support physicians' training. \n     Neither do the thousands of members of 39 national \n     organizations who have signed on to a letter urging support \n     of the Whitehouse amendment. Mental-health parity is the law \n     in principle; the CHGME reauthorization should make it be the \n     case in practice.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have a comment on an additional issue but \nwould only do so if the Senator from Rhode Island would allow.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me yield back to my senior Senator \nto move to his other issue. But let me also say what a pleasure and a \nprivilege it has been to work with him in our shared determination to \nsee that this amendment is made--this very reasonable amendment that \nwill add no additional spending and will expand the reach of adolescent \nand child psychiatry in this country. He has been terrific to work \nwith. It is always a pleasure and privilege to have Senator Reed as my \nsenior Senator, but this has been a particularly good occasion of \nworking together.\n  With that, I yield back to my senior Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to touch on a topic that was \ndiscussed by many of my colleagues, including Senator Whitehouse; and \nthat is the fisheries disaster in the Northeast, which was declared by \nthe Secretary of Commerce in 2012. There is language and support in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill to help our fishing industry in the \nNortheast that has been affected by this disaster in the areas of New \nYork, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.\n  These fishermen have been for years under a painful regime of \nrestricted fishing so that the stock could be replenished. Despite \ntheir efforts, some of the fishing stock has not responded, leading to \na declaration of a fisheries disaster by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  The funding that is included in the supplemental applies to New \nEngland, but it also helps Alaska and Mississippi. I appreciate very \nmuch the fact that Senator Mikulski is working to include this funding \nin the bill. She is an extraordinary leader in our Senate, an \nextraordinary and compassionate leader when it comes to issues \naffecting the fishing industry, not just in her home area of the \nChesapeake Bay and the Atlantic but as far away as Alaska and Rhode \nIsland and Maine. I would hope we could move to help these fishermen \nget on with their lives with this assistance.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Danny K. Inouye\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. When 7-year-old Danny Inouye saw the Japanese planes over \nhis Hawaii home on December 7, 1941, his first impulse was to help. So \nhe ran to help. He had emergency medical training. He used that \ntraining to help bind the wounds of the Americans injured in the attack \non Pearl Harbor.\n  His second impulse, just as strong, was to defend our country. But \nthe America of 1941 did not want his service. In fact, it considered \nDanny and his fellow Japanese Americans suspect and called them enemy \naliens and confined more than 100,000 of them to internment camps. When \nDanny Inouye tried to enlist to defend his country, his country told \nhim: You are not welcome.\n  That Danny Inouye did not allow anger and resentment to overcome his \nlove of country says something remarkable about him and about our \ncountry. When in 1943 President Roosevelt allowed Japanese Americans to \nenlist in the fight against Nazi Germany, Inouye and thousands of young \nmen answered the call. He burned with desire to defend the Nation that \nhad told him and people of his background: You may not serve; a nation \nthat still held thousands of Japanese Americans behind barbed-wire \nfences.\n  When he left Hawaii for the Army, his father told him: This country \nhas been good to us. Whatever you do, do not dishonor this country. \nDanny, on more than one occasion, told stories about his Army training \nin Mississippi, about the racial segregation he saw. He told the story \nof how after he returned from World War II he stopped in California on \nthe way home to Hawaii to stop to get a haircut and was told: We don't \nserve Japs here.\n  He stood there in full dress uniform, his chest covered in medals, a \nhook in place of the arm blown apart by a German rifle grenade. Even \nthen he had to confront hatred. There is so much that is remarkable \nabout the life of Dan Inouye, the story of his service on the \nbattlefields of Italy is indeed remarkable, physical courage he \ndisplayed in winning the Medal of Honor is alone enough to earn the \ntitle ``hero.''\n  But rising above his physical courage and the guts he showed is the \nmoral courage it took for Dan Inouye and his fellow Japanese Americans \nto even set foot on that battlefield. What is it that spurs some of our \ncountrymen to offer their lives in defense of a country that shuns \nthem? Where does that love of country come from? How can we impart some \nof it to those who too often take this country for granted?\n  It would be a wonderful tribute to Dan Inouye to seek out ways to \nencourage such service by future generations. Dan Inouye's work did not \nend when he took off his soldier's uniform. In many ways, it was just \nbeginning. Forced by the loss of his arm to give up dreams of a medical \ncareer, he entered politics. His was one of the most remarkable careers \nin public service our country has ever seen. We will miss Dan Inouye so \nmuch in the Senate, his leadership, his legislative talent, yes, but \nalso his friendship, his humor, his humility, his steadfast belief in \nthe American people. He was the last remaining Senator who voted for \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. In that vote and so many others, he \nserved the Nation and the Senate with distinction that few have ever \nmatched.\n  In Michigan we proudly claim an early connection to this noble man. \nMuch of his recovery from the wounds he suffered in Italy took place at \na veteran's hospital in Battle Creek, MI. There he met two other young \nmen, a soldier from Kansas named Bob Dole and one from Michigan named \nPhil Hart. They formed a lifelong bond, one that endured all the way to \nthe Senate.\n  In 2003, when we dedicated that former hospital in Battle Creek, now \na Federal office facility, as the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, \nSenator Inouye told the audience: All of us have chapters in our lives, \nmilestones. My most important chapter, he said, was a Battle Creek \nchapter. This is where I learned what democracy was all about, where I \nlearned what America was all about.\n  To have imparted any lessons on America to Dan Inouye would be a \nremarkable honor. What we may have taught him pales in comparison to \nwhat he taught us.\n  A few years ago, in a speech honoring his fellow Japanese-American \nveterans, Danny told his audience that our greatness as a nation lies \nin part in our willingness to recognize the flaws in our past, \nincluding our treatment of Japanese Americans and our determination in \nwhatever limited way we could to make amends. Dan Inouye served his \ncountry because of his dream of what we could be: a nation unbound by \nour all too human failings.\n  He believed to his core that we are able to shed old prejudices. He \nbelieved that our Nation, despite its flaws, shines with such bright \npromise that we could inspire remarkable service and sacrifice, even in \nthose who suffer from our shortcomings, a nation so great that those we \ntreat with disdain or even hatred can respond with love that knows no \nlimit. This love was as powerful as the love that Dan Inouye showed for \nall Americans and for the very idea of America.\n  I am so grateful for the lessons that Danny taught me, so grateful \nfor his friendship. Barb and I send our deepest condolences to Irene \nand all of Danny's\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nfamily, to the people of Hawaii, and to all of those touched by this \nremarkable man.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. Our former colleague, now Secretary of the \nInterior Ken Salazar has written a letter in memory of our departed \ncolleague Dan Inouye. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                    Washington, December 18, 2012.\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: Senator Danny Inouye was and will \n     continue to be one of my lifetime heroes. In December 2008, \n     when the President, you and I were in discussions about my \n     potential service as United States Secretary of the Interior, \n     Senator Inouye said the following to me:\n       ``The Secretary of the Interior is the most important \n     position in the Cabinet because you are the Custodian of \n     America's Natural Resources and America's Heritage.''\n       Senator Inouye's description of the Department was a major \n     factor in my decision to accept the President's offer to \n     serve as Secretary of the Interior. I have adopted his \n     description of the job of Secretary as my motto and as the \n     best description of the Department of the Interior.\n       Like you, I will forever miss Senator Inouye. He has served \n     and continues to serve as a mentor and inspiration to me in \n     all of my days in public service. I know his life and his \n     teachings will continue to live through each of us as he \n     continues to inspire our journey forward.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                                  Ken Salazar,\n\n                                   U.S. Secretary of the Interior,\n                                              former U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr President, I have not yet filed, but I intend to \nshortly, an alternative amendment to the emergency supplemental which \nis on the Senate floor and in the process of being debated. I would \nlike to explain what it is that I am going to file and what it does and \nexplain the rationale behind it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my understanding that the Senator is not going to \nseek action on it now, it is simply to file it?\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  We have shared this colloquy on two different occasions. I thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Vermont is correct. I don't intend to \ntake any action on this now. I know there are events planned tonight. \nWe are in the middle of mourning for our lost colleague as well. But I \nsimply wanted to explain for the record what it is that we are \nattempting to do.\n  I think all of us are sensitive to the pain and the damage incurred \nby those in the Northeast due to the catastrophic, clearly catastrophic \nrecord proportion hurricane that hit that sector of our country just \nweeks ago. Clearly, that is something that falls in the category of an \nemergency. It goes beyond the ability of State and local jurisdictions \nto address with their own resources. They will participate in the \nrecovery, and they have. It is remarkable, in this country virtually no \nState, no Senator, can stand and simply say, well, we haven't been \ntouched and not understand the need for the response that comes from \ndisasters, whether they be tornadoes like occurred in my State of \nIndiana just this past spring--we needed emergency help and response \nand received that--or whether it is flooding that has occurred \nthroughout the Midwest and in other parts of the country that has \ncaused a tremendous amount of damage.\n  There have been terrorist attacks such as 9/11, Oklahoma City. In \nthis case, hurricanes, and we have had a number of those. Katrina \nstands in our mind, Irene, and on and on it goes with Sandy being the \nlatest. This one was truly of a monumental proportion and created a lot \nof damage.\n  Therefore, a Federal response is needed and necessary if we are going \nto begin to have an adequate recovery, get people back to work and back \nin their homes, businesses up and growing again and working.\n  The bill that is currently on the Senate floor for us attempts to do \nthat. Some of us were somewhat staggered by the initial number, $60.4 \nbillion. That may not be enough; that may be too much. But in the short \namount of time that we have had to try to put all the estimates \ntogether in terms of what might be needed, what we as Senate \nAppropriations Republicans have attempted to do is to separate that \nfrom what we believe is immediately needed--immediate being from the \ntime of the storm through March 27--to attend to those initial \nresponses that need to take place. There were a whole raft of things \nthat run the gamut from debris cleanup to repairing damaged and flooded \nfacilities, destroyed homes, public facilities, and so forth. But we \nneed to try to go through and separate the immediate and make sure that \nmeasure of support as quickly and as expeditiously as possible is \nbrought to the area to address the problem and distinguish them from \nthose longer term projects and interests that have been proposed.\n  When our committee met, it was, I think, up to 10 Senators from the \naffected States testifying. We heard a number of suggestions about the \nnumber of things that ought to be incorporated into this legislation. \nMitigation was one major issue. Mitigation simply is preparing for the \nnext storm so we can mitigate or lessen the damage that occurred from \nthe storm that we just incurred. But mitigation is a long-term project. \nIt is not something that can be immediately entered into.\n  Interestingly enough, on the proposals that were presented before the \ncommittee, many were contradictory. Some thought that burying wires \nunderground would prevent, obviously, tree limbs from taking them down \nand losing power on above-ground wiring. In a city like Manhattan, \nBoston, or a major metropolitan area or in any city, it is an \nenormously expensive project.\n  While that seemed initially to meet some success, then one of the \nexperts who was testifying said, well, wait a minute. The flooding that \noccurs with this would go in and would corrode the piping and corrode a \nlot of the systems and the switches, and that might not be the best \nthing to do. I don't know whether that is better to do or not better to \ndo, but it is certainly something that needs to be examined carefully \nand vetted before we commit to that type of project.\n  Others said we should rebuild the sand dunes and sand islands \noffshore to provide barriers. There was the piece, I think it was in \nthe New York Times, that basically said this has shown some real \npromise in terms of protecting areas by having sand barriers off coast.\n  Other experts came in and said, well, yes, sometimes that works and \nsometimes it doesn't work, and you need to be careful how and where you \nbuild these. It is not the panacea, it is not the be-all and end-all of \nhow you prevent this type of damage, but it clearly is something that \nwe ought to look at, clearly something we ought to examine. But making \na decision now in the weeks' aftermath of the storm, just days from \nadjournment, and saying this is why we need $13 billion toward \nmitigation projects--without vetting those projects, without examining \nthose, having experts look at it and tell us what they think would \nwork, how much it would cost, setting the priorities of what ought to \nbe first, what ought to be done and what, perhaps, might not work and \nbe postponed--all of that requires a process.\n  If we are going to be responsible with the taxpayers' dollars at a \ntime of this fiscal crisis, and particularly now, it seems to me the \nmost logical and responsible way to move forward is to identify the \nimmediate needs and provide the immediate funding to address those \nneeds.\n  Secondly, on those needs that are longer term, go through the \nprocess. That is why we have committees. That is why we have procedures \nin place, to identify how best to move forward and spend the taxpayer \ndollars in a useful way that doesn't turn out to be a waste\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nof money and deny us the opportunities to do the mitigation or other \nrepairs that may be needed.\n  The additional funding, of course, this is a short-term proposal. It \ngoes through March 27. It addresses those needs that fall into that \ncategory that meet the criteria of what we set out when we told our \nstaff on the Appropriations Committee to go through and scrub the bill \nthat was put before us and separate out that which was needed now from \nthat which could be done later. That criteria excluded funding for \nprojects not related to Sandy.\n  There is the long list of requests out there for previous disasters. \nMitigation was for future disasters that may or may not come. On \nmitigation, we said let's set that aside for later deliberation.\n  On nonrelated issues, such as cleaning up the tsunami debris on the \nwest coast, those expenditures put in this $60.4 billion proposal by \nthe administration and brought to this Senate floor, if it is not \nrelated directly to this storm, let's set those aside for the \nprocedures that were being dealt with before Sandy occurred or put \nthose procedures in place to deal with it afterward. So unrelated items \nand unsubstantiated items, those are where all the facts weren't in, \nwhere these were estimates that had not been certified and not \nsubstantiated in a way that I think puts us in a position to make the \ncorrect decisions in terms of going forward.\n  So under that criteria, we came up with a proposal that is a little \nbit of a work in progress, but totals around $24 billion.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator, but I would like to finish my \nremarks, if I could. I know we all have time commitments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am only going to make a short unanimous consent request, \nif I could.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ncompletion of the distinguished Senator's remarks the Senate stand in \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the concept behind this, of course, is to \nbe as careful as we can with the taxpayers' money and make sure that \neach dollar spent is spent on something that has been thoroughly \nexamined, looked at, vetted, scrubbed, and determined to be necessary \ngoing forward. We have to determine the share, the cost share for the \nState and local communities; what that percentage ought to be that \ncomes from the State and the local communities as opposed to the \nFederal Government.\n  We have to determine how to best go forward with the best project \nthat can, hopefully, prevent future damage should a second storm or \nsubsequent storm occur. We have to look at a whole number of factors \nand make judgments. That is what we are elected to do.\n  When the taxpayers send their money into the Federal Government, they \ndon't want us to just throw up a number and throw some wish list out \nand throw out money at unsubstantiated and unscrubbed projects that are \nproposed. So I am not suggesting that everything in the proposal, the \n$60.4 billion, is not necessary. I am simply saying give us some time, \nat least these 3 months through March 27, to have our committees and \nhave the experts look at these proposals and make sure it is \nsubstantiated.\n  So we remove the unsubstantiated, the mitigated, the non-Sandy \nrelated. We have removed all that from this program, and that is how we \narrived at this number.\n  Now, I could go through a number of examples--I don't think I need to \ndo that at this particular point in time. When we look at the various \ncategories this falls into, sometimes we matched exactly what it was in \nthe administration's bill, saying this is an accurate number.\n  Flood insurance, for instance, we require people living in flood \nzones to buy flood insurance. They buy the flood insurance, and they \nare looking for their check. If the estimate has been made, and it has \nbeen made actuarially and through the procedures of FEMA and all those \nevaluating the cost, and the decision is made and the number is \ndetermined and certified, then a check is written and those people can \nmove on to their lives. That is an immediate need.\n  We can't tell people to pay their premiums and we will somehow find a \nway to get their checks to them a year from now. This is an immediate \nneed. In that regard, we have matched their request made by the Flood \nInsurance Program to provide the borrowing authority so that they can \ncut those checks. Whether it is Christmas or the middle of the year, \nthose people need to get their lives back together and we want to get \nthat money to them.\n\n  So as you go through the list here and the categories, as you compare \nwhat we have provided and what was provided in the larger bill, you \nfind congruence in a number of areas, but a number of other areas, \nwhich I have generalized in terms of mitigation, in terms of community \ndevelopment block grants, all these take time to come to fruition, to \nbe put together. The plans need to be vetted and approved. They are not \nnecessary to provide the necessary immediate need and aid that is for \nthe people who are suffering from the consequences of this storm. If we \ngo through all that and scrub it, we arrive at a considerably lower \nnumber.\n  But I want it said that this number, while higher than some would \nlike and lower than others would like, is a carefully thought-through, \nreasonable number to take care of needs for now, through this Christmas \nseason and all the way to March 27. This Congress will then revisit the \nmatter and see what else is needed. But during that time, we will be \nable to also carefully work through the estimates, substantiate those \nestimates, certify that. Then, obviously, I think those proposing will \nhave a much better foundation to stand on in terms of what they are \nrequesting, and those of us who are trying to be very careful with the \ntaxpayers' dollars will be able to assert or state why we think this \nmay not be necessary at this time or perhaps doesn't fall in the \ncategory of being related to Sandy.\n  We all know when some emergency supplemental comes to the Halls of \nCongress, a lot of people reach in their pocket, pull out their wish \nlist, waiting for the next train that has to be something we will move \nthrough quickly, has to be something signed by the President because it \nis designated as an emergency. They throw on their wish list of \nunresolved, unfunded projects that perhaps are legitimate, perhaps \nmaybe just earmarks or something that needs a train to hook onto in \norder to get passed. That is what we want to try to avoid.\n  As I said, I will be filing this amendment, which hopefully will be \nseen as an alternative to give Members a choice in terms of how best to \nmove forward in dealing with this legitimate supplemental emergency \nprovision.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8194-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend Senator Leahy, who is managing the Senate Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. The bill includes funding and language provisions \nfor the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will help construct and \nimprove crucial flood control projects in areas impacted by Hurricane \nSandy, including along the Jersey Shore. Mitigation projects along the \ncoast are critical to preventing future damage, and that's why I am \npleased that language is included in the bill to authorize projects for \nconstruction that are currently in the study phase. This provision will \nexpedite flood control efforts in flood-prone areas impacted by \nHurricane Sandy, and I am pleased Senator Leahy agrees this is a \nvaluable initiative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to work with Senator Lautenberg on this\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\nissue. New Jersey, New York, and other States throughout the region \nwere devastated by Hurricane Sandy. In particular, flood-prone areas \nand the coastline experienced severe damage. That is why the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill includes funding and language to \nimprove damaged projects, construct new projects to prevent future \ndamage, and to authorize projects in the study phase for construction, \nprovided that the Corps of Engineers determines doing so would cost-\neffectively reduce flood and storm damage risks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Requiring the Corps of Engineers to determine whether \npotential projects in affected areas can cost-effectively reduce flood \nand storm damage risks before receiving construction authorization is a \nvaluable goal. However, Hurricane Sandy changed the conditions of many \nprojects, which could increase the final cost of those projects. Also, \nmany homes and businesses in flood-prone areas were destroyed. This \ncould lead to a decrease in the value of property protected by proposed \nprojects. Therefore, the combined impact of increased project costs and \na reduction in the value of property that would be protected by planned \nflood control infrastructure could result in a calculation that shows a \nhigher project cost with lower economic benefits. Does the Senator \nagree that the language regarding the cost-effectiveness of flood and \nstorm damage efforts under consideration for construction authorization \nis not intended to disqualify projects that could have increased costs \nand decreased economic benefits as a result of Hurricane Sandy?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. The language does not intend for the Corps of \nEngineers to disqualify studies under consideration for construction \nauthorization based on increased costs and decreased economic benefits \nas a result of Hurricane Sandy. In addition, the term ``cost-\neffectiveness'' does not refer to the benefit to cost ratio typically \nused by the Corps of Engineers.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank Senator Leahy, along with Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, who \nhas jurisdiction over the Corps, for their work on this vital bill, \nwhich would help states affected by Hurricane Sandy recover and prepare \nfor future storms. It includes important language to allow projects in \nthe study phase to be constructed and does not intend to disqualify \nprojects with increased costs and decreased economic benefits as a \nresult of Hurricane Sandy. Given that this process is different than \nstandard practice, does the Senator agree that the Corps of Engineers \nshould submit a report to Congress to explain the process that will be \nimplemented?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. The Corps is directed to submit a report to the \nCommittee on Appropriations on its proposed process for determining \ncost-effectiveness, in accordance with the aforementioned intentions, \nno later than 45 days following enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                      Great Lakes Dredging Funding\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring attention to a significant \ndisaster situation in the Great Lakes region. As a result of a deadly \ncombination of the Midwest drought and an unusually warm winter, the \nGreat Lakes are at near record low water levels. The Army Corps of \nEngineers reports that Lakes Michigan and Huron are more than 2 feet \nbelow their long-term average. Lake Superior is more than 1 foot below \nits long-term average. Keith Kompoltowicz, chief of watershed hydrology \nfor the Army Corps of Engineers, has said regarding the Great Lakes \nwater levels, ``There is a good chance of setting record lows.'' The \nsituation in the Great Lakes has resulted in freighters getting stuck \nin channels, ships carrying reduced loads leading to millions of \ndollars in losses, harbors closing or being threatened with closure, \nand so-called Harbors of Refuge not being able to provide shelter to \nboaters in distress.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I share my colleague's deep concern with \nthe low water levels in the Great Lakes. This is, without a doubt, a \ndisaster for the communities who rely on our harbors and waterways. The \nGreat Lakes provide jobs for more than 800,000 Michigan residents, and \nlow water levels in the lakes are threatening those jobs. The Great \nLakes support a $7 billion fishing industry, and a $16 billion \nrecreational boating industry. However, weather disasters this year \nhave resulted in water levels in the Great Lakes near record lows. \nNormally we count on spring rains and snow melt-off to raise the level \nof the lakes. But this spring we saw only a 4 inch rise in Lake \nMichigan and Lake Huron, one-third of the normal level. And for the \nfirst time on record, there was no spring rise in levels of Lake St. \nClair and Lake Erie. Due in part to the summer heat wave, at the height \nof which every single one of Michigan's 83 counties was declared a \ndisaster area, 2012 was also marked by evaporation rates over 50 \npercent above average for the 4 largest lakes. There is no question \nthat the shipping channels and harbors of the Great Lakes are in \ndistress. We cannot reverse the drought, but we can support the \ndredging projects necessary to ensure that the 139 Federal harbors and \nwaterways in the Great Lakes region can continue to serve our Nation's \neconomy.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. While the water levels are at historic lows in \nLakes Michigan and Huron, Lake Erie, which my State borders, also has \nwater levels below its long-term average. Because the Great Lakes \nnavigational system is interconnected, with shipments often moving from \nDuluth to Cleveland to Buffalo, a problem in one harbor can have \nnegative impacts across all of the 60 commercial projects in the Great \nLakes system. The light-loading of ships has repercussions across our \ntransportation system with very real impacts on jobs and our \nmanufacturing and agricultural sectors. This year's drought across \nOhio, Michigan, and other parts of the upper-Midwest has been nothing \nshort of a natural disaster.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition to response, recovery and mitigation related \nto Hurricane Sandy damage, I also understand this bill provides funds \nto help respond to other natural disasters. I would ask the manager of \nthe bill, Senator Leahy, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, that is correct. The Supplemental Appropriations bill \nincludes some funding related to natural disasters other than Hurricane \nSandy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the near-historic low water levels of the Great \nLakes caused by drought and mild winters be considered a natural \ndisaster?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The bill does not define ``natural disaster,'' but the \nnear record water level lows in the Great Lakes caused by drought and \nunusually warm weather leading to increased evaporation are certainly \ncontributing to significant drought-like consequences at Great Lakes \nports and harbors.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. I am pleased the bill includes $821 \nmillion to dredge federal navigation channels and repair damage to \nCorps projects nationwide related to natural disasters. Would \nfederally-authorized Great Lakes harbors and channels be eligible for \nthat funding?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. The funding is tied to estimates of natural disaster \ndamages relayed to Congress by the Corps, however, the funding is not \nearmarked to specific projects. The Corps utilizes this funding to \nrestore essential project functions based on the Corps' priority of the \ndamages. In that context, Great Lakes ports and harbors would be \neligible for the funding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for his clarification. The Army Corps \nof Engineers estimates that $35 million could be utilized in operations \nand maintenance funding just to restore minimum operations in the Great \nLakes system. I am hopeful that $35 million of the $821 million for \ndredging will be directed to Great Lakes projects.

Mr. President, tonight we are wrapping up affairs here \non the floor, and what is going on right now is that the main \nsubstitute amendment that had a whole series of other amendments \nattached to it that has been the result of the work over the last \ncouple of days has been withdrawn, so we are back to square one in \nterms of addressing a series of national disasters around the country.\n  Tomorrow, with the new amendment, we will start off the day with a \nnew basic amendment and a new chance to have amendments to the \nreplacement. I explain this simply to say that a number of Senators who \nhad amendments over the last couple of days will come back tomorrow and \nwill ask to have their amendments be considered. I will be one of them, \nand I wanted to explain why.\n  In my home State of Oregon, we had the worst forest fires in a \ncentury this summer, and the devastation to ranchers and farmers was \nenormous. There was the loss of forage on their own land, the loss of \nforage on BLM land, certainly the loss of livestock, and the loss of \nmiles of fencing in these fires. Basically, whole ranching enterprises \nwere destroyed.\n  The largest of these fires was larger than the Presiding Officer's \nState, the State of Rhode Island. That is an enormous fire. That was \njust one of the many fires we had sweeping our State, and this was not \njust something that happened in Oregon. This happened in many States \nthis summer because it goes along with something else, which is we had \nthe worst drought in many parts of the country. So we have farmers and \nranchers across this Nation devastated this past summer by drought, \ndevastated by fires which were larger because of drought conditions.\n  Normally we would have had disaster programs to assist with these \ndisasters. These disaster programs were authorized in the farm bill. In \nthis Chamber we had a bipartisan coming together. We passed the farm \nbill, and we sent it over to the House. There it has sat, month after \nmonth after month, while our farmers and our ranchers all across this \nNation faced these disasters with no assistance, no assistance in a \nsituation in which they should be able to expect assistance. It is the \ntradition of our Nation that when there are extraordinary disasters, we \nrally together, respond and rebuild those communities, whether they be \nurban disasters or whether they be rural disasters. But because the \nfarm bill has not been passed, not gotten to the President, these \ndisaster programs have not been reauthorized, and our farmers and \nranchers watch us and wait. They say where is our government, our \npartner, when disaster occurs?\n  They know the tax dollars they pay go into the central government and \nhave many times been allocated to others around this Nation facing \ndisasters of all kinds--earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts. But \nthese individuals, now that Mother Nature has struck them, stand \nwaiting.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow to right this wrong. We have a bill \nthat is about the enormous terrible disaster that affected our \nNortheastern States in the form of Hurricane Sandy.\n  We should be absolutely expedient in taking care of communities so \ndramatically affected. But at the same time, isn't it right that we \ntake care of the other communities around this country that have faced \ndisasters this last year that are waiting on us?\n  I invite my colleagues to come to the floor and explain to me if they \nfeel it is not right to take care of the other disasters we have had \nthis last year. I would like to be able to go to the ranchers and \nfarmers in my State and explain to them the arguments that others might \nbring about why their disaster, the destruction of their livelihood \nthat the great hand of Mother Nature struck, why we shouldn't address \nand assist them when we are assisting others so dramatically affected \naround this Nation. Quite frankly, I have no answer. I have no answer. \nI can't think of an answer.\n  Will any of my 99 colleagues come to me and explain why we shouldn't \npass this amendment tomorrow, the amendment that I will propose? I will \ntell you that a number of us came together to propose this amendment. \nSenator Stabenow, Senator McCaskill, Senator Baucus, Senator Wyden, \nSenator Tim Johnson, Senator Franken, Senator Tom Udall, representing \nall kinds of parts of our Nation, who understand the impact that \ndrought has had, understand the impact the fires have had. They have \ncome together from different parts of the Nation to say we are in this \ntogether. Let's not leave stranded our ranchers and farmers when we \ngather to debate tomorrow. Let's let this amendment be brought forward, \nand let's get it passed as part of this very appropriate response to \nthis very terrible disaster called Hurricane Sandy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8197-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8197-S8199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LIMITED SERVICE EXCLUSION\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that has \narisen between companies within the moving industry. Recently, a group \nof full-service moving companies has attempted to change rules \nestablished by law, regulations, and court findings. These full-service \nmoving companies are aiming to undermine the clear intent of Congress \nby avoiding the formal rulemaking or legislative process. The changes \nsought would benefit their companies and damage their competitors \nwithin the sector.\n  In recent years, full-service moving companies have faced new \ncompetition from a growing number of companies that allow consumers a \n``do it yourself'' alternative to more expensive, traditional movers. \nSome general freight motor carriers have been offering ``do it \nyourself'' consumers an option for moving: a non-household goods motor \ncarrier drops off empty containers or trailers at the consumer's \ndoorstep for the consumer to load, the consumer loads the trailer--\nindividually, with help from neighbors, or by hiring a third party. \nAfter loading, the consumer calls the container company or freight \ncarrier to pick up the container or trailer, the container company then \narranges for an authorized general freight or flatbed carrier to pick \nup and haul the loaded container, dropping it off on the requested \ndelivery date for the consumer to unload; and the carrier returns to \npick up the empty container or trailer when unloaded. The customer is \nable to purchase the level of service he or she wants and manage the \nprocess themselves from start to finish.\n  Mr. President, that is precisely the type of service alternative \nCongress intended to encourage when it included the so-called ``Limited \nService Exclusion'' in the ``Household Goods Mover Oversight \nEnforcement and Reform Act\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\nof 2005,'' enacted as Sec. Sec.  4201-16 of Pub. L. No. 109-59, 119 \nStat. 1144 (2005), now known as ``SAFETEA-LU.'' This Limited Service \nExclusion, codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec.  13102 (12)(c), expressly states \nthat:\n\n       The term [household goods motor carrier] does not include a \n     motor carrier when the motor carrier provides transportation \n     of household goods in containers or trailers that are \n     entirely loaded and unloaded by an individual (other than an \n     employee or agent of the motor carrier).\n\n  I sponsored this provision and worked with others in Congress to \nincorporate this Limited Service Exclusion into law and want to be \nclear of the intent of the law. The ``Limited Service Exclusion'' was \nintended for the non-household goods motor carrier that drops off empty \ncontainers or trailers, which are loaded by the consumer or a third \nparty, and then delivered or stored by the container company or freight \ncarrier. The exclusion's intent was to keep portable container supply \ncompanies and general freight carriers from the regulations required \nfor household good movers.\n  The written guidance that has been requested by the full-service \nmoving companies are pushing would ignore the Limited Service \nExclusion's intent by blocking portable container supply companies and \ngeneral freight carriers from relying on this statutory exclusion to \nwork together and with the do it yourself consumer to move the \nconsumer's belongings to his new home. That requested interpretation \nwould reverse decades of legal precedent and rule that if the container \nsupplier or general freight carrier refers the consumer to a third \nparty who provides the labor to load or unload the containers and \ntrailers, and the consumer elects to use those services, this third \nparty automatically becomes the ``agent'' of that container company or \ntrucking company. This attempted change of the statute with its \nanticompetitive effects is exactly the opposite of what I and my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House who voted for SAFETEA-LU \nintended.\n  The traditional moving companies urge the FMCSA to adopt a definition \nof ``agent''--as such term is used in the Limited Service Exclusion. \nThis would result in greater costs to consumers and will prevent \ncontainer and general freight carriers from using the Limited Service \nExclusion as Congress intended. The FMCSA already has embedded in its \nregulations the ideal basis for arriving at a definition of ``agent'' \nthat is consistent with our intent. The FMCSA's own regulation, 49 CFR \nSec.  375.103, requires it to apply the ``ordinary practical meaning'' \nto the term ``agent.'' The ``ordinary practical meaning'' of the term \nagent is well settled as a matter of black letter law and there is no \ncause for a federal agency to attempt to further interpret such a well-\nestablished term. Simply put, the definition compels a finding that: as \nlong as the container or freight carrier does not control the third \nparty who the consumer engages to load and unload the container or \ntrailer, the carrier does not authorize the third party to act for and \non behalf of this carrier, and the third party does not agree to act on \nbehalf of the carrier, then the third party is not the agent of the \ncarrier. Facilitating the consumer to contract with a third party that \nprovides loading and unloading services does not create an agency \nrelationship as we intended that term in the Limited Service Exclusion. \nMoreover, on a related issue, the Limited Service Exclusion should \nremain intact even if the carrier receives compensation for \nfacilitating the consumer to contract with packing and loading \nproviders, provided that the carrier does not have an agency \nrelationship with the packing and loading providers.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as Senator Pryor points out, the clear \nintent of Congress in adopting the Limited Service Exclusion section of \nSAFETEA-LU was to ensure cost-conscious, budget-driven consumers will \ncontinue to have the option to choose low-cost moving services for \ntheir goods. Although I was not a member of Congress when SAFETEA-LU \nwas passed, you can plainly see that Congress made it clear in another \nsection of SAFETEA-LU that it was codifying and preserving decades of \nlaw developed and perpetuated at the FMCSA, its predecessor the \nInterstate Commerce Commission, and the courts that authorize general \ncommodity motor carriers lacking household goods authority to transport \nhousehold goods as long as they do not perform specialized household \ngoods related services such as loading and unloading. Here is what \nCongress added to SAFETEA-LU, now codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec.  \n13102(12)(B):\n\n       The term [``household goods motor carrier''] includes any \n     person that is considered to be a household goods motor \n     carrier under regulations, determinations, and decisions of \n     the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration that are in \n     effect on the date of enactment of the Household Goods Mover \n     Oversight Enforcement and Reform Act of 2005.\n\n  The definition of ``household goods motor carrier'' that Congress \nsought to preserve and perpetuate focuses on the nature of the services \nperformed, not on the commodity itself. If the motor carrier provides \nspecialized household goods related services--packing, loading, \nunloading, etc.--for the consumer, the carrier must be deemed a \n``household goods motor carrier'' with respect to the goods it \ntransports under a long line of court, FMCSA and ICC decisions and \nimplementing regulations. Conversely, if the carrier (or its agent) \ndoes not perform those specialized services in conjunction with those \nhousehold goods, it may transport them without being registered and \nregulated as a ``household goods carrier.'' This emphasis on the nature \nof the carrier services performed and not the nature of the commodity \nitself is also at the very heart of and reflected in the appropriately \nnamed ``Limited Service Exclusion.'' The interpretation that the \ntraditional movers advocate would overturn, not preserve, agency \nprecedent and arrive at a definition of ``household goods motor \ncarrier'' that unlawfully contravenes the service-based exclusion \ncodified in 49 U.S.C. Sec.  13102(12)(c).\n  Mr. PRYOR. Along with the growth of general freight motor carriers \nand container-supply companies catering to the needs of do-it-yourself \nconsumers, we have seen some of these same companies become regulated \nproperty brokers and step forward in this capacity to assist these \nconsumers. For a negotiated fee, they offer to arrange with portable \ncontainer companies and general freight carriers to place the \ncontainers and trailers for loading and to have them transported to \ntheir destinations when loaded. To counteract this middleman-service, \nthe full-service traditional moving companies are now urging the FMCSA \nto require do it yourself consumers desiring broker assistance to \nengage only brokers registered with and regulated by the FMCSA as \n``household goods brokers'' to make these arrangements on their behalf \nand to require them to use only registered, full-service ``household \ngoods motor carriers'' to perform the underlying transportation.\n  Their principal argument relies upon a false negative inference they \nwant the FMCSA to draw from the absence of a similar ``Limited Service \nExclusion'' from the ``household goods broker'' definition for brokers \nthat arrange household goods moves for do-it-yourself consumers. This \neffort at changing the meaning of the statute further obstructs the \nintent behind the Household Goods Mover Oversight Enforcement and \nReform Act of 2005. We want the consumers to have access to low-cost \ntransportation services as an alternative to the traditional full-\nservice moving companies when motor carriers, lacking specific \nhousehold goods authority and not providing specialized household goods \nrelated services, perform the underlying transportation in reliance \nupon the Limited Service Exclusion codified at 49 U.S.C. \nSec. 13102(12)(c). No broker-specific Limited Service Exclusion is \nrequired: if the underlying motor carrier service does not provide \npacking and loading services, then the motor carrier need not hold \nhousehold goods authority from the FMCSA. In turn, the broker engaged \nby the consumer to arrange the transportation (without any packing and \nloading services) likewise need not hold household goods broker \nauthority and need not use a household goods motor carrier. \nAccordingly, a motor carrier authorized to haul property (excluding \nhousehold goods) can perform the move.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as Senator Pryor has articulated, the FMCSA \nshould not suppress competition in the moving industry, and my fear is \nthat this would happen if the\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nagency eliminates an important moving option for do-it-yourself \nconsumers. This would economically hurt the principal users of portable \nstorage companies, namely the middle class, military, students and \nother price conscious consumers. For these reasons and the others \nmentioned by my colleague, it is my sincere hope that the FMCSA \npreserves the rights of consumers, as intended by Congress, to ready \nand unfettered access to lower cost options with respect to moving \ntheir household goods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8199-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Dan Akaka\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the last 22 years, Daniel Akaka has \nrepresented the people of Hawaii in this body. They have been the \nbetter for his service, and I have greatly appreciated the wisdom, \nhumility, and passion with which he has served here.\n  One issue on which we have been able to work closely as fellow \nmembers of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is \noversight of the Federal workforce, a key issue for his State and for \ntaxpayers everywhere. Senator Akaka's passion for Federal workforce \nissues comes from his passion for public service and for effective \ngovernment. Just in this Congress, I was an original cosponsor of his \nFederal Whistleblower Protection Act, to strengthen the law protecting \nFederal employees who bring to light fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal \nprograms. That Akaka bill is expected to be signed into law before the \nend of the year. Also this Congress, I was proud to cosponsor his Hatch \nAct Modernization Act to allow hard-working employees of State and \nlocal governments, who are covered by the Hatch Act, to serve as \nelected officials in their communities.\n  In addition to his focus on Federal workforce issues, Senator Akaka \nhas long been a valued member of the Armed Services Committee. We have \nworked together on legislation to reform Defense Department business \nand financial management systems; strengthen oversight and \naccountability of wartime contracting; and strengthen the Defense \nDepartment's management of the substantial funds it spends to acquire \nproperty and services.\n  Senator Akaka joined in 2002 with Senator Inhofe to form the Senate \nArmy Caucus, and through this bipartisan group they have focused \nwelcome attention on the programs and needs of our Army. Senator Akaka, \nhimself an Army veteran, has been an important source of insight into \nthe challenges facing our soldiers and their families.\n  Of course, as the former chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nSenator Akaka has long demonstrated an intense dedication to those who \nhave helped defend our Nation. His steadfast advocacy for veterans \nhealth programs, education benefits, and other important programs has \nmade a significant and lasting impact on the lives of veterans and \ntheir families.\n  When people describe Daniel Akaka, one of the first words used to \ndescribe him is ``humble.'' He is indeed that. He has been a dedicated \nand principled servant of the people of Hawaii and our Nation, an \nunfailing ally of our veterans and their families, and a valued \ncolleague and friend. I will miss him, and I will always remember how \nhe taught us that gentleness and effectiveness are not mutually \nexclusive characteristics.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, in his four terms representing the State of Wisconsin \nin this body, Senator Herb Kohl's focus has been precisely where it \nshould be: the welfare of the people of his State and of our Nation. \nWhether in supporting American manufacturers and the jobs they provide, \nin fighting for protection from crime and for adequate nutrition for \nour children, in protecting senior citizens from elder abuse, or in \npreserving the Great Lakes that our two States share, Senator Kohl has \naccomplished much on behalf of American families.\n  I have been fortunate to work closely with Senator Kohl on issues of \nvital importance to our States. He has long been a strong supporter of \nthe Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which helps U.S. manufacturers \nwith technical support and services that make them more efficient and \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. His support for adequate MEP \nfunding has made a significant difference for American companies and \nworkers.\n  Now, we in Michigan bow to no one in our love for the Great Lakes, \nbut even I would admit that Wisconsin, second only to Michigan in its \nlength of Great Lakes coastline, is a close competitor. As a member of \nthe Great Lakes Task Force, which I cochair, he has supported cleanup \nof toxic hot spots, the fight against invasive species, protecting \nGreat Lakes water quality, and sufficient funding for the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative.\n  We have also shared an interest in consumer protection. Senator Kohl \nchairs the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition \nPolicy and Consumer Rights, and from that platform, he has battled \nthose who would prey on American consumers, whether they are abusive \ncredit card companies or oil-exporting cartel nations.\n  But where Senator Kohl has left what may be his most lasting \nimpression is in his hard work on behalf of our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens: children and seniors. He has long advocated \nsolutions to help make college more affordable. He has helped expand \nthe availability of nutritious breakfasts for school-age children and \nprograms to help parents afford food on the table for their families. \nHe has worked to strengthen afterschool programs. And in 2007 and again \nin 2008, he introduced the Patient Safety and Abuse Protection Act, \nwhich allowed employers to perform background checks on nursing home \nemployees to help prevent elder abuse. When this legislation was \nincluded in the Affordable Care Act in 2009, it was a major step \nforward for patient safety.\n  I will miss working with Herb Kohl on these and many other issues. I \nwill miss the opportunity to give him a hard time whenever our Detroit \nPistons beat his Milwaukee Bucks. I hope we can continue the important \nwork he has helped move forward: protecting good jobs, our Great Lakes, \nour students, and our seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8199-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8199-S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today the State of Hawai`i, the \nSenate, and the United States mourn the loss of Senator Daniel Inouye.\n  Observers of the Senate today know Chairman Inouye as a poised, soft-\nspoken statesman: courteous and collegiate; shunning of the spotlight; \nabove the petty churn of the partisan fray. But historians will \nremember him as a great patriot, a fierce warrior, a brave pioneer, and \na great leader.\n  Chairman Inouye's unflinching commitment to his country withstood \nboth the moral threat of having his family deemed ``enemy aliens'' and \nthe direct physical threat of Nazi firepower. His famed ``Go For \nBroke'' 442nd Regimental Combat Team was made up of Japanese-American \nvolunteers, but even among this exceptionally decorated group of men, \nSecond Lieutenant Inouye exemplified exceptional bravery and sacrifice \nin what Winston Churchill described as the war ``to confront not only \nmilitary but moral aggression.''\n  The fight to see the American values of freedom, justice, and \nequality fulfilled would continue beyond the war years and throughout \nChairman Inouye's lifetime of service to his home state and his \ncountry. The new State of Hawai`i sent him to Washington as part of its \nvery first delegation. The first Japanese American elected to Congress, \nhe has been a champion of civil rights for women, Asian Americans, \nNative Hawaiians, and African Americans. Indeed, Chairman Inouye was \nthe last surviving member of the Senate to have voted for the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. He also ferreted out corruption at the highest \nlevel of government, serving on the Senate's select committee on the \nWatergate scandal, and chairing the investigation of the Iran-Contra \narms affair.\n  But Dan Inouye was first and foremost a servant of the people of \nHawai`i. Ever grateful for the faith they entrusted in him year after \nyear, he worked to make sure they had every opportunity to achieve the \nfull potential of the American Dream. I was honored that he joined me \nas an original member of the Senate Oceans Caucus,\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nand as a cosponsor of my bill to establish a National Endowment for the \nOceans to protect the environment and economies that are so vital to \nboth his home State and my own.\n  As his colleague and compatriot Senator Daniel Akaka said on the \nSenate floor in those first hours after we received the terrible news \nof Chairman Inouye's passing, ``He fulfilled his dream of creating a \nbetter Hawai`i.'' His wife Irene, his son Ken, his daughter-in-law \nJessica, his stepdaughter Jennifer, and his granddaughter Maggie can \nall be proud of that legacy. My thoughts are with them in this, their \ntime of loss.\n  As the old hymn tells us:\n\n     Now the laborer's task is o'er;\n     Now the battle day is past;\n     Now upon the farther shore\n     Lands the voyager at last.\n\n  Aloha, Dan Inouye.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8200-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE BURKE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to thank and to honor \nan invaluable member of my Senate team, Michael Burke. As my Maryland \nprojects director, Mike has been the key liaison between the Federal \nlegislative process and the critical institutions of my home State of \nMaryland. As my top environmental adviser, Mike has been vital to each \nof my environmental priorities, from climate change to the Chesapeake \nBay. Mike is a substantive expert, a keen strategist, a wise counselor, \nand an attentive mentor and friend to my entire team. He is a diligent \npublic servant who leads quietly, by example, with the strength of his \nknowledge and skill. As he retires after an exemplary career of \nservice, I am pleased to pay public tribute to this remarkable man.\n  Mike has devoted much of his career to protecting the natural \nsplendor of Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic, particularly our iconic \nChesapeake Bay. Before joining my team, Mike was associate director of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay program. There, he \ndedicated himself to implementing solutions for the bay, which is the \nworld's largest estuary, one of the most important water bodies in the \nNation, and a natural resource that all Marylanders treasure. Shortly \nafter I was sworn into the Senate, Mike joined my office as an EPA \nfellow. He demonstrated an incredible knowledge and understanding of \nthe wide range of issues affecting Maryland, and I knew I needed to \nhire him as a permanent member of my staff. He brought his passion for \nthe environment to his work in the Senate, skillfully leading efforts \non environmental issues from Chesapeake Bay health to clean air, and \nfrom climate change to wildlife conservation. I will continue to fight \nhard for the issues and programs that Mike helped initiate.\n  Mike knows the ecological importance of the Chesapeake Bay and the \nimpediments harming the bay's ecology because he has seen it all and \nexperienced it firsthand. From Poplar Neck to Elk Neck, from Catoctin \nMountain to Calvert Cliffs, from the Nanticoke to the Pocomoke, from \nRocky Gorge to Sandy Point, Mike has experienced the natural wonder of \nour great State. It is his deep appreciation for the importance of \nprotecting our State's natural resources that has made him such a \nvaluable member of my staff.\n  In addition to his critical environmental work, Mike led my team in \ncharge of instate projects. The key institutions of Maryland's public \nlife our universities, our hospitals, our local governments, and \ncommunity organizations have benefitted from Mike's expertise in \nnavigating the legislative process and his commitment to fighting on \nbehalf of the people of Maryland.\n  Mike's substantive knowledge and political acumen extend well beyond \nthe bay and Maryland. His policy expertise led Senator Barbara Boxer, \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, to ask me \nif I would ``lend'' Mike to her committee during the committee's \narduous work on both the 2010 climate bill and the 2012 Transportation \nbill. While his full-time service to my office was missed during those \nperiods, I was pleased to see how much my colleague from California \nvalued Mike's input and skill, and I was happy to see him brought in to \nhelp the chairman with these important committee initiatives.\n  In addition to his wealth of knowledge and strategic skill, Mike will \nbe missed most of all for the warmth, integrity, and generosity of \nspirit that he brings to every encounter. When he first joined my \noffice, he would occasionally send Maryland trivia questions around to \nthe staff. His enthusiasm helped to broaden my team's--and even my \nown--knowledge of the great State of Maryland, and endeared him to \neveryone in the office. No matter how tough the circumstance and here \nin the Senate, we often face tough days--Mike is quick to declare with \na smile that he has ``never had a bad day.'' He has committed himself \nto mentorship, voluntarily and enthusiastically spending hours working \nwith more junior colleagues, guiding and advising them with a \nselflessness that is remarkable for being all too rare.\n  During the years, I am proud to say that I have come to value Mike \nnot just as a staff member, but as a friend. He and his wife Pat have \nbecome favorites within the Cardin team, and I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to acknowledge Pat publicly as well. Her strong commitment \nto Maryland is evident not only in her own work in children's health \ncare, but in her support of Mike's efforts here in these Halls, and I \nthank her for her contribution to the people of Maryland.\n  Mike's knowledge of the environmental issues of the day does not just \nstem from his professional experience, but also from his personal \ninterest as an avid naturalist, bird watcher, kayaker, and overall \nlover of the outdoors. Mike is most at home among the natural spaces he \ntreasures, either on the water in a sea kayak or walking along a nature \ntrail. For several years, Mike has shared that passion with the \ncommunity by writing a column featuring different species of Mid-\nAtlantic native and migratory birds in the ``Chesapeake Bay Journal.'' \nAs with everything he does, Mike's columns always manage to include \nsome of the quiet wisdom that is uniquely his. In a column about the \ncommon song sparrow, a local bird that is often overlooked in favor of \nthose with brighter colors and flashier songs, Mike urges his readers \nto look beyond the bird's plain exterior to appreciate its unique \ncontribution to the natural community. His words manage to capture \nsomething about his own steady, unassuming service to those around him. \nMike writes, ``We lead quiet lives until some rare person decides to \nlisten with abiding patience, waiting for us to finally step out from \nbehind protective cover and softly announce our presence. And then \nanonymity gives way to the individuality that has been there all \nalong.'' For me, for my team, Mike has always been both the quiet \npresence and the patient listener, working with steady determination \nfor the people of Maryland. As he looks forward to a retirement filled \nwith relaxation and the outdoor recreation that he loves, I am humbly \ngrateful for his service. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8200-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8200-S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 285.

A bill to minimize the economic and social costs resulting \nfrom losses of life, property, well-being, business activity, and \neconomic growth associated with extreme weather events by ensuring that \nthe United States is more resilient to the impacts of extreme weather \nevents in the short- and long-term, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the STRONG Act of \n2012, or the Strengthening The Resilience of Our National on the Ground \nAct. This legislation will build upon existing extreme weather \nresiliency efforts to provide State and local actors with the tools and \ninformation they need to help prepare, plan for, and more quickly \nrecover from extreme weather events. Hurricane Sandy has shown us that \nextreme weather remains a major challenge for our Nation.\n  Recently, extreme weather events have battered the nation, resulting \nin record-high losses for 2011 and more broken records in 2012. In the \npast 30 years, there have been more than 130 extreme weather events in \nthe United States that generated at least $1 billion in devastating \ndamages. Most recently, Hurricane Sandy resulted in more than 100 \ndeaths, the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people, power \noutages affecting more than 8.5 million homes, massive flooding, \ngasoline shortages, and a crippled regional energy and transportation \ninfrastructure. Extreme weather ravaged every region of the United \nStates this year, with drought conditions in more than 60 percent of \nthe contiguous United States; deadly floods; destructive wildfires on \nmore than nine million acres across 37 States; and deadly heat waves.\n  By building stronger communities, we can reduce the serious economic \nand human costs of extreme weather over the short and long term. For \nevery $1 spent now on disaster preparedness and resilience-building, we \ncould avoid at least $4 in future losses. We need to make our Nation \nstronger and more resilient against extreme weather or face an \nincreasingly more expensive and deadly future.\n  The STRONG Act of 2012 will use existing Federal resources to help \nreduce future losses of life, property, and well-being. It will also \nhelp limit declines in regional economic growth due to disasters. \nSpecifically, it directs the Federal Government to create a more \ncomprehensive approach to planning for and supporting resiliency \nefforts due to extreme weather. The bill directs the White House Office \nof Science and Technology Policy to chair a high-level interagency \nworking group to assess Federal agencies' activities related to extreme \nweather resilience across key sectors, such as agriculture, water \nmanagement, infrastructure, public health, and national security. It \ndevelops a plan to better support State, local, and private and public \nsector resiliency efforts in the short and long-term, including \nestablishing a public clearinghouse of information. The bill emphasizes \nState, local, and private sector involvement; a Federal advisory group \ncomposed of private and public representatives will play a key \nconsultative role throughout the process, as will an advisory group \ncomposed of State, local, and tribal representatives. It also \ncomplements and builds upon recent activities by my colleagues and the \nWhite House in the Federal response to the devastation of Hurricane \nSandy.\n  I believe that by better understanding and planning, we can reduce \nthe serious economic and human costs of extreme weather on our \ncommunities. The events of 2012 and years past have clearly \ndemonstrated the need for better and more efficient governance before \ndisaster strikes again.\n  A number of organizations are supportive of this bill, including the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational Emergency Management Association, the National Weather \nAssociation, and the American Planning Association.\n  I am pleased that Senators Gillibrand and Lautenberg are original \ncosponsors of this legislation. I look forward to building upon a \nstrong foundation and improving our extreme weather resiliency efforts. \nIt is our responsibility to protect our citizens and help minimize \nfuture loss and damage. I ask all Senators to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 3696.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the New Columbia \nAdmissions Act that will create a 51st State from the populated \nportions of Washington, D.C., giving these more than 600,000 \ndisenfranchised Americans the voice they deserve in our national \ngovernment. The United States is the only democracy in the world that \ndenies voting representation to the people who live in its capital \ncity. It is long past time to end this unjust and embarrassing \ndistinction.\n  I am not the only Senator who feels this way--Senators Durbin, Boxer, \nand Murray join me in cosponsoring this bill today. My friend Senator \nInouye had planned to cosponsor this bill as he was a strong supporter \nof the District's right to have congressional representation.\n  Under this bill, there would still be Federal district called \nWashington, D.C., which would be under the control of Congress as the \nConstitution mandates. But it would be a smaller area encompassing the \nWhite House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the National Mall, \nwhere few people actually live. The rest of the current District of \nColumbia--diverse business districts and residential neighborhoods that \nare home to more than half a million U.S. citizens--would become a new \nState.\n  This is completely in accord with the principles and mandates of the \nConstitution and our Founding Fathers. Indeed, I think it is worth \nremembering why our Founding Fathers created a Federal district in the \nfirst place.\n  After the Revolutionary War, Philadelphia, PA, was the capital of the \ngovernment formed by the Articles of Confederation. That Congress met \nin what we now know as Independence Hall in Philadephia.\n  In 1783, a mob of Revolutionary War veterans besieged Independence \nHall, demanding promised payments for their service during the war. \nCongress asked the governor of Pennsylvania, John Dickinson, to call \nout the militia to defend the capital, but he sided with the veterans \nand refused.\n  Congress had to flee to Princeton, NJ.\n  This failure of a state government to protect the national government \nbecame a major concern of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and it \nwas decided the Constitution must create a Federal district that could \nbe controlled and protected by the new Federal government.\n  But Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution, which created the \nFederal district, did not order a particular location. It only said \nonly that it may not exceed ``10 miles square''--or 100 square miles.\n  The Residence Act of 1790 gave President Washington authority to pick \nthe final site of the capital, and the site of the current Washington \nD.C. was chosen as a result of a compromise between Thomas Jefferson \nand Alexander Hamilton.\n  When John Adams moved into the White House in 1800, Washington, D.C. \nhad a population of just 3,210 people--in a Nation of roughly 5 \nmillion. Even then the founders were concerned about voting rights for \nresidents of the new capital. In the early days before the capital was \nfully established, its residents were allowed to vote in Maryland or \nVirginia. There were proposals to guarantee their suffrage going \nforward but unfortunately they did not get enacted amid the press to \nestablish the new government. Certainly, though, it would have been \nunimaginable to the founders that a population of more than half a \nmillion in our capital city should be disenfranchised in the national \nlegislature.\n  Yet that is the current reality. Now we are a Nation of more than 300 \nmillion and Washington, D.C. is a thriving community of 618,000 people. \nThat's more people than Wyoming has and about the same as Vermont and \nNorth Dakota have, which, of course, have full representation in \nCongress. Acccording to the U.S. Census, Washington, D.C. is growing \nfaster than all 50 States. Demographers expect it will only get bigger \nin the years to come because much of that growth has been with young \npeople who want to raise families in the District.\n  The District of Columbia already functions as a state in many \nrespects--indeed the Federal Government treats it as a State for \npurposes of most Federal programs.\n  More important, the residents of the District of Columbia have all \nthe responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. They pay more Federal income \ntax per capita than residents of any state; D.C. residents and \nbusinesses send on average $20 billion to the Federal treasury each \nyear. D.C. residents must serve on Federal juries and male residents \nmust register for Selective Service. More than 190,000 D.C. residents \nhave served in the military in wartime and about 1,700 have died for \nour country in the wars of the last century alone. All this occurred \nwhile the District's residents were denied voting representation in \nCongress.\n  The current inequity has even been noted by international bodies, \nincluding the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as a possible \nviolation of international human rights accords.\n  It is long past time to give these American citizens who have chosen \nWashington as their home full participation in our democracy. People \nwho live in D.C. are, of course, as American as people who live \nthroughout our country--teachers, firefighters, doctors, janitors, \nparents, children, veterans, retirees. Why do their contributions to \nour democracy--financial and otherwise--merit rights and representation \nany less than those of their fellow citizens in the 50 states?\n  In sum, nothing in the Constitution prevents Congress from ceding \nthis territory to a new State. There will still be a Federal district \nunder Congressional control and protected by Federal authorities.\n  The voters of this new state will have the same rights we give voters \nin every other State, including those seven small states with \npopulations under 1 million. If the idea seems strange, remember that \nmany also once could not imagine full voting rights for women or racial \nminorities. It is the nature of civil rights that the disenfranchised \nmust fight to gain acceptance of rights that, in retrospect, seem \nmorally compelled and beyond question. We must right this injustice \ntoward the residents of the District just as Congress historically has \nrighted other voting injustices that stretched back to the very \nfounding of the Nation.\n  I will soon leave Congress after having had the great privilege of \nserving here for 24 years. Securing full voting rights for the 600,000 \nAmericans who live in the District of Columbia is unfinished business, \nnot just for me, but for the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/19/senate-section/article/S8205-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8205-S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 625--RECOGNIZING THE JANUARY 12, 2013, OPENING OF THE \nUNITED STATES FREEDOM PAVILION: THE BOEING CENTER AT THE NATIONAL WORLD \nWAR II MUSEUM IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, AND SUPPORTING PLANS FOR OTHER \n                 EDUCATIONAL PAVILIONS AND INITIATIVES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Vitter) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 625\n\n       Whereas historians Stephen E. Ambrose and Gordon H. \n     ``Nick'' Mueller, among others, founded the National D-Day \n     Museum on June 6, 2000;\n       Whereas section 8134(c) of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-87; 117 Stat. \n     1105) designated the National D-Day Museum as ``America's \n     National World War II Museum'';\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum advances the \n     mission of educating the public about the experience of the \n     United States in World War II, covering all branches of the \n     Armed Forces and the Merchant Marine, and documenting and \n     highlighting activities on both the battlefront and home \n     front;\n       Whereas the exhibits and programs of the National World War \n     II Museum portray why the War occurred, how the War was won, \n     and what the War means today, and celebrate the spirit of the \n     United States and enduring values displayed during the War;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum emphasizes the \n     diverse nature of the war effort of the United States, \n     reflecting the contributions of women, African-Americans, \n     Japanese-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and \n     other groups that have been neglected in many accounts of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas the 12,000 landing craft designed and built by \n     Higgins Industries in New Orleans made amphibious invasions \n     possible and\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\n     carried United States soldiers ashore in every theatre and \n     campaign during the War;\n       Whereas President Dwight D.

Ambrose, leading Ambrose to initiate plans for the \n     National World War II Museum;\n       Whereas the National D-Day Museum, now known as the \n     ``National World War II Museum'', has made great strides in \n     the development of the facilities, exhibits, and programs at \n     the Museum;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum, since the grand \n     opening on June 6, 2000, which was the 56th anniversary of \n     the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, has attracted more \n     than 3,000,000 visitors from across the United States and \n     around the world, and has reached millions more through \n     Internet-based and other distance learning programs;\n       Whereas World War II veterans and home front supporters, \n     recognized as the ``greatest generation'' because of the \n     sacrifices of the veterans and home front supporters at a \n     pivotal time in United States history, are passing away at a \n     rapid rate, creating an urgent need to preserve the stories, \n     and to pay tribute to the service of the veterans and home \n     front supporters;\n       Whereas Congress recognizes the need to preserve forever \n     the knowledge and history of the most decisive achievement of \n     the United States during the 20th century and to portray that \n     history to citizens, scholars, visitors, and school children \n     for generations to come;\n       Whereas Congress appropriated funds in 1992 to authorize \n     the design and construction of the National D-Day Museum to \n     commemorate the epic 1944 Normandy invasion, and appropriated \n     additional funds in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2009 to \n     help expand the Museum to cover the entire experience of the \n     United States in World War II, and the transformational \n     impact on the United States and the world;\n       Whereas the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in \n     Washington, DC, will always be the symbolic memorial where \n     people come to remember the sacrifices made during World War \n     II;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum in New Orleans \n     will always be the educational institution where people come \n     to learn about the monumental struggle by the United States \n     against would-be oppressors, so that future generations can \n     understand the role the United States played in the \n     preservation and advancement of freedom in the middle of the \n     20th century;\n       Whereas the State of Louisiana and thousands of donors, \n     including foundations, companies, and Museum members in every \n     State, have contributed millions of dollars and other support \n     to help build and advance the National World War II Museum, \n     and hundreds of volunteers, many from the World War II era, \n     have provided invaluable assistance to the Museum;\n       Whereas the Board of Trustees of the National World War II \n     Museum, national in scope, and the Presidential Counselors \n     advisory group, featuring leading historians and museum \n     professionals, provide effective guidance and oversight for \n     the National World War II Museum;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum continues to add \n     to and maintain 1 of the largest personal history collections \n     in the United States, representing the experiences of the men \n     and women who fought in World War II and served on the home \n     front, with more than 7,000 videotaped, oral, and written \n     accounts in the collection, and plans to digitize the \n     collection to vastly improve public access;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum is an official \n     affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, with a formal \n     agreement to borrow Smithsonian artifacts for exhibits;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum collaborates with \n     other museums and memorials in the United States and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum has added major \n     facilities in recent years through donor support, including \n     the Solomon Victory Theater complex, which features a 4-D \n     theater, the Stage Door Canteen, a United Service \n     Organization-styled entertainment venue, and the Kushner \n     Restoration Pavilion, home to a major patrol torpedo boat \n     restoration project;\n       Whereas the National World War II Museum will open the \n     United States Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center in January \n     2013;\n       Whereas the Pavilion will feature aircraft such as the B-17 \n     bomber and the P-51 fighter, the latter flown by the Tuskegee \n     Airmen, and a submarine experience and exhibits honoring \n     Medal of Honor recipients, government leaders who served in \n     World War II, and industries that became known as the \n     ``Arsenal of Democracy''; and\n       Whereas other major pavilions and interactive exhibits are \n     planned or under development as the Museum anticipates the \n     completion of the campus by 2016, including the Campaigns of \n     Courage: European and Pacific Theaters Pavilion, the \n     Liberation Pavilion, and a Union Station train experience in \n     the original Louisiana Memorial Pavilion: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and applauds the planned January 12, 2013, \n     opening of the United States Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing \n     Center, an iconic pavilion funded in part by the Federal \n     Government and a major feature of the institution designated \n     by section 8134(c) of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-87;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of State Rewards \n     Program Update and Technical Corrections Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of State's existing rewards programs \n     permit the payment of reward for information leading to the \n     arrest or conviction of--\n       (A) individuals who have committed, or attempted or \n     conspired to commit, certain acts of international terrorism;\n       (B) individuals who have committed, or attempted or \n     conspired to commit, certain narcotics-related offenses; and\n       (C) individuals who have been indicted by certain \n     international criminal tribunals.\n       (2) The Department of State considers the rewards program \n     to be ``one of the most valuable assets the U.S. Government \n     has in the fight\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n     against international terrorism''. Since the program's \n     inception in 1984, the United States Government has rewarded \n     over 60 people who provided actionable information that, \n     according to the Department of State, prevented international \n     terrorist attacks or helped convict individuals involved in \n     terrorist attacks.\n       (3) The program has been credited with providing \n     information in several high-profile cases, including the \n     arrest of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing \n     of the World Trade Center, the deaths of Uday and Qusay \n     Hussein, who United States military forces located and killed \n     in Iraq after receiving information about their locations, \n     and the arrests or deaths of several members of the Abu \n     Sayyaf group, believed to be responsible for the kidnappings \n     and deaths of United States citizens and Filipinos in the \n     Philippines.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the rewards program of the Department of State should be \n     expanded in order to--\n       (1) address the growing threat to important United States \n     interests from transnational criminal activity, such as \n     intellectual property rights piracy, money laundering, \n     trafficking in persons, arms trafficking, and cybercrime; and\n       (2) target other individuals indicted by international, \n     hybrid, or mixed tribunals for genocide, war crimes, or \n     crimes against humanity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n618 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 618) observing the 100th birthday of \n     civil rights icon Rosa Parks and commemorating her legacy.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over a half century ago, Rosa Parks sparked \na revolution in American race relations when she decided that she would \nno longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial \nsegregation on a bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people but the \nentire world. Her stand on that December day in 1955 was not an \nisolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and \njustice. Twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had been arrested \nfor violating another one of the city's bus related segregation laws \nrequiring blacks to pay their fares at the front of the bus then get \noff of the bus and re-board from the rear of the bus. The driver of \nthat bus was the same driver with whom she would have her confrontation \nyears later.\n  Rosa Parks, by her quiet courage, symbolizes all that is vital about \nnonviolent protest, as she endured threats of death and persisted as an \nadvocate for the simple, basic lessons she taught the Nation and from \nwhich the Nation has benefitted immeasurably. The bus boycott which \nRosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that \nelevated the status of African Americans nationwide and introduced to \nthe world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday \ndeclared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  February 4, 2013, marks the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Rosa \nParks. In recognition of this occasion, I am immensely proud to be \njoined by 56 bipartisan cosponsors of S. Res. 618, which was just \nadopted unanimously by the Senate, observing the 100th birthday of Rosa \nParks and commemorating her legacy. I am especially pleased to have had \nthe input of Senators Stabenow, Sessions, and Alexander in the crafting \nof this resolution, which is befitting one who so significantly \ncontributed to the breaking down the barriers of legal discrimination \nagainst African Americans, and equality for us all.\n  Although Rosa Parks will be forever associated with one day in \nMontgomery, AL, she lived most of her life in my home state of \nMichigan, and we proudly claim her as our own. She continued to \ndedicate her life to advancing equal opportunity and to educating our \nyouth about the past struggles for freedom, from slavery up to the \ncivil rights movement of the 1960s.\n  In 1987, Rosa Parks and Elaine Steele co-founded the Rosa and Raymond \nParks Institute for Self-Development. Its primary focus has been \nworking with young people from across the country and the world as part \nof the ``Pathways to Freedom'' program. With the work of the Institute, \nwe can truly say that in addition to having played a major role in \nshaping America's past and present, Rosa Parks is continuing to help \nshape America's future.\n  In the spirit of the enormous contributions of Rosa Parks to this \nNation, the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn, MI will commemorate the \n100th birthday of Rosa Parks by calling for a national day of courage; \nand sponsoring a program that highlights her contributions to the civil \nrights movement. The activities will include a day-long celebration, \nwith both virtual and on-site activities featuring nationally-\nrecognized speakers, musical and dramatic interpretative performances, \na panel presentation of ``Rosa's Story'' and a reading of the tale \n``Quiet Strength,'' and will feature the actual bus on which Rosa Parks \nsat as the centerpiece in commemorating Rosa Parks' extraordinary life \nand accomplishments, and affording everyone the opportunity to board \nthe bus and sit in the seat that Rosa Parks refused to give up.\n  Mr. President, in November of 2005, upon her passing, Rosa Parks \nbecame the first woman in the history of the United States to lie in \nhonor in the Capitol Rotunda. And, a few years earlier on June 15, \n1999, Rosa Parks was presented with the highest honor of Congress, the \nCongressional Gold Medal, of which I was pleased to coauthor. I was \nalso pleased to be a part of the effort in directing the Architect of \nthe Capitol to commission a statue of Rosa Parks, which will soon be \nplaced in the U.S. Capitol, making her the second African American \nwoman to receive such an honor.\n  Mr. President, the cosponsors of the resolution are: Senators \nStabenow, Sessions, Alexander, Landrieu, Cochran, Harkin, Shelby, \nCornyn, Boxer, Murray, Coburn, Kerry, Hutchison, Gillibrand, Mr. Leahy, \nSanders, Reid, Mikulski, Durbin, Pryor, Nelson of Florida, Brown of \nOhio, Lieberman, Mr. Conrad, Lautenberg, Kohl, Cantwell, McCaskill, \nWyden, Coons, Baucus, Whitehouse, Manchin, Bennet, Cardin, Hagan, \nCasey, Begich, Menendez, Warner, Udall of New Mexico, Klobuchar, \nInouye, Corker, Johnson of South Dakota, Franken, Rockefeller, Udall of \nColorado, Blumenthal, Akaka, Reed, Shaheen, Webb, McCain, Lugar, and \nGrassley.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will agree to S. \nRes. 618, a resolution observing the 100th birthday of civil rights \nicon Rosa Parks, and commemorating her legacy. It is hard to believe \nthat 57 years have passed since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \non a public bus, a heroic act for a young woman from Tuskegee, AL, who \njoined so many in the fight for civil rights. I am proud of the \nprogress this country has made toward equality for all, in large part \nthanks to the work and inspiration of leaders like Rosa Parks, although \nwe as a Nation have more work to do.\n  Rosa's brave act of defiance inspired a city-wide boycott and \nnational movement, and she remains an important symbol of the civil \nrights movement to this day. Her legacy reminds Vermonters and \nAmericans all over the country that one brave voice or action can shine \na light on injustice and challenge society to accept nothing less than \nfreedom and equality for all mankind.\n  In 2006 I was proud to work to reauthorize one of the most important \ncivil rights laws in our history and to have that voting rights \nlegislation bare Rosa Parks' name. Unfortunately, some are trying to \noverturn that protective and important law despite the continuing \nthreat to the right to vote. As we commemorate her birth 100 years ago, \nI hope we can all agree that threats to civil rights are not a relic of \nthe past. To honor Rosa Parks' memory, we must continue to fight to \nensure that all Americans can vote and have their vote counted. I thank \nSenator Levin for submitting this resolution and am proud to join him \nin commemorating the legacy of Rosa Parks.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements be placed in the Record.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 618) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 618\n\n       Whereas Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was born on February 4, \n     1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the first child of James and \n     Leona (Edwards) McCauley;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks dedicated her life to the cause of \n     universal human rights and truly embodied the love of \n     humanity and freedom;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was arrested on December 1, 1955, in \n     Montgomery, Alabama, for\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\n     refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a White man, and her \n     stand for equal rights became legendary;\n       Whereas news of the arrest of Rosa Parks resulted in \n     approximately 42,000 African-Americans boycotting Montgomery \n     buses for 381 days, beginning on December 5, 1955, until the \n     bus segregation law was changed on December 21, 1956;\n       Whereas the United States Supreme Court ruled on November \n     13, 1956, that the Montgomery segregation law was \n     unconstitutional, and on December 20, 1956, Montgomery \n     officials were ordered to desegregate buses;\n       Whereas the civil rights movement led to the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 Stat. 241), which broke \n     down the barrier of legal discrimination against African-\n     Americans and made equality before the law a reality for all \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks has been honored as the ``first lady of \n     civil rights'' and the ``mother of the freedom movement'', \n     and her quiet dignity ignited the most significant social \n     movement in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Rosa Parks and her close associate Elaine \n     Steele cofounded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for \n     Self Development to motivate and direct youth to achieve \n     their highest potential through Rosa Parks' philosophy of \n     ``quiet strength'' and cross-cultural exposure for nurturing \n     a global and inclusive perspective;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was the recipient of many awards and \n     accolades for her efforts on behalf of racial harmony, \n     including the Congressional Gold Medal, the Spingarn Award, \n     which is the highest honor of the National Association for \n     the Advancement of Colored People for civil rights \n     contributions, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which \n     is the highest civilian honor in the United States, and was \n     named one of the 20 most influential and iconic figures of \n     the 20th century;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks sparked one of the largest movements in \n     the United States against racial segregation, and by her \n     quiet courage symbolizes all that is vital about nonviolent \n     protest because of the way she endured threats of death and \n     persisted as an advocate for the basic lessons she taught the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks and her husband Raymond Parks relocated \n     to Michigan in 1957, and remained in Michigan until the death \n     of Rosa Parks on October 24, 2005;\n       Whereas, on Tuesday, October 26, 2005 the United States \n     Senate adopted a Resolution expressing its condolences on the \n     passing of Rosa Parks, and honored her life and \n     accomplishments;\n       Whereas, in recognition of the historic contributions of \n     Rosa Parks, her remains were placed in the rotunda of the \n     Capitol from October 30 to October 31, 2005, so that the \n     people of the United States could pay their last respects to \n     this great American;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, Congress authorized the Joint \n     Committee on the Library to procure a statue of Rosa Parks to \n     be placed in the Capitol;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service will issue a stamp \n     in February 2013 to honor Rosa Parks and her courage to act \n     at a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas, the bus on which Rosa Parks sparked a new era in \n     the American quest for freedom and equality is one of the \n     most significant artifacts of the American civil rights \n     movement and is on permanent display in the Henry Ford Museum \n     in Dearborn, Michigan;\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2013, the Henry Ford Museum, will \n     commemorate the 100th birthday of Rosa Parks by calling for a \n     National Day of Courage and sponsoring a program that \n     highlights her contributions to the civil rights movement, \n     including a day-long celebration, with both virtual and on-\n     site activities featuring nationally recognized speakers, \n     musical and dramatic interpretative performances, a panel \n     presentation of ``Rosa's Story'' and a reading of the tale \n     ``Quiet Strength'', featuring the actual bus on which Rosa \n     Parks sat as the centerpiece in commemorating Rosa Parks' \n     extraordinary life and accomplishments, and affording \n     everyone the opportunity to board the bus and sit in the seat \n     that Rosa Parks refused to give up;

and\n       (2) commemorates the legacy of Rosa Parks to inspire all \n     people of the United States to stand up for freedom and the \n     principles of the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
