I move to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940, a bill to \n     amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to restore \n     the financial solvency of the flood insurance fund, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senate will continue to debate the farm bill today. We \nhave a couple of votes lined up. We expect to have those this morning.\n\n\n                           Not to Compromise\n\n  Last week, in a moment of candor, House Republicans, led by \nRepresentative Cantor, admitted they have given up legislating until \nafter the election. Although there is far more work to be done, they \nhave said they are going to have a timeout. I repeat, there is so much \nto be done--especially building on 27 straight months of private sector \njob growth--Republicans in the House are lurching from one recess to \nthe next long recess. They don't take short ones, they take long ones. \nLast week's unscripted moment was a window into today's Republican \nParty--a party that obviously cares more about winning elections than \ncreating jobs.\n  Then a couple of days ago we had another frank assessment of the \nRepublican agenda. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said Monday that \nhis father, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan would not fit into \ntoday's Republican Party. He went on to elaborate about some of the \nissues in which they are simply headed in the wrong direction. Governor \nBush said today's GOP is defined by ``an orthodoxy that doesn't allow \nfor disagreement.''\n  He is right. The Republican Party no longer has room for moderates or \nanyone unwilling to march in lockstep with the radical tea party. That \nis apparent every day on Capitol Hill--more so in the House than in the \nSenate, but it has now infected the Senate. It was obvious from the \nfirst weeks of this Congress that the House was taken over by \nextremists with no desire to work for the sake of the economy and\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nno concept of the meaning of compromise--and legislation is the art of \ncompromise.\n  But over the last year and a half it has become clear that \nRepublicans in the Senate are also in thrall to the tea party. We see \nthe extremism in this Chamber--I have just mentioned that--where \nRepublicans have blocked or stalled most every jobs creation measure we \nhave brought to the floor. We see it on the campaign trail, where Mitt \nRomney told a crowd he opposes hiring anymore teachers, firefighters, \nand police officers. Putting more teachers in the classroom used to be \na goal Democrats and Republicans could agree on. But all over the \ncountry, things are happening just as happened in Nevada a couple of \ndays ago, where the school district--let's see, it must be about the \nthird or fourth largest school district now in the country, the Clark \nCounty school district, with well more than 300,000 students--indicated \nthey were going to lay off 1,000 teachers. But as a result of not \nfilling some positions because of retirements, they were able to have \nto only lay off about 400-some-odd people. It is happening all over the \ncountry.\n\n  Sending more cops out on patrol used to be something that--I can \nremember when Joe Biden was down here fighting for his COPS Program. \nPolice departments in Nevada loved the opportunity to get more people \non the street. That is the way it was all over the country. We used to \nfight to get more cops on the street. Now we are doing everything we \ncan to stop the layoffs, and we can't do enough because we can't get a \nbill passed over here to help. Hiring more brave men and women to fight \nfires and save lives used to be a goal Democrats and Republicans could \nagree on. Not now.\n  Because of global warming, there are fires raging all over the West. \nI spoke to Senator Bingaman from New Mexico yesterday. That fire in New \nMexico is 400,000 acres and, he said, we have another fire that has \nbroken out of only 40,000 acres. On the news this morning out of \nColorado, one person has been killed, scores of buildings and homes \nburned to the ground. The tankers they are using to fight these fires \nare old. One of them crashed in Nevada last week, killing the pilots.\n  But today's radical Republicans have another agenda--not hiring more \ncops and not doing something to stop the teacher layoffs, but their \ngoal is to drag down the economy because it is good for their politics. \nThey believe the more horrible the economy is, the better off they are \ngoing to be in November. They love bad news.\n  We still have the fact that even though there were more than 8 \nmillion jobs lost during the Bush administration, we have been \nfortunate to bring back 4.3 million of those jobs. But we could have \ndone so much more with the jobs measures we have brought before this \nbody that were lost on procedural grounds over here.\n  Yesterday Governor Bush said his father and President Reagan--neither \nof whom could win a Republican primary today--both ``sacrificed \npolitical points for good public policy.''\n  I believe that. I was not a pal of Ronald Reagan's. I met him and \nworked with him. But Paul Laxalt--who retired, and I ran for his spot--\nwas his pal, his friend. Ronald Reagan would not put up with what is \ngoing on here today, because there is no question that with Ronald \nReagan the country came first, not elections.\n  I have great admiration for the first President Bush. I have in my \nprivate possessions a couple of handwritten notes he wrote to me. He \nwould not put up with what is going on today. He was a pragmatist. He \nwanted to get things done for our country. He wasn't an ideologue. He \nwas conservative. Certainly no one is better qualified to be President \nthan the first Bush. He was a Congressman, head of the CIA, head of the \nRepublican National Committee, the Vice President, Ambassador to China. \nHe was interested in his country, not elections. He was a Republican, \nbut we could work with him.\n  Today's Republicans aren't interested in good policy and, obviously, \nthey aren't interested in creating jobs. They are too obsessed with \ndefeating President Obama. That is their No. 1 goal. But don't take my \nword for it. The minority leader said so himself. This is what he said:\n\n       The single most important thing we want to achieve is for \n     President Obama to be a one-term President.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  America is battling its way back from the greatest recession since \nthe Great Depression. And although we have created 4.3 million private \nsector jobs, there is so much more to be done.\n  I just left a meeting with people interested in infrastructure. We \nhave 70,000 bridges in America that need repair and replacement. Not \n700, not 7,000 but 70,000. The highway bill is hung up over in the \nHouse someplace. They aren't focused on jobs because they are too busy \nchecking the political scoreboard.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, tomorrow, the President plans to \ndeliver a speech to once again tout his favorite approach to the \neconomy. I say that because aides to the President say we should not \nexpect much new in the speech. We can expect more of the same: More \ngovernment, more debt, and higher taxes to pay for it all.\n  According to news reports, some Democrats are starting to get a \nlittle wary of this approach. A number of folks who worked in the \nClinton administration have suggested something more positive. But \nothers are pleading with the President to double down on the message \nthat government is the answer.\n  So far it appears as though the hard-left wing of the party has the \nupper hand. As liberal columnist E.J. Dionne suggested recently in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       Let's turn [Reagan's] declaration on its head. Opposition \n     to government isn't the solution.\n\n  Opposition to government was and remains the problem, and that is \nprecisely what the President appears to be doing--doubling down on the \nsame government-driven solutions that have kept the private sector \nmired in what some are calling the worst recovery ever.\n  These folks have so much faith in government that they seem blind to \nany failure or excess. They make no distinction between the things \ngovernment has done well in the past and the things it does not do well \nnow.\n  They have no limiting principle whatsoever. This is their logic: If \nyou like the Hoover Dam, you should support bureaucrats making higher \nsalaries and better benefits than the taxpayers who are paying for \nthem. If you like the Transcontinental Railroad, you should support a \n$1 trillion stimulus bill that has been more effective at creating \npunch lines for late night comedians than it has at creating jobs. If \nyou like the GI bill, they believe you must also embrace a debt-to-GDP \nratio that makes us look like Greece.\n  These folks seem to have no limiting principle whatsoever when it \ncomes to the growth of government. They have blind faith in it. It is \nthe only thing they ever seem to want, and they are completely out of \ntouch.\n  The President wants you to believe the reason we are in this economic \nslump is because States and local governments have been laying off \ngovernment workers. But what he does not tell you, and what the \nAmerican people will not hear him say tomorrow, is that since the \nrecession began, for every government worker who has lost a job 11 \nprivate sector jobs have been lost--for every government worker who has \nlost a job 11 private sector jobs have been lost.\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\n  Another thing you will not hear the President say is that public \nsector unemployment is just over 4 percent--unemployment among public \nworkers, just over 4 percent--while all other private sector industries \nare at least twice that. So government employment is not the problem. \nIt is the private sector that is suffering, and it is the private \nsector where we need to focus our policies.\n  So the battle lines are clear: After 3\\1/2\\ years of failure, \nDemocrats in Washington have one suggestion: more of the same. The \nPresident can repackage it however he wants tomorrow, but that is what \nit amounts to: more government, more debt, and fewer jobs--and that is \nnot what Americans want.\n  Republicans have refused to go along with this approach, and we will \ncontinue to oppose it until the Democrats recognize what most Americans \nalready seem to know: government is not the answer to what ails us; \ngovernment is not the answer to what ails us. It does not mean \ngovernment does not do some things well. It means government has its \nlimits, and we have reached them.\n  I saw a story line this week about a high school in Utah. It said the \nschool has been fined $15,000 for selling carbonated drinks. The school \nhas been fined $15,000 for selling carbonated drinks. Why? Because \nFederal nutrition guidelines say the school cannot sell sugary drinks \nduring lunch hour. Students could buy them before lunch and drink them \nduring lunch, but they cannot buy them during lunch and drink them \nduring lunch. The government will not allow it.\n  Madam President, we are not talking about the Transcontinental \nRailroad. We are talking about a government that has no sense of its \nown limits under the constitution and a President who does not seem to \nbe willing to embrace anything that does not start and end with a \ngovernment bureaucrat calling the shots.\n  It is time for a change, and here is what I would suggest: One, the \nDemocrat-led Senate should pass a budget. It has not done so in 3 \nyears. Two, the Senate should take up the 28 job-related bills the \nHouse Republicans passed that are collecting dust on the majority \nleader's desk. Three, we should pass comprehensive tax reform; and, \nfour, entitlement reform. This Nation will not be able to get out from \nunder the mountain of debt we have without addressing the out-of-\ncontrol spending related to these programs. They are simply \nunsustainable.\n  As I said yesterday, without Presidential leadership, it simply \ncannot happen. The same failed policies are not going to cut it. The \nonly question is whether Democrats in Washington are capable of seeing \nthat.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the speaker situation? Do I have \nsome time now to respond to the Republican leader?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Currently, the time is under \ncontrol of the Republican leader for the next 27 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I would ask if I could have 2 minutes just to respond \nto my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we are going to divide time; are we \nnot?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the Senator from California \nuse Democratic time, and the time on this side be reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask that I be allowed to speak on the \nDemocratic side's time for up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Republican leader.\n  It just stuns me when the Republican leader comes to the floor and \nhas his ``blame Obama'' moment every day that he can. I thought this \none was over the top. It is as if President Obama came in and \neverything was great and suddenly things are not going well.\n  Excuse me, I was here. I know. I remember when we had surpluses under \nBill Clinton and the Democrats, and the Republicans turned it into \ndeficits as far as the eye could see.\n  I cannot forget that because I remember a time when there was \ndiscussion about whether we were even going to have U.S. Treasurys \nanymore because we were not going to have debt anymore when Bill \nClinton was President, and the Democrats set us on that right course. \nWe had a balance between investments in our people and fair taxes so \nthat the top 1 percent paid a fair share, and everybody did well.\n\n  Madam President, 23 million new jobs were created with Bill Clinton. \nThen George W. comes in. Two wars go on the credit card, tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest few--the millionaires and billionaires--on the credit \ncard, and suddenly we have a crisis: No regulation of these \nsophisticated securities.\n  My friend in the chair, the Acting President pro tempore, knows well \nwhat happened: no oversight, derivatives, new kinds of securities, \ntaking a beautiful home ownership ethic we had in this country and \ngambling on it. What happened? The worst crisis since the Great \nDepression.\n  Who comes into office? President Obama takes the oath. The \nunbelievable crisis he inherited and the unbelievable debt he inherited \nand the unbelievable budget deficit he inherited was just unbelievable. \nAn auto industry was going to be gone.\n  My friend Senator McConnell has a right to his opinion, and I respect \nit so much except he avoids telling the facts about how we got where we \nare. The American people do not suffer from amnesia. They understand \nthis. They saw this President, this young President come in, faced with \njobs bleeding 800,000 a month. Yes, he turned it around. Yes, he did, \nin fact, promote a rescue of the auto industry. We would have been the \nonly great economy that did not have one if it was not for his courage. \nYes, a couple of courageous votes on the Republican side joining with \nDemocrats--that was a good moment. Yes, as Mitt Romney said: Oh yeah, \nthey could have gone busto, bankrupt. We did not feel that way here. \nThe President did not feel that way.\n  So all of this Obama bashing on the floor of the Senate is going to \ncontinue because Senator McConnell is a very straightforward person, \nand he said--and I quote not the exact words, the sentiment, close to \nthe exact words: Defeating President Obama is the highest priority of \nthe Republicans. We are seeing that play out on this floor. I pledged \nthat I would come here when I could to straighten out the record.\n  So let's be clear. This President took over in the worst of times \nsince the Great Depression. There have been millions of jobs created--\nnot enough. I will say this: If this economy sputters, this economic \nrecovery we are in sputters, and has a hard time because of the depth \nof the crisis originally--the fact that the housing crisis still \ncontinues, the fact that there are problems in the global marketplace \nin Europe, and all of these factors--I want to say this: I want the \nperson in the Oval Office to be a person who understands what is \nhappening, and that is President Obama, who relates to working people, \nwho relates to the middle class, who is not building an elevator for \nhis cars in San Diego. That is how I feel.\n  Every time there is an attack on this President, I am going to come \ndown here and tell the truth to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I heard the remarks of my colleague \nfrom California, and I just cannot let the record stand that President \nObama took over in the worst circumstances of our time. Really? The \ndebt of this country was around $10 trillion when President Obama took \noffice. In just 3\\1/2\\ years, that debt has almost doubled. We are now \nover $15 trillion and will soon be hitting the $16 trillion debt \nceiling limit in just 3\\1/2\\ years. We are in a debt crisis not from \nthe previous administration, we are in a debt crisis because we are \nspending too much, we are borrowing too much, and the President keeps \ntalking about more taxes.\n  Just last Friday, the President came out and said: ``The private \nsector is doing [just] fine.'' It is government that is in a crisis. \nWell, yes, government is in a crisis. The private sector\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nis not doing just fine, and the government crisis is not caused because \nwe are losing government jobs.\n  The government crisis is caused because we are spending too much, and \nwe are going into debt that is unsustainable in this country.\n  For the millions of Americans who are out of work in this country, \nthe President's assessment of the private sector must be like salt \npoured in a wound. My goodness, we have seen job numbers of over 8 \npercent unemployment since the President took office. The last 3 months \nhave been not so good. We are still over 8 percent, and we went up a \nlittle bit to 8.2 percent in May.\n  So to the nearly 13 million Americans who are unemployed and the \nmillions more who are underemployed or have left the labor force \naltogether because they have lost hope--Mr. President, things are not \nfine, and the private sector is not fine in this country, and the \nmiddle class is bearing the brunt.\n  On top of the unemployment rate for those who are in poverty \nconditions, the people who hold jobs are also losing ground. On Monday, \nthe Federal Reserve reported that the median net worth of American \nfamilies fell 39 percent between 2007 and 2010. We have not seen these \nlevels since 1992.\n  During the same period, incomes also dropped sharply. Average \nhousehold income fell 11 percent to $78,500, down from $88,300. The \nhardest hit? Families in the rapidly diminishing middle class. While \nthese statistics are troubling, there is a concern that cannot be \nmeasured in dollars and cents; that is, that families are losing faith \nin a secure future. There was a time when every generation had a better \nquality of life and expected a better quality of life for their \nchildren than their parents had. That is not the case today.\n  In 2010, 35 percent of families said they did not have a good idea of \nwhat their income would be just for the next year. That was 31.4 \npercent in 2007, 35 percent now. So the number of families who are \nlosing the faith that their children are going to have a better life \nthan they have had is diminishing.\n  How could they be confident? The job creators in the private sector \nare the ones under siege. I cannot believe the President of the United \nStates is so off base as to say the private sector is doing fine. Just \nthis week, the National Federation of Independent Business released its \nmonthly survey of small business optimism. Survey results continue to \nbe historically low and consistent with the subpar performance of gross \ndomestic product.\n  According to this survey, levels of hiring and spending remained \ndepressed in May. We all know that. More important, so did plans for \nthe future. The same report states that expectations for increasing \nfuture sales continued to be weak in May, far below readings recorded \nin any other similar period since 1973.\n  Many small business owners are reluctant to expand their businesses \nor hire more workers. Small business owners who expect the economy to \nfurther deteriorate outnumber those who think there will be an \nimprovement. Small businesses are our Nation's primary job creators. \nSmall business provided 55 percent of all jobs in the private sector.\n  Small business has created two of every three net jobs in the United \nStates since the early 1970s. So I would say to the President of the \nUnited States, it is small business that is the economic engine of \nAmerica, not government. That is the fundamental disagreement we have \nwith this administration.\n  We must spur the private sector to create income, growth, and \nsecurity in this country. The private sector is not doing fine. What \nshould we be doing to help Americans get back to work? We need to \naddress what is causing the uncertainty. Why are businesses not hiring? \nBecause government spending that serves to crowd out the private sector \nis increasing. There are tax increases being talked about by the \nPresident constantly.\n  So they are looking at looming tax increases, burdensome regulations \nthat they see coming by the bills, such as this, out of the U.S. \nGovernment. Those regulations hamper job growth in this country.\n  Then, on top of all that, on top of the talk of new taxes, on top of \nthe burdensome regulations our small businesses face every day, in \nbigger numbers every day, it is the health care law that was passed 2 \nyears ago this December.\n  If we want people to be hired, we cannot saddle our entrepreneurs and \nsmall businesses with new taxes, more regulations, and the cost, the \noverwhelming burden of the Obama health care plan.\n  President Obama, in an interview yesterday, dismissed questions from \na small business owner about the negative impact of the health care law \nand what it is already doing to small businesses. Anybody who has paid \ntheir part of insurance, if they are lucky enough to be covered, knows \nthat the premiums have increased and the coverage has decreased in \nanticipation of the Obama health care law, adding the new burden and \ncost on insurance companies, hospitals, doctors.\n  The costs of doing business in health care are increasing in \nanticipation of that health care law taking full effect in the next \nyear. I have heard so much opposition in my home State when I travel \naround from small businesses that are just throwing up their hands and \nsaying: I cannot provide the government-approved health care for my \nemployees, which is going to mean I will have a new tax burden for \nevery one of them as they then have to go on the government plan and \nfend for themselves.\n  Even families are going to have to do it or they will have to pay a \ntax. It is not just a good plan, it is the government-approved plan. So \nif they provide 35 percent of their employees' premiums, which is what \nthey can afford, but the government requires more than that, they will \nstill have to pay the fine. The small businesses are saying: I am going \nto pay the fine because that is my only alternative. Those with more \nthan 50 employees, will have costly new Federal regulations to comply \nwith. The financial penalty is so great we are seeing businesses stop \nat 49 so they will not have more workers and therefore have a bigger \nresponsibility.\n  I received a letter from a small business owner in Arlington who said \nit best: ``Did Congress and the President know they were going to \nfreeze our country's businesses' ability to help grow this economy when \nthey passed this bill?'' I will point out that not one Republican in \nthe House or Senate voted for this bill in Congress. So I would have to \nsay to my small business constituent in Arlington: This was the \nDemocrats in Congress and the President's bill. Not one Republican \nwould support it because of the fear of exactly what is happening; that \nis, small business owners are losing faith that they will be able to \ngrow, and that is what is causing the economic crisis we are in with \nunemployment over 8 percent.\n  A small business owner in Corpus Christi, TX, who has 34 employees \ntold my office that his company's cheapest option for health insurance \nwould boost premiums by 44 percent over last year. How can they do it? \nIt is happening everywhere. I hear it everywhere I go. Clearly, this is \nnot the incentive our economy needs right now.\n  We need government to get out of the way of the job creators in this \ncountry not block their path with miles of regulations, new burdens and \ncosts--new regulations, new costs--and then the talk of new taxes which \nis prevalent everywhere.\n  Our best hope is that the Supreme Court will see this has a \nconstitutional problem. Then we can start again and take a step-by-step \nreform. That will do what all of us want to do. Everyone in Congress \nand the President had the same goal; that is, to have more Americans \nwith affordable coverage and options.\n  But that is not the bill that was passed, and it is why Republicans \ncould not possibly support it, because they saw the burdens on \nfamilies, on businesses, and they knew it was not going to encourage \nhiring, which is what we need in this country. We have a chance to \nstart a process that will be positive. We need to do something to spur \nsmall business in this economy.\n  One thing that could be done, which is in discussions right now, is \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline, which would create a $7 billion, shovel-\nready, privately funded project that would transport over 700,000 \nbarrels of oil from Canada\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nto the United States. It has been estimated it would create 20,000 \nconstruction jobs and as many as 100,000 jobs at refineries and other \nbusinesses.\n  By the way, we would be trading with a friendly partner, Canada, so \nwe would not have to import more from unfriendly parts of the Middle \nEast, and we would also be able to know that these are privately funded \njobs, not one government cent. In fact, it would create taxes being \npaid to the government because people would be working, and that is the \nway we should be growing our revenue in this country.\n  But the President suggested a different solution. He said the answer \nis not to spur the private sector because they are doing just fine. He \nsaid let's spend more money bailing out the States because they are \nhaving a hard time. They are having a hard time. We can do something \nfor the States, and it is not bailing them out with more borrowed \nFederal dollars that will continue to weigh down the dollar itself. No. \nWe can do something for State governments; that is, stop sending \nFederal mandates that we do not pay for that we require them to do, put \na moratorium on Federal mandates on States today. Let's start repealing \nthese Federal mandates we are requiring States to absorb. It is killing \ntheir economies.\n  Medicaid and the lack of flexibility in Medicaid is the biggest \nexpense most States have. It is a Federal mandate unpaid for and \ninflexible, not the choice States could make to cover the people who \nneed the help. We can help the States but not at the expense of our \ndollar and our debt.\n  So the President is suggesting more spending and bailing out States, \nand we are offering a solution that says let's create jobs in the \nprivate sector. Keystone XL is ready to go right now, private sector, \n100,000 future jobs, not one penny from the Federal Government.\n  Let's take these Federal regulations and let's put a moratorium on \nthem right now and free our small businesses to be the entrepreneurs \nthat built this country. It was the entrepreneurs who built this \ncountry in freedom. This country has been a magnet for people coming \nfrom all over the world because they could do their research in \nfreedom. They could grow in freedom. They could keep the fruits of \ntheir labor and give their kids a better chance than they had, which \nthey could not get in their home country. That is what built this \ncountry.\n  We can get right back there, but it is not by borrowing more, \nspending more, taxing more, and regulating our small businesses out of \nexistence. We can do something positive, and it is time we got started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I, too, wish to rise and talk some \nabout the President's statement of last Friday but from maybe a \ndifferent approach than one might imagine.\n  The President said he thought the private sector was doing just fine. \nI was driving in the car when I heard the statement, and the statement \ntook me back because I feared the President might not actually know how \nthe private sector truly was doing.\n  Twelve weeks ago, I spent a week on the road doing townhalls, \nknocking on doors, visiting with Georgians. I come to the floor to \nprovide some information to the President that maybe the private sector \nisn't doing that well, and maybe there is something we can do about \nit--this administration and this Senate--because right now we are doing \nnothing and America is languishing because of problems, some of which \nare our making.\n  The private sector, by definition, is everybody other than the \ngovernment sector; at least that is my definition. Let me talk about \neverybody other than the government sector for a minute and why they \nare not doing very well. Let me talk about the homebuilder I met in \nValdosta, GA, who talked to me about the fact that he had just sold a \nhome he built. I said that is great; house sales are getting better. He \nsaid, the only problem is I could not get an appraisal for what it cost \nme to build the house, so I am selling it, but I am selling it at a \nloss. Part of that is because of the regulation and oppression that is \non appraisers right now because of a fear of appraisal fraud.\n  Or the tomato farmer I talked to from Bainbridge, GA. He talked about \nthe indignation he had when the Labor Department promulgated a rule--\nthey did not end up passing it--that would have said you have to be 18 \nyears or older to work on a farm, even if it was your family farm--an \noverreach of the Department of Labor that, fortunately, they pulled \nback, but the type of overreach that causes people to retrench, not \nbuild and expand and move their business forward.\n  Or the 81-year-old community banker I talked to yesterday on the \nphone, from Calhoun, GA, who had a significant amount of his savings \ninvested in stock in the community bank he had been a part of so much \nof his life, which is now under a cease-and-desist letter from the FDIC \nand is being managed under what is called a cease-and-desist order, \nwhich means the FDIC is basically running the bank, or limiting its \nparameters. The bank is slowly but surely dissipating its capital base \nuntil it gets to 2 percent and then the Feds will come in and close the \nbank and transfer its assets to a bigger bank and give them an 80-\npercent loss share guarantee, and the bigger bank will foreclose on the \nproperty and move forward.\n  In fact, what was intended by Dodd-Frank to reduce too big to fail \nand empower banks has done the opposite; the bigger banks have gotten \nbigger, the smaller banks have become fewer, and American banking and \ncapital investment is less.\n  Or the hospital I visited in Thomasville, GA, which just finished its \ncompletion, the Archibald Center--a great center. They were talking \nabout the difficulties they were having with employees and the fear \nthey had that the NLRB mini-union ruling on Specialty Health Care was \nactually going to become the law of the land through regulation, where \nmicro units within a facility could actually unionize, where just \nnurses in the emergency room, or in the ICU, could unionize, and \neverybody else would not. Can you imagine a hospital, department store, \nor a manufacturer with a union in the shoe department, a union in the \nnursing department, a union in the lumber department, a union on the \nloading dock, micro unions throughout the organization? You could not \nfunction; you couldn't cross-train, you couldn't manage. You would \nweight the playing field between management and labor in favor of labor \nand to the detriment of the investor who made the investment.\n  I could go on and on. It is those visits that I have talked about, \nthe people in those cities I have talked to in Georgia, people in the \nprivate sector--they are not doing well. And it is for fear of \noverregulation and of uncertainty. If we can do anything to empower our \neconomy in the short run in America, we can call time out and say \nenough is enough.\n  As I told a member of the administration 2 weeks ago, the \nadministration, I think, wants to eliminate risk. Our job is not to \neliminate; it is to mitigate risk. If you eliminate risk, you take the \npower of investments in the private sector, entrepreneurship, and \ncapital risk, you take it out the window. You can't eliminate risk, but \nyou can mitigate risk. So let's get back to mitigating risk, making \nsure we have a safe workplace, but where capital investment can be \nmade. Let's make sure we mitigate risk in banking, but not so much that \nwe choke out the small family banker. Let's make sure that agricultural \nworkers are safe, but that the son of a farmer can work on his father's \nown farm. Let's make sure we are not overreaching so far that we are \nmaking the private sector's plight worse than it is today.\n  My message to the Senate and to the President of the United States is \nthat the private sector is not just fine. Though it may not all be of \nthe government's making, part of it is. We are making it worse. We are \ntrying to run a country based on the three-legged stool of legislative, \njudicial, and the executive branch, on a two-legged stool of regulation \nthrough the executive branch and judicial regulation through the \njudicial branch--cutting out the legislative branch. Do you know what \nhappens to two-legged stools? They fall over. The private sector is \nfalling over, and it is, in part or in whole, because of us.\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n  I hope the President understands that there is a private sector that \npays the taxes and makes America work--a private sector that is \nhurting--and we can help the private sector. Let's put our nose and \nshoulder to the grindstone, and let's move forward in these months \nleading up to the election and change some of the overregulation and \nempower the private sector, not accept that we think it is doing just \nfine.\n  I end with this, the front page of the USA Today. Average family \nwealth net worth in the United States has declined 39.4 percent, back \nto the level of 1992, which simply means the private sector has lost 20 \nyears of accumulation, equity, and investment in the economy of the \nlast 3 years. That is unacceptable. It is why we have the depression we \nhave in this country. We need to get our shoulder to the grindstone, \nmake it work, and let the private sector be just fine again because of \nan empowerment of the private sector, entrepreneurship, and capital \ninvestment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we have six Senators, including the \noccupant of the chair, the Senator from New York, on the floor today in \nthe majority time to discuss the jammed bipartisan Senate highway bill.\n  I heard my colleague from Georgia talk about how we are doing nothing \nand America is languishing. One of the things we are doing nothing on \nis passing a highway bill that should not be complicated. But it is \njammed up by the House Republicans and, as a result, people in Rhode \nIsland and elsewhere are suffering. I will be here throughout our \nmajority period. I think the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire were here first, so I yield to them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his leadership in bringing us all together. We have to get this \ntransportation bill done. This is a bill that passed the Senate with 74 \nvotes. So we are here today to say to our colleagues over in the House \nand to ask our colleagues on the Republican side in the Senate to ask \nthe Republicans in the House to get this bill done.\n  Cold-weather States, such as Minnesota, it is sometimes said, have \ntwo seasons: the winter season and the construction season. This kind \nof delay can be crippling. We have a much smaller window of time to get \nthese projects done.\n  We have people waiting in traffic. We ask the House, why are we \nmaking them wait? We look at the cost when we delay construction \nprojects--the cost to taxpayers. Everybody knows if you wait too long \nto work on a project, and you are doing something on your house and you \nwait years to get it done, the costs go up.\n  We ask our friends in the House, why are they allowing this to happen \nand making this delay? Look at contractors, construction workers, and \nengineering firms. They need consistency. Why is the House making them \nwait?\n  Look at Caterpillar, a business that employs 750 people in my State. \nThey make road paving equipment and have a manufacturing facility. I \nwas there addressing the employees. They gave me a pink hat. There are \npeople working all over that company. They want more jobs, and they \nwant to make things in America, and they want to export to the world. \nWe are not going to be able to do that if we don't have the roads and \nbridges that can take our goods to market. We ask the House of \nRepresentatives, why are we making these private employers wait? The \nbill makes critical reforms to our transportation policy.\n  Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a \nreport announcing that 58 percent of high school seniors said they had \ntexted or e-mailed while driving in the previous month, and 43 percent \nof high school juniors said they do the same thing. This bill includes \nprovisions to help prevent texting while driving, and incentives--the \ntwo of us together, Madam President, worked on the graduated driver's \nlicense standards in this bill.\n  Why are we making the parents of America wait while their kids are \ntexting while driving? It makes reforms in the bill to transportation \npolicy, reduces the number of highway programs from over 100 to about \n30. So the Republicans in the House--how can they explain that they are \nmaking America wait to reform and make these programs less duplicative? \nIt defines clear national goals for transportation policy, and it \nstreamlines environmental permitting.\n  Why would you make America wait? That is what we are asking the House \nof Representatives today. Nobody knows better than Minnesota what \nhappens if you neglect roads and bridges: The 35 W bridge crashed down \nin the middle of a river 6 blocks from my house.\n  So we ask the House of Representatives, why are you making the people \nof America wait?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \ntalking about why it is so important to pass this transportation bill. \nI thank Senator Whitehouse for organizing this effort.\n  In New Hampshire, we understand what Senator Klobuchar was saying, \nthat it is important to get this bill passed so we can get our \nconstruction season underway. We have a limited amount of time. In only \n17 days, this Nation's surface transportation programs are going to \nshut down unless Congress acts to reauthorize them.\n  In March, nearly three-quarters of this Senate voted to pass a \nbipartisan, long-term transportation bill that maintains current \nfunding levels and avoids an increase in both the deficit and in gas \ntaxes. This legislation is important as we look at roads and bridges \nand mass transit that are going to have support. It is important as we \nlook at the jobs in the construction industry and manufacturing \nbusinesses that depend on our transportation system.\n  In fact, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that for every \n$1 billion in highway spending, we support about 27,000 jobs. I was \npleased last week to see an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the \nHouse vote to reject policies that will cut spending on roads and \npublic transit by one-third. If that had passed, an estimated 2,000 New \nHampshire jobs would have been lost. I think that vote sends an \nimportant signal to members of the conference committee that there is a \nstrong bipartisan majority in both Houses of Congress to support \nfunding for crucial investments in our transportation network.\n  I call on the House to work with the Senate in a similar bipartisan \nmanner, as we did in the Senate, to pass transportation policies that \nput Americans back to work and generate economic growth. We have seen \nit in New Hampshire, where we have 29 construction projects that are \ngoing to be on hold if we cannot get transportation legislation passed \nhere. We have seen it with Interstate 93, one of our main corridors \ngoing up and down the middle of our State, which has been delayed \nbecause of the delay in passing this transportation bill.\n  If we are unable to set aside election year amendments, unable to set \naside this partisan politics and come together to do what is right for \nour country and our economy and pass a transportation bill, it will be \nputting this country in a very difficult situation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the highway trust \nfund will run out of money next year--sometime in 2013. We are not \nexactly sure when. But that will mean funding to States will face \ndrastic cuts without any reauthorization to shore up that revenue. And \nwere the highway trust funds to run out of money, projects in this \ncountry would grind to a halt; it would decimate jobs in the \nconstruction industry. We cannot afford that.\n  Investing in transportation creates jobs and creates the conditions \nfor our small companies to succeed. It should not be an issue about \npolitics or partisanship. I urge our colleagues on the House side--\nbecause they are the ones holding this up--to come together and pass a \ntransportation reauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I join Senators Shaheen and Klobuchar, \nand I particularly thank Senator\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\nWhitehouse for bringing us together. Senator Boxer was on the floor \nearlier talking about the transportation conference committee, and \nSenator Begich is also here.\n  We are all here because of the urgency of the conference report being \npresented to us so that we have a multiyear reauthorization of the \ntransportation programs of this country.\n  Let me point out, I know a lot of times our constituents are confused \nas to why legislation cannot move here. Clearly, the holdup in passing \nthe surface transportation reauthorization is the Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives. They are blocking a bill that has broad \nsupport from the industries that are affected by it, from the public, \nand from both Democrats and Republicans here in the Senate.\n\n  We passed a consensus bill. It is not even bipartisan, it is \nconsensus. We were able to get the right balance between public \ntransportation and transit and highways and bridges. We have the proper \nbalance between how the money is controlled at the State level and how \nit is controlled at the local level. We have worked out a reform of our \ntransportation programs to do this in a most efficient way. That bill \nis being held up for one reason and one reason alone; that is, the \npolitics of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. They \nbelieve they can score political points by blocking any legislation \nfrom moving.\n  Let me underscore the points my colleagues have mentioned. This bill \nis all about jobs. It is all about rebuilding America and saving and \npreserving jobs.\n  On Sunday I was in Cumberland, MD, talking about the first Federal \nhighway, the national highway that was built over 200 years ago, which \nwas the first subsidized road in America. That brought jobs to our \ncommunities. It connected the East with the expanding Nation. Quite \nfrankly, this Transportation bill connects our Nation, and it is \nimportant for jobs. In the western part of Maryland, we have the \nAppalachian highway that we need to complete, the north-south highway. \nThat will affect jobs in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. \nThat is what this is about here.\n  A short-term extension costs us jobs. Last month we lost 28,000 jobs \nas a result of not being able to pass a multiyear surface \ntransportation program. We lose the construction season, as my \ncolleagues have pointed out. And quite frankly, we have the bill before \nus. We have the votes to pass it.\n  So what we are asking today is that the Republicans in the House \nrelease this bill, allow us to move forward so we can create jobs for \nAmerica and continue the economic expansion for America that we need \nthrough modern transportation. That is what this is about, and that is \nwhy we are here today, to remind our colleagues, the Republicans in the \nHouse--the extremists who are holding up this bill--this is a bill that \nis important for our Nation. Let's move forward with the people's \nbusiness.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \ncoming to the floor and especially thank Senator Whitehouse for \norganizing all of us to come here to speak on an issue that is really \nthe core of what we do here: to figure out how to build infrastructure \nfor this country so our private sector can have the infrastructure to \nwork from and play off of. But let's be very blunt and very honest \nabout what is happening. This Transportation reauthorization bill \npassed this body with 74 votes. It was a bipartisan effort, hard \nfought, with incredible debate, encompassing many different issues. Now \nit sits in a conference committee with House Members, led by the \nRepublican majority over there, not wanting to move forward.\n  Let's be very blunt about this. Not only do we have that bill over \nthere, we have the VAWA bill, the FDA bill, the postal reform bill, and \nthey are all just piling up over in the House. People wonder why the \neconomy has been struggling this last month. Well, all the business \nthat we should be doing and that we are doing here on the Senate side--\nwe are passing stuff--is all piling up over there on the House side.\n  Actually, I did what we were calling ``Begich Minutes,'' give or take \na few seconds. I went to the middle of the Capitol and described this \nincident of where we pass a bill, and then I physically pointed to the \nHouse side to show where the bill is now stalled. We have a small group \nwithin the Republican majority over there that is holding the Speaker \nhostage, literally, because they want to cut the Transportation bill by \nover one-third, which would devastate the infrastructure of this \ncountry.\n  Let me say from my own experience--and I know Senator Whitehouse has \nheard this, and others have as well--as a former mayor, I was in charge \nof the metropolitan planning organization for our community of \nAnchorage, which maintained at that time approximately 45 or 48 percent \nof the population of the State. We were in charge of managing the road \nmoney. Every time Congress delayed their action or were ineffective in \ngetting their work done, as a mayor, I had to put projects off, stall \nprojects, and hold contracts and tell contractors they couldn't get to \nwork. That created uncertainty, which at the end of the day does one \nthing: It costs more money. And the people who pay for that are the \ntaxpayers.\n  So they sit over there in the House. I saw a comment that they want \nto do another extension. Well, we have had nine extensions. For people \nwho don't know what extensions are, it is where the Congress says: \nWell, we will extend this bill for another week, another 2 weeks, \nanother month. But these extensions create more uncertainty and add \nmore cost. Every time you hear the word ``extension'' from the other \nside, that just means you--the taxpayers of this country--are paying \nmore in taxes. That is what that means, pure and simple. ``Extension'' \nmeans you pay more for a project that should have been on the board and \nmoving forward.\n  We have a bipartisan bill, with 74 Democrats and Republicans on the \nSenate side having voted for it. It is now lingering in conference.\n  We are now in the midst of the construction season. In Alaska--and I \nknow my colleague from Minnesota, who has joined us, will know about \nthis--the construction season is short. We need to have contracts let \nin early spring in order to construct in the summer and be completed by \nSeptember or October because the asphalt plants close. When the asphalt \nplants close, you can't put asphalt on the streets. It is very simple. \nWe have a very limited time. So the contracting community is frustrated \nand angry because they do not get the certainty they need to hire the \npeople. They can't get them to work.\n  So I plead with the folks on the other side, the extreme folks in the \nRepublican majority over there who are holding the Speaker hostage on \nthis issue, let's do what is right for America. Let's make sure these \njobs, these 3 million jobs that could be retained and added, move \nforward. In an economy where every job makes a difference, we are \ntalking here about 3 million jobs. Let's move this forward. Let's quit \nthe politics.\n  What is amazing about this--and I heard Senator Whitehouse say this \nmore than once--if the Speaker of the House would just allow the Senate \nbill to go to the floor for a vote, I can guarantee what will happen: \nDemocrats and a group of Republicans will support that bill and pass \nit. But that is not the issue. We have a very small subset of the \nmajority of the Republicans over in the House who have told the \nmajority leader he is not moving anything--nothing, zero--because they \nare not betting on America like we are. We bet on America. We are \nbetting on the right things. What they want to do is to cripple this \ncountry for their own political gamesmanship.\n  I have to say--and I would bet every one of my colleagues here would \nsay the same thing--that when I go back home to Alaska, I hear how fed \nup people are with this. They are frustrated by the inability of \nCongress to do its work. And I have told my folks back in Alaska that \nthe Senate is doing its work. We are passing bipartisan bills. But they \nget jammed up by a small group of extreme Republican tea party folks \nwho believe the best way to solve problems is to do nothing and to let \nthis economy falter.\n\n  So I hope Members will come to their senses over there. I can say \nthat my\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nCongressman, the Republican from Alaska, is working hard to get this \nbill passed. He is on the conference committee. He is one of the \nRepublicans who would vote with Democrats to get things done on this \nTransportation bill. Why? Because he likes building things. I like \nbuilding things. But there are some other folks over there who have no \ninterest in helping to build this country and make it a better place.\n  So, again, I yield my time. I hope folks on the other side in that \nextreme group will get some sense knocked into them. Maybe the American \npeople will do it. I hope so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor at this point for my friend from \nMinnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  I wish to emphasize the need to pass a long-term reauthorization of \nthis surface transportation bill. It is time for Congress to do its \njob. Thanks to the leadership of Senators Boxer and Inhofe, this body \npassed a bill with 74 votes. Actually, it probably would have been 76 \nvotes, but Senator Kirk is back at home recovering--and we wish him \nvery well--and Senator Lautenberg couldn't vote that day. I think he \nwas at the funeral of a friend. So it really would have been 76 votes. \nUnfortunately, our colleagues in the House were not able to pass a \ncomprehensive reauthorization bill and were only able to join a \nconference committee after passing yet another short-term extension.\n  So I will repeat myself: It is time for Congress to do its job. As \nthe Senator from Alaska, my good colleague, was just saying, the summer \nconstruction season is now upon us. In Minnesota, that is when we know \nwe can build roads and bridges and light rail, because in November and \nDecember it gets cold and snowy.\n  State departments of transportation have already canceled projects \nbecause the House has failed to act. We have already lost thousands of \njobs because, for whatever reason, the House will not pass a bill that \nreceived unanimous bipartisan support in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and 74 votes in the Senate as a whole.\n  Speaker Boehner has said the House may just pass another short-term \nextension. But all of these extensions have whittled away at the \nhighway trust fund--whittled it down to a dangerously low balance--and \nany further extension would put it in danger of going bankrupt.\n  This should not be controversial. This should not be partisan. \nTransportation and infrastructure have not been in the past. The Senate \nconsensus bill simply maintains the current level of funding for our \ntransportation system and streamlines many programs to make sure those \ninvestments are put to the best possible use. This is infrastructure \nthat we need to stay competitive in our global economy.\n  Minnesota is ready to make these investments. Whether we are talking \nabout maintaining our bridges so they are safe, expanding the new light \nrail system in the Twin Cities, or reducing congestion on our highways, \nthese are projects that will create jobs now and strengthen our economy \nwell into the future, as infrastructure always does.\n  On August 1 of this year, we in Minnesota will mark the fifth \nanniversary of a tragedy in our State: the collapse of the Interstate \n35 W bridge in Minneapolis. The collapse killed 13 people and injured \n145. That tragedy should have been a wake-up call in America and in \nthis body. Bridges should not collapse in the United States of America.\n  If that was a wake-up call, the House seems to be content to have hit \nthe snooze button and ignore the problem. Well, we cannot wait any \nlonger. There is no reason not to pass this bill. Frankly, the Senate \nbill is the conservative solution. It is paid for, it consolidates many \nFederal programs, and it streamlines project reviews--all things that I \nhave heard colleagues in the House ask for. The House negotiators need \nto work with Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe and the rest of the \nSenate conferees and come to an agreement both the House and the Senate \ncan live with. If they can't or won't, Speaker Boehner should--as the \nSenator from Alaska just said--just take up the Senate bill and give it \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Let's prove to our constituents that we can come together and do what \nis right. Let's pass a bill that will create jobs for workers in our \nStates and build prosperity for our future. It is time for Congress to \ndo its job and pass a transportation bill without any more delay.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield back to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the Senators on our side who \nhave come here today during the majority time block to express their \nsupport for moving forward on the highway transportation bill.\n  Not all of them have had the chance to speak because time was short, \nbut I wish to have the Record reflect that in addition to Senators \nKlobuchar, Shaheen, Begich, Cardin, and Franken, who did speak, and \nmyself of course, Senator Gillibrand is also here but presiding. \nSenator Stabenow was here but could not wait. Senator Mark Udall is \nhere. Senator Conrad was here. We are all here because we are very \nconcerned about what is going on with the highway bill.\n  We had a March 31 deadline in order to get things done by the summer \nconstruction season that we have heard so much about. We made the \ndeadline. Not only did we make the deadline, we made the deadline with \na bipartisan bill, one that was unanimous among both parties in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and we brought it to the floor \nand we got it passed, 75 or more Senators supporting it. The House did \nnot do its job. It did not have a bill. It could not pass a highway \nbill.\n  For folks who have been around here longer than I have, the failure \nto pass the highway bill is telling. This is not like getting an A on a \nchemistry test. This is like showing up for class, and they failed at \nthat very simple task. So they asked for an extension. We probably \nshould not have given it. We probably should have forced the vote then. \nBut we did. We gave them an extension on the theory that, in good \nfaith, they would come through. We knew the extension would cost jobs. \nThe extension has cost jobs. Out of over 90 projects slated for this \nconstruction season in Rhode Island, about 40 are going to fall off \nbecause of the delay. Those are real jobs in Rhode Island, a State that \nneeds them, and that is true across the rest of the country. Wherever \nwinter falls, this predicament exists. So that is why so many of my \ncolleagues were here.\n  Now we are closing in on the end of the extension we gave them. It \nwill end June 30. I am here to urge that we give no further extensions. \nIt is either govern or get out of the way to the House of \nRepresentatives. If they can't pass a highway bill of their own, let \nthe Senate bill come up for a vote. It is bipartisan. It is supported \nby manufacturers. It is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It \nis supported by road builders. It is supported by environmentalists. It \nis supported by labor. It is a good bill. It had a great process, wide \nopen, on the Senate floor. There is no excuse for not taking up that \nbill. I agree with Senator Begich. If that bill comes up, Democrats and \nRepublicans together will give it a massive majority in the House, and \npeople will be put to work.\n  One place where I think we all ought to be able to agree on both \nsides of the aisle is that Federal spending is actually helpful and \ndoes create jobs in building our roads and bridges. We don't expect \nAmericans to repair the road in front of their house. We don't expect \nAmericans to go and build bridges for themselves. It is a government \njob to build roads and bridges. The jam-up Speaker Boehner and Majority \nLeader Cantor have created on this is costing probably hundreds of \nthousands of jobs right now in this country. Why they are doing it, \ntheir motive, that is not for me to say. But the practical effect is \nthat jobs are being lost by unnecessary delay, created by Republicans \nin the House, which they could get rid of by simply calling up the \nbipartisan Senate bill and giving a free vote on it, letting it pass, \nand putting Americans to work.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for \nbeing\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\npatient as I went over my time a little bit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague.\n  Last week, I discussed some unfinished business that remains for \nCongress and the President to address. Specifically, Congress must take \nup a number of tax-related matters in very short order.\n  When I discussed this tax agenda last week, I referred to this chart. \nThings have not changed since then. As this chart shows, the tax \nextenders, which are overdue by almost one-half year, are not alone on \nCongress's to-do list.\n  We need to resolve the death tax. Death tax relief expires at the end \nof 2012. We need to prevent the 2013 tax hikes. As I noted earlier, we \nhave the so-called tax extenders that are right there, and we have to \naddress the alternative minimum tax--or AMT--the second one on that \nlist. The issue of the AMT is what I would like to address today.\n  Thirty-one million American families will be caught by the AMT or are \nalready caught. Yet Congress has done nothing to address the AMT. The \nalternative minimum tax is a stealth tax on 27 million families. \nApproximately, 3.9 million families paid the AMT last year, and they \nmay not be surprised if it hits them again this year. But for the other \n27 million American families set to be ensnared by the AMT, this \nrepresents a significant and stealthy tax increase.\n  The AMT burden is, in fact, far broader than just the 31 million \nAmerican families who are in its sights. Nearly double that number--60 \nmillion American families--must fill out the AMT worksheet to determine \nwhether they owe an alternative minimum tax. While not as bad as paying \nthe tax itself, the task of compliance is just another time-consuming, \ngovernment-imposed challenge for Americans families they don't need to \nhave.\n  To get some idea of the magnitude of the AMT's reach, consider this \nchart. It breaks down, State by State, the number of American families \nhit by the AMT.\n  When I speak of those now being caught by this tax, I am referring to \nthose families who make estimated tax payments and who are scheduled to \nmake their second payment tomorrow.\n  Last year, 3.9 million families were hit by the AMT. I think this was \n3.9 million too many, but it is considerably better than the more than \n31.1 million who will be hit in 2012.\n  The reason we are threatened by such a large increase this year is \nthat over the last 11 years, Congress has passed legislation to \ntemporarily increase the amount of income exempt from the AMT. Unlike \nmany other provisions of the Tax Code, the AMT exemption amount is not \nautomatically adjusted for inflation. These temporary exemption \nincreases have prevented millions of middle-class American families \nfrom falling prey to the AMT, until now.\n  While I have always fought for these temporary exemptions, I believe \nthe AMT ought to be permanently repealed. One reason to pursue \npermanent repeal is the uncertainty that the AMT creates for taxpayers \nwhen Congress must revisit and adjust it every year.\n  Unfortunately, a permanent fix does not appear to be forthcoming. \nCongress has yet to undertake any meaningful action on the AMT. \nPresident Obama has proposed permanently patching or maybe even \nrepealing AMT. Yet what he gives with one hand, he takes away with \nanother.\n\n  He has proposed to pay for an AMT fix with this so-called Buffett \ntax. The thing is, the Buffett tax is nothing more than a new \nalternative minimum tax. The solution to the alternative minimum tax \nproblem surely can't be an alternative minimum tax.\n  Moreover, the revenue generated by the Buffett tax--in spite of the \nsuggestion by the President that this tax on the rich could pay for all \nthings good--would not come close to providing the revenue necessary to \naddress the AMT in a meaningful way.\n  Despite assurance from the President and his allies that AMT relief \nis an important issue, nothing has actually been put forward as a \nserious legislative solution for this year. There has been no Senate \ncommittee markup or floor action for tax extenders, the AMT patch, \ndeath tax reform or even preventing 2013 tax hikes.\n  This year is about half over, and all we have is talk about the need \nto address the AMT, but a theoretical discussion is not a substitute \nfor real action, as anyone making a quarterly payment today will attest \nto.\n  Everyone seems to agree something needs to be done--and done \nquickly--but the discussion does not go any further from there. We are \nout of time. The second quarterly AMT payment is due. Today, taxpayers \nacross the country are under a legal requirement to pay their estimated \ntax. They will use the form depicted on this chart right here--``2012 \nEstimated Tax.'' Though I hope otherwise, I expect I will be here again \nwhen the third payment comes due saying basically the same thing.\n  A question remains about whether people who should be making an \nestimated tax payment tomorrow actually will. Most of these 31 million \ntaxpayers subject to the AMT do not even know they are subject to the \nalternative minimum tax, so they will not be making that estimated tax \npayment tomorrow, even though they should. If one fails to pay \nsufficient estimated tax or have a sufficient amount of wages withheld \non a timely basis throughout the year, then one can be subject to \ninterest and penalties. This is an awful spot for Congress to put the \nAmerican families in.\n  It is also worth recalling that the IRS cannot just flip a switch and \nhave its systems in place for an AMT patch. This is not done overnight. \nIt takes months. The Congress's failure to act on a timely basis could \nactually delay the processing of 2013 refund checks perhaps by even a \nfew months.\n  The failure of Congress to promptly enact an alternative minimum tax \nfix would have a cascading effect on our system of tax administration. \nSoftware providers and tax preparers would struggle to keep up.\n  One of the issues holding back an AMT fix is that many on the other \nside insist that, unlike new spending proposals or extensions of \nexisting spending programs, AMT reform should happen only if it is \nrevenue neutral. That means any revenues not collected through reform \nor repeal of the AMT must be offset by new taxes from somewhere else.\n  Notice that I said ``not collected'' rather than ``lost.'' This \ndistinction is important for the simple reason that the revenues we do \nnot collect as a result of AMT relief are not truly lost. The AMT \ncollects revenues it was never supposed to collect in the first place. \nIf we offset revenues not collected as a result of AMT repeal or \nreform, total Federal revenues over the long term are projected to push \nthrough the 30-year historical average and then keep going.\n  Originally conceived as a mechanism to ensure that high-income \ntaxpayers were not able to eliminate their tax liability completely, \nthe AMT has failed. The AMT was originally created back in 1969, with \njust 155 taxpayers in mind--155--a mechanism to ensure that high-income \ntaxpayers were not able to eliminate their tax liability completely. \nThe AMT has failed completely. On the one hand, as IRS Commissioner \nEverson told the Finance Committee in 2004, the same percentage of \ntaxpayers continues to pay no Federal income tax.\n  On the other hand, the AMT is projected to bring in future revenues \nit was never designed to collect. At least 31 million middle-class \nfamilies are now in the AMT's crosshairs, and that was never meant to \nbe. That is quite a change from 155 rich people who never paid any \ntaxes. It should serve as a cautionary tale for those who believe \ntoday's tax increase proposals will remain limited to the so-called \nwealthy.\n  During the 2008 campaign, President Obama advocated for a permanent \nAMT patch. His budgets have maintained that position. While permanent \nrepeal without offsetting the AMT is the best option, we absolutely \nmust do something to protect taxpayers immediately, even if it involves \na temporary solution, such as an increase in the exemption amount. Of \ncourse, if we do that, we are going to be in the same fix next year, \nand I will again be making the same points.\n  This coming Friday--June 15, 2012--taxpayers making quarterly \npayments are going to once again discover that the AMT is neither the \nsubject of an\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nacademic seminar nor a future problem we can put off dealing with. The \nAMT is a real problem right now. If this Congress was truly serious \nabout tax fairness, it does need to stand and take action.\n  I would like to take a few moments to address another matter of \nimportance.\n  A conference committee is currently meeting with the goal of \nproducing a transportation bill. As I said at the public meeting that \nwas held last month, ensuring that local communities have a strong \nvoice in the transportation decisionmaking process is a priority of \nmine. There are many ways this can be achieved, but one particularly \neffective method is through the implementation of environmental \nstreamlining.\n  Negotiations are still ongoing, so I do not want to go into too much \ndetail. Yet environmental streamlining is something that will benefit \nmy own home State of Utah and every other State that is currently \nforced to comply with redundant and oppressive redtape when engaging in \ntransportation projects with the Federal Government.\n  The highway trust fund, which funds many transportation programs, \ncurrently has more money coming out of it than is going into it. While \nthere are many who want to deal with bloated and unfocused spending by \nraising taxes, I disagree. If revenues do not meet outlays, then we \nshould not be punishing the American taxpayer; rather, we should be \nreevaluating spending priorities.\n  In addition to examining what Congress spends money on, we need to \nensure that money being spent is spent efficiently. Currently, \ngovernments at the Federal, State and local level spend considerable \nresources complying with Federal regulations designed to protect the \nenvironment. Given that many of these regulations have accumulated over \ntime, I am confident that we can scrape many of these barnacles off the \nship of state without harming the environment.\n  Both the Senate and the House recognize the truth of what I am \nsaying, and both bills currently in conference reflect this sentiment. \nBoth contain provisions designed to streamline or simplify the \nenvironmental reviews with which transportation projects must comply. \nIn particular, I am appreciative of the efforts shown by Chairman Mica \nof the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for his role \nin highlighting the importance of environmental streamlining within the \nconference committee.\n  Madam President, I inquire how much time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no controlled time. The \nSenator has the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not want to infringe on my colleagues. Let me just \nsay this: I am appreciative of the efforts shown by Chairman Mica of \nthe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for his role in \nhighlighting the importance of environmental streamlining within the \nconference committee. I hope the rest of my fellow Senate conferees are \ncarefully reviewing his suggested language. I know all of us want to do \nall we can to expedite project delivery times while minimizing \nredundant costs. Chairman Mica is clearly eager to engage on this \ntopic.\n  President Obama has talked in the past about the importance of \nfunding shovel-ready jobs. All we are asking is when there is a shovel-\nready job to move forward without undue or unnecessary environmental \nreviews.\n  I close with an appeal rooted in my role as ranking member of the \nFinance Committee. The highway trust fund is currently on a path to \ninsolvency, and the Senate bill does not change that. By working with \nour colleagues in the House we can make sure taxpayer money is not \nwasted on redundant and unnecessary compliance and regulation. Despite \ncurrent policy being green in the environmental sense, it does not mean \nwe have to sacrifice being green in a budgetary sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the \namendment that is pending to kill the Sugar Program in the United \nStates. My colleagues should know that the domestic sugar industry \nemploys 140,000 people in this country. If there were ever a jobs-\nkiller amendment, it is the amendment that is going to be offered to \nkill the U.S. Sugar Program.\n  In advancing that amendment, a series of claims have been made about \nthe U.S. Sugar Program that I believe are false. First of all, it is \nsaid that the Sugar Program has a high cost for taxpayers. That is \nfalse. It is said that it keeps sugar prices artificially high. That is \nfalse. It is said that the Sugar Program drives the confectionary \nindustry out of the United States. That is false. It is said that the \nSugar Program impedes imports into the United States. That is false. It \nis also said that consumers will benefit from eliminating the Sugar \nProgram. I believe that is false as well.\n  Let's take each of these arguments in turn. First is that it has a \nhigh taxpayer cost. Here is the cost, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, of the Sugar Program for 2013 to 2022. The cost is zero. \nIt is hard to get lower than zero. Maybe the square root of zero would \nbe lower. But those who say there is a high cost to taxpayers are just \nwrong. It is false.\n  The second claim is that it keeps sugar prices artificially high--\nfalse again. This chart shows the average retail sugar price in major \ncountries around the world. Here is the United States way down here, 59 \ncents. The global average is 67 cents. The developed country average is \n73 cents. We are below the global average, and we are below the average \nof developed countries. So the claim that it keeps sugar prices high is \nfalse again.\n  The third claim is that the Sugar Program drives the confectionary \nindustry out of the United States. Wrong again. Here is what is \nhappening to the U.S. chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery \nproduction in the United States since 2004. Do you see the trend line? \nIt is up. More production not less production.\n  These are facts, and facts are stubborn things. Let's go to the \nfourth claim, that this Sugar Program impedes imports. This is maybe \nthe biggest whopper of all. Here are the facts: The United States, in \nthe period from 2008 2009 through 2010 2011, is the biggest importer of \nsugar in the world. So this program is impeding imports into the United \nStates? If it is, it is not doing a very good job of it because the \nUnited States is No. 1 in imports of sugar in the world.\n  Before we get to the final assertion, let's look at what other \ncountries, poor countries that produce sugar are saying to us about our \nSugar Program. The argument made on the Senate floor is we are hurting \npoor countries with our Sugar Program. Maybe we ought to listen to what \nthose poor countries say. Here is their organization, the International \nSugar Trade Coalition, that represents sugar producers in 17 developing \nnations in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, and South \nAmerica. Here is what they say:\n\n       The U.S. sugar policy contained in the Farm Bill passed by \n     the Senate Agriculture Committee is important to sugar \n     producers in developing nations because it provides a \n     guaranteed level of access to the United States sugar market \n     at fair, predictable prices. Attempts to weaken this policy \n     through amendments on the Senate floor would not only harm \n     U.S. farmers but also poor growers from developing countries \n     where sugar is a key economic driver.\n\n  These are the poor countries that produce sugar who are saying to us: \nKeep your Sugar Program because not only does it benefit you, but it \nbenefits us.\n  Let me go further in their letter:\n\n       Ending the sugar program would reward only a handful of \n     large food companies and agricultural superpowers like \n     Brazil, while punishing some of the world's poorest \n     economies.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       This was what happened when the European Union radically \n     altered its sugar policy, and thereby lowered standards of \n     living in places like Guyana, Fiji and Mauritius where there \n     is no agricultural alternative to sugarcane. Sadly, Saint \n     Kitts and Nevis had to stop sugar production altogether after \n     300 years as a result of the EU's reforms.\n\n  Let's not make that same mistake.\n  Finally, on this notion that consumers are going to benefit by \neliminating the Sugar Program--really? Let's look at the facts. The \ngreen line is the trendline on retail sugar prices. That trendline \nsince 2010 is going up.\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nHere is what the wholesale price of sugar has been--flat. Do you see \nthe disconnection? Wholesale prices flat, retail prices up. The fact is \nthat sugar is such a small part of the cost of finished products that \nit has almost no bearing whatsoever on retail prices of a candy bar, \nthe box of cereal, or any of the other things that sugar goes into.\n  The record is so clear on the facts that I urge my colleagues to \noppose the amendment being offered to kill the U.S. Sugar Program, to \nkill 140,000 good jobs in this country, to kill $19 billion of economic \nactivity in this country. It would be a profound mistake not only for \nus but for the poor countries in the world that produce sugar, that are \ncalling on us to keep our Sugar Program because not only is it \nimportant to U.S. farmers, it is important to their farmers as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 10 minutes be \nprovided to Senator Udall of Colorado and then 5 minutes for Senator \nGillibrand of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank Senator Conrad. He is always gracious \nand compelling, and I appreciate the strong case he made for his point \nof view.\n  I rise as I did yesterday, and I will continue to do so, to highlight \nwhy it is so important that we extend the production of the tax \ncredits, or PTC as it is known, for wind energy. Senator Bennet from \nColorado joins me, feeling the urgency of the moment. Members of both \nparties have agreed that the PTC is vital for continued economic growth \nin our country. Put simply, the PTC means good-paying American jobs. \nThe longer we wait, the more American jobs we can expect to be lost in \nthe coming months and weeks ahead.\n  When I go home, Coloradoans say to me it does not make any sense that \nwe would not extend the production tax credit. So over the next couple \nof weeks I am going to come to the floor every day to talk about how \nthe wind production tax credit affects each State across the country, \nto drive home the point that real American jobs will be lost if we do \nnot take this commonsense step.\n  The PTC has meant economic growth in Colorado. We have a favorable \nbusiness climate in Colorado, and we have tremendous wind resources. In \nfact, if we harness the wind potential that is there, similar to the \nwind potential that is off the shores of the State of the Presiding \nOfficer, there is enough wind power to go way beyond our needs. In \nColorado's case, 25 times over the State's electricity needs could be \nmet if we harness and harvest that wind.\n  That is an amazing statistic. It is generated by the National \nRenewable Energy Lab, which we are happy to host in Colorado, a \nflagship of energy research, development, and innovation.\n  I hope I will not have to say too many days in the future what I said \nyesterday: The strong growth in the wind sector is at risk. Thousands \nof jobs, as you can see in this chart of Colorado, have been created \nacross my State, all the way from Pueblo in the south central portion \nof the State, to Greeley, Fort Morgan up in the northeast, to Yuma \nCounty way out in the eastern part of the State.\n  These are quality jobs. These jobs support families and communities. \nI want to put a face on these families and these communities. I want to \ntalk about Derek Palmer. He lives in Greeley, up here in the \nnortheastern part of the State. He has three children and a wife. He \ngraduated from the University of Northern Colorado in 2011 with a \ndegree in business management, and he has worked at the Windsor \nmanufacturing plant--it is a Vestas plant that manufactures wind \nblades--for the past 9 months. He left an excellent managerial job in \nthe service industry and joined Vestas, in large part because of the \nstrong benefits package that is there for his wife and kids. He loves \nworking there. He is patriotic, and he is helping our country become \nenergy independent. Because of our inaction, thousands of jobs like \nDerek's are in jeopardy. This industry deserves some certainty, some \nstability, and so do countless families like Derek's in Colorado and \nall over the country. So if we don't act, I fear dire consequences.\n\n  The CEO of Vestas--I think you have met him, Mr. President--says that \nhe expects the wind market in the United States to fall by 80 percent \nif the PTC isn't extended. Eighty percent is a huge number. That is 80 \npercent fewer jobs, 80 percent fewer families pulling themselves out of \nthis recession, and 80 percent less investment than we have today, all \nbecause we are not active, all because we are not taking the right \nsteps for it.\n  As I close, this is not a partisan issue. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans, Senators and House Members, agree that we need to extend \nthis commonsense tax credit. There are bipartisan bills to extend it. I \nled an effort with six Democrats and six Republicans here earlier \nurging us to extend the PTC. The solution is simple. We just need to \nextend the PTC ASAP. We need to do it. Let's do it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \nchairwoman of the Agriculture Committee and the ranking member of that \ncommittee for their dedicated effort to move the farm bill to the floor \nto discuss our Nation's agricultural policy and for their leadership in \nchampioning so many issues that help America's and New York's farmers.\n  I rise today because I really want to make clear to the American \npeople just what is at stake and at the heart of this farm bill. It is \nabout a growing economy for our family farms and for our small \nbusinesses. It is about reviving rural communities and rebuilding a \nthriving middle class and the opportunity for all of those who are \ntrying to get there. It is about the health of our agricultural \nindustry, the jobs it provides, and the health of our families whom it \nhelps to feed. But from the amendments that are being filed today from \nacross the aisle, you would not know it. There are some trying to use \nthis bill to roll back protections for the air we breathe and for the \nwater we drink. There are some who want to use this bill to expand \nconcealed-carry laws for weapons. We are even seeing attempts to bring \nin the divisive politics from the Wisconsin recall and inject it right \ninto the debate on the Senate floor on farm policy.\n  This bill has so much potential to create jobs, to help our farms \nthrive, to protect our farmers and small businesses from natural \ndisasters, to feed our children, and to feed our at-risk seniors. But \nif we are ever going to reach that potential, we can't afford to get \nbogged down in these dead-end fights that are meant only to score \npolitical points.\n  Worse yet, there are Draconian cuts being proposed by some that will \ntake even more money away from those who are the greatest in need. They \nwant to take money away from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, better known as food stamps, which literally will result in \nchildren going to bed hungry in this country. These amendments simply \ndo not meet the fundamental founding principles of this Nation or who \nwe are as Americans. In this day and age, in this country, as rich as \nwe are, to accept hungry children, hungry families, hungry seniors is \nunacceptable.\n  This farm bill started out with a $4.5 billion cut to food stamps \nover 10 years. These cuts must be restored. While I fought against \nthese cuts with 13 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, \nothers are still actually advocating for additional, much more extreme \ncuts. They could even cut SNAP by almost half.\n  If you have heard from families living off of food stamps, as I have, \nyou know this is something no one strives for. Most have never imagined \nthat they would be on food stamps or that they would need that kind of \nsupport. But many have been dealt a very bad hand in this economy, and \nthrough no fault of their own they are finding they are in need. Food \nstamps are often the last resort for those who are just trying to keep \nthe lights on, put food on the table for their kids, and find their way \nback to that paycheck they desperately want to be earning.\n  Among all the families relying on food stamps at historical rates, we \nare now seeing veterans and their families. I can tell you that our \nveterans and their families have already suffered a lot. For these \ntroops who are coming\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nhome, they are coming back into a very tough economy and are unable to \nfind the jobs they need. And we have to imagine these children of our \nvets who have already suffered so much, and now they are being faced \nwith not knowing from where their next meal will come.\n  For any parent watching this debate today, I just want to ask one \nquestion. Has your child ever said to you: Mommy, I am still hungry.\n  Well, I can't imagine what a mother would feel like if she could not \nhand her child some food. I can't imagine what a mother would feel like \nif her child said that to her every single night. That is exactly what \nwe are talking about today in this farm bill. As a mother and \nlegislator, watching children suffer, watching America's children not \nhaving enough to eat is something I will not stand quietly by and \nwatch.\n  Under this bill, nearly 300,000 families in New York will become food \ninsecure, and what that translates to is $90 a month that they will \nhave less money to put food on the table, and what that translates to \nis that it is the last week of the month. That $90 pays the grocery \nbills every single week. What do these families do when they don't have \nenough money at the end of the month? Despite not being responsible for \nthe economic crisis our country has faced, we will be asking these \nfamilies to share a disproportionate amount of the burden being placed \non them.\n  We know that food stamps are such a good investment into our economy. \nFor every dollar we put into food stamps, we get $1.71 back into the \neconomy. Even one of the best economists, Mark Zandi, said: ``The \nfastest way to infuse money into the economy is through expanding the \nSNAP/food stamps program.'' These food stamps pay salaries for grocery \nclerks and truckers who haul the food. The USDA estimates that 16 cents \ngoes right back to the farmer.\n  I know my time is expiring, but I have 13 bipartisan cosponsors for \nthis amendment, and the list keeps growing with the support from the \nAARP, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and all of those who are \nfighting on the front line for hunger.\n  Our amendment will restore the SNAP funding back to the $4.5 billion \nthat has been cut, and it will pay for the food our kids so desperately \nneed. Every child in America deserves to be fed. Every child in America \ndeserves to reach their God-given potential. We need to restore these \ncuts to ensure that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a particular amendment--\nperhaps a couple of amendments--on the farm bill, specifically the \namendments to the sugar portion. There are a number of titles, it is a \nbig, complicated bill, and there is a great deal of discussion about \nthe many reforms that are contained in this bill.\n  There is one very glaring exception. There is one huge program that \nhas no reforms whatsoever in the underlying bill, and it just so \nhappens to be in, in my view, one of the most egregiously flawed \nprograms in the entire agricultural sector, maybe in government as a \nwhole, and it is the Sugar Program. This is a program which \nsystematically forces American consumers to pay much more than the \nglobal price for sugar. It is a huge transfer of wealth from consumers, \nincluding the poorest American consumers, to a handful of wealthy sugar \nproducers. It is completely wrong, it is ill-conceived in the first \nplace, it is perpetuated in this bill, and I think that is just \nunconscionable.\n  Some of the specific ways in which the existing program has the \ngovernment completely manipulating the market for sugar include \nexplicit limits on how much sugar can be produced domestically. There \nis a de facto government-imposed price floor on sugar rather than \nallowing the price to reflect whatever supply and demand would lead to. \nIt puts strict limits on how much sugar can be imported without forcing \nAmericans to pay taxes on those imports in the form of duties. It \nmandates that the government purchase excess sugar and then sell it at \na loss to ethanol producers. All of these are features of the existing \nsugar policy, and all of them are left completely unchanged by this \nbill. So it is screaming for some amendments to provide some \ncommonsense reforms to this very badly flawed program.\n  Let me be very clear. At the end of the day, the net effect of all of \nthese machinations in which the government manipulates the market for \nsugar is that U.S. consumers end up paying much more, often about \ndouble the going rate that everyone else in the world who doesn't \nmanipulate their markets pays for sugar.\n  By the way, that should be reason enough to end this program \nentirely, but there are other reasons. For instance, the existing sugar \npolicy--as I said, unchanged in this bill--is absolutely costing us \njobs in the United States. That is not even disputable. It is, on \nbalance, a job killer. It is costing us jobs today specifically in \nmanufacturing--the manufacturing of products that include sugar, of \nwhich there are many.\n  Here is a simple observation from the CEO of a candy manufacturer in \nPennsylvania who uses sugar as an import. He points out: These sugar \nsubsidies artificially inflate the price of one of the staples of the \ncandy industry and force us, and any other companies, to choose between \nabsorbing the higher costs, passing the costs on to consumers, or \nproducing elsewhere.\n  The fact is that some people inevitably choose to produce elsewhere.\n  The next chart illustrates a point that has been made by the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce. We are not just making these things up. Many \nU.S.--essentially sugar-consuming producers--manufacturers have already \nclosed or relocated to Canada, where sugar prices are less than half of \nthe United States. Why? Because Canada chooses not to have a ridiculous \nsugar program. So we lose jobs as manufacturers go to Canada, use \nmarket-priced sugar at much lower costs to produce candies, and then \nimport them into the United States.\n  The next chart quantifies this. It is very simple. For every job that \nis protected somewhere where they are growing beets or cane sugar, \nthree manufacturing jobs are lost. Again, these are statistics from the \nDepartment of Commerce. This is very clear. This is not really \nrefutable.\n  The final chart illustrates this in another way. The Canadian \nGovernment has figured this out, and they advertise the fact that they \nhave a huge competitive advantage because they choose not to create an \nartificially high price for sugar, and as a result they are constantly \ntrying to persuade manufacturers to move up to Canada where they can \nhave lower costs. By the way, for many of these companies, the cost of \nsugar in the United States is the single biggest cost they pay.\n  The other point that we should stress and that I would like to \nunderline is that not only do we lose jobs systematically because of \nthis program, it also hurts consumers. Think about it. Everybody \nconsumes sugar. There is sugar in so many products that it is \nimpossible to avoid this inflated cost. It should be seen as equivalent \nto a tax. It is as though the Federal Government is imposing a tax on \nsugar. It doesn't work literally that way, but it has that economic \neffect. It is completely equivalent. Who gets hit the hardest? It is \nthe lowest income Americans. It is as regressive a tax as we can have. \nThink about that. Wealthy people devote a small percentage of their \nincome to food. They have plenty of money to spend on other things. If \nyou are a low-income American, then you necessarily are devoting a \nlarge part of your income to food, and so much of it is artificially \ninflated in cost by our own Federal Government. This is what is so \negregious about it.\n  The GAO said in 2000 that the existing sugar policy forced Americans \nto pay $2 billion in additional food costs. And if we use their same \nmethodology and we move it ahead to today, AEI projects that those \ncosts are now $3.5 billion. This is a simple straightforward transfer \nof wealth from low- and middle-income and ordinary American consumers \nto a handful of wealthy producers. It is as simple as that.\n  There is one other feature. There is also an ongoing risk to \ntaxpayers. Because of that feature I alluded to earlier in which the \nFederal Government buys what is deemed to be excess sugar and then \nsells it at a loss to ethanol makers, CBO projects this will lose $193\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nmillion for taxpayers over the next decade.\n  We have an amendment that would address this, the Shaheen amendment. \nI think Senator Shaheen has actually offered more than one amendment on \nthis topic, one would repeal the entire program. I salute her. I agree \nwith her. I support that. My understanding is that we will soon be \nvoting on a motion to table that amendment. I think it is quite \nunfortunate that Senator Reid would choose to take this amendment off \nthe table, so to speak, to put it aside. A vote to table the amendment \nis, of course, a vote to kill it. I think we ought to be passing this \namendment and end the practice of forcing American consumers to \ntransfer this wealth in this fashion.\n  But I wish to also stress that I am concerned about the process that \nhas gotten us here. I am concerned that Senator Reid has intentionally \nchosen an amendment that is going to be very difficult to pass. As \nstrong as its merits are, from my point of view, I know it is difficult \nto get a majority in this body to support the full repeal of this \nprogram. I hope we can succeed in that, but I don't know that we can. \nIf we cannot, Senator Shaheen has another amendment that I have joined \nher on which would push back some of the excesses of this program--push \nus back to where we were back in 2008, prior to the most recent farm \nbill. The amendment makes some modest changes and just scales back some \nof these excesses. I certainly hope we get a chance to vote on that. If \nwe can't pass full repeal, we have every right--and I would argue every \nresponsibility in this body--to try to at least improve on what is such \nan egregiously flawed program.\n  Again, I would underscore the fact that the current bill is silent; \nin other words, it perpetuates, it continues this spectacularly flawed \nprogram that is so unfair to American consumers. We will have an \nopportunity to vote later today on a motion to table. I hope we defeat \nthe motion to table so we can take up this amendment and do away with \nthis program. But failing that, it is very important that we have an \nopportunity to at least amend the program.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Toomey to talk about what truly is an egregious oversight in \nthe underlying farm bill we are considering.\n  This morning, the Senate is going to have the opportunity to vote on \nan amendment that would repeal the Sugar Program. As Senator Toomey has \npointed out, I submitted several amendments. One would reform the Sugar \nProgram. The one we are going to vote on this morning is the one to \nactually repeal the program. I, as does Senator Toomey, hope we will \nget a vote on both, but I certainly hope people will vote against the \ntabling motion to repeal the Sugar Program.\n  The underlying farm bill we are considering reforms almost every farm \nprogram we have. Every farm group has had to sacrifice with this farm \nbill so we can reform these programs. Unfortunately, there is one \nglaring exception to these reforms; that is, the Sugar Program.\n  We need to reform the sugar subsidy because it costs consumers and \nbusinesses $3.5 billion each year in the form of higher prices. That is \nalmost double the world average. We can see on this chart--which shows \nsugar prices over the last 30 years since 1981. This is the world price \nfor sugar, and that is the U.S. price. We can see demonstrated very \ngraphically--no pun intended--that we in America are paying almost \ntwice what the world price is for sugar. It also costs us about 20,000 \njobs every year. We are doing all this--we are affecting consumers and \nhundreds of thousands of jobs--to benefit fewer than 5,000 sugar \ngrowers. To benefit those 5,000, all of us are paying more, and we have \nbeen paying more, as this chart clearly indicates, for the last 30 \nyears.\n  How does the subsidy program work? Senator Toomey did a great job of \nexplaining it, but it essentially manipulates the market. It controls \nhow much sugar is grown in the United States. It restricts how much \nsugar comes into the United States from outside the country. It sets a \nfloor on sugar prices by providing a government guarantee to sugar \ngrowers on what they are going to get paid, and it requires the \ngovernment, in some cases--this is what is truly outrageous--it \nrequires the government to buy sugar off the market and then sell it to \nethanol plants at a loss to taxpayers. The proponents of this program \nsay it doesn't cost us any money? What our amendment would do is phase \nout this outdated program over the course of a couple years.\n  I wish to respond to some of the claims we have heard from those who \nsupport this Sugar Program. The first is that it doesn't cost taxpayers \nany money. That is if we ignore the fact that consumers are paying out \nof one pocket; they may not be paying as taxpayers in taxes, but they \nare paying out of the other pocket as consumers. But, in fact, that is \nnot even accurate when it comes to taxpayer dollars. A recent study by \nIowa State University showed that the program costs $3.5 billion a year \nto consumers in the form of higher prices, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates this program will cost taxpayers directly in the \ncoming years. CBO has scored this amendment as saving millions of \ndollars for taxpayers in the next decade. So repealing the Sugar \nProgram, according to CBO, will save millions for taxpayers in the next \ndecade.\n  Those who support the Sugar Program also claim prices just aren't \nthat high and that consumers actually benefit from the sugar subsidy. \nThat is absurd. We can see graphed out very clearly what consumers are \npaying. Consumer groups, such as the Consumer Federation and the \nNational Consumers League, support our amendment because the sugar \nsubsidy costs consumers and businesses $3.5 billion a year.\n  Subsidy supporters cite a study which was paid for by the sugar \nindustry to support their data. That is not accurate. Using data from \nUSDA shows a very different story, because for wholesale prices which \nrepresent two-thirds of the sugar bought by businesses in the United \nStates, the effect of the Sugar Program is obvious, and it is hard to \nargue with this drastic difference as displayed on the chart. What we \nhave is a hidden tax that is designed to benefit a small powerful \ninterest group. Again, studies have found that consumers are paying a \ncost to the tune of $3.5 billion a year.\n  The supporters of the sugar subsidy also say this program doesn't get \nin the way of job creation. This is an argument that just doesn't hold \nup when we look at the facts. Multiple studies have found we are \nsacrificing hundreds and thousands of jobs by keeping sugar prices \nhigh. In 2006, the Department of Commerce found that for every job \nprotected in the sugar industry, three were lost in manufacturing. A \nrecent study from Iowa State University found that we are sacrificing \n20,000 new jobs created every year due to the sugar subsidy program. So \nwe are losing 20,000 jobs every year because of the sugar subsidy. \nThere is no evidence sugar reform is going to hurt job creation; in \nfact, it is going to help. We have a small business in New Hampshire, a \nfamily-run business called Granite State Candy. They have been doing \nvery well. They would like to expand, but because of the high cost of \nsugar they are having trouble thinking about how they are going to pay \nfor that.\n\n  There is nothing more definitive than the illustration Senator Toomey \nshowed earlier today and that I showed yesterday on the floor which is \nfrom a Canadian brochure designed to attract businesses in the \nconfectionery industry to come to Canada. It points out how much less \nthey are going to pay. Here it is. It points out how much less \nbusinesses are going to pay for sugar in Canada and how much more \nbeneficial it would be for companies to do business in Canada rather \nthan the United States. It says very clearly:\n\n       Consider these hard facts: Sugar refiners import the vast \n     majority of their raw materials at world prices. Canadian \n     sugar users enjoy a significant advantage. The average price \n     of refined sugar is usually 30 to 40 percent lower in Canada \n     than in the United States. Most manufactured products \n     containing sugar are freely traded in the NAFTA region.\n\n  If one needs any other evidence, that is it. It is clear we are \nlosing those jobs.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against tabling this amendment \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\nThis may be our only chance to reform the Sugar Program in this farm \nbill. Tabling this amendment would be a vote to support special \ninterests, those fewer than 5,000 sugar growers, at the expense of over \n600,000 employees in the food industry and millions of consumers.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Paul \namendment No. 2182, which would cripple the food stamp program. I have \nto tell my colleagues that there is an aura of wonderment around here \nthat says: Look, let's cut food stamps for hungry families and for \nlittle children. We have the agri companies to take care of, the \nagribusinesses, to make sure they can feed their children.\n  The most fundamental test for any family is to put food on the \ntable--to make sure their children get the nutrition they need. When \ntough economic times hit, families can find themselves struggling to \nmeet their most basic needs. The food stamp program was created so that \neven in the toughest of times, children in this country do not go to \nbed hungry.\n  Here is a picture of a child reaching out for food--the old story \nabout models on cereal programs, talking about satisfying the brother's \nhunger with the old remarkable display of what it is that comes to the \nfundamentals and taking care or letting families who need help get \nsome, especially in this area.\n  It is appalling that our Republican colleague from Kentucky has \nproposed an amendment to cut more than $300 billion from a program that \nis a lifeline for many families. These harsh cuts would punish families \nwho need help the most. We are debating a bill that contains billions \nin support for big agricultural companies, but instead of targeting the \nsubsidies they get from the Federal Government--from the taxpayers--\nRepublicans say we ought to cut programs for hungry children. I wonder \nif those who want to cut the food stamp program would participate in a \nreal way and say to their little children, say to their family: Look, \njust to show we are serious, just to show we care, we will limit the \namount of food we are going to give our children, the amount of food we \nare going to give the elders in our household, to show we are serious \nabout this.\n  Hungry children didn't cause the recession or the deficit. Cutting \nfood stamps will not solve our debt problem. But hungry children don't \nhave lobbyists, so programs such as food stamps end up on the \nRepublican chopping block--heroic, muscular men and women who say: We \nwant to make our country fiscally sound, so let's take the food stamps \naway from people who could be starving.\n  The Paul amendment would cut support for food stamps by almost 45 \npercent next year alone. The consequences could be devastating. The \nconsequences would be devastating.\n\n  The numbers are staggering: More than 46 million Americans, including \n800,000 people from my State of New Jersey--we are a State that has \nabout 9 million people--are dependent on food stamps to make it through \nthe month. Half of them are children.\n  When you look at this placard, can you imagine telling a mother that \nshe has to tell her kids they have to do more with less food so maybe \nother businesses--agribusinesses--can continue to get subsidies?\n  Republicans should have to tell these families: We are not going to \ncut corporate subsidies. No, no; we have to do that. We have to make \nsure the rich will not pay more in taxes. So please understand, as we \ntake food off their tables, we say to our kids: Eat less, get thinner, \nget trimmer. Stop doing your homework because you are too tired or stop \ncomplaining because you do not feel well when the food quantity is not \nsufficient.\n  On average the Food Stamp Program provides assistance of just $1.50 \nper meal--a buck and a half. There is not much there to cut. The \nRepublicans who are so eager to cut food stamps from children should \ntry living on $1.50 per meal for the next month. Let them then report \nhow it feels, how their kids survived with less food than they need. \nThen we will see how eager they are to cut the food stamps.\n  The Republican approach would hurt those with the least to protect \nthose with the most. That is not what this country is about. Too many \nof America's families are still struggling. Too many parents are still \nlooking for work. Too many of our children are still hungry. The food \nbanks across the country are getting evermore attention and visits.\n  Republicans should offer them help, show some heart. This is not an \naccounting organization. We are not here to just balance the books. \nYes, we have to balance the books. I come from business, and I know \nwhat they have to do. But that means we would not be servicing our \ndemocratic structures, the people in our society who need help. \nRepublicans should offer them help. Instead, they offer them deeper \npoverty and greater hunger.\n  The bottom line is this: At a time when 50 percent of food stamp \nrecipients are children, it would be a moral stain on our country's \ncharacter to cut this program. That is not what America is about, and \nthat is not why any of us serve.\n  The children who would be harmed by reckless cuts cannot speak for \nthemselves. But we should not need to hear their crying voices to know \nwhat is right. I urge my colleagues to listen to their consciences and \ndefeat the Paul amendment.\n  I conclude by saying how disappointing it is to see a $4 billion \nreduction to the Food Stamp Program in the farm bill. I am proud to \njoin Senator Gillibrand in offering an amendment to reverse these cuts. \nWe are going to try to make that happen.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2393\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to an \namendment that would eliminate the Sugar Program, and I urge my \ncolleagues to table it at this time.\n  As we continue our work on the farm bill, as we debate these \namendments, I think my colleagues should keep in mind at every moment \nthat this proposal contains $23 billion in cuts that we have brought \ntogether on a bipartisan basis, and two-thirds of those cuts--$16 \nbillion--is on only 14 percent of the bill; that is, the farm programs. \nTwo-thirds of the cuts: $16 billion on the farm program.\n  This bill is supported by 630 conservation groups, nutrition groups--\na number of them. Obviously, they would like to see changes. People \nwant to make things better. But if we do not get this bill done, you \ncan imagine what is going to happen to school hot lunches and the like.\n  Unfortunately, eliminating the Sugar Program would actually hurt jobs \nin America. I know Senator Conrad was here earlier putting the facts \nout, but people need to know the facts. This is a zero-cost program \nthat supports 142,000 jobs and generates nearly $20 billion in economic \nactivity. This is the kind of value we are looking for.\n  I believe we need to be doing everything we can to maintain programs \nthat are working for our farmers in an efficient way--programs that are \nsupporting jobs and putting dollars into our economy, especially those \nprograms that do not cost money.\n  Most of us can appreciate the value of a strong farm safety net. \nDuring our discussions in the Agriculture Committee, I worked with \nChairwoman Stabenow and other members of the committee to make sure the \nbill provided for that safety net so the livelihoods of our farmers \ncannot be swept away in the blink of an eye by natural disasters and \nmarket failures and because, you know what, we as a country do not want \nto be dependent on foreign food like we are dependent on foreign oil.\n  The Sugar Program has played its own key role in shielding farmers \nfrom risk--albeit it is a different and more predictable kind of risk \nthey face. I am talking about the risk of competing against heavily \nsubsidized sugar from foreign countries.\n  Let's put it this way: If you do not like being dependent on foreign \noil, you are not going to love being dependent on foreign sugar. Past \nU.S. trade agreements have already opened our domestic market to \nforeign sugar. Over the last 3 years, the United States, on average, \nhas been the world's largest\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nsugar importer, supplying nearly one-third of our total sugar needs.\n  Since 1985 we have had 54 sugar factories close due to sustained low \nprices. Once these jobs are gone, they are gone forever. This is why we \nneed to continue the Sugar Program in the 2012 farm bill--one that \nsupports American sugar beet and sugar cane producers while ensuring an \nabundant supply of sugar for consumers and manufacturers.\n  We must continue this program. Look at what has happened. The average \nglobal retail price for sugar is 14 percent higher than it is in the \nUnited States. In other developed countries, the average price is 24 \npercent higher than it is in the United States.\n  Some people have blamed farmers for the high cost of sugar foods in \nthe grocery store. But look at the numbers. For example, a $1 candy bar \nhas about 2 cents' worth of sugar in it. A $3.50 carton of ice cream \nhas about 10 cents' worth of sugar. So ending the Sugar Program is not \nthe solution that will keep food prices competitive. It is the \nopposite.\n  This is an important program for our country. If changes are to be \nmade to it, the answer should not be to eliminate it. That is why I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in tabling this amendment as we work together \nin the future to make sure we preserve American jobs.\n  The sugar industry supplies American jobs. Just ask the people in the \nRed River Valley in Minnesota and North Dakota.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for her \ncomments. This is an amendment that has come up on a regular basis--\nalways started from New Hampshire, always defeated by the Senate.\n  I encourage my colleagues to table Reid amendment No. 2393. This \nmeasure is known as Senator Shaheen's amendment to phase out the \nFederal Sugar Program.\n  First, I would like to commend Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member \nRoberts for their work on the underlying bill. They proved that the \nAgriculture Committee is able to take a serious look at the farm bill \nprograms and improve what is working while cutting what is not.\n  The Sugar Program is an excellent example of what works in the farm \nbill. Since its early years, the Sugar Program has evolved to ensure \nthat beet and cane growers can continue to provide the United States \nwith a safe and reliable source of sugar products. I underscore \n``reliable'' because sugar is a unique commodity. Not only are sugar \ncrops extremely limited in their seasons, but an added component is \nthat both sugar beets and cane must be processed immediately after \nharvest. Processing involves what is essentially a refinery.\n  In Wyoming we have three facilities that process sugar, all of which \nare grower owned and operated. People can always tell its October back \nhome when the large piles of sugar beets begin to appear outside the \nsugar plants. Workers race to produce raw sugar before the beets go \nbad. Any number of complications can spoil the crop and put the sugar \nrefineries out of business.\n  Such unique conditions produce risk that is not common with other \nagricultural commodities. Because much of the year's sugar is produced \nin such a small window, a sugar program is needed to stabilize the \nprice of sugar through the entire year. This policy benefits the very \npeople who opponents of the Sugar Program wish to protect.\n  With stability in the sugar markets confectioners, food \nmanufacturers, and beveragemakers have a steady supply of quality sugar \nwithout wild price swings. Not only are U.S. sugar prices stable under \nthe program, but the United States offers sugar users some of the \nlowest prices in the developed world.\n  I also wish to add that the U.S. Sugar Program works to ensure that \nother nations have access to sugar markets. Some claim the U.S. Sugar \nProgram is a protectionist policy. This could not be more false. Mr. \nPresident, 17 of the largest sugar exporting countries in Africa, Asia, \nthe Caribbean, Central America, and South America have all expressed \nsupport for the U.S. Sugar Program.\n  As a matter of fact, the United States is the second largest net \nimporter of sugar behind only Russia. The program is operated to ensure \nthat we fulfill our trade obligations, especially within the WTO, and \ncontinues to provide a sugar market for developing nations wishing to \nexport their product.\n  Finally, the U.S. Sugar Program has been run for the past 10 years at \nzero cost to the U.S. taxpayers, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture \npredicts it will remain that way in its current form for at least 10 \nmore. As other colleagues have mentioned, this is all while the U.S. \nsugar industry has helped to generate nearly $20 billion in annual \neconomic activity in our country.\n  Wyoming offers just a few examples of how much of an economic impact \nthe sugar industry has on rural communities across our Nation. As I \nmentioned, the growers and local communities in my State own the plants \nthat refine the raw sugar we use every day. Those plants produce jobs \nand keep economic activity local. With all the inherent risks in sugar \nproduction, these communities are able to continue providing the United \nStates with a safe and reliable supply of sugar for the United States.\n  The U.S. sugar policy not only helps growers but keeps prices low for \nconsumers. Some American food manufacturers will claim that it is the \nprice of sugar causing them to shed jobs or move overseas. However, \nsugar represents only a small portion of the input costs that go into \nfood production. Instead, it is the cost of labor, environmental \nstandards, and regulatory burdens that play the biggest role in whether \nU.S. firms can compete with food markets overseas. In recent years, \nU.S. candy production has actually gone up, and the U.S. Sugar Program \nhas played its role by keeping prices stable.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to table amendment No. 2393 and keep \nthe programs that work in this farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to support and underscore the \npoints just made by Senator Enzi in support of the U.S. Sugar Program, \nwhich, as he indicated, has operated successfully at no cost to the \nAmerican taxpayers, consumers, or food manufacturers.\n  As you know, the sugar beet industry is very important to my State of \nIdaho, bringing in approximately $1.1 billion in revenue every year. \nHistory has shown that grocers and food manufacturers do not pass their \nsavings from lower ingredient prices along to consumers.\n  For example, from the summer of 2010 until now, producer prices for \nsugar have dropped nearly 20 percent. In fact, the U.S. Sugar Program \nremains crucial because other nations are implementing trade-distorting \nsubsidies for their otherwise uncompetitive sugar industries. The world \nsugar price, as is so often debated in these Halls, suffers from \ngovernment-backed dumping that protects sugar producers overseas to the \ndetriment of American sugar producers--hence, the need for the U.S. \nSugar Program.\n  Consumers in the rest of the world pay, on average, 14 percent more \nfor sugar--in the developed world, 24 percent more--than American \nconsumers pay. In America, sugar is a readily available and affordable \nproduct.\n  Critics of U.S. sugar policy make the argument that the program \ncauses disastrous shortages in U.S. sugar supply, which flies in the \nface of reality. U.S. farmers and producers have proven themselves, \ntime and again, to be the most efficient in the world, but they cannot \nbe left alone to face a trade market undermined by foreign government \nmanipulation.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth, and the latest numbers \nreleased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture underline that. The USDA \nnow estimates that there is enough sugar surplus to give every man, \nwoman, and child in this country nearly 12 pounds of sugar on top of \nwhat they already consume. This is enough surplus sugar to fill the \nCapitol Dome 55 times.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose any attempts at \nrepealing this program. At risk would be 142,000 American jobs \ngenerated by the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nsugar-producing industry. Many of these jobs would be lost to \nsubsidized foreign producers who are generally less efficient and less \nreliable and produce sugar far less safely and responsibly than \nAmerican sugar producers.\n  I support Idaho's sugar beet growers as well as sugar growers \nthroughout the country. I am committed to ensuring that they have \naccess to the tools they need to produce an affordable and abundant \nsugar supply.\n  The bottom line is not only is this program not a cost to the U.S. \ntaxpayer, it generates revenue to help us reduce our deficit. These are \nthe kinds of programs we need to protect American producers.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose the Shaheen amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nShaheen and others which would phase out the Federal Sugar Program. I \nwould like to share some of my personal history with my colleagues. My \ngrandfather and grandmother emigrated from Japan to work at McBryde \nSugar Company on the island of Kauai in 1899. In my office here in \nWashington, I have a framed copy of the contract on which my \ngrandfather, Asakichi Inouye, placed his ``X.'' The contract includes a \nphotograph of this brave young man and his wife and a little baby boy \nthey are holding, my father.\n  Nearly a century later, Asakichi Inouye's grandson is proud to be \nrepresenting the State of Hawaii in the United States Senate. With \nexception of one, all of Hawaii's sugar plantations are now closed. The \nHawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company, HC, remains operational on the \nisland of Maui and employs nearly 800 employees. HC is Hawaii's \nlargest provider of raw sugar, producing approximately 200,000 tons \neach year. In addition to the growing and milling of sugarcane, HC \nproduces raw sugar, specialty sugar, molasses, and the generation and \nsale of electricity to help provide power across the island.\n  I am proud to represent the men and women in Hawaii who still work \ndirectly or indirectly for the sugar industry, and their families. \nThese agricultural workers, who are among the world's most productive, \nhave enjoyed collective bargaining for decades and are rewarded for \ntheir productivity with good wages, with some of the best health care \nbenefits in the country, and with generous benefits for insurance and \nretirement. Their safety and their health are bolstered by some of the \nstrictest worker protection rules and highest environmental standards \nin the Nation, and possibly in the world.\n  These workers, many of whose families have been in sugar for three or \nfour generations, lead comfortable, but by no means extravagant lives. \nThey can put their children through college and can look forward to a \ndecent retirement, but they are far from wealthy in the monetary sense.\n  The U.S. sugar policy has ensured American consumers with dependable \nsupplies of reasonably priced sugar, adhering to U.S. standards for \nfood safety and quality. Consumers in other developed countries pay on \naverage 24 percent more for their sugar than American consumers. The \nU.S. Sugar Program provides no subsidies to American sugar producers. \nFor the past 10 years, the policy has operated at zero cost to \ntaxpayers, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts it will \nremain at zero cost for the next 10 years, to 2022. In the absence of a \nU.S. sugar policy, it would eliminate or severely damage the no-\ntaxpayer-cost U.S. sugar policy, and, among other things, shift \nAmerican jobs overseas. Hawaii's existing sugar producer could \npotentially close, forcing my constituents to lose their livelihood.\n  If the U.S. sugar policy were eliminated, our U.S. market would be \nflooded with subsidized sugar from the world dump market that is less \nreliable and less safe. The U.S. market would collapse, and efficient \nAmerican sugar farmers would be driven out of business. Job and incomes \nlosses would devastate rural economies where sugar is grown and harm \nurban economies where sugar is processed.\n  Further, if the U.S. sugar policy were eliminated Americans would \nhave to cope with less reliable, less safe, more costly, foreign sugar. \nAmerican consumers demand consistent quantity and quality. In other \nwords, when consumers go to the grocery store to purchase sugar, they \nexpect a high-quality product that is safe and contaminant free and \nidentical with every purchase. They also expect to find such products \non the shelf whenever they want to buy them. This is exactly what the \nAmerican consumer gets from the U.S. sugar industry--so much so that we \ntake it for granted. Further, in many of these countries, producers \noperate with labor, environmental, and food safety standards or \nenforcement that is much less than what American producers routinely \nmeet. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to table Shaheen amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 2392, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote, and that the time \nbe controlled by Senator Stabenow and Senator Paul.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, our system of helping ensure that no one in \nour country goes hungry is a noble one. We are now asking to spend $750 \nbillion on food stamps. When we ask this, we need to remember that \nrecently a woman in Chicago faked the birth of triplets in order to \nreceive $21,000 in food stamps. We need to remember that millionaires, \nincluding Larry Fick, who won $2 million, is still receiving food \nstamps because he says he has no income. He has $2 million but no \nincome. Amanda Clayton won $1 million recently in the lottery and she \nwas aghast she lost a third of it to taxes. She now has two homes and \nmortgage payments and doesn't know how can she make it without food \nstamps. So we are paying millionaires food stamps. Thirty percent of \nPolk County inmates are getting food stamps.\n  There has to be some reason. Should you be able to buy junk food on \nfood stamps? Should you get to go to McDonald's on food stamps? This is \nout of control. It is not about helping those in need, it is about \nbeing wise with taxpayer dollars and not giving people $20,000 a year \nin food stamps. We need to give only to those who cannot work, those \nwho are infirm, those who are diseased and are not able-bodied. But we \nare giving to millionaires, and we are paying for junk food and giving \nto those who go to McDonald's, and it has to stop.\n  This program has doubled in the last 10 years. We do not have an \nendless supply of money. I think Americans would be flabbergasted at \nthe amount of money and that some of these programs are duplicative. \nPeople getting food stamps for a meal are also getting a free lunch at \nschool. Some of these programs are actually advertising for applicants. \nIn my hometown they advertise to try to promote people coming in and \ngetting the free lunch during the summertime.\n  It is not that we won't help people, it is that we need to be \nconscious of how much money we have and that we help only those who \ncannot help themselves. I would ask for some reason. The food stamp \nprogram is exploding, and I recommend we vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, I strongly oppose this \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote to table it.\n  I would agree with the Senator from Kentucky that nobody who wins the \nlottery should get food assistance, and we outright ban it in this \nbill. We outright ban a number of areas where there has been waste, \nfraud, and abuse. This bill does more on accountability on food \nassistance than we have seen in many years. But it also doesn't do what \nthis amendment does, which is block grant funding, cut it, send it back \nto the States with no requirement it be used for people who truly need \nit.\n  I can tell you, coming from Michigan, I have people who have never \nbefore in their lives needed help with food assistance. They are \nmortified; they have paid taxes their whole life and they have never \nasked for help, but now that the plant has closed, they need some \ntemporary help. Those folks are, on average, getting help for 10 months \nor less, and they deserve every dollar we can help them with.\n  I want to make sure that every single dollar goes where it should go. \nWaste, fraud, and abuse we tackle. But for somebody in this great \ncountry who has paid their taxes all their lives and worked all their \nlives and now needs help to put food on the table for the balance of \nthe month, they need to know we are going to provide a little bit of \ntemporary help.\n  This amendment is outrageous and would go completely against the \ncommitment we as a country have made to help those who truly need it. I \nurge we vote yes to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I was unable to vote on the motion \nto table the Paul amendment No. 2182 this morning due to a family \ncommitment, but should I have been present, I would have voted yea on \nthe motion to table the amendment.\n  SNAP was effective in helping over 786,157 individuals in my own \nCommonwealth of Virginia--including children and the elderly--have the \nresources necessary to purchase healthy food this past year. I believe \nthat turning this program into a State block grant, as Senator Paul's \namendment would have done, would not allow this program to continue to \nbe as effective. SNAP is the bedrock of our national nutrition safety \nnet, serving as a first line of defense against hunger, and during this \nlast economic downturn has made sure that low-income families across \nthe Commonwealth and the country are helped in putting food on the \ntable each night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. MR. President, I now ask unanimous consent the pending \nmotion to recommit be withdrawn; that amendment No. 2390 be withdrawn; \nthat the Stabenow-Roberts amendment, No. 2389, be agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be considered original text for the purpose of further \namendment; that the following four amendments be the first amendments \nin order to the bill with no other first-degree amendments in order \nuntil these amendments are disposed of: Coburn, No. 2353; Hagan, No. \n2366; DeMint, No. 2385; McCaskill, No. 2222; that there be up to 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees on each of these amendments; that upon the use or yielding \nback of this time on all four amendments the\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nSenate proceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted; that there be no amendments or motions in order to the \namendments prior to the votes other than on motions to waive points of \norder and motions to table; that upon disposition of these amendments, \nI be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wonder if I might ask the leader a question through the \nChair. It would seem to me the process we are planning now is that the \nleader is deciding what amendments we will vote on and what we will \nnot. I wonder if he would be open to the consideration of us sending up \n40 amendments over the next 4 days and coming to an agreement on this, \nbecause what we are playing now is a game of low priority amendments \nversus high priority amendments in the name of saying we are doing \nsomething rather than having an open amendment process, which is the \ntradition of the Senate. My question to him is would he be amenable to \nhave a discussion on a much larger number of amendments so we don't \ncontinue to get out of order? This is the first time I remember seeing \nthis list, and this is a very low priority amendment for many.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish my friend was near as exercised over \nthe year, 18 months, on getting on a bill. It takes us a week to get on \na bill because we have to file motions to invoke cloture every time we \nproceed to a bill. We could save a lot of time if we could get on a \nbill. One reason there used to be so much, as he said, tradition--\ntradition has been spilled into the spillways--is that it was a rare \noccasion you had to do anything to invoke cloture on a motion to \nproceed. Now it is what we do every time because the Republicans demand \nthat.\n  In direct answer to the question, I have worked with Senator Roberts \nand Senator Stabenow. We are trying to get some amendments up. They may \nbe low priority on his part, my friend from Oklahoma, but some people \nthink these are important amendments. The two we just finished, no one \ncan consider those low priority amendments, dealing with foodstamps and \nwith sugar. These are always big deals on this farm bill.\n  So I say to my friend, Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow are \ntrying to come up with a list. The Republicans are having some kind of \na steering meeting or whatever it is now. Maybe the Senator can go and \nvisit with them and try to help us get a list.\n  I am not going to talk out here about a number, but as we did on the \nhighway bill, we have done it on the FDA bill, come up with some \namendments. There is plenty of dead time around here, and we don't have \nto spend a lot of time on the amendments themselves. Once we agree to \nthem, we keep on talking about them forever.\n  To answer the Senator's question, yes, I would be happy if we could \nget, as we have been trying to get for a long time, an agreed-upon \ngroup of amendments. I want to finish the farm bill. I think it is \nextremely important to our country.\n  So, I say to my friend, I hope we can work something out. I have told \nmy friend, the junior Senator from Michigan and the chairman of this \ncommittee, I would like something so we can enter into an agreement \ntoday and start voting on some of these amendments tomorrow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would the leader be willing to yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much. To emphasize what the leader \nindicated earlier, isn't it true that while we are moving forward step \nby step--before we get a larger universal agreement--as he has said, \nthe leader is open to work with me, Senator Roberts, and Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to get a larger list in the range in which the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma has talked about and certainly a \nlist which we would begin to move through?\n  But while we are doing that, rather than just biding time on the \nfloor, this gives Members an opportunity to debate on issues they care \ndeeply about and continue to move forward.\n  In fact, is it the leader's desire that we do this and that we are in \nthe process of putting together that larger universe of amendments?\n  Mr. REID. In response to my friend's question, the reason we had \nthese two votes this morning is while we are working on coming up with \na finite list of amendments, why sit around and twiddle our thumbs? At \nleast through this process, we have gotten two major amendments out of \nthe way. They are gone.\n  If my friend continues his objection, I am going to set up some more \nvotes this way. Listen, this is not my preference for doing these \nbills. But I say to my friend, I would hope with the concern the \nSenator has for the finances of this country and how he cares about our \ncountry, care a little bit about these motions to proceed which are \nsuch a waste of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I take the leader at his word. I will go \nback to my caucus and explain that I object to this group of bills, but \nI would also note we did get two amendments out of the way. The one \namendment on sugar that had the potential to pass wasn't the one we \nchose.\n  So I come back to the point, never in the history of the Senate, with \nthe rate at which we see now, did we give up our rights to allow the \nmajority leader to decide what amendments will be voted on or offered. \nIn fact, for the last 3 days, we could have had a great open process of \nhaving the floor open for amendments and moved 8 or 10 amendments a \nday. I understand the conflict. I understand what he is trying to do, \nand I understand the political ramifications of that.\n  I will go and seek the counsel and guidance of my caucus and return \nand give the leader's message.\n  With that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves the floor, I also look back at the \ndays, as is recounted in Caro's book and as we have heard here, to the \ndays when the majority leader truly did some things. During the days of \nLyndon Johnson, we couldn't even have a vote on anything unless he gave \nthe nod. I don't have that power anymore. That has changed over the \nyears, but I would love to be able to have a bill brought to the floor. \nIf we were able to get rid of these senseless motions to proceed that I \nhave to file cloture on, we could spend a lot of time debating and \namending these bills, and that is what we need to get to.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the majority leader would yield, I think the leader \ncould eliminate motions to proceed very easily by saying that every \nbill that comes to the floor will have an open and honest debate \ndetermined by what colleagues and Members would like to debate, but we \nhave not seen that. That is not just the Democratic control of the \nSenate; we have seen some with the Republican control of the Senate as \nwell.\n  We are not going to solve that problem now. I will take counsel with \nmy caucus, and I will get back to the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2406\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. \n1940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the farm bill and \nrecognize the fine work the Senate Agriculture Committee did in \nbringing this bill forward.\n  I am disappointed, to say the least, that this bill is bogged down in \nlegislative games. This bill is too important for folks to play \npolitics. If we want to talk about a lack of predictability, this is a \nprime example. We should be passing a bill and instead games are being \nplayed.\n  Agriculture is the largest industry in Montana. Montana's farmers and \nranchers produce the food that powers the Nation. Providing an \neffective safety net for those of us in production agriculture is \nimportant, and it is potentially very costly. It would have been easy \nfor the Senate Agriculture Committee to write a bill that keeps \nspending at the levels of the last farm bill, but they did not.\n  This bill recognizes the fiscal challenges we face. It cuts more than \n$23 billion, more than double the amount proposed by the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission.\n  Due to the good work of the Senate Agriculture Committee, this bill \nproduces meaningful savings and reduces the number of programs at the \nDepartment of Agriculture. At the same time the bill preserves a strong \nsafety net for farmers, invests in conservation and nutrition and \ninstitutes much needed reforms.\n  I have offered amendments to address the issues that still face \nfarmers and ranchers around the country. The first is my provision to \nensure that farmers will be able to buy public varieties of seeds. My \namendment will make sure the Department of Agriculture follows through \non the government's commitment to public seed varieties. It ensures \nthat the USDA will devote the resources necessary to support a strong \npublic breeding program and develop public plant and animal varieties. \nFor too long the Agriculture Department has failed to promote public \nseed varieties. The USDA must support diverse seed research that \nfarmers can adapt to various growing conditions.\n  My amendment will not solve the problem, but it is a necessary first \nstep to ensure that farmers have a choice of what kind of seeds to \npurchase.\n  I have also introduced an amendment that takes a proactive approach \nto protect our country's livestock producers. Back in 2009, Senator \nBarrasso and I wrote a new law to help livestock producers get \ncompensation for losses related to wolves. Any producer will tell us \nthey would rather prevent predation than get compensated for a loss, \nbut losses do happen. A number of States receive some assistance from \nthat program. That is why I have introduced an amendment to help \nproducers protect their livestock from the threat of predation. It is a \ncommonsense solution to support livestock producers who live near \nprotected populations of predators.\n  Speaking of commonsense amendments, I am also offering what some have \ncalled the biggest package of sportsmen's bills in a generation. My \nsportsmen's act combines over 20 different sportsmen bills. It comes in \nresponse to the concerns I have heard as a chairman of the \nCongressional Sportsmen's Caucus.\n  What I hear most often from sportsmen is the importance of access to \npublic lands. That is why this bill dedicates funding to ensure \nsportsmen's access to some of the best places to hunt and fish in this \ncountry.\n  Some folks might ask why is this important, but hunting and fishing \nis a way of life in places such as Montana. In fact, one in three \nMontanans hunts big game and over 50 percent fish. For us, it is not \njust recreation, it is a critical part of our economy. It drives and \nsustains jobs.\n  So Senator Thune and I, as cochairs of the Congressional Sportsmen's \nCaucus, have combined the best bills and ideas from Republicans and \nDemocrats. In addition to preserving access to public lands, it \nreauthorizes several vital conservation programs and preserves our \nshooting heritage. That is why it has the support in a wide variety of \nsportsmen and conservation groups. Neither party has a monopoly on good \nideas.\n  My sportsman's act takes the best from the House bill and the best \nfrom both sides of the aisle in the Senate to move the ball forward for \nsportsmen and sportswomen in Montana and the Nation. By adding this \nsportsmen's package to the farm bill, we will conserve some of our most \nproductive habitat, passing on hunting and fishing traditions to future \ngenerations and entrusting them to those who care about them the most.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Tester are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. TESTER. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, earlier this week I came to the \nSenate floor to speak about the importance of the forestry title in \nwhat is a bipartisan farm bill we are considering right now as I speak.\n  In my previous remarks, I spoke about a growing emergency in our \nNation's forests caused by the largest bark beetle outbreak in our \nrecorded history--an outbreak that is projected to kill nearly every \nlodgepole pine in Colorado.\n  I know the Presiding Officer from the neighboring State of New Mexico \nis experiencing these same conditions in his State. The Forest Service \nhas estimated that 100,000 dead trees are falling in our forests every \nday. Hard to imagine, but their estimates are such: 100,000 trees every \nday. That means our landscapes are littered with tinder ready to burn, \nwhich, combined with the hot dry summer we are already experiencing, is \na recipe for a disastrous fire season.\n  Mother Nature bats last, which means much of what we face is out of \nour control. But we can act, and we must act, in order to manage the \nmagnitude of the crisis in our home States.\n  In some ways--I know the Presiding Officer sees this the same way I \ndo--the forests in Colorado are the canaries in the coal mine that tie \nus into and identify the effects of a changing climate. Warmer \ntemperatures and drought conditions have exacerbated beetle \ninfestations in our forests, and we are now dealing with an \nunprecedented combination of explosive fire season events.\n  There is a raging Colorado wildfire today, as I stand here, in \nLarimer County--the High Park Fire--and it continues to grow. It has \nconsumed over 46,000 acres. It has claimed the life of a local \nhomeowner, and it is causing devastating effects in the surrounding \ncommunities. As of first thing this morning, only 10 percent of the \nfire had been contained. We have made sure, though, that all available \nresources are dedicated to this effort. I am told we now have over \n1,000 firefighters on site,\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nwhich is good news. We will not know the true costs of the fire for \nsome time, but it, undoubtedly, will have a lasting effect on my State.\n  I want to assure Coloradans that I will continue to closely monitor \nthe High Park Fire to ensure that firefighters on the ground have all \nthe resources they need to beat back this devastating blaze. I also \nurge my fellow Coloradans to heed the warnings and follow the \nevacuation guidance of the firefighters who are tasked with keeping us \nsafe. Most importantly, I ask that we keep these brave public servants \nin mind as they work to protect lives and personal property--especially \nas what is a very unpredictable fire progresses.\n  Again, I know the Presiding Officer has had a series of fires in his \nState, and he knows the capricious nature of wildfire. I want to also, \nin giving a little more background, point out that the High Park Fire \nis burning predominantly on private land. But it is moving rapidly into \na beetle-infested national forest. This is a reminder of exactly why we \nneed flexibility to treat hazardous beetle-killed trees and to engage \nthe public in the active and collaborative management of our Nation's \nforests.\n  We cannot reverse the tragic loss of life and property that the High \nPark Fire and many other fires have caused, but it is essential that we \ntake steps to understand what can be done in the future to better \nprevent, prepare, and respond to wildfires. We must learn more about \nthe conditions that make those fires catastrophic.\n  Let me start by talking about homeowners.\n  Homeowners can create what we know in our States is called defensible \nspace, depth space. That involves clearing brush, moving woodpiles, and \nlooking at other actions through which we can protect structures. Those \nactions have been proven to be the hallmark of what has saved such \nproperties in past fires.\n  These are important takeaways we have learned in my State of Colorado \nin the wake of catastrophic fires, and they are also the result of \nsubsequent stories and studies that I have called for to inform the \npublic about what they can do to protect their homes and property.\n  The same studies have also taught us that Federal forest management \npolicies must prioritize tree removal around communities to protect \nhomes, roads, and infrastructure--something I have fought to provide \nresources for over the last decade. The added benefit to these efforts \nis that they create local jobs and support the critically important \ntimber industry in our States.\n  But that is not all. We must also advance new policies that will \nactually help prepare our firefighters to combat these raging fires. A \nrecent example of this is action the Senate took to pass a bill I \ncosponsored to expedite the purchase of much needed air tankers to \nfight wildfires. Our Nation's tanker fleet has aged and dwindled \ndramatically in recent years. Without sufficient air tankers, we are \nill-prepared to respond to catastrophic fires--especially multiple \nfires at once. I am pleased the Congress passed this bill, and I \nunderstand the President is prepared to act quickly to sign the air \ntanker legislation into law. Still, we need to and we can do more.\n  We need more flexibility to treat forests more comprehensively. I \nbelieve, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the forestry \ntitle of the farm bill is a good start. However, I believe it does not \ngo far enough to authorize adequate resources to treat forests that \nhave been affected by bark beetle infestations.\n  The Forest Service's bark beetle strategy calls for doubling the \nnumber of acres it has been able to treat in past years. In other \nwords, the Forest Service is saying: Look, we want to double what we \nhave been doing. We believe we have the expertise to do that. What else \ndo they need, though? They need money.\n  In fiscal year 2011, the Forest Service allocated $110 million to \ntreating acres affected by bark beetles in the Western United States. \nBut if we are going to double that acreage, we are going to need more \nFederal support.\n  A year ago I fought to increase the amount of funding the Forest \nService had available to treat hazardous trees. I worked with the \nadministration and strongly supported a reprogramming request that \nwould have allowed the Forest Service to use extra money to treat \nproblem areas in the West.\n\n  The Senate supported this commonsense request. But, I have to tell \nyou, unfortunately, the House Appropriations Committee stood in the way \nof getting these critical funds into the forests where it was and is \nstill needed most. So that inaction meant that thousands of acres of \nbeetle-killed trees were not treated--areas that are potentially now \nworsening the High Park Fire as we speak.\n  In the new farm bill, the Agriculture Committee has authorized $100 \nmillion for designated treatment areas affected by beetle infestation, \nwhich is less money than last year, and certainly not enough to double \nthe number of acres that were targeted for fire prevention and tree \nremoval.\n  At the current authorization level of $100 million, the Forest \nService simply will be unable to meet its goal. To help remedy this, I \nhave filed a bipartisan amendment, No. 2295, with Senator Thune of \nSouth Dakota, which would increase the authorization for funding to \n$200 million to authorize adequate resources in order for the Forest \nService to address these looming and immediate emergencies.\n  I have been a strong advocate for finding ways to ensure we are \nprudent in how we spend taxpayer dollars, but the need to address this \ncrisis is immediate and the threat to public health, safety, and our \neconomy will only get worse, causing us to pay more later. Another way \nto put it is it is less expensive to prevent fires, to prepare for \nfires, than it is to fight fires and then be involved in the \nrehabilitation of those landscapes after those devastating fires are \nfinally put out.\n  In addition to the amendment I have filed with Senator Thune that \nwould provide increased authorization for the funding of tree removal, \nI have also filed amendment No. 2294 that would extend Colorado's good \nneighbor authority.\n  Good neighbor authority gives the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau \nof Land Management the capability and the power to enter into \ncooperative agreements with State foresters to plan and implement \nforest health projects on more acres more efficiently. This would give \nmy State and other States the opportunity to collaborate with Federal \nagencies to perform forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration \nservices--actions that a study I requested after the Fourmile Canyon \nFire in Boulder County, CO, found firsthand helps agencies and \nhomeowners better prepare to reduce the risk of damage and loss of life \nfrom wildfires.\n  Lest viewers and those who are interested in wildfires think they are \nan aberration, wildfires are actually a fact of life in the West and in \nforests in general, and they will continue to occur over and over again \nin Colorado. But I am committed to doing everything possible to learn \nfrom every fire and take whatever precautionary measures we can, with \nthe hope of saving more lives, property, and communities in the future.\n  As I have said before--and we all know--wildfires can easily become a \nmultimillion-dollar effort affecting every level of government. As the \nbark beetle epidemic continues to present a significant threat to our \neconomy, critical infrastructure, and important natural resources, we \nmust allocate resources to address this epidemic up front in a \ncommonsense way.\n  Again, I know the Presiding Officer has faced these challenges head \non in his State. Some may see this as just solely a western problem, \nbut I urge my colleagues to support bipartisan efforts to ensure that \nwe manage our forests to reduce fire risk, protect water supplies, and \nbolster our economy.\n  Forests all over our country are susceptible and vulnerable to fires. \nWe can work together in the Senate to ensure that we have the tools to \nprotect our forests and protect the communities and the people who live \nin those communities.\n  I look forward to the Senate taking up these two important amendments \nin the near future as we hopefully move the farm bill to passage in the \nSenate and to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I do week \nafter week, and have since the health care bill was signed into law, \nwith a doctor's second opinion about the health care law. I do that as \nsomeone who practiced medicine, taking care of families all around \nWyoming for about a quarter century.\n  I continue to hear great concerns from folks back home and across the \ncountry about the health care law. So often people ask the question: \nDoes the President understand the health care law?\n  Well, last week President Obama shocked a lot of Americans when he \nmade a statement--not on the teleprompter but off script--that the \n``private sector was doing fine.'' He said the private sector was doing \nfine. He said the weaknesses in our economy had to do with State and \nlocal government.\n  The words made it very clear to people in this country that the \nPresident is not in touch with what is happening in this country--\nspecifically with the economy.\n  But then on Monday, the President said something else about the \nhealth care law that made it once again look as though he doesn't \nunderstand what is happening all across America. During an interview \nthe President was doing with a local news reporter from Sioux City, IA, \nhe actually was surprised to learn that his health care law is hurting \nsmall businesses--certainly hurting small businesses all across the \ncountry. He was surprised to learn of that.\n  While the news doesn't come as a shock to most Americans, it \ndefinitely caught President Obama off guard. Here is what happened. The \nIowa reporter told the President that one business in Iowa needed to \n``close up shop and move the jobs back to Wisconsin'' because of the \nPresident's health care law. The President's response to the reporter I \nfound troubling. President Obama said:\n\n       Yeah, that would be kind of hard to explain, because the \n     only folks that have been impacted in terms of the health \n     care bill are insurance companies.\n\n  The President said that the only folks--only folks--who have been \nimpacted in terms of the health care bill are insurance companies.\n  That is why I continue to come to the floor with a doctor's second \nopinion, ever since Nancy Pelosi made the famous statement that ``first \nyou have to pass it before you get to find out what is in it.''\n  I had hoped that by now the President would actually know what is in \nthe health care law. By his statements to this reporter in Iowa, it \ncertainly seems to me the President does not know what is in the health \ncare law, does not know how it is impacting jobs and the economy in the \nUnited States. How on Earth can President Obama believe insurance \ncompanies are the only people impacted by the health care law? Small \nbusinesses all across the country are being slammed by the law's \nexpensive mandates--the mandates that people have to have government-\napproved insurance, which is much more expensive than what they had \nbefore. The insurance premiums that he promised would drop by $2,500 \nper family have actually gone up higher and faster than if the law had \nnever been passed. The President said if you like what you have, you \ncan keep it. We know that millions of Americans who had insurance they \nliked are not able to keep it.\n  The fact is that colleges are dropping their insurance plans for \nstudents because, under the President's law, those insurance plans were \ngoing to go up anywhere from 4 to 10 times more as a result of the \nmandates that those students buy government-approved levels of \ninsurance, which was a lot more insurance than the students needed, \nwanted, or could afford. So the colleges are saying we cannot pass this \nexpense on to students, so we are going to drop it entirely.\n  It is astonishing that the President doesn't realize how many people \nare impacted in a bad way by his own health care law. He thinks it is \nonly the insurance companies, but small business owners are forced now, \nbecause of this law, to choose between bad choices. One is that they \ncan offer very high-cost government-approved insurance, making it much \nmore expensive for them to try to run their business and hire workers \nin this time of significant uncertainty in the economy, or they won't \noffer any health coverage at all because they cannot afford the law's \nout-of-touch and expensive insurance mandates. The choice is completely \nunacceptable, and the President should know that.\n  Someone in the White House ought to be informing the President. They \nought to clearly be leveling with the President about the impact of his \nbill, his law, and his understanding of it, and what the impacts are on \nAmerican families and the American economy. The private sector is not \ndoing fine. This health care law negatively impacts people across the \ncountry, including many small business owners.\n  The President also deserves to know from his advisers that his health \ncare law is having a significant impact on American seniors.\n  Earlier this week, Senator Coburn and I joined the rest of the \nRepublican health care providers in Congress, in the House and Senate, \nand released a ``Doctor's Note on Medicare.'' This new report details \nhow the President's health care law specifically makes it harder for \nAmerica's seniors to get the care they need from a doctor they choose \nat a lower price.\n  I want to walk you through this report. There is a section called \n``10 Facts Seniors Need to Know About Medicare's Future.'' I will focus \non five of those.\n  One, to control Medicare spending, instead of trusting seniors, the \nPresident empowered 15 unelected bureaucrats. That is right, the \nPresident set up the Independent Payment Advisory Board, people who \nwould be politically appointed--not elected by the voters but unelected \nbureaucrats. They will be the ones in charge of deciding and \ncontrolling Medicare spending.\n  Another is that doctors overwhelmingly believe the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board will hurt seniors' access to care. This is under \nthe facts that seniors need to know about Medicare's future as a result \nof the President's health care law.\n  In a recent survey, 80 percent of doctors said this Independent \nPayment Advisory Board, which the President liked and put in his health \ncare law, will cut reimbursement rates to doctors, which will harm \nseniors' access to care.\n  Now let's go to a third. Without congressional action, Medicare \nreimbursement rates will drop about 30 percent at the end of the year, \nwhich would harm seniors' access to care. That is in the law as it \nstands now. If the law isn't changed, that cut will automatically go \ninto place, and it is going to be that much harder for seniors to get \ndoctors. Seniors are very concerned right now about being able to find \na doctor. If their doctor retires, they may have a hard time finding a \nnew doctor. If the senior moves locations, they may have a hard time \nfinding a doctor in that location. This is an increasing problem that \nis made worse by the health care law.\n  I think the President deserves to hear that and to know that and to \nrealize the impact his law has had on people way beyond, as he says, \njust insurance companies. The President also needs to know--because \nseniors know--that the President's health care law took $530 billion \nfrom Medicare--not to save Medicare, not to strengthen Medicare, but to \nspend on other programs not for seniors. The health care law cut more \nthan $\\1/2\\ trillion from the Medicare Program to fund new government \nprograms. Seniors realize this, and it is\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\ntime the President of the United States understood the impact of the \ndecisions he made when he signed this health care bill into law.\n\n  Many seniors on Medicare Advantage will lose their plan. More than \none in four seniors are currently on Medicare Advantage. It is a choice \nthey make. They know they are on Medicare Advantage. Over 11 million \nseniors are on Medicare Advantage. Yet, according to the Actuary of \nMedicare alone, by 2017, when the Medicare Advantage cuts in the \nPresident's health care law are fully implemented, roughly half--half--\nof seniors who like the Medicare Advantage plan they have will lose it.\n  The President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. \nPerhaps he should have realized the bill he signed into law would cause \nhim to break a number of the promises he made to the American people. \nThat is another one of those broken promises. So the President \npromised: If you like what you have, you can keep it. But we find out \nmany more people are not able to keep what they have. And the President \nsaid his plan would lower insurance costs by $2,500 per family. Yet we \nsee insurance rates have gone up, and they are going up faster than if \nthe law had never been passed in the first place.\n  So the reality is from the time I gave my second opinion speech last \nweek until today, the President needs to realize the private sector is \nnot fine and his health care law hurts small businesses, hurts seniors, \nand hurts patients all across this country. If the President wants to \ndo something to help the private sector, he should work with Congress \nto repeal his health care law and to replace it with better reforms \nthat would actually be better for patients and providers and taxpayers.\n  This health care law, as I see it, is bad for patients, it is bad for \nproviders--the nurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--\nand it is terrible for the American taxpayer. What we need is health \ncare reform that actually provides the care for people they need from a \ndoctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sugar Program\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to multiple \namendments to the farm bill that would undermine critical support for \nAmerican sugar producers and the American jobs they create. These \namendments would pull the rug out from underneath sugar beet producers \nin my home State of Montana. It would leave farmers and other sugar \nindustry workers in Montana and across the country vulnerable to job \nloss. In these tough economic times, this is a step backwards in job \ncreation, and that is a step we can't afford to take.\n  Montana is the fifth largest sugar beet-producing State in the \nNation. In 2010, our cash receipts totaled more than $66 million, and \nthose dollars mean good-paying American jobs. That is why the farm bill \ncontinues the vital support that helps America's sugar producers \nsustain more than 140,000 jobs and nearly $20 billion in economic \nactivity every year.\n  Our sugar policy is a proven investment in American jobs at no cost \nto the taxpayer. That is right. Let me repeat that. The U.S. sugar \npolicy doesn't cost American taxpayers a single cent. So why in the \nworld would we want to get rid of this proven job creator at a time \nwhen jobs should be our No. 1 priority?\n  The policy does not restrict access to lower sugar prices for \nmanufacturers, but it allows sugar producers from Montana and the rest \nof the United States to compete in the world market with access to less \nquality sugar, cheaper labor, and fewer regulations. Other countries \nvery strongly protect their sugar industry.\n  Some argue our Sugar Program, while not costing the American taxpayer \ndirectly, costs them indirectly at the grocery store. But let me be \nvery clear: For every $1 candy bar bought at a grocery store, only 2 \ncents of that total cost is sugar. For every $1, only 2 cents of the \ncost of that candy bar is sugar.\n  With no cost to the American people and proven benefits extending \nfrom rural farmers through the entire economy, this policy works. It is \na lifeline to Montana's sugar beet farmers and the rural communities in \nwhich they live. I would not let us get rid of a policy that supports \nproven job creators at a time when we need jobs more than ever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                             Food for Peace\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \naddress an issue related to hunger, a topic that is a significant \ncomponent of the farm bill we are debating, and particularly to raise \nthe topic associated with an amendment I have offered. It is amendment \nNo. 2403.\n  Most of us have heard the expression, since it is an old saying, that \ngoes like this: Give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach a man to \nfish and he will eat for the rest of his life.\n  By teaching someone how to fish or how to grow crops, we help them \nprovide food for themselves and for their families. The bill we are \nconsidering has funds set aside for a program called Food for Peace, \ntitle II. They are intended to do just that, to help combat world \nhunger and malnutrition. We have a long history in Kansas, Senator Dole \nbeing a prime example of someone who has cared greatly about hunger not \nonly in the United States but around the world. The funds used here in \nFood for Peace are very important to us, certainly as a matter of \nhumanitarian issues, but also to the security of our country and its \nfuture.\n  There are funds designated within that title II, some to be used for \nemergency aid and some to be used for developmental aid, the difference \nbeing the ability to respond to an immediate crisis or disaster, and \nother funds, the developmental aid, to be used to improve the chances \nthat crisis never occurs.\n  The question I want to raise with my colleagues here in the Senate is \nhow do we allocate the amount between emergency food aid and the amount \nof money we use to teach folks the skills necessary to help them \nsurvive when disaster strikes? We are not talking about any new \nspending, any new money; we are simply trying to address the issue how \ndo we allocate what amount has already been decided upon by the \ncommittee.\n  I have been to Darfur, for example, spent time in Sudan, and saw the \nefforts by many to keep people from starving. Those are very important. \nI am thankful for the generosity of Americans, both as charitable \norganizations and as taxpayers, who provide emergency food assistance \nto these people. We never want to have the kind of suffering we see \nthere and other places around the world.\n  But I am concerned about the allocation that is included in this bill \nand I have introduced an amendment to ensure that at least 20 percent \nof Food for Peace, the title II funds, is available each year for \nprevention-based programs that reduce hunger in poor, crisis-prone \ncommunities. If we can prevent the need for emergency food assistance \nand help more people gain the skills needed for their lifetime, then we \nshould do that. That is what this amendment is intended to do.\n  The legislation we are considering significantly reduces the minimum \namount of funding for developmental programs that equip vulnerable \npeople around the world to feed themselves. The farm bill, this farm \nbill we are debating, reduces by nearly 40 percent the amount of funds \nthat would be used for the important work of development aid. Instead, \nit directs those dollars to emergency food aid. The amendment I am \noffering would raise the minimum amount that would be spent on \ndevelopmental programs by 5 percent so we can prevent circumstances \nwhere people are starving and need that emergency aid.\n  This has been an issue we have worked on for a long period of time.\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nThis is my third farm bill as a Member of Congress. In the 2008 farm \nbill, we created a lockbox, an amendment I offered that was included in \nthe 2008 farm bill, that set aside about $450 million for purposes of \ndevelopmental aid, again trying to make certain we have the resources \nin place to reduce the chances we are going to need emergency aid. It \nis true that many countries have a high concentration of malnourished \nchildren, and subsistence farming usually goes hand in hand in those \ncircumstances.\n  Affected by droughts and crop failures, eroding soils, lack of \nsustainable income, these populations are short of food several months \nof the year and they oftentimes need emergency food aid as a result. As \na consequence of that circumstance, even though title II emergency food \naid programs are intended to be short-lived, lasting between a few \nmonths maybe up to a year, usually most emergency food aid is directed \nto the same areas, year after year, because of the continuing need. It \nis a reoccurring need, in fact, so year after year we are trying to \nprovide emergency food aid to the same populations and the same areas \nand the same countries.\n  My point is we would be wiser in spending our dollars by trying to \nreduce that reoccurring starvation, that recurring need, that lack of \nfood, because of the amount and length of a food crisis and the need to \nstretch our taxpayer dollars as far as possible. Because using food aid \nmore effectively is the key to success, the 2008 farm bill assured that \na portion of that food aid would be combined with technical assistance, \ntraining, and business development to boost agricultural productivity, \nconserve natural resources, link farmers to markets, and improve child \nnutrition, incomes, and diets.\n  That lockbox set aside about $450 million. It is expected, if this \nbill were fully funded, that these millions are nearly now $100 million \nless. So we are moving in the direction of providing a lot less \ndevelopmental aid. In fact, in the 1970s when this program was amended \nand altered, 75 percent of title II money, of Food for Peace money, was \nset aside for developmental aid. Over time, that amount has been \nreduced, time and time again. Through economic empowerment, improved \ninfrastructure, watershed innovations, these programs in developmental \naid help protect and safeguard against the need for emergency aid. \nProviding a consistent and adequate level of funding for prevention-\nbased programs has been proven to work.\n  For example, in Haiti, World Vision has been implementing a 5-year \nmulti-year assistance program, supported by developmental aid funding. \nThe central plateau region of Haiti has historically suffered from lack \nof adequate food, causing extremely high levels of poverty and stunting \namong children under 2 years of age. World Vision has worked with \nclinic and community health workers through a mobile clinic strategy to \nprovide nutritional and primary health care support to mothers and \nchildren. During their last national nutrition survey, large parts of \nthat central plateau moved from red and yellow, crisis and \nsevere insecurity areas, to green, indicating the investment in \npreventing malnutrition using the nonemergency programs is an effective \nand worthwhile investment in fighting ongoing hunger and preventing \nadditional use of emergency funds down the road.\n\n  In Haiti we see the example of using the prevention dollars to reduce \nthe need for disaster or crisis dollars. Title II prevention-based \nprograms are implemented by private, voluntary organizations and co-\nops. They are supported, begun, by the American people. They have \nregular audits and oversight. We are talking about organizations such \nas World Vision, as I mentioned, Catholic Relief Services, Food for \nHunger, Mercy Corps, Congressional Hunger, the United Methodist \nCommittee. These are folks who are engaged day in, day out, year in, \nyear out, in trying to prevent hunger from occurring or the \ncircumstances which create hunger in a community from occurring. The \ninability to plan and predict the uncertainty of the amount of money \nthat would be available by what we do each year in appropriations and \nwhat we do every few years in a farm bill makes their job much more \ndifficult. So the consistency of having the resources available to \nfight and the need to fight the circumstances that create the need for \ncrisis intervention is something that is important, as is the certainty \nthat can come from knowing there will always be this certain amount of \nmoney available for prevention.\n  Reasonable levels of food aid are important in both the urgent needs. \nThere are going to be crises. Certain things happen--floods, natural \ndisasters occur. We know we need to be able to respond quickly. But we \nalso know we need to be able to reduce the incidence of hunger \noccurring time and time again in certain areas of the world. With this \namendment, title II will still largely be used for emergencies but will \nincrease by a modest amount the funding for developmental programs that \nhelps eliminate the need for that emergency assistance down the road. I \nencourage my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment.\n  I know this has been a significant issue within the Senate Committee \non Agriculture and I appreciate their consideration of this topic. I \ncommend the chairperson, Senator Stabenow, and the ranking member, my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, for their tremendous efforts \ntrying to bring to the Senate a farm bill that meets both the needs of \nagricultural producers and the people they feed. I offer my sincere \nappreciation to both those Senators and other members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for their work.\n  I particularly wish to express my gratitude for the Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Roberts, for his continuing involvement in agriculture \nthroughout his time as a Member of the House, chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, now the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. His efforts on behalf of the folks back home as well as \naround the world are greatly appreciated by me.\n  Again I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support an adequate \nportion of the Food for Peace resources being used to stave off \nreoccurring food crises, rather than just reacting to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Food Stamp Program\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we deal with the farm bill we have to \nacknowledge that 80 percent of that bill now is the SNAP program, or \nthe Food Stamp Program. I will repeat that--80 percent of this bill. So \nwe need to not call it the farm bill anymore. It needs to be considered \nprimarily the Food Stamp bill as that's what it is.\n  When we look at the bill, our sponsors are rightly pleased that they \nhave tightened the belt of the farmers, they reduced some of the \nsubsidies and programs, they created a little better policy, I believe, \nand they deserve some credit for that. But of the $800 billion that \nwill be spent in the next 10 years, under current law--$800 billion \ncompared to $200 billion in the rest of the farm program--for the $800 \nbillion they are only claiming a $4 billion savings.\n  It is quite true that we in America do not want to have people \nhungry. We do not want to have people malnourished. What we want is to \nrun a Food Stamp Program that has integrity, that creates an incentive \nfor responsible personal behavior and that helps America to be a \nhealthy nation.\n  I do not think we are there yet. In fact, we have Members on the \nDemocratic side who are opposing even this $4 billion reduction in \nprojected spending. This is less than half of 1 percent. And some of \nthem don't even want to have that. Cut the farmers, all right, whack \nthem 10 percent; but don't make real cuts to anything else or deal with \nany other programs. So our challenge simply is to make sure that people \nwho are truly in need get the benefits. My Republican colleagues and I \nsee this as a program that is temporary, helping people through tough \ntimes and creating an incentive for them to move on, be successful, \nfind work and take care of themselves and their dependents.\n  I believe this chart will give some indication of the situation that \nwe are in today. It is an accurate illustration of spending in this \nbill, the 2013 bill, which begins October 1 of this year. The Food \nStamp Program will make up $82 billion out of the spending in this \nlegislation that we are dealing with. In the bill, $6 billion will go \nto conservation programs--which is not really a\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nfarmer's program, and they may get some benefits from it--another $6 \nbillion for commodities, which is the orange in the chart, and $8 \nbillion for crop insurance, which is the new fundamental basis of farm \npolicy. I am not complaining that farmers are being squeezed. \nHopefully, this has been done in a smart way that will also make those \nprograms better. However, what I am suggesting is that there is \nvirtually no change in the 80 percent of spending in this bill. We \ndon't have the money to waste especially if it can be done better and \nsmarter.\n  The main farm provisions in the bill experience a $14.7 billion \nreduction. That is a reduction of nearly 10 percent of spending \nrelative to the baseline. To add some context, if the food stamp \nportion were to be reduced by 10 percent, it would save the U.S. \nTreasury $75 billion. Food stamp spending has quadrupled since 2001. It \ndoubled between 2001 and 2006. Some people say the reason food stamp \nuse is up is due to unemployment and recession. Well, that is not the \nentire story. For example, from 2001 to 2006, under President Bush's \ntime when the economy had a small recession but was moving along very \nstrongly in 2006, it still doubled from 2001 to 2006. At that time \nunemployment remained at about 5 percent. It is now 8 percent. When \nfood stamps were first expanded nationally, 1 in 50 Americans were on \nthe program. Today that number has increased to 1 in 7.\n  Are we confident that each of those seven Americans need this kind of \nsubsidy? Are we sure that is needed? I believe we need to examine the \nprogram. If they need this benefit, let's get it for them. If not, \nlet's not.\n  There are nearly 80 welfare programs provided by the U.S. Government, \nand 17 are for food and nutrition support. I repeat, 17 programs are \nfor food and nutrition support. The costs now exceed $700 billion \nannually for all of these Federal programs, food and others too, plus \n$200 billion in State contributions. So that is almost $1 trillion a \nyear, which is so much money it is difficult to express.\n  For example, an individual on food stamps may have a household that \nis eligible to receive and may receive $25,000 a year in total welfare \nsupport. We have a host of programs for which people can qualify, so we \nneed to keep that in mind as we go forward. There is a patchwork quilt \nof Federal and State programs that help people in need. This is in \naddition to charitable and religious support that people can access.\n  The farm bill proposes to permanently elevate food stamps far above \nprerecession levels. In 2008 we spent less than $40 billion on food \nstamps. I repeat, in 2008--just a few years ago--less than $40 billion \na year. Food stamp spending over the next 10 years is estimated to \naverage almost $80 billion. This is double the prerecession amount.\n  This chart shows how we have grown from a little under $20 billion in \n2001 to over $70 billion in 2022. We can see a little decline there \nbetween 2013 and 2022. That chart is based on projections from the \nCongressional Budget Office and assume that the unemployment will begin \nto drop in the future--we hope this is correct. Even though \nunemployment is expected to fall below 8 percent, they are not showing \nthat we are going to have a major dropoff in food stamp spending in the \nfuture. Hopefully, unemployment will be falling. Hopefully, we will get \nthis economy on the right track.\n  I would suggest the point that is revealed in this chart is that \nunemployment is not what is driving the food stamp increases. The \nincreases far exceed the unemployment rate increases, and the decline \nfrom a projected reduction in unemployment is not very much either.\n  Were food stamp spending returned to prerecession levels those, say, \nin 2007, and then they were indexed for inflation, it would produce for \nthe U.S. Treasury a $340 billion savings. So I don't think in 2007 the \nnumbers that were spent are totally disproportionate to what we would \nneed today, and I believe if properly managed we could do better.\n  The amendments I have filed--and there are four--address some of the \nperverse incentives for States to increase food stamp registration \nrather than an incentive to increase the integrity of the program.\n  For example, one of the things we need to do is to deal with the \nFederal provision that provides bonuses to States that increase the \nnumber of people who are registered. States currently receive bonuses \nfor increasing enrollment and running the Food Stamp Program. They \ndon't get bonuses for efficiently managing the program to reduce fraud, \nthey don't get bonuses for finding people who are on the program \nillegitimately and selling their benefits in the marketplace or \notherwise abusing the program, they get bonuses for seeing how many \npeople they can sign up. That is not a sound policy.\n  The next amendment I have is Restoring the Asset Test for Food \nStamps. You would think it is pretty well accepted that if a person has \na certain amount of assets, they shouldn't have the government pay for \ntheir food. But through a system known as categorical eligibility, 43 \nStates have now provided benefits to individuals whose assets exceed \nthe statutory limit for them. Only 11 States did that in 2007.\n  Why? There are a couple of reasons. I guess one of them is they help \nget the incentive bonus for signing up more people. If they get around \nthe asset test and sign up more people, maybe they get a bonus.\n  What incentive does the State have to reduce the amount of dollars \nfrom Washington? They don't match a dime of it. What incentive do they \nhave to reduce the amount of money--free money in their minds--from \nWashington going to the State? Not much really.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if passed, this \namendment would save $11 billion, and all it would do is to say that \nSNAP beneficiaries would have to comply with the requirements of the \nprogram before they get the food stamps. It is called categorical \neligibility. If people qualify for any other welfare program, the \nStates have been given the power to say they qualify for food stamps \neven though they don't meet the formal qualifications for the food \nstamp program. Let me say that again--if they qualify for these others, \nunder categorical eligibility they are categorically entitled to food \nstamps. That is not a good policy. It does not appropriately target the \ncorrect population, and we should fix that.\n  Another issue is what has been referred to as the LIHEAP loophole. \nThis reform--and the amendment I have offered, and I hope we get a vote \non it--requires households that receive larger food stamp payments on \nthe basis of home energy expense actually provide proof of that \nexpense. This is a real problem. States have been part of this, \nfrankly. They have learned how to manipulate the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program money, and it creates an opportunity to have more \npeople qualify for higher food stamp benefits than they are entitled \nto. It is not good policy and this abuse should be dealt with. The CBO \nsays if that abuse were eliminated, it would save $9.5 billion over 10 \nyears in addition to the other savings in this bill.\n  Then another amendment, called the SAVE amendment, would simply \nrequire that the Federal Government use a program called SAVE--similar \nto the E-Verify program--to ensure that those adults receiving benefits \nare, in fact, lawfully in the country. If they are not lawfully here, \nthey should not be getting welfare support from the U.S. government. \nHow basic is that? They just should not.\n  One of the most important things we can do to restore integrity in \nour immigration system is to quit providing economic benefits for \npeople who violate the law. This is the first thing we need to do. It \nis an important thing to do. So I think that would be an amendment we \nshould include.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, Federal spending is set \nto increase 50 percent over the next 10 years. I repeat: Federal \nspending is projected to increase 50 percent over the next 10 years, \nand this creates a problem for us. Our per-person debt is worse than \nthat of Portugal, Greece, Spain, or Italy.\n  This is a chart that shows that. We didn't make up these numbers, and \nit is perfectly established that they are accurate.\n  This raises a good question. What is the per capita debt of the \nUnited States per person? In other words, what\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\ndoes the U.S. government owe? It is $49,800 per person--man, woman, and \nchild in America. In Spain it is $20,000, in Portugal it is $22,000, in \nFrance it is $35,000, in Greece it is $40,000, in Italy it is $40,000, \nand in Ireland it is $46,000.\n  This level of debt is not healthy for us. So the idea that we have an \nunlimited ability to throw money at every problem we have and that we \ndon't have to make sure every single dollar we appropriate helps the \npeople truly in need, and is wisely spent, is over. We have to end that \nconcept. This government, this Congress, this administration has been \nfar too blase about managing the people's money.\n  It is like we just want to leave the money out there and maybe it \nwill create a stimulus and somehow it will help the economy and we will \ngive more than we need to give and not worry about it. We don't want to \ninvestigate anybody who rightfully qualifies for these benefits. We \ndon't want to cut off anybody who truly deserves these benefits. That \nwould be unkind. However, it is not unkind to insist that people meet \nthe qualifications of the program. The people who don't meet the \nqualifications don't get the money. That is only common sense, and that \nis justice as Americans know it.\n  It is amazing that 40 cents of every dollar we spend in our country \ntoday is borrowed. The United States is headed for what has been called \nthe most predictable economic crisis in its history. The debt course we \nare on is unsustainable. We are headed to a debt crisis if we don't \nchange where we are going, as every witness before the Budget \nCommittee, of which I am ranking member, has told us. Yet many Senators \nin this body are not only unwilling to achieve more than $4 billion in \nsavings from the $800 billion program, but some even consider $4 \nbillion too much to reduce from the program.\n\n  The junior Senator from New York proposes to increase food stamp \nspending even more than the current growth we have seen, explaining \nthat ``food stamps are an extraordinary investment because for every \ndollar that you put into the SNAP program [the food stamp program] you \nget out $1.71.'' I won't repeat that because this is what the director \nof the program said, or the Secretary of Agriculture, I believe. He \nsaid that for every dollar spent on food stamps, you get out $1.71. \nUnder this reasoning, we ought to just increase the food stamp program \n10 times. Why not? Under this reasoning we are going to get even more \nmoney back. Somehow, it is going to create a stimulus and it is going \nto bring more money in for the Treasury and make the economy grow. Why \ndon't we just pay for clothes, shoes, and housing? Why not? It is \nprecisely this kind of thinking that has bled our Treasury of money \nthat we need to pay for the demands this country has.\n  I also think it is a moral issue. What is our policy objective? Is it \nour national goal to place as many people on welfare, food stamp \nsupport, as we can possibly put on that program? Is that our goal? Is \nthat a moral vision for the United States of America, just to see how \nmany people we can place in a situation where they are dependent on the \nFederal Government for their food? I just ask that. I think we should \nwrestle with that question.\n  Under the current proposal, no fewer than one in nine Americans will \nbe on food stamps at any point during the next 10 years. Which is the \nbetter goal--to permanently have one in nine Americans on food stamps \nor to have as many Americans as possible achieving financial \nindependence?\n  Left unattended, the safety net really can become a restraint, a \ntrap. Welfare reform is guided by the moral principle that welfare \nsupport can become damaging not only to the Treasury of the United \nStates but to the recipient. Over time, the trillions of dollars we \nspend on welfare programs--with the greatest of intentions, with the \ngreatest desire to do good--can replace the normal support role of \nprivate family, church, and community. It can become a barrier to self-\nsufficiency and an incentive not to be engaged in the tough, real world \nof work and competition. So I think it is not compassionate to increase \nwithout limit the size and reach of the Federal Government. The central \npremise of the American society is that the empowerment of the \nindividual is always preferable to the empowerment of the state.\n  The amendments we have spent a lot of time working on--each one of \nthem is crafted to improve the program. None of them represent major \ncuts in the amount of spending that is involved in the food stamp \nprogram. For each one of them the biggest savings would be about $10 \nbillion, but in each case it is $10 billion that would be saved, that \nwould make the program more efficient, that would improve the integrity \nof the program, and not reduce any of the benefits that will go to \nthose who would qualify for food stamps under existing law. It would \nnot reduce that.\n  I am concerned that the majority leader has filled the tree on this \nbill. Senator Reid has basically taken control of the amendment \nprocess. So we have a bill moving through the Senate that will spend \nabout $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and 80 percent of the \nspending in this bill will deal with food nutrition programs, with SNAP \nprograms--80 percent of it--and we have only had one amendment that \ndeals with that program--only one.\n  We have been here for days without voting on anything.\n  Senator Roberts is trying to get amendments from the Republican side \nto be voted on.\n  The majority leader says: Well, I don't think I will approve that \none. No, we don't want to vote on that. We have already voted on \nsomething like that. We are not going to vote on that. You have already \nhad a food stamp amendment. We are not going to have any more food \nstamp amendments.\n  That is the kind of talk that is going on here.\n  This is the U.S. Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the \nhistory of the world--something we are exceedingly proud of--where we \ncan have debate, vast, continuous, intense debate. It is part of the \nglory of this body. So now we have one person--the majority leader--\nusing a parliamentary technique called filling the tree and basically \nsaying I don't get a vote on any of those amendments I just mentioned.\n  I believe they are responsible amendments. I believe all four should \nbe adopted. I believe it would make the food stamp program better. It \nwould help ensure we have enough money to make sure the people who are \nin need get help. If we don't get off the debt course we are on, we are \ngoing to be in a crisis and all the programs are going to be cut--maybe \nmore than we really need to cut them--because we have to get on the \nright course.\n  So I am objecting to this. I am not happy about it. I don't think it \nis healthy. I do believe the majority leader has utilized this \ntechnique of filling the tree more than any majority leader in \nhistory--far more than any majority leader in history--and it is not a \nhealthy trend for the Senate.\n  We have always had a lot of amendments on the farm bill, and we need \nto have these amendments. So I hope and believe that--I hope we will \nget votes on these amendments. I hope that we will be able to debate \nthese amendments and that we will be able to help improve the food \nstamp program.\n  I want to mention one more thing. Senator Rand Paul offered an \namendment earlier that did not pass that would have block-granted the \nmoney to the States. I am not sure--different people can disagree on \nexactly how he would go about that and whether he did it the right way \nand whether the spending level he chose was appropriate, but let me say \nthis: A system in which the Federal Government gives an unlimited \namount of money to the States creates a perverse incentive for the \nStates to make sure they achieve every possible dollar from Washington. \nThis system creates no incentive for the States to enhance the \nintegrity of the program and to stop those who are abusing it, because \nwhen we spend State money to investigate and prosecute and stop abuse, \nwe have reduced the treasury of the State. When we reduce the amount of \nfood stamps pouring into the State, we reduce the amount of Federal \nmoney coming into a State--an additional adverse consequence \neconomically for that State.\n  So we need to create a situation in which the State is given a \ncertain amount of money--a fair formula--and then they have the \nresponsibility of making sure it goes to the right people. If poor \npeople aren't getting enough\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nmoney, they will then have an incentive to identify those who are \nimproperly getting the money, cut them off, and direct the money to \npeople in need. We don't have that incentive today. That is one reason \nthe food stamp program is not operating effectively.\n  So I think Senator Paul was correct fundamentally in his approach \nthat block-granting the food stamp program to the States would create \nthe right incentive to make the program more effective, to create more \nintegrity, and to make sure people most in need receive the benefits.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nAlabama for calling this body's attention once again to the debt crisis \nwe face as a country. I was with some people just a little while ago, \nand I was telling them a story about a conversation I had in Colorado \nabout our debt and our deficit and the moral obligation we have to our \nkids to actually deal with this problem and face up to the fact. My \nthen-10-year-old daughter was with me, Caroline.\n  We walked out on the front stoop of this place, and she said to me: \nDaddy.\n  I said: What.\n  She said: Just to be clear--she was making fun of me because I say \nthat sometimes--she said: Just to be clear, I am not paying that back.\n  That is the right attitude she ought to have and the right attitude \nchildren all across the country ought to have and the right attitude we \nought to have. I look forward, when we get into this discussion this \nsummer, to finding out how to find a bipartisan path through this \nmorass so that Caroline Bennet doesn't have to pay back a debt she \ndidn't accrue.\n  I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about the economy because \nI think one thing we can agree on in this body for sure is that the \nbest deficit reduction program we can find would be to get this economy \nmoving again. I wanted to talk about one sector in particular that has \ncreated tremendous economic growth in Colorado; that is, the wind \nenergy sector. I know my colleague from Colorado, Mark Udall, came down \nearlier today to discuss the same issue, and I so much appreciate his \ncontinued efforts in fighting for these jobs.\n  Just a piece of context here. We face very significant structural \nissues in this economy today. I have brought this chart down here \nbefore, but what it shows is that our gross domestic product--our \neconomic output--is actually higher today than it was when we went into \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression. Our productivity is off \nthe charts. That is the blue line, the second line. It has been going \nthat way since the early 1990s because of our response to competition \nfrom China and India and other places, because of our use of \ntechnology, and because of the recession itself, which drove \nproductivity straight up as firms all across the United States tried to \nfigure out how to get through this tough time with fewer people. But \nmedian household income continues to fall in this country, and we have \n23 or 24 million people who are unemployed or underemployed, even \nthough we are generating this economic output.\n  I think there are two fundamental answers to this. One is education. \nThe worst the unemployment rate ever got for people with a college \ndegree in the worst recession since the Great Depression was 4.5 \npercent. But the other is innovation. Jobs are going to be created \ntomorrow and next week and the week after that that have rising wages, \nnot lowering ones, not falling ones. And this economic recovery, like \nthe last economic recovery--those two together are the first recoveries \nwe have had as a nation in our history where economic growth decoupled \nfrom job growth and wage growth. I don't know about the Presiding \nOfficer, but that is what I hear about most in my townhall meetings at \nhome.\n  The wind production tax credit, it seems to me, cuts right to the \ncore of whether and how we want to compete in this global and changing \neconomy.\n  Let me show another picture here. This is it. This is a factory in \nBrighton, CO--bricks and mortar, made in America. It is a wind \nproduction facility. We are not talking about some fly-by-night \nexperimental industry here.\n  This credit has triggered tremendous economic growth in Colorado and \nall across the country--good-paying jobs, manufacturing jobs here in \nthe United States. As Representative Steve King, a Republican from \nIowa, said recently in an op-ed he published, the production tax credit \nhas driven as much as $20 billion in private investment. This is not \nsome Bolshevik scheme. That is $20 billion in private investment \nsupporting jobs here in the United States, manufacturing jobs here in \nthe United States.\n  Wind power accounts for more than one-third of all new U.S. electric \ngeneration in recent years. In Colorado alone, it has created 6,000 \njobs. It has moved our State toward a more diversified and cleaner \nenergy portfolio. But because they can't get any certainty out of \nWashington, like everybody else, developers and manufacturers are \nalready starting layoffs. They are laying off employees today in \nanticipation of the credit expiring at the end of the year.\n  Vestas, which has a huge manufacturing footprint in Colorado, from \nWindsor all the way south to Pueblo, is poised to lay off 1,600 workers \nif we fail to act. It is hard for me to understand, when our concerns \nabout the deficit and our concerns about economic growth are ones that \nwe hear about every day on the floor, why laying off 1,600 workers in \nColorado is a good idea. Iberdrola Renewables, also doing business in \nColorado, has already laid off 50 employees. Nationally, 37,000 jobs \nare at risk, not to mention the ones we could have created after 2012 \nbut won't if we let this credit expire.\n  I know sometimes I sound like a broken record, but the world is not \ngoing to wait for us. Our largest single export today is energy, \nactually--interestingly enough. That is a very recent occurrence that \nwe became a net exporter of energy. Before that, our single largest \nexport was aircraft. We build the best aircraft in the world. Mr. \nPresident, $30 billion a year is what that export is to the United \nStates.\n\n  China's export of solar panels last year was $15 billion--half our \nlargest single export. They did not export 1 solar panel 10 years ago, \nand we invented the technology in the United States. In fact, some of \nus claim we invented it right at home in Colorado.\n  I am sure China would love to have this business as well or we can \nget out of our own way and extend the PTC, extend the tax credit, save \nthose jobs, and grow our own clean energy economy.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I led a letter several months ago, \nwhere Republicans and Democrats from the Colorado delegation came \ntogether to urge a quick extension as part of the payroll deal. That \neffort, unfortunately, was not successful, nor were the others we have \ntried to take in the interim.\n  Shortly after our letter I filed an amendment--a bipartisan \namendment--with the Senator from Kansas, a fully paid-for 1-year \nextension of the credit. This place has become the land of flickering \nlights. We extend one thing for a month, we extend another thing for 2 \nmonths.\n  I am very proud of the work we are doing on FDA right now, which is a \n5-year reauthorization. But, my goodness, couldn't we extend this for a \nyear to give people some degree of certainty, particularly when it is \npaid for?\n  I thank Senator Moran, Republican from Kansas, for joining me--or for \nletting me join him--to lead that amendment.\n  Following that, several colleagues and I have partnered with Senator \nGrassley and others to write a bill that would extend the credit for 2 \nyears. There is clearly plenty of bipartisan support out there, and I \nknow the people in my State--whether Republicans or Democrats or \nIndependents or not even thinking about that--I know they want us to \nget this done.\n  Nearly 7,500 Coloradans have already signed a petition on my Web site \nsupporting the wind production tax credit. I urge others today who are \nwatching this to visit my Web site and please add their name.\n  I conclude by asking why, when the economic stakes are as high as \nthey are, the Congress cannot get its act together. We need to extend \nthe wind production tax credit, and we need to do it now.\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n                              EQIP and CSP\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on Coburn amendment No. 2353, and I \nwant to be the first to say how much I appreciate the efforts of my \ncolleague from Oklahoma at deficit reduction. In fact, we are currently \nworking together to promote a comprehensive approach to deficit \nreduction, and I deeply appreciate his leadership, which in many ways \nhas been unparalleled on this issue. However, I have to oppose this \nparticular amendment. I understand we are likely to consider the \namendment this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment \nby supporting the motion to table.\n  This amendment will repeal the popular Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, and the Conservation Stewardship Program, \nCSP. Both are critical programs authorized under the conservation title \nof the farm bill.\n  In Colorado, I have heard time and time again from our farmers and \nour ranchers how critical these programs are to holding on to their \nfamily farm.\n  EQIP, for example, is on the front lines of agricultural production. \nIt helps farmers ensure that their operations contribute to clean water \nand clean air in our rural communities. It proactively and successfully \naddresses new and emerging resource issues to avert the need for \nregulation--to put our farmers and ranchers in a place where they have \nless regulation, not more, because of the work they are doing on the \nground to conserve their lands.\n  Let me give you one example from Colorado. EQIP resources have been \nused to ensure that the sage grouse stays off the endangered species \nlist--a listing that would threaten ranchers all across the West. That \nis the result of the great work that has been done by farmers and \nranchers in Colorado with EQIP.\n  By providing resources to mark barbed wired fences--making them more \nvisible to the threatened bird--EQIP is working for farmers and \nranchers, and it is working well. It is the flagship of voluntary, \nincentive-based conservation programs, which is a direction I think we \nshould be heading, and a direction we head in this farm bill.\n  Both EQIP and CSP provide quantifiable benefits that are reflective \nof the varied conservation challenges all across our country. So I \nstrongly support this new conservation title as we reported it out of \nthe committee in a bipartisan vote.\n  As I have mentioned, and has been discussed on this bill, this bill \nis also remarkable for the cuts it makes: $23.6 billion. To my \nknowledge, there is not any other committee in the Senate or any \ncommittee in the House of Representatives that has actually reached \nbipartisan agreement and, in this case, bipartisan consensus on budget \ncuts, which is the way we should be doing business around here because \nit is what the American people and the people in Colorado expect from \nus, particularly on these difficult questions around our deficit and \nour debt. And $6.4 billion of those cuts--$6.4 billion of that $23 \nbillion--came from the conservation title, not all of which I liked, \nbut we made difficult compromises at the committee level, and we ought \nnot make further cuts on the floor, especially to programs that make \nsmart and effective investments in our rural communities.\n  So I will oppose, for those reasons, amendment No. 2353 and support \nthe motion to table, and I urge my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to do the same.\n  Finally, I wish to say thank you to the chairwoman of this committee \nand the ranking member, Debbie Stabenow and Pat Roberts, for their \nextraordinary bipartisan work in getting the bill this far. It is my \nfervent hope that leadership on both sides reaches an agreement on \nthese amendments so we can move forward and do the right thing for our \nfarmers and ranchers back home in Colorado.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, on \nthe floor. I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Presiding Officer and my friend from \nColorado.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the urgent need \nfor the Senate to adopt cybersecurity legislation.\n  I begin by recalling a recent story in the Washington Post that \ndetailed how a young man living an ocean away from us was able to use \nhis computer to hack into the cyber control system of a local water \nutility here in the United States. It took him just 10 minutes and \nrequired no special tools or no special training.\n  While the hacker could have taken over the water company's operations \nand caused real damage, instead he posted screen shots of his hack on \nthe Internet to show that he had been there and prove his point that \nour Nation's Internet security is woefully lax. And it took very little \nin the way of resources or skill to penetrate it.\n  This kind of story is but one piece of what I would call an avalanche \nof evidence showing that there is an urgent need to pass comprehensive \ncybersecurity legislation that will safeguard our critical cyber \ninfrastructure.\n  The fact is, as this 22-year-old's activities showed, and as \nauthorities in the area, such as ADM Mike McConnell, the former \nDirector of National Intelligence, have said, the cyber infrastructure \nwhich is owned by private entities is simply not adequately defended. \nAnd when it is not adequately defended--and here I am talking about \nvital national systems: The electric power grid, water companies, \ntransportation systems, pipelines, et cetera, et cetera--when the cyber \nsystems that control them now are not adequately protected, it means \nour Nation is not adequately protected because a cyber-attack can \nincapacitate vital national entities that we all depend on every day \nand, in fact, cause enormous harm and loss of life, as much as a \nconventional attack by air in earlier confrontations and conflicts.\n  Yesterday the majority leader came to the floor of the Senate and \nspoke, I thought, eloquently about the urgency of the Senate adopting \ncybersecurity legislation. I wanted to come to the floor today to thank \nSenator Reid for that statement and to say, as chairman of the Senate \nHomeland Security Committee, how strongly I agree with him. Of course, \nwe are not alone.\n  A few days ago six of our Nation's most experienced national security \nleaders, spanning the last two-plus administrations, transcending any \nlines of partisanship, wrote a letter to Senator Reid urging him to \nbring up cybersecurity legislation ``as soon as possible.'' That is a \nquote: ``as soon as possible.''\n  In that letter to both--not just to Senator Reid, but to Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, as well--former Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary Mike Chertoff from the Bush administration; \nformer Director of National Intelligence, ADM Mike McConnell, whom I \nreferred to, from the Bush administration; former Deputy Defense \nSecretary Paul Wolfowitz, also from the previous administration; former \nNSA and CIA Director Mike Hayden, also from the previous \nadministration; former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN \nJames Cartwright, and former Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Lynn sent \nthis letter--incidentally, to say what is already a matter of public \nrecord. In doing so, they express opinions that are quite similar to \nwhat we have heard from all the leaders of the current administration \nwhen it comes to security--Secretary of Defense Panetta, Director of \nNational Intelligence Clapper, Director of the CIA Petraeus, and so on, \nand, of course, Secretary Napolitano at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I want to read from this letter from these national security leaders \nbecause it sums up where we are. I quote now:\n\n       Given the time left in this legislative session and the \n     upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the window \n     of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view \n     critically necessary to protect our national and economic \n     security is quickly disappearing.\n\n  In the letter they went on to say--and I quote again\n\n       We--\n\n  The signers of the letter--\n\n     carry the burden of knowing--\n\n  Along with a lot of the rest of us--\n\n     that 9/11 might have been averted with the intelligence that \n     existed at the time. We do\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of whether this will happen; it is \n     a question of when.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2012.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to urge you to \n     bring cyber security legislation to the floor as soon as \n     possible. Given the time left in this legislative session and \n     the upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the \n     window of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view \n     critically necessary to protect our national and economic \n     security is quickly disappearing.\n       We have spoken a number of times in recent months on the \n     cyber threat--that it is imminent, and that it represents one \n     of the most serious challenges to our national security since \n     the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago. It appears that \n     this message has been received by many in Congress--and yet \n     we still await conclusive legislative action.\n       We support the areas that have been addressed so far, most \n     recently in the House: the importance of strengthening the \n     security of the federal government's computer networks, \n     investing in cyber research and development, and fostering \n     information sharing about cyber threats and vulnerabilities \n     across government agencies and with the private sector. We \n     urge the Senate to now keep the ball moving forward in these \n     areas by bringing legislation to the floor as soon as \n     possible.\n       In addition, we also feel that protection of our critical \n     infrastructure is essential in order to effectively protect \n     our nation, and economic security from the growing cyber \n     threat. Infrastructure that controls our electricity, water \n     and sewer, nuclear plants, communications backbone, energy \n     pipelines and financial networks must be required to meet \n     appropriate cyber security standards. Where market forces and \n     existing regulations have failed to drive appropriate \n     security, we believe that our government must do what it can \n     to ensure the protection of our critical infrastructure. \n     Performance standards in some cases will be necessary--these \n     standards should be technology neutral, and risk and outcome \n     based. We do not believe that this requires the imposition of \n     detailed security regimes in every instance, but some \n     standards must be minimally required or promoted through the \n     offer of positive incentives such as liability protection and \n     availability of clearances.\n       Various drafts of legislation have attempted to address \n     this important area--the Lieberman/Collins bill having \n     received the most traction until recently. We will not \n     advocate one approach over another--however, we do feel \n     strongly that critical infrastructure protection needs to be \n     addressed in any cyber security legislation. The risk is \n     simply too great considering the reality of our \n     interconnected and interdependent world, and the impact that \n     can result from the failure of even one part of the network \n     across a wide range of physical, economic and social systems.\n       Finally, we have commented previously about the important \n     role that the National Security Agency (NSA) can and does \n     play in the protection of our country against cyber threats. \n     A piece of malware sent from Asia to the United States could \n     take as little as 30 milliseconds to traverse such distance. \n     Preventing and defending against such attacks requires the \n     ability to respond to them in real-time. NSA is the only \n     agency dedicated to breaking the codes and understanding the \n     capabilities and intentions of potential enemies, even before \n     they hit ``send.'' Any legislation passed by Congress should \n     allow the public and private sectors to harness the \n     capabilities of the NSA to protect our critical \n     infrastructure from malicious actors.\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when `cyber 9/11' \n     hits--it is not a question of `whether' this will happen; it \n     is a question of `when.'\n       Therefore we urge you to bring cyber security legislation \n     to the floor as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Hon. J. Mike McConnell,\n     Hon. Paul Wolfowitz,\n     Gen. Michael Hayden,\n     Gen. James Cartwright (RET),\n     Hon. William Lynn III.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The majority leader came to the floor yesterday, as I \nhave said, echoing these sentiments in his floor speech, when he said:\n\n       When virtually every intelligence expert says we need to \n     secure the systems that make the lights come on, inaction is \n     not an option.\n\n  I could not agree more with Senator Reid.\n  The fact is, the House of Representatives, the so-called other body \nof Congress, has passed a cybersecurity bill--a package that I think \ntakes some significant initial good steps. I thank the House for that. \nBut I believe the bipartisan Senate Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 2105, \nwhich is sponsored by Senators Collins, Feinstein, Rockefeller, and me, \ntakes the additional necessary steps to secure our cyber systems and, \ntherefore, is preferable.\n  It is preferable, in large part, because it addresses the need to \nsecure our Nation's critical cyber infrastructure; that is, the \ncomputers that control the systems that, if commandeered, attacked or \nintruded upon, could allow an attacker to open and close key valves and \nswitches in pipelines for gas and oil and refineries and factories and \nwater and sewer systems and electric plants and banks and along \ntransportation nodes without detection by their operators.\n  We need to pass this bill or something very much like it so we can go \nto conference with the House and iron out whatever differences we have \nthis year so we can get legislation to the President's desk. He has \nendorsed, I am grateful to say, S. 2105--certainly endorsed the \nprinciples that are in it.\n  We have to do that so we raise our defenses before we are victims of \na cyber 9/11. The time remaining to do so in this session is obviously \ngrowing shorter. We know the lameduck session will be almost \nexclusively taken up with difficult questions about the budget, debt, \nsequester, the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts and much more. \nSo we have to act.\n  I am encouraged by Senator Reid's statement yesterday and my own \nbelief after conversations with him that the leader is intent on \nbringing this legislation to the floor in July. The truth is, if we do \nnot take it up in July and see whether we have the votes--and I am \nconfident we will when it comes to the floor--we are not going to be \nable to pass this legislation that is timely and allows us to go to \nconference, reach an agreement, and send the bill to the President of \nthe United States for his signature.\n  When talking about cybersecurity, the biggest threats we all know \ncome from other nations, nation states, also nonstate actors such as \nterrorists and organized crime syndicates. But this young man I \nreferred to at the beginning of my statement and his ability to quite \neasily penetrate the cyber control system of a local water company in \nthe United States shows us that an attack can come from just about \nanyone and from just about anywhere.\n  According to the Washington Post story, ``This individual who goes by \nthe name prOf is a bright unemployed 22 year old who favors hoodie \nsweatshirts and lives in his parent's home somewhere overseas.''\n  But this good guy, white-hat hacker, knows the risks our Nation is \nfacing. He told the Post:\n\n       Eventually, somebody will get access to a major system and \n     people will be hurt. It is just a matter of time.\n\n  That is the truth. Six of our Nation's premier equity security \nexperts are in agreement with this 22-year-old hacker as they said in \ntheir letter: It is just a matter of time. We have to act before that \ntime comes. To my colleagues who have concerns about the Cyber Security \nAct of 2011, the Collins-Feinstein-Rockefeller-Lieberman legislation, I \nsay: Come on and work with us. We can and must resolve our differences. \nIn fact, around some of the major areas of discussion, controversy, the \nsection of our bill that has performance requirements for private \nsector entities that own the most critical infrastructure which, if \nattacked, could cause mass deaths, casualties, catastrophic economic \nloss, and a denigration of our national security, those are--and then \nthe other section being the information-sharing section, where some \npeople have civil liberties or privacy concerns, there is a good-faith \neffort going on to resolve those differences because, I think \nincreasingly, Members of the Senate on both sides, just reacting to the \nfacts, are worried this is a real and present danger to our security.\n  Perhaps the most real and present immediate danger of a massive \nattack on our homeland that exists today is by cyber attack. I do not \nthink any of us wants to look back and say: Why did we not act before \nwe were attacked? Therefore, I am encouraged by these deliberations. \nBut I say to anybody else who has concerns about our bill, Members of \nthe Senate, please be in touch with Senators Collins, Feinstein, \nRockefeller or myself.\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n  If we cannot resolve our differences, then draft amendments and let's \ndebate them on the floor and have up-or-down votes and let the Senate \nwork its will. As Senator Reid said in his remarks yesterday:\n\n       Everybody knows this Congress cannot pass laws that do not \n     have broad bipartisan support. So we are going to need to \n     work together on a bill that addresses the concerns of \n     lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  That time is coming soon, I am confident to say, based on my \nconversations with the majority leader. That time is coming soon on the \nfloor of the Senate, but we have to start now to make sure we are ready \nwhen the bill comes to the Senate floor. I guarantee that one day in \nthe near future, if we do not pass comprehensive cybersecurity \nlegislation, and there is a serious and significant cyberspace attack \non us, we will rush to pass it and that will be too late and we will \nnot do it in a thoughtful way.\n  Time grows short while the threat keeps swelling. What if the next \n22-year-old who decides to take over a water plant or an oil or gas \npipeline or an electric powerplant decides to make a more convincing \ndemonstration than just posting screen pictures online? If a 22-year-\nold can do this, think what an enemy nation with a significant amount \nof money and personnel and training behind it could do to us if we are \nnot adequately defended?\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, because this is \nnot a partisan issue at all, this is a national security-homeland \nsecurity issue: Let's get to work. Let's get ready for the floor debate \non cybersecurity that I am confident is coming soon. Then let's pass \nthis urgently needed legislation for the sake of both our national and \neconomic security.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Strengthening Agricultural Production\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to take a few minutes to \noutline the amendments I plan to offer on the farm bill. In beginning, \nI particularly want to commend the chair of the committee, Senator \nStabenow, and Senator Roberts. I think we all understand that if you \nwant to tackle a big issue, an important issue, you have to find a way \nto come to something resembling common ground.\n  This bill is especially important. This is a jobs bill at a time when \nour country needs good-paying jobs. It is an extraordinarily important \nhealth bill, particularly one with great implications for how America \ntackles the issue of obesity. It is an environmental bill because it \nhas great implications for conservation. And, of course, it has \nextraordinary impact on rural communities--rural communities that are \nhurting right now.\n  The amendments I am going to be offering on the farm bill address \nthose major concerns, and those concerns are particularly important to \nmy State. My State does a lot of things well, but what we do best is we \ngrow things. We grow things, add value to them, and ship them \nsomewhere. We grow lots and lots of things--hundreds of crops, \nwonderful fruit and vegetables. We want to have a chance to grow this \npart of our economy. It is a $5 billion economy for the State of \nOregon, and one we want to strengthen in the days ahead.\n  The first amendment I will be offering on the farm bill addresses the \nFarm to School Program. Schools all across the country purchase \nproduce--pears, cherries, tomatoes, and lettuce--from Department of \nAgriculture warehouses. In some cases, the warehouses may be hundreds \nand hundreds of miles away. There are schools, however, that wish to \nsource their fruits and vegetables locally. There are producers who \nwish to sell their goods to local schools.\n  You don't have to be a fancy economist, but that sounds like a market \nto me. The Congress ought to enable this market, not make it more \ndifficult for this market to function. I spent a lot of time in rural \nOregon over the last few months. As I have previously indicated, Harry \n& David, a producer in my home State--and a lot of Senators have gotten \ntheir wonderful products over the years as holiday gifts--wants to sell \ntheir wonderful pears to the school down the street. In attempting to \ndo so, Harry & David has been met with a real maze, a welter of odd \nFederal rules, that has prevented them from doing so.\n  It should not be bureaucratic water torture for a local producer to \nsell to a nearby school. It is getting at that kind of bureaucracy and \nredtape that my Farm to School amendment seeks to address. As of now, \nFederal agriculture policy seems to be dishing out a diet of paperwork, \nprocess, and limited options, when we ought to be promoting innovation \nand getting away from this sort of one-size-fits-all approach.\n  My Farm to School amendment would allow for at least five Farm to \nSchool projects across the country, where States like mine that are \ninnovative, have established and proven Farm to School programs in \nplace, would be able to source healthy, quality produce rather than buy \nit from one of these faraway Federal warehouses.\n  Under this kind of approach, with this crucial program, the schools \nare going to win, our farmers are going to win, and our kids will be \nable to enjoy delicious local produce every day with this particular \namendment.\n  The second amendment I plan to offer also encourages healthier \neating. This one deals with the SNAP program--the program formerly \nknown as Food Stamps. As the occupant of the chair knows, this program \nrepresents a substantial amount of the funding for the farm bill--over \n$70 billion. There are 700,000 SNAP recipients in my home State of \nOregon. For too many Oregonians, this program is the only thing that \nstands between them and hunger.\n  I have said it on this floor before, and I want to say it again: I am \nnot in favor of cutting these benefits; quite the contrary. I think \nSenator Gillibrand has an excellent amendment to ensure that that \ndoesn't take place. I hope she will win support in the Senate for it. \nWe should not have, in a country as rich and strong as ours, this many \nAmericans going to bed at night hungry and trying to dig themselves out \nof the great recession at the same time. So I am not in favor of \ncutting SNAP benefits, but I am in favor of incentivizing this program \nto make it possible for those of modest incomes to get healthier, more \nnutritious foods, especially in light of the growing obesity epidemic \nour country faces.\n  What troubles me is that, in one sense, the Food Stamp Program, the \nSNAP program, is something of a conveyor belt for calories. It \nessentially says all of the various food products are equal. At a time \nwhen we see such extraordinary rates of obesity, particularly for low-\nincome children and low-income women, I only hope we can look at ways \nto create incentives for healthier eating.\n  I am not in favor of setting up some kind of Federal policy that \nstarts dictating from Washington, DC, what folks who are using the SNAP \nprogram can eat. I am not interested in some kind of national nanny \nprogram, or something that says you can't eat this or that. What I am \nproposing is that here in the Senate, we look at ways, particularly \nwhen you are talking about $70 billion of Federal nutrition spending, \nto at least promote healthier eating wherever possible, and the \nincreased consumption of healthy fruits and vegetables.\n  Studies by the Centers for Disease Control show that low-income women \nand children--those most likely to receive SNAP benefits--are more \nlikely to be obese than higher income women and children. What I am \nproposing with this amendment is giving the States some flexibility to \ntry out ways to make SNAP benefits a launch pad for better nutrition, \nrather than, as I characterized it earlier, a conveyor belt for \ncalories.\n  What I wish--and I know the Chair hails from a State with a \nsubstantial amount of agriculture--is to see farmers, retailers, health \nspecialists, and\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nthose who rely on the SNAP program, to get together and find a \nconsensus--some common ground--on a way to wring more nutritional value \nout of those SNAP benefits.\n  In Oregon, we have tried this idea out. Those in the retail \ncommunity, farmers and anti-hunger groups got together, and this group \nthinks they can do more to improve nutritional outcomes under this very \nlarge program.\n  The amendment makes clear that you could not get a waiver to reduce \neligibility, or reduce the amount of benefits that someone on the SNAP \nprogram receives. But you could, for example, try various approaches to \npromote nutritional eating. A State could encourage SNAP recipients to \npurchase more fruits and vegetables by partnering with grocery stores \nor other food sellers to provide coupons to enable SNAP recipients to \npurchase extra or discounted fruits and vegetables. There are now \nprograms that allow SNAP benefits to be exchanged at farmers markets \nfor coupons that produce $2 worth of produce for $1 of SNAP benefits. \nThe cost of the extra produce is paid for using non-federal funds. A \nState waiver could enable this type of program, for example, to be \nexpanded beyond farmers markets.\n  There is a host of innovative proposals, in my view, that could \nimprove public health and increase the consumption of healthy food. I \nhope as we go forward toward the conclusion of this legislation in the \nSenate, we can look at ways to accept the proposition that not all of \nthe wisdom resides in Washington, DC, particularly when we are seeing \nthese skyrocketing rates of obesity, tragically with special \nimplications for low-income women and children. I think there are \nbetter ways to proceed. This amendment empowers States to have that \nopportunity.\n  The third amendment I am going to offer, I have not spoken about on \nthe floor to date, and I wish to take just a minute to describe what \nthis amendment deals with. It is an amendment I plan to offer that \naddresses the issue of industrial hemp farming. It is cosponsored by \nSenator Rand Paul and is identical to legislation in the House, which \nhas 33 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  This is, in my view, a textbook example of a regulation that flunks \nthe commonsense test. There is government regulation on the books that \nprevents America's farmers from growing industrial hemp. What is worse, \nthis regulation is hurting job creation in rural America and increasing \nour trade deficit. When my colleagues get more information about this \noutlandish, outrageous restriction on free enterprise, I think most of \nthem are going to agree the restriction on industrial hemp is the \nposter child for dumb regulations. The only thing standing in the way \nof taking advantage of this profitable crop is a lingering \nmisunderstanding about its use. The amendment I have filed on this \nissue will end a ridiculous regulation once and for all.\n  Right now, the United States is importing over ten-million of dollars \nof hemp products to use in paper products, construction materials, \ntextiles, and a variety of other goods. We are importing a crop that \nU.S. farmers could be profitably growing right here at home if not for \ngovernment rules prohibiting it.\n  Our neighbors to the north can see the potential for this product. In \n2010, the Canadian Government injected over $700,000 into their \nblossoming hemp industry to increase the size of their hemp crop and \nfortify the inroads they're making in U.S. markets, at the expense of \nour farmers. It was a very good bet. U.S. imports of hemp products have \nconsistently grown over the past decade, increasing by 300 percent in \n10 years. From 2009 to 2010, they grew 35 percent. The number of acres \nin Canada devoted to growing industrial hemp nearly doubled from 2011 \nto 2012.\n  I know there are going to be Members of Congress, and others who are \nlistening to this, who are going to say all this talk about hemp is \nbasically talk about marijuana. The fact is, while they come from the \nsame species of plant, there are major differences between them. They \nhave different harvest times, they're different heights, and the \ncultivation techniques are markedly different. And when we recognize \nthose differences, we'll be able to focus on the benefits from \nproducing domestically the hemp we already use.\n  Under this amendment, the production of hemp would still be \nregulated, but it would be done by the States through permitting \nprograms, not the Federal Government. Nine States have already put \nlegislation in place to provide for a permitting system that enforces \nthe prohibition on marijuana and ensures that industrial hemp maintains \na very low THC level--under 0.3 percent. The lowest-grade marijuana \ntypically has 5 percent THC content. The bottom line is no one is going \nto get high on industrial hemp.\n  Hemp has been a profitable commodity in a number of countries. In \naddition to Canada, Australia also permits hemp production, and the \ngrowth in that sector helped their agricultural base survive when the \ntobacco industry dried up. Over 30 countries in Europe, Asia and North \nand South America currently permit farmers to grow hemp, and China is \nthe world's largest producer. In fact, our country is the only \nindustrialized nation that prohibits farmers from growing hemp.\n  Oregon is home to some of the major manufacturers of hemp products, \nincluding Living Harvest, one of the largest hemp food producers in our \ncountry. Business has been so brisk there that the Portland Business \nJournal recently rated them as one of the fastest growing local \ncompanies.\n  There are similar success stories in other States. One company in \nNorth Carolina has been incorporating hemp into building materials, \nreportedly making them both stronger and more environmentally friendly. \nAnother company in California produces hemp-based fiberboard.\n  No country is better than ours at developing, perfecting, and \nexpanding markets for our products. As the market grows, it ought to be \ndomestically produced hemp that supplies that growth.\n  I would like to close on this topic with a couple statements by one \nof the leading newspapers in my State, The Bulletin. I think it would \nbe fair to say The Bulletin would not cite itself as one of the first \nplaces one ought to look for left-wing thinking, and here is what they \nhad to say with respect to my amendment, which they encouraged support \nfor:\n\n     . . . producers of hemp products in the United States are \n     forced to import it. That denies American farmers the \n     opportunity to compete in the market. It's like surrendering \n     the competitive edge to China and Canada, where it can be \n     grown legally.\n\n  The editorial then goes on to say:\n\n       Legalizing industrial hemp does not have to be a slippery \n     slope towards legalizing marijuana. It can be a step toward \n     removing regulatory burdens limiting Oregon farmers from \n     competing in the world market.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \neditorial from The Bulletin.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Bulletin Staff, June 9, 2012]\n\n                  U.S. Should Legalize Industrial Hemp\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has introduced a change to the \n     farm bill to remove the federal prohibition on growing \n     industrial hemp. Wyden's change would put an end to an \n     unnecessary ban.\n       The Oregon Legislature authorized the growing of industrial \n     hemp in 2009, but federal law still blocks hemp as an illegal \n     crop.\n       Why? Federal policy does not distinguish between the \n     varieties of cannabis. Some are good for oilseed and fiber. \n     Some are better for smoking to get high.\n       Yes, both do contain the hallucinogenic compound delta 9 \n     tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Industrial hemp is low in it \n     Marijuana is high in it.\n       That doesn't mean the country should ban growing all of it.\n       Industrial hemp is versatile and can grow like crazy. It \n     can be used for paper, clothes, rope. The seed oil can be \n     used for a variety of things: food, paint, pharmaceuticals \n     and more.\n       It's already used in Oregon and across the country. But \n     producers of hemp products in the United States are forced to \n     import it. That denies American farmers the opportunity to \n     compete in the market. It's like surrendering the competitive \n     edge to China and Canada, where it can be grown legally.\n       There are concerns about what legalizing hemp would mean. \n     Would it be another headache for law enforcement?\n       One way to solve that, if it's a problem, is to require \n     industrial hemp fields to be licensed and require random \n     testing to ensure the crop is low in THC. Oregon's law said \n     the state could seize crops that had a THC level higher than \n     0.3 percent.\n       Legalizing industrial hemp does not have to be a slippery \n     slope toward legalizing marijuana. It can be a start toward \n     removing regulatory burdens limiting Oregon farmers from \n     competing in the world market.\n\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, if this farm bill is about empowering \nfarmers and increasing rural jobs, let's give them the tools they need \nto get the job done. Let's boost revenue for farmers and reduce the \noverhead costs for the businesses around the country that use this \nproduct. And let's put more people to work growing and processing an \nenvironmentally friendly crop with a ready market in the United States.\n  For all the reasons I have described, I will be urging my colleagues \nto support this amendment so the law can be changed and farmers are not \nprevented from growing a profitable crop in the future.\n  Even though my amendment is about growing a crop and should be \nclearly relevant to the farm bill, it may be blocked from getting a \nvote because of the Senate rules on what amendments are allowed to be \noffered once cloture is invoked on the bill. If I get the opportunity, \nI am going to bring this amendment up through the regular order. But if \ncloture is invoked and my amendment is not allowed, I want colleagues \nto know I will be back at this again until there are smarter \nregulations in place for industrial hemp.\n  In closing, let me say I don't think we can overstate the importance \nof the best possible farm bill. Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts \nhave, in my view, done yeomen's work in trying to build a bipartisan \napproach. The question now is can we use the amendment process to \nimprove on the kind of bipartisan effort they brought to the floor.\n  Each of the areas I have described this afternoon--improving the Farm \nto School program, wringing more value and better nutritional outcomes \nfrom the SNAP program, and helping a promising hemp industry--give us a \nchance to attain the objectives of what I have described as the best \npossible farm bill, and we can do this all without spending one single \ndime of additional taxpayer money--not a dime of additional taxpayer \nmoney. It is my hope we can take the good work that has already been \ndone by Senators Stabenow and Roberts and build on that. I hope the \nSenate will support the three amendments I have described this \nafternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, let me thank all of our \ncolleagues who are working with us as we move forward in putting \ntogether a package of amendments to be voted on here in the Senate. I \nwant to thank everyone--of course my ranking member, Senator Roberts, \nbut also people on both sides who are working together in good faith as \nwe move through this process.\n  This morning, we did have two votes, and in the next little while we \nwill have two more. And I do want to speak to one of those but also to \njust indicate again to all of our colleagues how important it is to \nfarmers and ranchers, families, and rural communities across America \nthat we come together and pass this farm bill.\n  Sixteen million people have jobs related to agriculture. I am not \nsure there is any one single piece of legislation we have had in front \nof us that actually impacted 16 million people like this one. Of \ncourse, we are very proud of the way we have come together in a \nbipartisan way to propose something that actually cuts the deficit by \nover $23 billion and creates real reforms that taxpayers and farmers \nhave asked for, while strengthening our risk-management tools for \nagriculture, conservation, other jobs efforts, certainly rural \ndevelopment, alternative energy, and certainly our support for families \nwith their own personal disaster when it comes to putting food on the \ntable during an economic downturn for them.\n  I want to specifically take a moment, though, to speak and urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes on a motion to table Coburn amendment No. 2353, \nwhich would repeal two of the most successful conservation programs in \nthe history of our country, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, which we all call EQIP, and the Conservation Stewardship \nProgram.\n  EQIP is on the front lines of production agriculture, helping farmers \ncomply with regulatory pressures, and it has been very effective. It is \nthe cornerstone of our country's commitment to voluntary, incentive-\nbased conservation--voluntary--working with farmers, working with \nranchers in a voluntary way, to partner with them to be able to provide \nways to tackle environmental issues we all care about.\n  I would underscore the fact that what we call the farm bill is \nactually the largest investment we as a country make in conservation of \nland, air, and water on working lands--lands that are owned by the \nprivate sector, partnering, because we all have a stake in runoff and \nclean water issues and erosion issues and all of the other things that \nrelate to protecting our wildlife and our wetlands for not only \nhabitats but also for our hunters and fishermen and all of the other \nissues around which we celebrate what we have been able to do around \nconservation in this country.\n  EQIP really is a cornerstone of our commitment to a voluntary \nincentive-based conservation program. It provides a cost share to \nfarmers to implement practices that have been absolutely proven to work \nto benefit our country's soil, air, and water resources.\n  This last year the Environmental Quality Incentive Program entered \ninto 38,000 contracts with farmers and ranchers all across America, \ncovering 13 million acres of land. EQIP has a number of incredible \nstories across the country--in Louisiana, helping farmers recover from \nHurricane Katrina; in Oklahoma, helping producers implement best \nmanagement practices to reduce sediment in the Mission Creek, improving \nwater quality, helping restore fish populations. In Michigan, they have \nhelped farmers struggling with bovine TB protect their herds and \nlivelihoods.\n  So this is one of two critical conservation programs that would be \nrepealed by this amendment. The other one is the Conservation \nStewardship Program. This encourages higher levels of conservation \nacross agricultural operations as well as the adoption of new and \nemerging conservation practices. CSP encourages producers to address \nresource concerns by undertaking additional conservation activities and \nimproving and maintaining their current activities. And they focus on \nseven resource concerns as well as energy--soil quality, soil erosion, \nwater quality, water quantity, air quality, plant resources, and animal \nresources--all things important not only for our farmers and ranchers \nbut to all of us--every community, every State, all of us in the \ncountry.\n  This program is extremely popular. It has been very successful. This \nyear producers enrolled 12 million acres in the program, and this \nbrings the total to 49 million acres across the country that now have \nconservation practices as a result of the CSP. It provides conservation \nbankers with more acres than any other conservation program in the \ncountry. I strongly urge we table this amendment. I ask for a ``yes'' \nvote in tabling the amendment.\n\n  I would like to talk a little bit more about what we have done in a \npositive way in the conservation title. One of the areas of this bill I \nam most proud of is the work that has been done with conservation and \nenvironmental groups all across the country--in fact, we have 643 \nconservation and environmental groups that have said this is the right \napproach.\n  In tough economic times, when we know we do not have additional \ndollars, we took a look at every single page, every single program. \nThere are 23 different programs in conservation. Every time somebody \nhad a good idea, a program got added rather than looking at \nduplication, redundancy, how we can streamline and make it better for \nfarmers, communities, better for ranchers, make it simpler and more \nunderstandable. So we decided to go back and do what every taxpayer and \nevery citizen has asked us to do; that is, streamline, make more \naccountability, cut the paperwork, make things work better.\n  We do support flexibility. We support locally led ground-up voluntary \nefforts.\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nWe increase transparency and accountability, we streamline, consolidate \nprograms, help farmers comply with regulatory pressures, and we \nbasically have come together. We have taken 23 different programs down \nto 13 and put them in three different areas and created a lot of \nflexibility. We want to stretch the dollars even further in four areas: \nworking lands, easements, conservation reserve programs, and regional \npartnerships, which are so important to so many of us.\n  All across the country family farms are passed down to children, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Our rapidly growing population \ndemands our farmers and ranchers double their production over the next \nfew decades and use fewer acres to do it, so innovation in farming is \nabsolutely critical. But no amount of technology can make up for \ndegraded soil or polluted water.\n  The farm bill's conservation programs help our producers meet their \nchallenges and the country's challenges, ensuring that we have a safe, \nabundant food supply, clean water, and thriving wildlife populations \nfor many generations to come.\n  It is wonderful to see the partnerships that are going on all across \nMichigan, all across the country. Many farmers take advantage of these \nvoluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. In our Great Lakes \nregion alone--I would say not only Michigan but our Presiding Officer \nfrom Minnesota certainly cares as well. We championed together so many \ntimes on the Great Lakes initiative. But in the Great Lakes region \nalone farmers use one form of conservation on 95 percent of the acres. \nOn 95 percent of the acres we have conservation going on.\n  As we look at streamlining from 23 to 13 programs, making them more \nflexible and so on, we actually have been able to achieve savings of $6 \nbillion while maintaining conservation functions, and I would argue \nstrengthening their effectiveness as well while cutting the dollars. \nNationally, there are 357 million acres of cropland, 406 million acres \nof forest land, 119 million acres of pasture land, and 409 million \nacres of rangeland under private ownership in the United States. That \nis a lot of land, and all of that is impacted by what we do in the \nconservation title of the farm bill.\n  We also know the challenges my farmers face in Michigan are different \nthan those in Kansas or Oklahoma or Minnesota or Montana. We have built \nin enough flexibility in this new title, modernizing it, reforming it, \ncreating flexibility to be able to meet very different needs across the \ncountry. I will briefly go through each area. We are focusing, as I \nsaid, on four different areas.\n  Working lands, where we have two programs that are proposed to be \neliminated right now, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nwhich I spoke about, and CSP is in the working lands title. We also \ninclude the conservation innovation grants, which are geared to \nprojects that offer new approaches to providing producers environmental \nand production benefits. Again, we look for ways to support efforts \nthat have not been receiving ongoing funding through the past bill to \nbe able to continue and have greater flexibility in a number of \ndifferent programs.\n  One is critical, I believe, for America's sportsmen and sportswomen; \nthat is, access to good recreational land. I know that is very \nimportant to my State of Michigan, very important to my family.\n  The Voluntary Public Access and Wildlife Incentives Program \nencourages farmers to open their land for recreational uses--hunting, \nfishing, bird-watching. Right now, 26 States are taking advantage of \nthe program, and we continue that in the bill, which is very important.\n  Our second area is on easements. There are three existing \nconservation easement programs. We are putting them into one to protect \nour lands from development and keep them devoted to agricultural use as \nwell as to keep the land for grazing. Wetland easements restore, \nprotect, and enhance wetlands which are important to water quality, \nquantity, and wildlife habitat in many areas also.\n  We are focusing on long-term land protection. Over the last 20 years \nthe Wetlands Reserve Program helped more than 11,000 private landowners \nvoluntarily restore, protect, and enhance wetlands and wildlife \nhabitat. So we are very pleased all of this is in the bill as well.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program has been very successful. From 2006 \nto 2010 the USDA estimates the Conservation Reserve Program was \nresponsible for reducing 1.09 billion tons of sediment, 3.1 billion \nmetric tons of nitrogen, and 613 million pounds of phosphorus from \ngoing into our waters--that is an accomplishment--from going into our \nGreat Lakes, into our oceans, into our rivers, into our streams. These \nare the main contributors to many of the water quality issues we face \nas a country.\n  During the same time period, USDA estimates the Conservation Reserve \nProgram contributed 284 million metric tons of greenhouse gas \nreduction. It is reducing CO2. I would say it is equivalent \nto taking 55 million cars off the road for a year. Coming from the car \nState, I appreciate CRP doing that. We want to be able to continue to \ndrive our automobiles, and we are proud of what we are doing around \nautomobiles, but can you imagine that this program alone has taken \nenough CO2 out of the atmosphere to equate to 55 million \ncars being taken off the roads?\n  As of 2011, CRP was enrolling just under the acreage cap of 32 \nmillion. Over the next couple of years, over 15 million acres are set \nto expire. We recognize not all of those will be reenrolled, but we \nwant to make sure there is adequate room to reenroll the most sensitive \nacres.\n\n  As an example of the effectiveness of CRP, last year parts of \nOklahoma--I have a special affinity for Oklahoma. My mother was born in \nOklahoma. My grandparents' family has lived there all their lives. I am \nvery familiar with that State. Parts of Oklahoma experienced drought \nworse than the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. But we did not see dust \nstorms like the 1930s because the voluntary conservation efforts--of \nthe CRP in particular--worked to reduce soil erosion and keep the soil \nwhere it was supposed to be, which is on the ground.\n  There are huge successes we have seen because our country has made an \ninvestment in protecting our precious land and water and air. We also \nhave established a new program called the Regional Conservation \nPartnerships Program which consolidates four very effective regional \npartnerships into one. I am very pleased we have been able to do this. \nThere is great significance for Members in all parts of the country. We \nconsolidate the Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative, the \nAgricultural Water Enhancement Program, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed \nInitiative, and the Great Lakes Water Erosion Sediment Program. This \nexemplifies many of the principles of this title.\n  We focus on conservation efforts that are locally led, that are \nvoluntary, and we create more flexibility and transparency for \nreporting as well as making sure we have adequate resources. When we \nwere talking to producers and a variety of partner organizations, \nnonprofits--again, hunters, fishermen, other organizations--they were \nvery excited about this new regional partnership title as a section. We \nappreciate all of the input and the support we have received to be able \nto make this effective.\n  Let me just say in conclusion that we have a conservation title that \nis supported in terms of its approach by almost 650 different \nconservation and environmental groups all across America in every 1 of \nthe 50 States. They have sent a strong message. They worked with us. \nThey know times are tight. They knew we had to create savings, we had \nto reduce dollars, but we had to make sure we had enough flexibility to \ndo the job people across our country want to see done in protecting our \nlands, our water, and our air.\n  This has been achieved with a tremendous amount of hard work on the \npart of many people. I am grateful for the work of our committee and \nmany others. I appreciate our subcommittee chairman Michael Bennet, who \nhas been deeply involved in this as well, and the Presiding Officer \nfrom Minnesota as well. We have many people who feel very strongly. Our \nchairman of the Finance Committee who was on the Senate floor earlier \nspeaking about this is another true champion around conservation. There \nwere so many people in our committee.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  I could go on and on about this, and on both sides of the aisle I \nmight add, but if I start naming people I will probably get in trouble \nfor missing someone. But we have strong people, strong advocates on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I thank everybody for their wonderful work on this conservation \ntitle. I think it is an example of the great work that has been done in \nputting the bill together. Again, I urge colleagues to vote yes to \ntable the Coburn amendment and the additional amendment I will talk \nabout at another point that will be coming before us, and continue to \nwork with us as we bring together the path forward to completing this \nvery important bill that affects 16 million American jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Sexual Assault in the Military\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to speak about \nsomething very serious, which is the issue of sexual assault in the \nmilitary, and in support of the Shaheen amendment which I cosponsored \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee markup. Today, I wrote a letter \nto the House majority leadership expressing my concern for this issue \nand asking that it be addressed immediately.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee recently considered and passed \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, and it \nawaits full consideration of the Senate.\n  As we all know, our troops need the tools and resources to complete \ntheir mission. It is imperative that it gets brought up right away.\n  As a member of the committee, I joined with members of both sides of \nthe aisle in supporting this amendment which would ensure that women \nwho serve in our Armed Forces and their families are provided access to \nabortion services in cases of rape or incest.\n  Sadly, sexual assault of women servicemembers has been recently \nexposed as far more prevalent than anyone previously thought. As a \nmatter of fact, the Pentagon believes such crimes are vastly \nunderreported. There is evidence that there are as many as 19,000 \nassaults that are committed every year. That is as many as 50 each day.\n  Furthermore, women are serving in harm's way--we know that--and they \nare often in dangerous locations without access to safe, nonmilitary \nhealth services. Given their courageous service, they deserve our care \nand protection, put quite simply.\n\n  The language of the amendment is consistent with the longstanding \nHyde amendment, which prevents Federal funding for abortions, except \nfor the victims of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at \nstake.\n  It is a simple issue: Those who are serving in harm's way who are \nvictims of such horrific crimes should be afforded the same rights as \ncitizens they protect and who rely on Federal funding for their health \ncare.\n  Our amendment passed 16 to 10 on a bipartisan basis, as I referenced \nearlier, in committee, and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto ensure it remains included in the version that passes the full \nSenate.\n  As I said, unfortunately, the House Armed Services Committee did not \ninclude a similar provision in their version of the bill, and I am not \nquite sure why.\n  I urge the House Members to think about the real-world implications \nof their actions and not block this legislation. I hope we can work \ntogether, in a truly bipartisan and bicameral basis, to ensure that our \namendment language becomes law so the President may sign it as such.\n  Extending these provisions to our military servicewomen is the right \nthing to do.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. On June 15, 1982, 30 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court \nhanded down a landmark decision, Plyler v. Doe. In 1975, the State of \nTexas had passed a law that allowed public schools to refuse admission \nto children who were undocumented. The law also withheld State funds \nfrom local school districts if they were to be used for education of \nundocumented kids.\n  In the Plyler case, the Court struck down the Texas law and held that \nit is unconstitutional to deny public education to children on the \nbasis of their immigration status. Justice William Brennan, who \nauthored the opinion, wrote: ``By denying these children a basic \neducation, we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our \ncivic institutions and foreclose any realistic possibility that they \nwill contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our \nnation.''\n  The year was 1982. In the 30 years since Plyler v. Doe was decided, \nmillions of immigrant children have received an education and become \ncontributing members to America and society. They are today's doctors, \nsoldiers, teachers, engineers, and they make us a better nation.\n  But since it was decided, Plyler has been under attack from anti-\nimmigration forces. On the very day the decision was announced, there \nwas a lawyer at the Justice Department who wrote a memo criticizing his \nsuperiors for not arguing support of this Texas law that was stricken \nby the Court.\n  Keep in mind at the time Plyler was decided, the Justice Department \nwas not under the control of a Democratic President; Ronald Reagan was \nPresident. Who was the Justice Department lawyer criticizing the Reagan \nadministration for not being tough enough on immigrant children? His \nname was John Roberts.\n  Twenty-three years later, in 2005, he was nominated to be Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court. During his confirmation hearing, Chief \nJustice Roberts said he would not vote to overturn cases that are \n``well-settled law.'' For example, he said Brown v. Board of Education, \nthe Supreme Court decision that ordered desegregation of schools, was \nalso well-settled law.\n  Plyler v. Doe is often called the Brown v. Board of Education of the \nimmigrants in America. But when I asked John Roberts whether he \nconsidered Plyler to be well-settled law, he refused to answer my \nquestion. Over the years, there have been attempts to pass Federal \nlegislation overturning this Supreme Court decision.\n  In 1996, Congress was considering a bill to restrict illegal \nimmigrants. Representative Elton Gallegly, a Republican from \nCalifornia, offered an amendment to overturn Plyler v. Doe and permit \nStates to bar undocumented children from public schools. At the time, I \nwas in the House. I voted against the Gallegly amendment and so did \nmost of the Democrats.\n  But most Republicans voted for it and it passed. President Clinton \nthreatened a veto if the Gallegly amendment was included in the final \nversion of the immigration bill. The amendment was also opposed by a \nbipartisan group of Senators, including the late great Senator Ted \nKennedy and our colleague, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.\n  As a result of this opposition, the Gallegly amendment was dropped \nfrom the final version of the bill. The latest threat to Plyler v. Doe \nis a spate of State laws targeting legal and illegal immigrants. On \nJune 9, 2011, 1 year ago this week, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley signed \ninto law H.B. 56, the strictest immigration law in the country.\n  Under Alabama law H.B. 56, it is a crime for a legal immigrant to \nfail to carry documents proving his or her legal status at all times. \nPolice officers in Alabama are required to check the immigration status \nof any individual if they have ``reasonable suspicion that he or she is \nundocumented.''\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\n  I am especially concerned about the provisions of the Alabama law \nthat involve schools in enforcing immigration laws. For example, in \nAlabama, schools must check the immigration status of every student and \nreport that information to the State. Schools are authorized to report \nstudents and parents they believe to be undocumented to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Last year, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Department of \nEducation sent a letter to every school district in the country warning \nthat enrollment practices that discourage students from attending \nschool could violate Federal civil rights law. The letter reminded \nschool districts of their obligation to provide access to undocumented \nstudents under the Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe.\n  Supporters of the Alabama law argue it does not prohibit immigrant \nchildren from attending public schools. But involving schools in \nenforcing immigration laws will clearly discourage immigrant children \nfrom attending. Last month, Tom Perez, the head of the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to the Alabama \nSuperintendent of Education about their department's investigation of \nAlabama's H.B. 56.\n  Mr. Perez said the Justice Department has concluded that ``in the \nimmediate aftermath of [H.B. 56's] implementation, Hispanic student \nabsence rates tripled, while absence rates for other groups of students \nremained virtually flat'' and ``the rate of total withdrawals of \nHispanic children substantially increased'' to 13.4 percent of all \nHispanic students in Alabama schools.\n  Mr. Perez also said: ``Hispanic children reported increased anxiety, \ndiminished concentration in school, deteriorating grades, and increased \nhostility, bullying, and intimidation.''\n  The author of the education provision of the Alabama law has made it \nclear his real goal is to overturn Plyler v. Doe. If this challenge \nshould make it to the Supreme Court, it could find a receptive audience \nin the Chief Justice, who criticized Plyler v. Doe when it was decided \nand refused to say it was well-settled law when he appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  I think this is the wrong approach for America. Instead of \nchallenging Plyler vs. Doe, we should be building on its legacy. Eleven \nyears ago, I introduced the DREAM Act--11 years. The DREAM Act is a \nbill that would give a select group of immigrant students who grew up \nin America the chance to earn their way to legal status if they do one \nof two things: serve in America's military or at least complete 2 years \nof college in good standing.\n  These young people were brought to the United States as children. I \nam sure the Presiding Officer knows many of them in his home State. \nThey grew up in this country and, thanks to Plyler v. Doe, they got a \nchance to go to school here. They are the valedictorians and ROTC \nleaders in many schools.\n  It wasn't their decision to come to this country. They were kids when \nthe decision was made, and their parents made the decision. The \nfundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish kids \nfor any wrongdoing by their parents. That isn't the American way. As \nSenator Marco Rubio has said, just because the parents got it wrong, we \nshould not hold it against the kids.\n  As Justice Brennan said in Plyler v. Doe, ``legislation directing the \nonus of a parent's misconduct against his children does not comport \nwith fundamental conceptions of justice.''\n  The DREAM Act isn't just the right thing to do, it is the right thing \nto do for America. It would help our economy by giving these talented \nimmigrants a chance to become tomorrow's engineers, entrepreneurs, \nsmall business owners, teachers, and doctors.\n  The DREAM Act would strengthen America's national security by giving \nthousands of highly qualified, well-educated young people a chance to \nserve in America's Armed Forces. It is one of the greatest levelers in \nAmerica. When we decided to integrate the Armed Forces under President \nHarry Truman, we set the stage for the civil rights revolution in this \ncountry. When men and women in the military were recognized for their \ninherent worth and commitment to this Nation rather than the color of \ntheir skin, it set a standard that now guides our Nation.\n  Almost every week I do my best to come to the floor to tell a story \nof one of these young people who would qualify for the DREAM Act. Today \nI will tell you about Al Okere. Al was born in Nigeria in 1990. In \n1991, Al's father was killed by the Nigerian police after he wrote \nnewspaper columns criticizing the Nigerian Government. The killing of \nAl's father was documented in the State Department's annual human \nrights report.\n  In 1995, Al's mother fled Nigeria and brought her 5-year-old boy Al \nto the United States. Al's mother, because of the murder or killing of \nher husband, applied for asylum, but her application was denied and she \nwas deported in 2005, when Al was 15--after 10 years in the United \nStates.\n  Today Al is 21 years of age. He lived in the State of Washington. His \nmother's sister, who is a U.S. citizen, is Al's legal guardian and has \nraised him since Al's mother was deported.\n  Al graduated from Rogers High School, near Tacoma, WA. He is \ncurrently attending Central Washington University, where he is an \nhonors student with a 3.5 grade point average. He is an avid basketball \nand football player. He is an active volunteer in his community. For \nexample, he recently headed up a fundraising drive for the Hope \nChildren's Hospital.\n  I ask a lot of these ``dreamers'' to send me letters about their view \nof the United States and their hope for the future. He wrote this:\n\n       I have been in accelerated academic programs most of my \n     educational life and hope to be a medical doctor some day, to \n     contribute to the well-being of fellow humans. I hope to \n     continue to emulate and walk in the great academic shoes of \n     my late father, who earned a Ph.D degree from a university in \n     Paris, France. My family and community support has been \n     enormous and it gives me zeal to work hard in my studies, to \n     be able to lend a hand to others in need, to realize a bright \n     future.\n\n  Unfortunately, Al has been placed in deportation proceedings. Under \nour immigration law, his aunt, who is a U.S. citizen and his legal \nguardian, can't sponsor him for citizenship.\n  Al Okere grew up in America. He has never committed a crime. We have \nalready invested in him. He has received his entire education, from \nkindergarten through college, in the United States. He didn't get any \nfinancial help in going to college from the Federal Government. He \nborrowed for that because he is undocumented. He had to find other \nsources and work his way through college. But he made it. He has a \ngreat potential to contribute to America. He doesn't remember a thing \nabout Nigeria, and he doesn't speak their native language. Despite all \nthat, the laws of America say that Al should be deported.\n  Here is what Al said about that possibility:\n\n       I don't remember anything about my mother's country of \n     Nigeria. I cannot even speak the language. Every experience I \n     have had in life that I can remember has been in the United \n     States of America. Everyone I know and care about are all \n     here, except for my mother, who was sadly removed and remains \n     in hiding in fear of her life.\n\n  Fortunately, the Department of Homeland Security has decided to put \nAl's deportation on hold. I support this decision, but I know it is \nonly temporary, it doesn't give Al permanent legal status of any kind, \nand there is still a risk of deportation in the future. The only way \nfor Al to become a citizen is for the DREAM Act to become the law of \nthe land.\n  Would America be a better Nation if Al Okere were deported? Of course \nnot. Al is not an isolated example. There are thousands of others like \nhim, who are only asking for a chance, asking for justice.\n  Plyler v. Doe gave Al Okere and other bright, accomplished, and \nambitious young people like him the opportunity to obtain an education \nin America. The DREAM Act would give them a chance to fulfill their \nGod-given potential and become our future doctors, engineers, teachers, \nand soldiers.\n  A couple of weeks ago--a lot of these DREAM Act students keep in \ntouch with us--one student contacted our office saying he had given up. \nHe lived in America all his life and had been educated here. He made \nhis way through college and was looking forward to being an engineer. \nHe waited 11 years for passage of the DREAM Act, and it hasn't \nhappened. He decided he had no choice but to move to Canada. So now his \ntalents will go to Canada. I have\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nnothing against Canada; it is a great nation and neighbor. But why \nwould we give up someone we have educated and trained to be a part of \nAmerica?\n  On the 30th anniversary of Plyler v. Doe, I again ask my colleagues \nin both parties to support the DREAM Act. Let's give Al Okere and so \nmany other young people like him a chance to contribute more fully to \nthe only country they have called home. It is the right thing to do, \nand it will make America a stronger Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Childhood Obesity\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today because there is an \nepidemic hovering over America, and we ought not to stand by and let it \ncontinue.\n  A staggering one-third of Americans are obese a condition that can \nendanger health and shorten lifespan. Among our children, the situation \nis becoming a plague and leaving too many young people unable to \nparticipate in physical activities, such as sports or games.\n  I salute the First Lady, Michelle Obama, for bringing attention to \nthis crisis by educating parents, teachers, and kids about the need to \nbe more active and eat nutritious food, but it is going to take the \ninvolvement of this Congress. We need to protect our children, our \neconomy, and our national security.\n  Our Nation's childhood obesity rate is one of the highest in the \nworld. Here we see it, childhood obesity rates displayed worldwide: \nObesity epidemic as seen among American youth. And if we look at the \nother major countries in the world, going from the lowest, China is at \n5.2 percent, upwards to France at 14.1 percent, and then we get to \nAmerica, and 31.7 percent of our children are obese or overweight. That \nis discouraging, very sad for the individual and for the country at \nlarge.\n\n  People who are obese are at a higher risk for heart disease, stroke, \ndiabetes, and even certain types of cancer. Obesity-related conditions \nkill more than 110,000 Americans every year. We do not want to see more \nchildren with diabetes. We don't want our children to be burdened with \na lifetime of disease and disability.\n  Public health advocates have been sounding the alarm for years, but \nthis problem has only gotten worse and this Congress and the Federal \nGovernment have largely ignored the problem. Over the last few decades, \nthe rate of children who are obese or overweight has doubled. In 1973, \nwe were looking at 15.4 percent. That was the percentage of obese and \noverweight American children. But if we look ahead only 40 years, we \nsee the rate has gone from 15.4 percent to 31.7 percent. That is almost \none-third of our childhood population. This issue has even affected our \nmilitary and the statistics are shocking; 25 percent of our young men \nand women who want to join the military are too overweight to serve.\n  We need to take bold action. This farm bill is not just about making \nsure businesses stay profitable, it should be about keeping our \ncitizens healthy too. We owe it to our kids and our country to learn \nwhat is causing this calamity.\n  That is why I filed an amendment to focus in on a particular \nsuspected contributor to the problem. The Federal Government can and \nshould determine whether sugary drinks are causing obesity and causing \nthe damage that goes with it. Americans are drinking more high-sugar \ndrinks than ever before--children and adults drink twice the amount of \nsugary soda than they did just three decades ago. These drinks are \ncheap and available everywhere--in restaurants, convenience stores, \nmovie theaters or vending machines.\n  We have seen children and teenagers holding giant cups of soda or \nother sugary drinks. Some of these sizes are so big they look like a \nbarrel. When a child drinks 32 ounces, takes a 32-ounce cup of soda, it \nis the equivalent of ingesting 41 sugar cubes. Can you imagine anyone \npermitting their children to devour 41 sugar cubes? Who in this body \nwould give their child or grandchild 41 sugar cubes to eat?\n  The city of New York is taking a bold course of action and other \ncommunities have done their own studies and have decided to act. In \nCongress, we need to step up and do our part. We need to know what role \nsugary drinks are playing in the childhood obesity epidemic in America. \nMy amendment would initiate a study on the impact of these drinks on \nobesity and human health in the United States. It would require an \nexamination of public health proposals regarding the cost and the size \nof these drinks. The amendment is endorsed by organizations such as the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, the American Public Health Association, \nand the Center For Science and the Public Interest.\n  I reach out, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I ask \nthat, once and for all, we work together to do what we can to protect \nour children--protect them, in this case, from the obesity epidemic. I \nhope we will join together to fight for the well-being of our children.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \nJobs Act of 2012, which the Presiding Officer from New Jersey just \nspoke of, in my State called the farm bill, represents the most \nsignificant reform of U.S. agriculture in decades. It is the product of \nmonths of policy discussion and late-night deliberations, guided by \nChairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Roberts. It is the reason why \npeople across the country, farmers and business owners and faith \nleaders and county commissioners are paying attention. The bill \nbenefits all of us, all Americans.\n  Today, one in seven jobs in Ohio is related to the food and \nagriculture industry. To get the economy back on track, the farm bill \nmust remain a priority in Congress. The Agriculture Committee has \nworked to craft a farm bill that is forward-looking and realistic. The \ncenterpiece of the bill's deficit reduction efforts is based on a bill \nI authored with my colleague John Thune, a Republican from South \nDakota, along with Senator Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and \nSenator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. Our Aggregate Risk and \nRevenue Management Program proposed streamlining the farm safety net \nand making it more market oriented. The era of direct payments--the \nbillions of dollars that newspaper editorial writers and constituents \nalike complained about, these huge farm subsidies that went mostly to \nlarge corporate farmers--the era of direct payments made annually \nregardless of need under this bill is over.\n  Instead, the new Ag Risk Coverage Program will work hand in hand with \ncrop insurance to provide farmers the tools needed to manage risk, \nmaking payments only when farmers need them most.\n  The program is market oriented. It relies on market data instead of \narbitrary numbers in statutes. It is more responsive to farmers' needs \nand more responsible to taxpayers. The bill reforms a number of \nlongstanding, unjustifiable practices. For the first time, this farm \nbill ends payments to landowners who have nothing to do with farm \nmanagement. It puts a firm cap on how much support any farmer can \nreceive from the direct farm support programs every year. There are \ncommonsense reforms that ensure the taxpayer dollars go only where they \nare needed.\n  Is there more to be done to make sure taxpayers get the most \nefficient, effective, and affordable farm policy possible? Of course \nthere is. In the coming years, we will continue to improve our farm and \nfood policy, but\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nthis is a good start. It is good for farmers, good for taxpayers. It \ncontinues to move our Nation's food and agriculture policy in a \npositive direction.\n  The farm bill is a jobs and innovation bill. Every $1 billion in \nexports supports 8,400 American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas, \naccording to the USDA. In 2011, U.S. agriculture enjoyed a trade \nsurplus of $42 billion, $42 billion we sold more than we brought in \nfrom abroad in farm products, the highest annual surplus on record. \nContrast that with the billions and billions, tens of billions, \nhundreds of billions of dollars in trade deficit we have in \nmanufacturing in other parts of our economy.\n  There is so much room for growth, not only overseas but also at home. \nBio-based manufacturing and renewable energy are two examples of the \npotential that American agriculture holds for U.S. economic growth and \nfor job creation. Alongside food production, farm-based and renewable \nenergy production, such as advanced biomass energy, can serve as the \nengine of the rural economy for decades to come. It is investments in \nagriculture such as this, such as the ones this bill maintains in \nresearch and energy and bio-based products and food production, that \nwill enable continued creation of good-paying jobs, again that will \nnot, that cannot be shipped overseas.\n\n  The farm bill provides economic relief to millions of Americans. \nAlhough we call it a farm bill, this bill is fundamentally an economic \nrelief bill. For farmers, the bill provides financial assistance to \nweather tough times or adopt conservation practices that protect clean \nwater and healthy soils and wildlife habitat. For millions of \nAmericans, this bill helps put dinner on the table when wages are tight \nand families are struggling to make ends meet and keeps children from \ngoing hungry. That is why this bill is so important. I add, the \nPresiding Officer from New Jersey has always been such a strong \nadvocate of these nutrition programs. We both understand that more than \none-third of people who are getting SNAP, who are receiving what we \nused to call food stamps, are working families, people who are only \nmaking $9, $10, $11 an hour, sometimes working two jobs, and still \ncannot make it without some food assistance.\n  The bill includes resources for SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, which is one of the Nation's most essential \nantipoverty programs. In addition to supporting people who are \nstruggling to feed their families, SNAP supports retailers and \nbusinesses and the farmers and ranchers who grow the food.\n  At a time of high unemployment, SNAP participation now exceeds 44 \nmillion Americans, half of whom are children. Many of these families \nare working families. Half the people served by SNAP are children.\n  SNAP participation is expected to fall as the economy recovers. The \nbill continues to support SNAP with minimal modifications. It continues \nand increases support for commodity distribution to food banks at a \ntime when food pantry shelves in Ohio and across the Nation are bare. \nBut I want to be clear. I have serious concerns with the cuts, not \nlarge cuts such as the House Agriculture Committee wants to do and that \nSenator Paul tried to do--very unsuccessfully--and that Congressman \nRyan made with his budget from the House of Representatives--nothing \neven close to the tens and tens of billions of dollars they want to cut \nfrom nutrition. But I am concerned about this $4 billion cut. When \ncompared to the $130 billion in cuts to SNAP in the Ryan budget, the \nmodification in this bill was done carefully.\n  The farm bill is a deficit reduction bill, a jobs bill, an economic \nrelief bill. It affects every American every day. I commend, again, \nChairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Roberts. Their joint effort to \nwork across party lines is to be commended.\n  These months of work and deliberation are at risk because some insist \non debating dozens of unrelated amendments and others seek to score \npolitical points at the expense of American families and at the expense \nof American farmers. This is not the time to debate conceal-and-carry \nlaws or American aid to Pakistan or the future of the Labor Relations \nBoard. Not that any of those are not debatable or any of those aren't a \nplace where people can have reasonable differences on public policy. \nBut conceal and carry, American aid to Pakistan, the future of the \nLabor Relations Board should not be part of the farm bill.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to work together and halt the impasse that keeps \nus from making progress on this bill.\n  I am the first Ohio Senator who is a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee in 40 years. In my first month in the Senate, I made a \nrequest to Senator Reid to join the Agriculture Committee, along with \nother duties, because of the importance of agriculture in my State. One \nout of seven jobs in Ohio is related to agriculture. It is the largest \nbusiness, largest industry in my State. It matters so much to Ohio.\n  My position on the Agriculture Committee has helped as I have done \nroundtables around Ohio and met with literally hundreds of farmers, \nincluding grain farmers, dairy farmers, specialty crop farmers, nursery \nfarmers, tree farmers, experts at Ohio State in the agriculture school, \nand I have come prepared to help write this farm bill both back in 2007 \nand this year. This is a major step forward. It is something of which \nwe can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4144-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very \nspecial part of my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am \nspeaking of McCreary County, in the southeastern region of the State. \nThis year, McCreary County celebrates its centennial; according to the \nMcCreary County Museum located in the heart of historic downtown \nStearns, KY, the county's birthday was on March 12, 2012. One hundred \nyears ago, Kentucky Governor James B. McCreary signed the legislation \ncreating the county, named after himself, as the 120th and last county \nof the Bluegrass State, formed out of portions of Wayne, Pulaski and \nWhitley counties.\n  The people of McCreary County today have upheld the rich traditions \nand legacy of the hardy Kentuckians who were there for that county's \nfounding 100 years ago. They have exemplified the very best of what \nsoutheastern Kentucky has to offer, they have kept Kentucky's history \nalive, and they represent the future of Kentucky and our Nation. I ask \nmy Senate colleagues to join me in wishing the people of McCreary \nCounty the very best as they celebrate their centennial.\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\n  An article published in the McCreary County Record recently described \nthe events of McCreary County's centennial celebration. I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear as \nfollows:\n\n            [From the McCreary County Record, Mar. 15, 2012]\n\n    Happy Birthday! County Marks 100 Years With Day-Long Celebration\n\n                           (By Janie Slaven)\n\n       Whitley City.--The past, present, and future converged \n     Monday as McCreary County celebrated its centennial.\n       Festivities centered around the local courthouse, which \n     attracted state and federal dignitaries.\n       Representatives for Governor Steve Beshear and U.S. Senator \n     Mitch McConnell read congratulatory letters while State \n     Representative Sara Beth Gregory presented McCreary County \n     Judge-Executive Doug Stephens with a resolution passed by the \n     House on Friday.\n       Judge Stephens opened the ceremony with a prayer. Quoting I \n     Chronicles, he acknowledged that McCreary County has suffered \n     the ``curse of poverty and scourge of drugs'' but asked God \n     to heal our land. The judge went on to praise the endurance \n     and resilience of our citizens, saying that McCreary County \n     is not just a spot on a map but a way of life.\n       ``We have a rich history but we also have a rich future,'' \n     Judge Stephens said.\n       To illustrate that history, the bulk of the ceremony was \n     devoted to ``A Governor's Visit''--the dramatization of \n     namesake Governor James B. McCreary's 1914 visit to \n     Kentucky's latest county--by local historian Sam Perry. \n     Through speeches from the governor (as portrayed by Jimmy \n     Waters), first elected county judge Joseph Williams (Adam \n     Phillips), State Rep. William B. Creekmore (Grady Wilson), \n     and narration from former judge-executive Jimmie W. Greene; \n     the play gave the crowd attending a lesson in who settled the \n     Big South Fork region and what went into forging the new \n     McCreary County from portions of Wayne, Pulaski and Whitley \n     counties.\n       Following the play, Judge Stephens ceremoniously cut the \n     first piece of the county birthday cake (prepared by Yummi \n     Bakery)--which he presented to the oldest citizen in \n     attendance, Fannie Morgan, who turned 100 last November. The \n     second piece went to the youngest citizen, four-year-old \n     Bailey Gilreath.\n       The crowd then gathered into the fiscal courtroom, where \n     county officials debuted the recently refurbished portraits \n     of 14 of McCreary County's 19 judges and judge-executives. \n     Centennial Commission member Shane Gilreath noted that the \n     elite group came from all walks of life. They were attorneys, \n     social workers, farmers, miners, teachers and more.\n       Photographs of Mahan Renfro and Joseph Williams, which had \n     hung in the portrait gallery and have been replaced by \n     paintings, were presented to family members. Maxine Lawson, \n     ``Cookie'' Joe Williams and Debbie Jo Peterson represented \n     three generations of the Williams family. Greene, Renfro's \n     nephew by marriage, joked that he had lobbied for a portrait \n     to represent each of his four terms.\n       Deputy Judge-Executive Andrew Powell and McCreary County \n     Museum director Amy Combs recognized the artists in \n     attendance--including Dorothy Washam, Dale Crabtree, and \n     Nadine Heth--before unveiling two new portraits honoring the \n     last two judge-executives. Judge Stephens's portrait will be \n     hung at a later date, but Blaine Phillips's portrait was hung \n     by his wife, Kathy, and twin brother, Wayne.\n       Before breaking for a luncheon hosted by the McCreary \n     County Historical Society, those attending had the \n     opportunity to view a number of exhibits displayed throughout \n     the courthouse's ground floor.\n       If the morning was devoted to our county's past, the \n     evening focused firmly on the future. After signing a \n     proclamation honoring the county's centennial during Monday's \n     regular fiscal court meeting, Judge Stephens signed another \n     in honor of the Girl Scouts' 100th anniversary. Local \n     troops--assisted by representatives from the Daniel Boone \n     National Forest's Stearns Ranger District (which is \n     celebrating its 75th anniversary)--planted a sugar maple on \n     the courthouse lawn.\n       If you missed Monday's celebration, you have several \n     opportunities to obtain centennial keepsakes.\n       For a limited time, the U.S. Postal Service is offering a \n     postmark commemorating the occasion. Mail order requests for \n     the special cancellations will be available for 30 days \n     beginning March 12.\n       Customers should allow at least a 2-inch-by-4-inch space in \n     the stamp area for the postmark and have postage applied to \n     cards or letters before mailing them--inside another \n     envelope--to: Postmaster, McCreary County Centennial Station, \n     1387 North Highway 27, Whitley City, KY 42653.\n       The McCreary County Museum is offering a set of 12 historic \n     postcards as well as DVDs of the day's events for $10 each. \n     Call 376 5730 for more information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4145-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, finally, let me shift gears to another \ntopic I care deeply about; that is, taking care of our veterans. This \nweekend a group of World War II veterans from Montana will be visiting \nour Nation's capital. With a great deal of honor and respect, I extend \na hearty Montana welcome to each and every one of them.\n  Together, they will visit the World War II Memorial and share stories \nabout their service. This journey will no doubt bring about a lot of \nmemories. I hope it will give them a deep sense of pride also.\n  What they achieved together almost 70 years ago was remarkable. That \nmemorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never \nforget what they did nor what they sacrificed. To us, they were the \ngreatest generation. They left the comforts of their family and their \ncommunities to confront evil from Iwo Jima to Bastogne. Together, they \nwon the war in the Pacific by conquering an empire and liberated a \ncontinent by defeating Hitler and the Nazis.\n  To them, they were simply doing their jobs. They enlisted in \nunprecedented numbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They \nrepresented the very best of us and made us proud.\n  From a young age I remember playing the bugle at the memorial \nservices of veterans of the first two world wars. It instilled in me a \nprofound sense of respect I will never forget.\n  Honoring the service of every generation of American veterans is a \nMontana value. I deeply appreciate the work of the Big Sky Honor \nFlight, a nonprofit organization that made this trip possible.\n  To the World War II veterans making the trip this weekend, I salute \nyou. We will always be grateful, and we will never forget your service \nor sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4145-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4145-S4146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STAN SLOSS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as every one of our colleagues \nwill attest, the work we do in this Chamber is made possible by many \nexceptional people who do not carry an election certificate. I am \nspeaking of the dedicated staffers who work on committees and in our \npersonal offices.\n  Many of the staff members we interact with every day go on to build \ntheir own careers in political life, while others use the skills they \ndeveloped here to work in rewarding ways for the private sector. Others \ncontinue in public service with nonprofit organizations or other kinds \nof government service. A few will make their contribution to public \nservice by staying here as employees of the House of Representatives or \nthe Senate. A smaller and more distinct group will develop such broad \nexpertise in the legislative branch that they might as well carry an \nelection certificate of their own because of the respect, esteem, and \nhigh regard in which they are held. These are the men and women whom \nother congressional staffers seek for their wisdom and guidance. These \nare the wise people whom Senators and Congressmen look upon as peers, \nnot only because of their good counsel and uniquely honed years of \nexperience but also because they often know more about the legislative \nprocess than legislators themselves.\n  Among this more and most distinct group of staff members, there is a \nstandout, my friend Stan Sloss. I know the Presiding Officer knows Stan \nSloss. Stan is marking his 14th year of service in my office but also \n37 total years of work in Congress.\n  A native of Glenwood Springs, CO, Stan is a graduate of Amherst \nCollege and Harvard Law School. He came to Washington, DC, in the late \n1960s, working first in the General Counsel's Office of the Atomic \nEnergy Commission.\n  Stan's congressional career started in 1975 when he joined the staff \nof what was then known as the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In 1977 Stan became a counsel to the new Subcommittee on General \nOversight and Alaska Lands chaired by former Representative John \nSeiberling, an iconic past Member of the House of Representatives. In \nthis capacity, Stan worked with both Representative Seiberling and my \nfather, Morris Udall, who was chairman of the full Interior Committee.\n  Stan has had many successes, but one that I am most proud of is his \nwork to help draft legislation that became the\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--key legislation \nsetting aside more than 100 million acres of Alaska's most pristine \npublic lands. Stan staffed hearings throughout the lower 48 States and \nAlaska and was one of the many key professional staff who helped shape \nthe final legislation. The law was a milestone in conservation, \nprotecting an area larger than the State of California and more than \ndoubling the size of the Nation's system of national parks, wildlife \nrefuges, wilderness, and wild and scenic rivers.\n  When John Seiberling retired in 1987, Stan remained on the Interior \nCommittee staff, serving under former Representative Bruce Vento, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands. Stan \ncontinued to work on many other laws and regulations affecting public \nlands and natural resources, including the Arizona Desert Wilderness \nAct sponsored by my father.\n  Stan's expertise was simply indispensable. In 1995 Stan left the \nResources Committee to become the legislative director for David \nSkaggs, a House Member from Colorado, who benefited from Stan's years \nof experience and expertise with public lands issues.\n  I have a letter from Congressman Skaggs noting all of Stan's \naccomplishments and service. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Stan Sloss,\n     Congressional Staffer Extraordinaire, Office of Senator Mark \n         Udall, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Stan: Yes, ``The Honorable.'' You are entitled to that \n     term of address more than most on whom it is bestowed ex \n     officio. For you, it is has been earned per labores.\n       I am reluctant to contemplate your retirement--or, more \n     precisely, to think of the Congress no longer subject to your \n     knowledgeable instruction and deft oversight. No doubt the \n     superlatives will flow from those who will speak in person at \n     your party. I wish I could be there, and will count on the \n     good Senator to read this for me.\n       My vocabulary is barely adequate to express my admiration, \n     respect and gratitude for your service to Article I branch \n     and to me personally. You are simply without peer in devotion \n     to duty, in insistence on the highest standards of intellect \n     and integrity, and in institutional loyalty. You have \n     educated us with your insights into law and policy, you have \n     inspired us by your courage and steadfastness, and you have \n     supported us with your friendship and wry humor.\n       All who have had the privilege of working with you, even as \n     we pretended that you worked for us, feel a poignant mix of \n     deep affection and some sadness at the occasion of your \n     retirement. To say that you will be profoundly missed barely \n     suffices. I pray that you will draw enormous pride and \n     satisfaction in looking back on a career of exceptional \n     service to your country. The United States is a much better \n     place on account of Stan Sloss. The Honorable Stan Sloss.\n       Godspeed, dear friend.\n           With great respect and affection,\n                                                  David E. Skaggs,\n                                        Former Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. While Stan was working with Congressman \nSkaggs, he also dealt with contentious issues related to Rocky Flats, a \nformer nuclear weapons site in Colorado, and the other sites in the \nU.S. Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex.\n  Stan was one of the first people I hired following my election to the \nHouse of Representatives in November of 1998. It was one of the best \ndecisions I have ever made. I was fortunate to have someone with Stan's \nexperience who also understood issues important to Colorado. While in \nmy House office, Stan was instrumental in developing a number of land \nand environmental bills that were signed into law, including the Rocky \nFlats National Wildlife Refuge Act, which converted this site and a \nvast expanse of open space into a wildlife habitat asset after it was \ncleaned up and closed. He also steered into law the James Peak \nWilderness and Protection Area Act, one of the last unprotected areas \nalong Colorado's Northern Front Range mountainous backdrop. Stan has \nalso been my expert on fire prevention, developing legislation on \nforest health and wildfire response and mitigation.\n  But Stan's work has not just been confined to the environmental \narena. His keen intellect, common sense, and sharp legal analysis have \nbeen invaluable on a wide range of issues and topics that face each and \nevery one of us every day. He has been especially effective in tutoring \nmany of the younger members of my staff on the inner workings of \nCongress, helping them learn the nuances of legislative drafting, and \nserving as an example of the highest standard of professionalism for \ncongressional staff.\n  Like any thoughtful and accomplished lawyer, Stan is often fond of \nsaying that he can ``argue it flat or he can argue it round,'' and his \nobjectivity is legendary in our office. Having said that, however, I \nalso know that beneath his always calm demeanor and his capacity to see \nall sides of the question, there beats the heart of a man who is \npassionate about doing the right thing.\n  Through many years of working on behalf of the people of Colorado in \nmy House office and now my Senate office, Stan has always been a voice \nof wisdom, reason, and, above all, integrity. My colleagues in the \nColorado congressional delegation have often looked upon Stan as their \nresource as well. I have never minded sharing him because his advice \nand guidance carry weight that inevitably makes better whatever bill or \npolicy he has been asked to consider. I think I daresay the Presiding \nOfficer has also had the opportunity to work with Stan and take \nadvantage of his wisdom and insight.\n  Stan is a person of depth and accomplishment beyond his work in \nCongress. He is one of the best read people I have ever met. He is an \nexpert on gardening, on opera, on history, and the list goes on and on. \nI have to say parenthetically, as a graduate of Williams College, for \nme to say that about an Amherst graduate probably has double weight.\n  Stan has an exceptional sense of humor and a dry wit, as demonstrated \nin the poems he often wrote making wry observations on current events \nwhich he would regularly circulate to staff. In short, he has perfected \nwhat seems to be the lost art of being polite and courteous to other \npeople even when he disagrees with them. That, of course, is a quality \nwe could always use a bit more of in Congress.\n  Stan is not only a good employee, he is also a good human being. In \nthe rough-and-tumble world of politics, that is perhaps the highest \npraise to which any of us can aspire. His contributions to my offices, \nthe offices of other Members, the House Resources Committee, and the \nwhole Congress and ultimately the people of the United States serve as \nan example of a professional life that commands both respect and \naffection.\n  Just a few months ago, my staff and I celebrated Stan's 70th birthday \nwith him, as we had his 60th and 65th birthdays in past years, and \ntoday we are honored to celebrate his retirement. My staff and I will \nmiss Stan, it goes without saying, and we will miss working with him.\n  As a point of personal privilege, I want to make it clear that I know \nI will continue to seek his advice even after he leaves congressional \nservice. I am excited to see what the next chapter will be for Stan. It \nwill no doubt involve some adventure, some noble pursuits, some deep \nthought, and some new summits to ascend.\n  So please join me in thanking Stan Sloss for 37 years of exceptional \nwork in the Congress and for his service to our country that he loves \nso much. We wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4146-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4146-S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHERRIE SLICK\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague \nfrom Colorado who has come to the floor to recognize a very fine public \nservant who has been with him and the Senate for years. I, too, today \nrise to speak of an Alaskan who has dedicated a quarter century to \nservice in the Senate, working as my staff person down in Ketchikan, \nAK.\n  I would like to share a few comments with my colleagues on this \noccasion. It is a little bit of a happy occasion, a little bit of a sad \noccasion. I think my colleague from Colorado would agree that when we \nhave someone who has dedicated so many years, we wish them well as they \nmove forward, but their departure leaves a little bit of a hole for \nthose of us who carry on.\n  Today I rise to honor Sherrie Slick, who on June 1 began her 25th \nyear as a Senate staffer in southeast Alaska based in her hometown of \nKetchikan. Sherrie plans to retire from Federal service on July 30, \nafter, again, a quarter century of service to her State.\n  For Sherrie, I think her retirement is very likely a cause for joy. \nIt is going\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nto give her more time to spend with her kids and her grandchildren, \nmore time to devote to the many volunteer and civic efforts in which \nshe is engaged in southeast Alaska. But it is going to be a sad time \nfor myself and for Congressman Don Young.\n  Sherrie provided guidance to the Alaska delegation in Ketchikan, \nAlaska's first city, through a very interesting time. It has been \nsomewhat of a turbulent quarter century, one in which the region's \nformer economic mainstay, which is its timber industry, has sharply \ncontracted, during a period in which the tourism industry has \nsignificantly grown, and during a period where its prospects of \nsupporting major mineral development I think have substantially \nbrightened--that is a good spot for us. It has been a period when \nKetchikan, which is the seventh largest entity in our State, which is \nthe only large community that is separated from its lifeline with its \nairport on a neighboring island, has endured somewhat unwelcome \nnational attention solely because they seek dependable access by \nbridge.\n  Over the years, Sherrie has responded to tens of thousands of public \nand media inquiries and requests for help over everything from Social \nSecurity checks and visas to immigration documents. She has listened to \nthousands of complaints over access to Alaska public land and to \nobjections to many, many Federal regulations--far too many to count \nhere. Through it all, I think it is fair to say that Sherrie has been \nthat proverbial energizer bunny. She has more enthusiasm, more energy \nthan many people combined. She listens patiently, and she works \ntirelessly to help all. She helps those southeast residents and \nvisitors deal with Federal agencies, navigate the Federal redtape, and \nthen on top of it, all in that extra time, she volunteers to help her \ncommunity and help her State be a better place in which to live and \nraise a family.\n  Sherrie's volunteer efforts were recognized by the community when she \nwas named Citizen of the Year back in 2005 by the Greater Ketchikan \nChamber of Commerce. But her accomplishments go far beyond being named \nthe Federal Employee of the Year, the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce's \nOutstanding Chamber Emissary in 1991, its outstanding board member in \n1994 and its chairman in 1996. She has also received the Ketchikan \nRotary Club's Community Service Award in 1994, received the Ketchikan \nFederal Executive Association's Lifetime Community Service Award in \n2006, received the Ketchikan Visitors Bureau Rainbird Award in 1990 and \ngained its Outstanding Service Award in 2006.\n\n  Ms. Slick, originally from Corvallis, Oregon, has a degree in \nelementary education from Oregon State University and also training in \nbusiness and accounting from Linn-Benton Community College in \nCorvallis. She moved to Ketchikan in 1975. A mother of two, Brian and \nTheresa, she first worked for eight years as the office manager of the \nKetchikan Credit Bureau before moving to insurance underwriting for \nthree years. She later became the assistant sales tax auditor for the \nKetchikan Gateway Borough for five years and then spent a sixth year \nworking as the borough's planning and zoning secretary.\n  In June 1988, former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, with encouragement \nfrom the state's other Senator at the time, my father, Frank Murkowski, \nstole Sherrie away from local government to head the Delegation's \nunified southern Panhandle constituent office. In addition to her \nlegislative work, Sherrie has performed a dizzying array of volunteer \nservices for her community and state.\n  Since 2004 she has been a member of the Ketchikan Pioneers Home \nFoundation, the state's main senior care provider. She was a board \nmember of the Alaska State Pioneer Homes Board from 2007 to 2010, a \nboard member of the Ketchikan General Hospital Foundation from 2008 to \n2010, served as chair person of the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce in \n1996, as chairman of Ketchikan Rotary in 2000 and as the Secretary-\nTreasurer of the Ketchikan Federal Executive Association. She also was \nthe Treasurer and Vice Chairman of Ketchikan Soroptimists, a member of \nthe Executive Board of the Alaska Public Employees Association and \nState Treasurer of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough chapter of the State \nEmployees Political Information Committee.\n  While active in local and state politics, Sherrie also was the \nfounding board member of the Ketchikan Soccer League, the vice \npresident of the Ketchikan Killer Whales Swim Club, the Co-Leader and \nDay Camp director of the local Campfire Girls program, a Boy Scouts Co-\nLeader and Den mother, a leader for the local junior and senior high \nschools' drill teams and for four years was a board member, vice-chair \nand chairman of the Ketchikan Theater Ballet. The latter posts allowed \nher to express her musical loves which include playing piano, organ, \nclarinet and accordion.\n  Sherrie, in her ``free'' time, also operated a part-time catering \ncompany and was a partner in the Alaska Cruise Line Agency, which \nprovides lecturers to explain Alaska's history, discuss its scenery and \nwildlife and answer tourist questions about the state during voyages up \nthe Inside Passage aboard commercial cruise ships. In that role Sherrie \nhas provided factual information to thousands of visitors to the 49th \nState answering such questions as whether visitors to Alaska can use \nAmerican stamps on their postcards. She, in that post, has been a true \nambassador for the state's tourism industry.\n  Through it all, including organizing and staffing literally hundreds \nof federal official visits, congressional field hearings and volunteer \nfundraising events, such as those to aid breast cancer detection and \ntreatment, Sherrie has maintained her calm, her poise and her never \nfailing sense of humor and graciousness--not to mention her energy \nlevel. Her dedication to family, community and career is universally \nrecognized by friends and associates.\n  I can't thank her enough for her service to me during my decade in \nthe U.S. Senate, and her service to her fellow Alaskans over the past \n25 years. Her intelligence, knowledge and people-pleasing skills will \nbe sorely missed in the future. I hope that all members of the U.S. \nSenate will join me in wishing her well and godspeed in her retirement \npursuits. She has earned all of her accolades and the true thanks of \nall Alaskans in the Panhandle for a job very well done.\n  I am pleased and delighted to have her here with her granddaughter \nenjoying some Washington, DC, hospitality. Again, I cannot give thanks \nnear enough to her for all the years of service Sherrie has provided to \nmy State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4147-S4148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LORY YUDIN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is a definition of ``United States \nSenator'' that I have always enjoyed: ``A United States Senator is a \nconstitutional impediment to the smooth functioning of staff.'' We may \nlaugh. But we all know that there is a lot of truth in that!\n  On the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which I \nchair, I am blessed with one of the finest staff teams on Capitol Hill. \nAnd on that staff, Lory Yudin, our chief clerk, has set the highest \nstandard for professionalism, expertise, and work ethic. So it is a sad \nday for the committee as Lory retires this week.\n  Actually, this is Lory's second retirement from the Senate. She \noriginally came to work in the Senate in 1977, as a staffer for the \nBanking Committee, later moving to the Rules Committee, and retiring in \n2001.\n  She was coaxed to come back to the Senate in 2009. It was a critical \ntime for the HELP Committee, just days before the committee was \nscheduled to begin markup of the historic health reform bill. We were \nin sudden, urgent need of a new chief clerk. And not just any chief \nclerk. This was no time for on-the-job training. We needed a seasoned \nveteran who could step right in and take charge of a long and complex \nmarkup process. Long-time staffers put their heads together and came up \nwith the answer: We need to persuade Lory Yudin to come back to the \nSenate.\n  Fortunately, Lory said yes. On her first day, she walked into a scene \nof disarray, with boxes, papers, and documents scattered across tables \nand lining hallways. Lory quickly took charge, imposing order and \ndiscipline--and, most importantly, projecting a sense of calm and \ncompetence. In short order, everything was sorted, organized, and under \ncontrol. The committee was ready for one of the most\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\nimportant markups in its history. As one senior staffer said about \nLory's leadership at this time, ``She really rescued the committee.''\n  In the nearly 3 years since, Lory Yudin has become a beloved and \nrespected chief clerk, looked up to by everyone as the quintessential \nSenate professional. And, of course, she has been a great friend to \nmembers and staffers alike. For younger staffers, she has been the \nperfect mix of mentor and mom, someone they turn to for wisdom and \ncounsel.\n  Lory is very much a member of our Senate family. This is where she \nmet her husband David, as well as so many of her lifelong friends. And \nwhile Lory has always been dedicated to her work here in the Senate, \nthere is no question that her family has always come first, especially \nher son Eli.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nlandmark moment in health care for our veterans. Today is the 25th \nanniversary of the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Nation's first \nVeterans' Community Based Outpatient Clinic, CBOC. On June 13, 1987, at \nthe Cary Medical Center in Caribou, ME, Governor John McKernan was \njoined by Senators George Mitchell and William Cohen, and then-\nCongresswoman Olympia Snowe to cut the ribbon of the new clinic. As the \nfirst community based outpatient clinic of its kind in the United \nStates, the Caribou clinic served as the proving ground upon which the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, has built a nationwide health care \nsystem that delivers much improved access to care for America's rural \nveterans. Today nearly 3.5 million veterans, approximately 41 percent \nof those enrolled in the VA health care system, live in rural areas, \nmany of whom receive care at more than 800 community based outpatient \nclinics.\n  The history of the CBOC in Caribou, however, began long before the \nribbon cutting, when seven Aroostook County veterans dedicated \nthemselves to the mission of improving access to critical health care \nservices to the veterans living in their communities. To accomplish \nthis goal, they established the Aroostook County Veterans Medical \nFacility Research and Development, Inc. The initial members were Percy \nThibeault, Meo Bosse, John Rowe, Ray Guerrette, Wesley Adams, Walter \nCorey, and Leonard Woods, Sr.\n  Over a span of 8 years, they committed themselves to convincing the \nVA to establish a veterans' health clinic in Caribou. They were joined \nalong the way by other concerned veterans, community members, the Cary \nMedical Center, and a number of Maine veterans service organizations. \nTheir initiative paid off 8 years later, and today, on the 25th \nanniversary of their historic accomplishment, they deserve to be \nrecognized. Our veterans in rural areas throughout the United States \nbenefit today from the dedication of this landmark work. CBOCs are a \nvital part of veteran health services today.\n  These exemplary seven men battled to ensure that health care services \nwere available to every veteran living in rural areas. That battle, \ndespite the VA's best efforts, goes on.\n  Rural areas are still underserved in the types of medical treatment \navailable. In some cases CBOCs don't even have permanent physicians \nassigned. The Iraq and Afghan wars have created a new generation of \ncombat veterans, many of whom have new medical needs including \nprosthetic medical treatments, mental health care, and extensive \nphysical therapy needs.\n  I am encouraged by the VA's renewed commitment to rural health care, \nand the $250 million that VA is allocating for programs for rural \ncommunities. But I would urge the VA to do more, and expand one program \nin particular, the Access Received Closer to Home, ARCH, project. ARCH \nhas been tremendously popular in all five of the communities where the \npilot program was established. Given Caribou's history, it is \nespecially fitting that Caribou CBOC was selected as one of the five \nlocations.\n  Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country. We owe them all \nthat we can to ensure they receive the best care possible. The seven \nmen who fought for the Caribou CBOC knew that, and we honor their \ndedication to their fellow veterans by carrying on their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4148-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4148-S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO PAT BRUCE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pat \nBruce for being presented with the Bureau of Land Management's, BLM, \n``Making a Difference'' National Volunteer Award. Mr. Bruce, a \nvolunteer with the BLM Winnemucca District Black Rock Field Office, has \nbeen awarded for his outstanding volunteer service and leadership to \npreserve and maintain the Silver State's wilderness areas. I am proud \nto honor a Nevadan who is dedicated to giving back to our community to \ncreate a better and brighter tomorrow.\n  As the field project coordinator for the Friends of Nevada \nWilderness, Mr. Bruce has dedicated 6 years to organizing volunteer \nprojects within wilderness areas in the Black Rock Desert, which span \nover 1 million acres of BLM lands. Hiking in remote areas, Mr. Bruce \nmaps routes and boundaries to create an assessment of current ground \nconditions. He is also a volunteer supervisor for nonwilderness \nprojects which include the restoration and protection of BLM's Black \nRock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation \nArea.\n  The Silver State is home to vast wildlands and wildlife, which are \nvital to the character of our State. As a life long Nevadan and an avid \noutdoorsman, I was raised to respect and appreciate our State's natural \nsurroundings and abundant wildlife. I first enjoyed these great Nevada \ntreasures with my father and have since passed that same respect and \nappreciation along to my children.\n  I understand the importance of good stewardship and appreciate Mr. \nBruce's dedication to protecting and maintaining Nevada's lands. I am \nproud to represent him in the Senate and applaud\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nhim for his efforts to provide future generations of Nevadans the same \nrecreational opportunities we enjoy. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Mr. Bruce for his commitment to Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING OAKHURST DAIRY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in honor of June being National \nDairy Month, I rise today to recognize Oakhurst Dairy, located in \nPortland, ME, for supplying New England with essential vitamins and \nnutrients. Through its sale of refrigerated milk and dairy products, \nOakhurst is committed to producing the highest quality goods sourced \nfrom over 70 local farms throughout Maine and northern New England.\n  National Dairy Month began in 1937 in an effort to promote the \nimmense benefits derived from milk and to stabilize the dairy demand \nduring surplus production. Calcium, potassium, protein, and vitamins A \nand D are just a few of the indispensable nutrients found in dairy \nproducts that help reduce the risk for hypertension, osteoporosis, and \ncertain cancers, while also helping improve weight management, muscle \ntissue repair, and healthy skin. Although this national campaign only \nlasts for the month of June, the family-owned Oakhurst Dairy is \nconstantly working to increase awareness of the necessity of these \nnutrients through community integration and product innovation in \nnorthern New England.\n  Stanley Bennett purchased the Portland dairy farm in 1921, naming the \ncompany after a grove of Oak trees found nearby. He promised to provide \nonly the freshest quality products to all of his customers and \nestablished the trend of supporting the local community and the \nenvironment, practices which still hold true today. Oakhurst Dairy \nembodies the ideals of entrepreneurialism and encourages this spirit in \nothers by resourcing products from small local farms to create their \nmilks, dairy creams, cheeses, and juices. These products are then \ndistributed to a variety of retailers, including chain grocery stores, \nand small independent grocery stores, and to foodservice outlets such \nas schools and restaurants.\n  Oakhurst understands the importance of providing for its employees \nand in the 1940s became one of the first businesses in southern Maine \nto initiate company-paid medical insurance and deferred profit-sharing \nplans. Since that time, Oakhurst has been devoted to providing for the \ncommunity at all levels. On the corporate level, every year Oakhurst \npledges 10 percent of pretax profits to organizations supporting \nhealthy children and a healthy environment. This company also inspires \nfuture generations by giving out numerous scholarships for academic \nachievements and even promotes the future of the milk industry by \nsponsoring 4 H dairy program awards given at agricultural fairs. On the \nindividual level, employees are encouraged to donate their time to \nfundraising events for nonprofit organizations and are often found \nserving on local boards, dedicating their leadership skills to inspire \nvaluable changes.\n  The third generation of the Bennett family has continued to keep \nOakhurst thriving, which now employs nearly 240 people. In addition to \nits headquarters in Portland, there are three distribution facilities \nlocated in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, each operating to \nguarantee healthy lives in the communities they serve. Oakhurst Dairy--\ncontinuously seeking to improve the dairy industry--has recently began \nfortifying their products with beneficial additives such as probiotics \nand Omega-3, which improve digestion, cardiovascular health, and boost \nimmunity. In addition to product innovation, Oakhurst Dairy has made \nseveral truly outstanding achievements, including perfect scores from \nFederal quality and sanitation inspections, and State awards such as \nthe 2011 Maine Restaurant Association's Allied Member of the Year and \nthe 2010 Maine Grocers Association's Vendor of the Year.\n  In addition, Oakhurst Dairy insists on making green initiatives a top \npriority in an effort to minimize their impact on the environment. \nWithin the last decade, the company has largely reduced carbon dioxide \nemissions and offset fuel oil usage by transforming nearly the entire \nshipping fleet into biodiesel fuel trucks and installing solar panels \nin several of its facilities. As a means to ensure product safety and \ncustomer satisfaction, Oakhurst became one of the first companies in \nthe U.S. to offer financial incentives to partnering farms for \nabstaining from treating their cows with artificial growth hormones. \nOakhurst continues this practice of avoiding growth hormone additives \nthrough their trademarked America's First Farmer's Pledge.\n  Oakhurst Dairy continues to flourish, even in difficult economic \ntimes, thanks to its commitment to innovation and service. Year after \nyear, Oakhurst Dairy has cultivated a winning strategy through its \ntradition of public service, safeguarding the environment, and keeping \nNew England healthy. As a strong advocate for dairy farm protection, I \nam proud to extend my best wishes to the entire Oakhurst Dairy \noperation for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4149-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC 6480.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 3289. A bill to expand the Medicaid home and community-based \nservices waiver to include young individuals who are in need of \nservices that would otherwise be required to be provided through a \npsychiatric residential treatment facility, and to change references in \nFederal law to mental retardation to references to an intellectual \ndisability; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year nearly 3 million youth receive \nmental health services to address a range of issues including \ndepression, severe mental illness, and suicide prevention. When youth \nwith mental health needs are treated early, with the most appropriate \ncare for their situation, they are more likely to have positive \noutcomes during both their childhood and their adult life.\n  I have worked with my colleague Senator Grassley on a bipartisan bill \nthat will expand the Medicaid 1915(c) waiver to provide an option to \nserve children and adolescents with intensive home or community-based \ntreatment services in lieu of being treated as inpatients in a \npsychiatric residential treatment facility. There are currently nine \nStates participating in a 1915(c) waiver demonstration focused on \nchildren and adolescents, which expires in September of this year. Data \nhas shown that the youth served through this demonstration waiver have \nhad positive outcomes, have been able to stabilize, and have had \nsignificant improvement in mental and behavioral health. The waiver \ngives States more flexibility to offer the most appropriate mental \nhealth services for children on Medicaid. Without access to intensive \nhome or community-based services, these children could otherwise be \ninstitutionalized. The waiver expansion will allow more States the \nopportunity to provide cost-effective care that best meets their \nchildren's mental health needs.\n  In addition, this bill officially removes the outdated term \n``mentally retarded'' from the Social Security Act and replaces it with \nthe phrase ``intellectually disabled''. In 2010, the President enacted \nthe bipartisan Rosa's Law which removed the words ``mentally retarded'' \nfrom federal health, education and labor laws. This bill takes the \nnecessary step of removing this obsolete term from a significant \nportion of the U.S. Code.\n  I would like to recognize Youth Villages, which has been integral to \nthe development of this legislation. More than 30 organizations are \nsupportive of this bill, including the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the American Association of People with \nDisabilities, American Psychiatric Association, Bazelon Center for \nMental Health Law, Child Welfare League of America, First Focus \nCampaign for Children, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National \nCouncil on Independent Living, and the Arc of the United States.\n  I look forward to continued progress in improving mental health \ntreatment options for our youth and ask all of my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/13/senate-section/article/S4153-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2404.
