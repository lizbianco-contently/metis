Mr. President, Americans have been very clear about where \nthey stand on the Republicans' budget proposal: They reject it soundly, \nand for many reasons. But the most glaring reason is the effort to \nchange Medicare as we know it. No wonder. It ends a successful program \nthat has saved seniors from illness and poverty for over four decades--\nmillions of them.\n  Their so-called budget is nothing more than an ideological plan to \nshift the burden to seniors, who can least afford it, in an effort to \nput the insurance companies between senior patients and their doctors. \nWith all due respect to the ranking member of the Budget Committee here \nin the Senate, pointing the finger at Democrats, as he has done, will \nnot erase the fact they plan to end the Medicare Program as we know it \nand like it.\n  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents feel the same way, and no \namount of political distortions or distractions will change that. Only \nwhen Republicans agree to take cuts to Medicare off the table can we \nhave a serious discussion about how we can move forward in our battle \nto decrease the deficit.\n  Republicans claim only sacrifices from seniors will balance the \nbudget. We disagree. Yet they protect tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires. They protect the billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded \nhandouts to oil companies making record profits. The Republican plan \nwill put insurance company bureaucrats between seniors and their \ndoctors. It would force each senior, for example, to pay $6,400 more \neach year for health care.\n  Breaking our promise to seniors, while wealthy oil companies and \nbillionaires get a pass, is simply too high a price to pay. We need to \nstrengthen Medicare for the millions of seniors who count on it every \nday, and preserve it for our children and grandchildren, not cut \nseniors' benefits.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks, Americans have \ngotten what seems like a daily\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\ndose of bad news about the state of the economy. Whether it is more \njoblessness, threats from ratings agencies, the price of gasoline, \ngoods and housing, or a slowdown in manufacturing, people are finding \nvery little reason for optimism, and they are getting little comfort \nfrom an administration that seems more interested in deflecting the bad \nnews than facing up to it. Amidst the onslaught of bad news last week, \nPresident Obama's message was that we had hit some bumps in the road--\nwe had hit some bumps in the road--and that people need to be patient \nin the face of what he called economic ``headwinds.'' He even joked \nabout the wildly mistaken predictions he and others at the White House \nhad made a few years back about the job-creating potential of the \nstimulus.\n  Well, I don't think the 14 million Americans who are looking for jobs \nright now find any of this very funny. I don't think the 23 percent of \nAmericans who now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are \nworth are laughing about their predicament. I don't think recent \ncollege graduates, who are burdened with tens of thousands of dollars \nin student loan debt and who can't find a job, are amused that the \nstimulus turned out to be a failure.\n\n  In fact, I think Americans are deeply troubled by the fact that an \nadministration which claims to be concerned about creating jobs has \nspent the better part of the past 2\\1/2\\ years--the better part of the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years--pushing policies that seem as though they were \ndesigned to destroy jobs instead. Indeed, I think there is a growing \nconsensus out there that, far from improving the economy, the President \nhas made it worse.\n  The facts speak for themselves. The day the President took office, 12 \nmillion Americans were out of work. Today, nearly 14 million Americans \nare out of work. That is a 17-percent increase in the unemployment rate \nunder President Obama. So employment is clearly worse.\n  Gas prices have nearly doubled. When the President came into office, \nthe average price of a gallon of gas in the country was $1.85. Today, \nit is $3.69. So gas prices have gotten worse.\n  The national debt has reached crisis levels. In the last 2 years, the \ndebt has gone from $10.6 trillion to $14.3 trillion--a 35-percent \nincrease from when the President was sworn into office. And his own \nbudget projects it will only continue to grow. So the debt is far \nworse.\n  Health insurance premiums have gone up. For more than a year, the \nPresident devoted what seemed like every waking moment to a health care \nproposal that he said would lower health insurance premiums by as much \nas $2,500. Instead, health premiums for working families continue to \nrise, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says they will \ncontinue to grow by as much as $2,100 per year. So health insurance \ncosts have gotten worse.\n  Home values continue to plummet too. In my State of Kentucky, home \nprices have fallen about 7 percent in the last year, while new home \nconstruction is down almost 15 percent. I have constituents with \nexcellent credit telling me they can't get a mortgage because of new \nlending rules that have made it hard even for people who have worked \nfor years and built a stellar credit rating to even get a loan. \nNationally, home values have gone down 12 percent since Inauguration \nDay. So home values have gotten worse too, driving down the equity \npeople have built over many years.\n  When it comes to policy, the President is fond of dividing the world \ninto two camps. In his view, those who disagree with him are on the \nwrong side of history. Those who agree are on the right side. Well, at \nthis point, I think most Americans agree if this is the right side of \nhistory, they are not interested; they would rather have their jobs \nback.\n  At this point, I think it is safe to say the patience of the American \npeople has run out. Administration officials made a lot of promises of \na brighter future. They have had their chance to deliver. Americans \ndon't have infinite patience. They do not want to be told to wait a \nlittle longer when all the evidence shows that their circumstances and \ntheir prospects are only getting worse. They want a change in \ndirection.\n  One of the liberal think tanks in town recently issued a press \nrelease that I think embodies the disconnect between Democrats in \nWashington and the experience of most people outside of Washington. In \nthe face of all the bad economic news we have been getting, this \nparticular think tank announced it had 10 charts which purported to \nshow that, contrary to the claims of some, the United States is \nactually a low-tax country.\n  Never mind the fact that we have the second highest corporate tax \nrate in the world; never mind the fact that nearly 14 million Americans \nare out of work; never mind the fact that the time it takes out-of-work \nAmericans to find a new job is now longer than it was during the Great \nDepression--and that since the housing crisis began, average home \nvalues have fallen more dramatically than they did even during the \nGreat Depression. Never mind all that. These guys have 10 charts they \nwant to show you that prove government should take more money out of \nthe hands of taxpayers so they can spend it themselves.\n  I think this is all you need to know about the Democratic approach to \nthe economy. It never seems to change. Take almost any major economic \nindicator you want, Americans are worse off than they were in 2009. It \nis time Democrats wake up to this fact. It is time they do something to \nsolve these problems and help the people right in front of them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3788-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, these past few weeks I have been coming to \nthe floor to talk about the size and scope of our Nation's fiscal \nproblems. It has been said often that this is the most predictable \ncrisis we have ever faced, and I believe that is true.\n  I have talked about how the tremendous growth of government has \nlimited the ability of small businesses to create jobs. I have noted \nthe severe and dramatic cuts Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security \nwill face if we do not act now to reform those programs. I have also \npointed out how the Draconian cuts would need to be paired with \npainful, job-crushing tax hikes.\n  Simultaneously, the interest we pay on that debt will take up an \never-increasing share of our revenue. In fact, it has already been \nnoted that in a few short years the interest on the debt alone would \nexceed the amount we spend on national security. In other words, we \nwould spend more paying for the amount of money we borrow in the form \nof interest than we spend defending the country. At some point, \nbondholders are going to recognize that we don't have an ability to pay \nout these bonds, and they will demand increasingly higher interest \nrates. This in turn sends our interest rates even higher in a vicious \nspiral.\n  However, what I would like to focus on today is to talk about how \nnone of this is necessary. So how do we prevent this from happening? I \nbelieve the solutions we need fall into three broad categories: We need \nreforms to our budget processes, and that includes, one, a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution; we need caps on overall and \ndiscretionary spending; and we need entitlement reform.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  In the 1990s, the Senate was within just one vote of passing a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I can't help but think \njust how different our country's fiscal situation would be if that \namendment had been approved.\n  We now have two different balanced budget amendment proposals put \nforward this year. I cosponsored both of them. I had the opportunity to \nlead a working group of my fellow Republican Senators to discuss these \nproposals and to help find the best parts of each. From those \ndiscussions and others, we were able to come together with the Hatch-\nLee balanced budget amendment, of which every single member of the \nRepublican conference is a cosponsor. This important amendment requires \nthe budget to be balanced every year, except for when there is a \ndeclared war. A supermajority would be required to waive this \nprovision. This amendment puts the emphasis on controlling spending, \nwhich is the real cause of our debt and deficits. It requires \nsupermajorities to raise taxes, and it prevents spending from exceeding \n18 percent of our GDP, 18 percent of our entire national output, which \nhas been the historical level of taxation for our country.\n  Not only do we need to balance our budget but we need to ensure that \nevery dollar is being spent in the most efficient way possible. We need \nto be honest about the cost of this spending and to create processes \nthat will prevent wasteful, unnecessary, and excessive spending. In \norder to do this, we need a number of budget reforms in addition to the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I have introduced the Deficit Reduction and Budget Reform Act, which \nhas a number of reforms to the budget process we use today.\n  The bill reforms the pay-go rules to prevent the double-counting \ngimmicks that get used around here all too frequently, and it makes the \nFederal budget a binding joint resolution signed into law by the \nPresident--something that doesn't happen today with our budget.\n  It moves us into a biennial budget timeline, which leaves more time \nfor oversight. As everybody knows, we are supposed to do a budget at \nleast every year. We haven't done one now for 777 days. So the notion \nthat we do a budget every year may be somewhat an antiquated one, but \nwe are supposed to do a budget every single year. Because of that, we \nspend an awful lot of time going through the budget process, doing all \nthe appropriations bills, and it doesn't allow very much time for \noversight, which is a function that I think we have a responsibility to \ndo. So if we went to a biennial budget--in other words, if we did a \nbudget every other year--if we did the spending, the budget, and the \nappropriations bills in the odd-numbered years, then in the even-\nnumbered years when people have to go home to run for reelection, we \ncould actually focus on oversight. We could look for ways not to spend \nmoney but to save money.\n  I have been a big advocate of biennial budgeting--doing a budget \nevery other year, 2-year budgeting--for some time. A number of States \ndo it that way. I think it is important we make that reform so we have \nthe appropriate time to do the level of oversight that is required and \nis so desperately missing around here today, which is why we end up \nhaving so many government agencies with so much duplication, so much \nredundancy, and so much overlap that leads to wasteful spending on \nbehalf of the American taxpayers.\n  My budget reform would also create a legislative line-item veto. My \nGovernor in South Dakota has that, and I believe the President should \ntoo. In fact, I think most Governors across this country have some sort \nof mechanism that allows them to veto extraneous spending measures. I \nbelieve the President ought to have that power, and it needs to be done \nin a way, of course, that is consistent with the Constitution, and a \nlegislative line-item veto would meet that test. It prevents the abuse \nof emergency spending designations which have been used to pass \nhundreds of billions of dollars in deficit spending since the last time \nwe passed a budget resolution.\n  It creates a new CLASS Act trigger to make sure that program is \nsolvent over the 75-year timeframe.\n  I think most of my colleagues know that the CLASS Act is a new long-\nterm care entitlement program that was enacted as part of the health \ncare reform bill last year. It, similar to so many other government \nprograms, relies upon premiums that will be paid in the early years, \nwhich actually show revenues coming into the Treasury which are then \ncounted and used to pay for other things--in this case, the health care \nbill. But at some point in the future, when the demands come for those \nbenefits that people have subscribed for, it becomes a liability \nbecause the funds, the revenues that have come into that program in the \nearly years have already been spent. Again, it leads to more and more \nborrowing. That is what the Congressional Budget Office has said would \nhappen with the CLASS Act.\n  To make sure that program is going to stay on the books--and, by the \nway, I have a piece of legislation to repeal it because I think it is \nvery bad policy and I think it is going to put our country into an even \ndeeper fiscal hole. But that being said, if it is going to stay on the \nbooks, we ought to have a mechanism to ensure the program is solvent \nover the 75-year timeframe. My legislation would do that.\n  Likewise, it modifies the Medicare cost containment trigger to have \nhonest accounting with respect to revenues and savings in the new \nhealth care bill, and it updates the Credit Reform Act to score the \npurchases of debt, stock, equity, and capital using a discount rate \nthat incorporates market risk. Whenever the Government gets into the \nbusiness of acquiring debt, stock equity, those sorts of things--and \nthat hasn't happened, as you know, in the last few years--it needs to \nbe accounted for honestly by using real discount rates that make market \nrisk part of that calculation. Today, that is not necessarily the case \nwhen those calculations are made.\n  It also creates a new standing joint committee of Congress for budget \ndeficit reduction. It might interest my colleagues to know--sometimes \nwe forget about this around here--we have 26 committees and \nsubcommittees in Congress that spend tax dollars. We do not have one \nthat focuses on saving tax dollars. We need a committee that is \nexclusively committed to reducing the cost of spending, to saving tax \ndollars as opposed to spending them. With 26 committees and \nsubcommittees around here that spend money, it is time we had one to \nsave money.\n  The joint committee would be responsible to produce a bill to cut the \ndeficit by at least 10 percent every budget cycle and to do it without \nraising taxes. It would be a standing committee that would continue to \nfight government spending, would even issue recommendations to cut \nspending by at least 10 percent, even in years when the budget is \nbalanced. It has been a long time since we have seen that around here. \nThat probably is not going to happen in the foreseeable future. I \ncertainly hope it does. But in any case, my legislation would require, \neven in years when the budget is balanced, that we be looking for ways \nto cut spending.\n  Importantly, these recommendations would be assured of an up-or-down \nvote in Congress. This committee would make its recommendation each \nyear, and my legislation would require expedited consideration on the \nSenate floor; in other words, to ensure it gets an up-or-down vote and \ndoesn't languish somewhere similar to so many reports that come out of \nvarious committees. This committee would actually have the authority to \nput a product out on the floor of the Senate and to ensure it gets a \nvote.\n  Finally, what my bill would do is freeze and cap spending, the third \naction we need to take in order to get spending under control. This \nbill would institute a 10-year spending freeze at 2008 levels adjusted \nfor inflation. After all, between 2008 and 2010, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending increased by 24 percent while inflation in the \noverall economy was just over 2 percent. The Federal Government, in the \nlast couple years, between 2008 and 2010, was spending literally over \n10 times the rate of inflation. How can you go to the American taxpayer \nwith a straight face and explain that? We need to go back to those 2008 \nlevels and freeze it there, cap it there, and then allow for \nadjustments for inflation. But let's go back and negate this 24-percent \nincrease we have seen just in the last couple years.\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\n  The recent continuing resolution that was passed by Congress started \nto put downward pressure on these accounts, but more needs to be done. \nMy colleagues, Senators Corker and McCaskill, have introduced what they \ncall the CAP Act, which would put our spending on a downward glidepath \nso we do not spend more than our historical average of 20.6 percent of \nGDP. For the last 40 years, spending on the Federal Government has \naveraged 10.6 percent of our total economy. That represents all Federal \nspending. It doesn't represent State and local government spending, but \nFederal spending, percentagewise, on average, for the past 40 years has \nequaled 20.6 percent of our entire economic output.\n  This year we are in the 24- to 25-percent range. Now we have gone \nfrom spending one-fifth of our entire economy on the Federal Government \nto spending about one-quarter of our entire economy on the Government. \nThat, to me, is something that needs to be reined in. There has been a \nhuge ramp-up of spending in terms of our economy.\n  What that means is, the private economy, as a percentage of our \nentire economy, is getting smaller and the government component of that \nis getting larger. We need to get that back on a more historical and \nwhat should be a realistic course.\n  There are at least three different possible proposals to cap \nspending: the 18 percent included in the constitutional amendment, the \nCAP Act, which I just mentioned, and my own proposal to cap \ndiscretionary spending. These caps are necessary to signal to the \nmarkets we are serious about cutting spending.\n  Finally, we need entitlement reform. The CAP Act and the 18-percent \ncap would both force us to deal with entitlements. I am heartened by \nthe budget working group that is being led by Vice President Biden, in \nthat they are considering some entitlement reforms. I hope they can \nproduce a product that actually will tackle entitlements. We need, at \nthe end of the day, to have the President leading. As I said, I hope \nthis group that has been put together will produce a result that will \ntake us down a path toward tackling runaway entitlement programs.\n  At the end of the day, for any of this to be signed or get enacted, \nwe have to have the President stepping in and providing leadership. So \nfar we have not seen that. The President, in his budget he submitted to \nCongress and a subsequent budget speech he made, has done little, if \nanything, to deal with the issue of entitlement reform.\n  Frankly, you cannot deal with the fiscal problems this country faces, \nthe challenges we face or the deep hole we are in when it comes to \ngetting on a more sustainable course for the future without taking on \nentitlement reform. The President needs to be explaining to Americans \nthe need for entitlement reform and showing us what his plan is to save \nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid, not simply getting out and \ndemagoguing Chairman Ryan's budget and kicking the can further down the \nroad.\n  We know these entitlements already represent $61.6 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities. There is no more road. We have kicked the can as \nfar as possible. It is now time for us to face the reality that we have \nto deal with this and we cannot afford the luxury of waiting any \nlonger.\n  It is clear that action needs to be taken. If the President were to \nstep to the plate, I think we would have a real chance to enact \nsubstantial entitlement reforms that could preserve the important role \nthese programs play.\n  Enacting these three different prongs or these three different \napproaches--one dealing with budget reforms that includes a balanced \nbudget amendment being the first component, spending caps being the \nsecond component on both discretionary and overall spending, and \nentitlement reform--are not going to be easy to do. We have been on \nautopilot around here for a long time. What that has gotten us is \ndeeper and deeper into the fiscal hole, to the point today we are at \n$14 trillion in debt--meaning we are going to have to raise the debt \nlimit in the very near future--and growing by the day. The amount it \ngrows by the day, interestingly, is $4 billion. Between this time and \n10:40 tomorrow, we will borrow another $4 billion that we will add to \nthe debt of our children. That represents more than we spend in my home \nState of South Dakota for an entire year; $4 billion, the amount we \nborrow every single day at the Federal level exceeds the amount the \nState of South Dakota spends in an entire year. That is the dimension \nof the problem we were dealing with.\n\n  There are three very important numbers people need to focus on to \nremind ourselves how critical it is that we act. One is forty-two. That \nis the cents out of every $1 we borrow. Forty-two cents out of every $1 \nthis government spends today is borrowed. That is a staggering \nstatistic. The other number is 93. Ninety-three is the number now that \nrepresents the percentage of our entire economic output that is \nrepresented by our gross debt. In other words, our debt to GDP, our \ndebt to total economic output ratio is 93 percent. That is the danger \nzone. Historical research has demonstrated, when you get a debt-to-GDP \nratio that exceeds 90 percent, you are losing 1 percentage point of \neconomic growth every single year. One percentage point of economic \ngrowth translates into 1 million lost jobs. So every year we continue \non this path of sustaining this level of debt as a percentage of our \nentire economic output, we are bleeding 1 million jobs in our economy, \ncosting us 1 percentage point of economic growth. That is a very real \nand immediate impact from the amount of spending and the amount of debt \nwe have.\n  The final number I think is important for people to understand too, a \nnumber I mentioned earlier, is the 777 number. That is the number of \ndays that have passed since Congress passed a budget. I know it is very \nhard around here, particularly in the present circumstances, to find \nconsensus on a path forward to pass a budget. But we have a \nresponsibility to the American taxpayers, when we are spending \nliterally $3.7 to $3.8 trillion every single year, to at least let them \nknow how we are going to spend their money. We have not done a budget \nin 777 days.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. We have not had a markup. There is \nno indication we will have a markup. There is no indication we are \ngoing to do a budget. We have already blown past all the deadlines the \nlaw requires when it comes to doing a budget. We didn't do a budget in \nthe last Congress. I think what that does is it makes it even more \ncomplicated to address these issues. If you do not have an overall \nframework, if you do not have a construct or understanding of what it \nis going to take to get our books back in order, then it is going to be \nvery difficult.\n  Sometimes around here we do not have enough teeth in the laws we pass \nwhen it comes to budgeting. We do not have enough enforcement \nmechanisms. I am proposing provisions in the budget reforms to add \nenforcement mechanisms to cure that. But even with that, you at least \nhave to have a plan. You at least have to have a blueprint, a path for \nhow you are going to spend $3.7 trillion of the American taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  I urge my colleagues, the majority, to put forward a budget. At least \nlet's debate it. Let's talk about priorities. Let's have a debate, \ndebate amendments, but let's do a budget or reform the budget process \nalong the lines I suggested so we get a process in place that enables \nus to make some headway, to make some progress toward dealing with this \nrunaway debt and these runaway deficits that are going to not only \ncrush our economy in the near term but put an unfair burden on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Right now, the things most Americans are worried about are spending, \ndebt, jobs, the economy, and they are all connected. The level of \nspending and debt is something that needs to be gotten under control to \nget the economy growing and prospering again, so you don't have the \nFederal Government out there competing with the private economy when it \ncomes to capital. Small businesses need capital to invest to create \njobs. When the government is crowding that out, it makes it more \ndifficult. There are so many adverse economic implications from the \ndebt levels we are sustaining today that are going to make it \nincreasingly difficult, the longer we stay deeper and deeper in the \nred, for this economy to recover and grow. That is fundamental to all \nthis.\n  When it comes to jobs and the economy, we also have to have policies \nthat\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nencourage economic growth. I know the President talks a lot about jobs \nand the economy. He certainly is rhetorically, at least I believe, \nsaying the right things out there. But you have to have actions that \nare consistent with the rhetoric. If you look at the President's \nrecord, we have not seen that. The reason we have not seen that is \nbecause the policies are all adverse to economic growth and job \ncreation, whether it is regulations coming out of agencies, whether it \nis the new mandates imposed by the health care reform bill, whether it \nis the out-of-control spending and debt and no attempt to address the \nlong-term challenges we face there, particularly entitlement reform, \nwhether it is the new taxes that have been imposed through the \nlegislation that has been enacted since this President has come into \noffice. But if you look at the economic record, if you look at \nunemployed Americans since this President took office, we have almost 2 \nmillion more unemployed Americans. The unemployment rate has gone up 17 \npercent. Fuel prices, which impact everybody's pocketbook in this \ncountry, since this President took office, have gone up by over 100 \npercent, over a 100-percent increase in the price per gallon of \ngasoline since this President took office. The debt has gone up 35 \npercent. The debt per person in this country has gone up $11,000 per \nperson. That is the amount the debt has increased since this President \ntook office. Food stamp recipients are up 39 percent. Health insurance \npremiums--despite the promises of what health care reform would do to \nlower insurance premiums--health insurance premiums have gone up 19 \npercent since this President took office. The only thing that has gone \ndown since he took office is home values. Home values are down 12 \npercent. That is the economic record. That is the composite record. Of \ncourse, we can all say things, but we have to be judged by what we do. \nWe cannot judge people by what they say. We have to judge them by what \nthey do.\n\n  I hope the President will decide it is time for him and for his \nadministration and for his leadership to focus on policies that will be \nconducive to economic growth, that will enable that, rather than make \nit more expensive and more difficult to create jobs, which are the \npolicies that are being employed by this administration. That applies \nto so many areas. It is developing domestic energy resources, so we can \nget more American supply of energy and start driving that price down. \nSo many areas are off-limits. Even more have gone off-limits since this \nPresident took office. It means getting trade bills enacted. We have \nheard now for several years the President talk about how we need to \npass the Colombia, Panama, and South Korea Free Trade Agreements. Yet \nthey languish. They have not been submitted to us. We are ready to act. \nWe have said repeatedly these are important to our economy.\n  I have used this example on the floor before, but just one brief data \npoint for agriculture. I represent an agricultural State, so we are \nalways looking for opportunities to export. In wheat, corn, and \nsoybeans exports, we had an 81-percent share of the Colombia market in \n2008. In 2010, that had dropped to 27 percent. We have literally been \nlocked out of that market because this free-trade agreement has \nlanguished in Congress and, as a consequence, other countries have \nstepped in to fill the void. Now you have the Canadians, the Europeans, \nthe Australians stepping in and picking up the slack and we continue to \nlose more and more market share, which means more and more lost jobs in \nthe American economy. So it is about trade policies, tax policies, \nenergy policies, regulatory policies and spending and debt. Those are \nthe things, in my view, that will get this economy back on track, start \ncreating jobs, create a better and brighter and more prosperous future \nfor future generations of Americans. Unfortunately, the policies being \nemployed by this administration are making it worse, and at least \naccording to this economic record, much worse. We can do better. We \nshould do better by the American people, and I hope we will find the \npolitical will to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3791-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3791-S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fiscal crisis \nfacing our country and specifically the dire financial situation of \nMedicare, which is a program that matters so much to tens of millions \nof senior Americans but also adds so much to our national debt. I wish \nto talk about some ideas I have about how we might effectively deal \nwith this problem in Medicare, particularly, without doing away with \nthe Medicare Program because I believe in it.\n  If I can start on a broader level, briefly. It is hard to find \nanybody in Congress in any party who does not acknowledge that our \nFederal Government is hurtling toward the edge of a financial cliff. We \nare now running deficits in this year of over $1 trillion. That means \nwe are spending $1 trillion more than we are taking in so we have to \nborrow that money, and at some point we are going to reach a level of \nborrowing that is unsustainable. It will send our economy hurtling \ndown, will bring us into another great recession, will compromise our \nability to provide the security and services to the people of our \ncountry that it is our responsibility to provide. To avoid that \nhorrific result, we have to show some responsibility and work across \nparty lines to get some things done. None of this is easy.\n  Almost everybody will say we have a terrible financial problem in the \nGovernment, debt, deficit, but when you get to the solutions, there has \nbeen an outbreak of what I call Federal Government NIMBYism. Everybody \ntalks about NIMBY at the State and local level--Not In My Back Yard; \nthis is a great program, but I do not want it in my neighborhood. The \nFederal Government budget crisis we are in, NIMBYism seems to be not my \nprogram or not my favorite tax credit. You can cut other stuff but not \nwhat I am in favor of.\n  We have one group saying no tax increases whatsoever, even indirect \nthrough the elimination of tax credits, which is spending money, and \ntax credits can be as wasteful an expenditure of the taxpayers' money \nas a wasteful spending program can be. On the other side, we have \npeople saying: Not my program. You cannot touch it. You cannot even try \nto make it more efficient. It is just too good or it is too politically \npopular or whatever. If we keep going down that road, we are not going \nto get anything done.\n  The main hope of our result in the next couple months is the small \nbipartisan, bicameral leadership group that is being presided over by \nVice President Biden. I think anytime any of us comes out and says: No, \nwe cannot do this, we cannot have a tax increase of any kind, we cannot \neven eliminate wasteful tax credits, and on the other side people say, \nwe cannot touch Medicare, for instance, it, one, shackles the hands of \nVice President Biden as he tries to solve this problem, and it also \nmeans, more generally, that we are not fulfilling our responsibility. \nThat is the case with Medicare. The fact is, those who say you cannot \ndo anything with Medicare, just will not support it, are not doing a \nfavor to the Medicare Program.\n  Congressman Paul Ryan, in the House, put forth his own budget, \nincluding a Medicare reform program. I said when he did it, I want to \nlook at it in more detail, but I gave him credit to put something so \ncomprehensive out because it is going to take that kind of guts by all \nof us to save our great country from going over the edge of the cliff, \nfrom going into permanent decline, from making it impossible for our \nchildren and grandchildren and beyond to have the opportunities we have \nhad.\n  When I looked at the Ryan plan, particularly on Medicare, I decided I \nwas not for it. When it came to the Senate, I voted against it. That \nwas the case, generally, when it came up in the Senate and the vote on \nthe Ryan budget. But one cannot just stop there and say no, which is a \npopular vote on a Medicare reform proposal. I think any of us \nresponsibly have to then come forward with our own ideas. That is why, \nlast week, I indicated in a newspaper op-ed column that I would be \nputting some proposals forward that will save Medicare, that will \nprotect Medicare as a Government program of health insurance for senior \nAmericans but will change the program. Anybody who\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\ntells you Paul Ryan is going to kill Medicare as we know it, there is \nanother way to kill Medicare as we know it, which is to do nothing to \ntry to save it.\n  We cannot save Medicare as it exists today. There are a couple of \nstatistics. In 2010, the Medicare Program cost $523 billion. The \nestimates I have seen are consensus, not extreme estimates, that within \nthe next 10 years that number will double to over $1 trillion for \nMedicare. Where are we going to get the money to pay for that? That is \ngoing to add to the national deficit and the national debt. Part of \nwhat is happening is the baby boomers are coming of age and Medicare \neligibility--15 million in the coming years coming into this program.\n  I will give you another general statistic. All the studies I have \nseen show--most people do not appreciate this, if I can say, the \naverage Medicare participant over their lifetime will actually cost the \nsystem in benefits three times what we put in through premiums, \nwithdrawals, et cetera. So this program is on an unsustainable course. \nI think if you want to save Medicare, you have to be willing to change \nit. You cannot say do not touch Medicare. I must say I am disappointed \nwhen I hear people say that.\n\n  Here are some of the ideas I am working on legislation to propose. \nThe plan I outlined last week, and I am putting into legislation, I \nthink will extend the solvency of the Medicare Part A, a big program \nfor hospital care. It will lower the Federal Government's financial \ncommitments to the Part B Program for doctor services and, most \nimportantly, it will keep the Medicare Program alive and serving \nAmerica's senior citizens for at least 20 years and when we get it \nestimated, probably by a lot more.\n  A lot of the proposals I made--and I have five key parts of it--are \nsimilar to ones that have been made earlier and the Congressional \nBudget Office has made estimates on. My guess, applying existing CBO \nestimates to the ideas I put forward, is they will save $250 billion in \nthe first 10 years and extend the life of the program by at least 20 \nyears, which is 20 more years in which American seniors can depend on \nMedicare to help them pay their health care bills in their senior \nyears.\n  Here is some of what I am proposing. It is controversial. They are \nall controversial. We cannot save Medicare without doing some things \nthat make people unhappy. I am proposing to raise the eligibility age \nof Medicare from 65 to 67, beginning in 2014, by 2 months every year \nuntil it reaches 67 years in 2025. That would put it on the same course \nSocial Security is on now, to go up to 67, which means if you turn 65 \nin 2014, you are going to have to wait an additional 60 days before you \nbecome eligible for Medicare. In my opinion, that is a small price to \npay for the guarantee that you are going to have Medicare to take care \nof your health costs for the rest of your senior years.\n  The reason for this change being necessary is factual. When the \nMedicare Program began in the mid-1960s, the average lifespan of an \nAmerican was a little less than 70 years. Today, the average lifespan \nis 78. Thank God. That means people are obviously living longer. Part \nof why they are living longer is they are getting better health care, \nbut that wonderful fact explains why the average recipient takes three \ntimes as much out of the Medicare system as they put in.\n  I will give you another number that says this in a different way. In \n1965, there were about 4.6 active workers for every Medicare enrollee \nin the program as a senior. In 2005, that went down to 3.8 active \nworkers. The Medicare actuaries tell us, by 2050, that will drop to 2.2 \nworkers for everybody on Medicare at that time, and that means the \nburden on those 2.2 workers is going to be too high. The current math, \ntherefore, is unsustainable, and it is why we have to change the \neligibility age.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, doing so, 65 to 67, \nwill save $125 billion over 10 years. That is a substantial savings, \nwhich will contribute to keeping the program viable and paying bills \nfor seniors.\n  The other thing to say is that for those who fear what will happen to \nthose seniors between 65 and 67 as they wait--some will have their own \nhealth insurance--but we did pass health care reform, and that is going \nto be there to cover those people through the health care exchanges.\n  Second, I am proposing that we reform the complex Medicare benefit \nstructure, which is wasteful, misunderstood, particularly by the \nbeneficiaries and a lot of the providers, and prone to overutilization \nand fraud. That is, prescribing more health services because someone \ndoesn't pay for it, Medicare does--but we all pay for it. The Medicare \nbenefit structure is so confusing and so maligned with various \ndeductibles, copays, cost sharing, caps, fees, forms, and limits that \none would be hard-pressed to find a Medicare enrollee who really \nunderstands how their insurance coverage works. As a result, there is \nenormous waste and excess utilization, with services being paid for by \nthe Medicare Program that are really not needed for the health of the \nindividual. That, again, means more costs for the taxpayers.\n\n  I think we can fix these problems by implementing a single, combined \nPart A and B deductible requiring a copay on all Medicare services and, \nif we choose, we can also do something new, which is create a maximum, \nout-of-pocket benefit that will give seniors peace of mind. In other \nwords, they would only be required to pay up to a certain amount out of \ntheir pockets every year. So it guarantees them that if they have a \nserious illness requiring long-term hospitalization, they are not going \nto be forced into poverty or bankruptcy. This proposal was part of the \nBowles-Simpson report, and it is a good one.\n  Third, I think it is time to reform the premium structure. When \nMedicare was implemented, the premiums paid by the beneficiaries \nsupported 50 percent of the cost of the program. In fact, when \nPresident Johnson signed Medicare into law, he noted that this equal \ncontribution--50 percent from government, 50 percent from the insured--\nwas a critical part of the program. He said:\n\n       And under a separate plan, when you are 65 you may be \n     covered for medical and surgical fees whether you are in or \n     out of the hospital. You will pay $3 per month after you are \n     65 and your government will contribute an equal amount.\n\n  Fifty-fifty.\n  Unfortunately, today, as a result of acts of Congress of various \nkinds--well-intentioned--Medicare enrollee premiums support only 25 \npercent of the cost of the program--half of what they were intended to \nwhen President Johnson signed this extraordinarily progressive and \nbeneficial law into effect. We make up the difference from funds taken \nout of our Federal budget--general revenues. That is part of why \nMedicare contributes to the exploding national deficits and long-term \ndebt.\n  So I am going to propose that we raise premiums for all new enrollees \nin Part B, which is the part that covers doctor expenses, starting in \n2014, so they pay for 35 percent of the program costs instead of 25 \npercent. That will result in around a $40 increase in premiums. The \nfact is there is some indexing based on income in the Part B and Part D \nPrograms, and, therefore, under the current law, the increase from 25 \npercent to 35 percent will be paid by more people of higher income. I \nknow asking anybody to pay more money for anything is not popular, but \nit is needed if we are to address the stranglehold Medicare puts on our \nannual budget and if we are to avoid something even more unpopular, \nwhich is the demise of the Medicare Program as we know it.\n  Fourth, I think we need to reform the way Medigap policies work. \nMedigap policies are insurance policies that cover the gaps in a \nsenior's Medicare coverage. They are designed to pay an enrollee's \ncopays and deductibles so he or she would not be liable for a big \nhospital bill if they ever get sick. But study after study has found \nthat the Medicare enrollees who have a comprehensive Medigap plan that \npays all of the deductible and all of the copays, so the individual \ndoesn't pay anything, use as much as 25 percent more services than \nthose with the traditional Medicare Program, and that is because they \ndon't have any impact on themselves for the utilization of services. \nAgain, who pays for that extra utilization of services? Not the \nindividual Medicare enrollee, the taxpayer, and it is not fair.\n  Fifth, I think we have to increase revenues into the Medicare \nProgram. We just can't save it by adjusting benefits and making changes \nin the premium structure. So I am going to propose that higher income \nAmericans--in\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nthis case defining it as people making over $250,000 a year--contribute \nan additional 1 percent of every dollar of income over $250,000 to save \nMedicare as we know it.\n  That is the outline of my plan. I wanted to come and describe it to \nmy colleagues: We raise the eligibility age; charge a more financially \nsound premium; address overutilization and waste and fraud; and develop \na more reliable funding stream so we can save Medicare, which is a \ngreat program, and which we would not save unless we make some tough \ndecisions.\n  I said earlier I think this proposal will save at least $250 billion \nin the first decade and keep the program alive for 20 years. I was \nencouraged that the very respected Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget said, after I disclosed this plan last week, that they believed \nit would save as much as $325 billion over the next decade and reduce \nspending even more in the following decades.\n  I offer these ideas as a starting point in a discussion we have to \nhave about how we can both extend the solvency and life of Medicare for \nthe seniors who depend on it and reduce our national deficit and debt, \nwhich we will not do unless we reduce the drain on our National \nTreasury that the Medicare Program now represents. I am going to be \ndrafting this as legislation, and I will circulate it to my colleagues. \nI hope it is of some assistance to Vice President Biden and the \nleadership group that is working with him as they prepare proposals to \nget America's ship of state back into fiscal balance.\n  I know all of these are full of political risk, but the refusal of \ndifferent parties of Congress to either cut spending on the one hand or \nraise taxes on the other is exactly why we are in the fiscal mess we \nare in now, and the more we wait to deal with it the harder it is going \nto be. At some point, there is going to be such a disaster that we are \ngoing to have to both impose Draconian cuts in spending and tax \nincreases, and none of us want to do that. The way to avoid that moment \nis to do it now in a methodical and sequenced, longer term way.\n  The fact is, unless we take risks together, the great losers--and \nthose risks have to be across party lines. This has to be a moment when \nwe say to each other across party lines: These are tough votes. I can \ndemagogue this vote, I can go after you in the next election based on \nthis vote, but I am pleading with you to cast this vote, and I will \ncast one that is risky, too, politically, so we can do something good \nfor the country because, if we don't turn away from partisanship and \nturn toward shared responsibility, the big losers are going to be our \ngreat country and the wonderful people who elected us and sent us here \nto lead.

Mr. President, when Gerry Counihan leaves the Senate \nemployment in the next couple of days, we will lose one of the most \nrespected and beloved members of our Senate family. During his nearly \ntwo decades of service with the Senate, he has epitomized the \nprofessionalism, dedication, loyalty, and the incredible work ethic of \nthe best staff members on Capitol Hill. So we are saying farewell not \njust to a wonderful Senate employee but also to a very good friend.\n  Mr. President, Gerry Counihan first came to Capitol Hill in 1991 as a \nmember of John McCain's staff. He later left the Senate for a brief \ntime, but returned in 1997 as a tour guide in the Capitol Building, \nwhere he truly excelled. In fact, Gerry made a bit of history himself. \nHe gave the first public tour following the fatal shooting of two \nCapitol police officers in 1998. When the Capitol reopened to visitors \nfollowing the attacks of September 11, 2001, Gerry again led the first \ntour of the Capitol.\n  Four years ago, sadly, Gerry was the victim of a violent crime and \nsustained very grave injuries. He spent over 4 weeks at the National \nRehabilitation Hospital. It was a long and courageous struggle to learn \nto walk and speak again. But he persevered and succeeded.\n  Unfortunately, Gerry was not able to return to his job as a tour \nguide because of his injuries, but he was hired by the Sergeant at Arms \nto work as one of our elevator operators. That is where I and so many \nother Senators have had the pleasure of meeting him and enjoying his \ncompany in recent years.\n  I can't tell you how many times during late night sessions he has \nbrightened our lives with a kind word or bright smile. I can't tell you \nhow many times he has shepherded us into the sanctuary of his elevator \nwhile fending off intrusive reporters or lobbyists. We have always been \ngrateful to him for that.\n  No question about it, Gerry Counihan has been one of those very \nspecial people who make the Senate a great place to work.\n  Gerry is moving on to a new career with new responsibilities and new \nopportunities at the Department of Health and Human Services out in \nRockville, MD. With his departure, we are saying goodbye to a standout \nSenate staffer, a great friend, and someone who always brightens our \nday. We will miss him very much.\n  There are not many things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in \nthis body these days, but our love for Gerry Counihan is bipartisan \nand--indeed, I can say this without any fear of contradiction--\nunanimous. The Senate family joins together in wishing Gerry happiness \nand success in his new career.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise today to discuss what I think is one of the \nclearest threats to Americans' digital privacy and to discuss \nlegislation I think will go a long way toward addressing this problem.\n  Americans have valued and sought to protect their right to privacy \nfor a long time, and so have the representatives they have elected to \nbe a part of this Chamber. But in the past few decades, there has been \na fundamental shift in the nature of our right to privacy and the \nprivacy threats we face. Because when I was young, when people talked \nabout their right to privacy, they talked about protecting themselves \nfrom the government--from government intrusion. They asked: Is the \ngovernment keeping tabs on my political beliefs? Is it staying out of \nmy family business?\n  Today, we still need to worry about protecting our privacy from the \ngovernment, but we also need to protect our privacy from private \nentities--from corporations that are obtaining and aggregating \nincreasingly large amounts of our personal information. Nowhere is that \nneed clearer and more urgent than on the Internet. Within the Internet \necosystem, I would argue that some of the most sensitive information \nout there comes from our phones.\n  Smartphones are the future of the Internet and can actually be more \npowerful than desktop computers from a decade ago. There will be more \nsmartphones sold in 2012 than laptops and desktops combined. There is a \nreason for that. These are incredible devices. Using a smartphone, a \nmother or\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nfather can see his or her child, wish him or her goodnight, even if \nthat child is half a world away. A smartphone can give a driver \ndirections and can tell that driver where the nearest gas station is. \nSmartphones also enable emergency responders to find and respond to an \naccident in a matter of seconds.\n  But the same technology that allows these wonderful benefits also \nraises very clear privacy concerns. Our smartphones know where we are \nall the time. Unfortunately, the last 6 months has shown that our legal \nframework hasn't kept up with technology and isn't protecting our \nprivacy when we use these devices.\n  Last December, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal revealed \nthat of 101 top applications for Apple iPhones and Google Android \ndevices, 47 disclosed information about a user's location to third \nparties, without asking consent from the user.\n  In April, security researchers discovered that for almost a year, \nApple iPhone devices have been creating a detailed log of the different \nplaces a user had visited--and stored that log on both the phone and on \nevery computer a user synched his or her device to in an unencrypted \nmanner. That same month, Americans learned that both iPhones and \nAndroids were automatically transmitting location information back to \nApple and Google. In the case of the iPhones, the user had no clear way \nof knowing this was happening. In many cases, they actually had no way \nto stop it.\n  In February, I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee's new \nSubcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. I decided to use my \nnew role to dig down and find out more about smartphone privacy. When I \nlearned of the events in April, I wrote Apple about what was going on, \nand in May, I held our first subcommittee hearing on the issue. We took \ntestimony from the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, \nprivacy advocates, technologists, representatives from app developers, \nand we took testimony from Apple and from Google. I will tell you, the \nmore I learned about this problem, the more I became worried for \nconsumers.\n\n  I learned that an app on your phone can access an incredible amount \nof information on you. It can monitor your Web browsing habits. It can \naccess and read your address book. And, of course, it can access your \nlocation. But in most cases, a user has no way of knowing that all of \nthis information can be freely sent to third parties that the user has \nnever heard of. A recent study of the top 340 free applications found \nthat only 19 percent provide users with a link to a privacy policy. \nThat is less than one in five apps.\n  I also learned that our Federal laws on this subject are a confusing \nhodgepodge full of gaps and loopholes, and that in many cases our \ncurrent Federal laws explicitly allow wireless companies and companies \nsuch as Apple and Google to disclose our location information to \nwhomever they want.\n  Let me give you an example. If I use my smartphone to make a phone \ncall, my wireless company cannot go out and give my location to third \nparties without getting my express consent. But if I use that same \nsmartphone to search the Internet, my wireless company can disclose my \ninformation to almost anyone they want.\n  Here is another example. If I use a mapping application on my \nsmartphone to find out where I am or to find the nearest supermarket, \nApple and Google would have to ask my consent before telling third \nparties where I am. But if my same phone automatically transmits my \nlocation to one of these companies without my knowing it, then, \narguably, under current Federal law, again, these companies would \nlikely be free to disclose my information to almost anyone they want.\n  You do not have to take my word for it. Over the past several months, \nI have asked privacy experts and officials from the Department of \nJustice and the Department of Commerce about these issues, and they \nhave confirmed that this is, in fact, the case. This does not make \nsense. In fact, it is kind of a problem.\n  But the most alarming thing I heard is that there are real-life \nconsequences when we do not do enough to protect location information \non our smartphones. The very first group that contacted me after I \nwrote my letter to Apple in April was the Minnesota Battered Women's \nCoalition. They told me they have seen time and time again how \nsmartphone location technology can be abused by batterers and stalkers.\n  I asked the Minnesota Battered Women's Coalition to submit testimony \nfor my hearing. Two stories from their testimony jumped out at me. One \nwas of a woman from St. Louis County, MN. The Presiding Officer knows \nSt. Louis County very well. It extends from Duluth all the way up to \nthe Canadian border. It is a huge county, actually.\n  Recently, this woman had gone to a domestic violence program located \nin a county building. Within 5 minutes of entering the building, her \nabuser sent her a text message and asked her: Why are you in the county \nbuilding? Soon after that, an advocate helped her get an order of \nprotection against her abuser. To get that, she needed to go to the \nlocal courthouse. Soon after she filed the order of protection, the \nabuser texted her again. This time he asked: Why did you go the \ncourthouse? Did you file for an order of protection against me? The \nadvocates later concluded that this woman's abuser was tracking her via \na location tracking service on her phone.\n  Another woman in Minnesota had a similar experience when she secretly \nentered a domestic violence shelter and her abuser started sending her \ntext messages asking her: Why are you at a shelter? In fact, he started \ncalling taxicabs to wait for her outside the shelter at all hours of \nthe day. Again, in this case, advocates realized that this woman's \nabuser was tracking her through an app on her phone.\n  My goal with the Privacy Subcommittee is to try to find a balance \nbetween the wonderful benefits of modern technology and our need to \nprotect our privacy. Right now, when it comes to smartphone location \ntechnology, we have an imbalance, because we are getting all the \nwonderful benefits, but we are not keeping our privacy. I think we can \nget both.\n  This problem is not going to fix itself. Let me tell you why I say \nthat. After the hearing with Apple and Google, I asked representatives \nfrom each of those companies a simple question: Will you require that \nthe apps you sell have privacy policies? In fact, I also asked them \nthis: Even if you do not require that all the apps you sell have \nprivacy policies, will you at least require privacy policies for just \nthe apps that can get your location?\n  Well, by last week, both companies had answered my questions. Let me \nsummarize their answers: No.\n  I think Congress needs to act. That is why today I am introducing the \nLocation Privacy Protection Act of 2011. This piece of legislation is \nfounded on a simple principle: that consumers have a right to know what \ninformation is being collected about them and how it is being used, and \nthat they have a right to decide who will get that information, and \nwith whom they can share it.\n  This bill will fill gaps and loopholes in current Federal law to give \nconsumers four simple protections.\n  First, the bill says that anytime your wireless company or a company \nsuch as Google or Apple or an app developer wants to get your location \nfrom your smartphone, they need to get your permission first.\n  Second, if they want to give your information to a third party, they \nalso need to get your permission. This does not mean that our \nsmartphones are going to be clogged with permission screens. No. This \ncan be done with one simple screen. My bill does not require a new \npermission screen from every subsequent company that gets your \nlocation. That would be impractical. It would not be smart.\n  The third thing it does is require companies that collect and \naggregate the location information from thousands of consumers to take \nreasonable measures to protect that information from foreseeable \nthreats.\n  Finally, if a consumer writes one of these companies and asks: Hey, \ndo you have my location information, that company has to answer that \nuser yes or no. And if the user asks for his or her information to be \ndeleted, the company has to honor that request.\n  When I wrote the bill, I looked at the way other current digital \nprivacy laws were being enforced. Most of them have\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nwhat is called a private right of action that allows a consumer to get \ntheir day in court if their rights are violated. I know that many \nentrepreneurs find these burdensome, so I wrote the private right of \naction clause such that it would only kick in if no Federal or State \nauthority decides to act.\n  I also included exceptions in the bill to make it easier for parents \nto keep track of their children, for companies to protect against fraud \nand use location information that is anonymous, and for emergency \nresponders to get to the scene of an accident without any redtape.\n  In fact, this bill does not cover law enforcement at all. It governs \nonly what private companies do with our information, and what companies \nthey share it with.\n  I am proud to have worked on this bill with my friend from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal. I am equally proud the bill has the \nsupport of the Center for Democracy and Technology, Consumers Union, \nConsumer Action, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, the \nNational Consumers League, the National Women's Law Center, the \nNational Center for Victims of Crime, the National Network to End \nDomestic Violence, and the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group.\n  This bill will bring us back to a better balance between the benefits \nof smartphone technology--and they are wonderful--and our right to \nprivacy, which is basic. It was written with input from consumer \nadvocates and industry alike. But even after today, I will continue to \nwork with these groups to make sure our bill is getting that balance \nright. I look forward to those conversations.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to bring to the Senate's and \nthe Congress's attention a great challenge that we have before us \nrelative to the budget of the Department of Homeland Security and, \nfrankly, it is a challenge facing the entire budget of the United \nStates. That challenge is to make sure we have enough funding in the \ndisaster emergency account to cover the multitude of disasters that \nhave taken place this year since January, as well as those we are still \nrecovering from in the past.\n  I will put up a chart to show, in dramatic fashion, that this is an \nunprecedented situation we are facing. Since January of this year, 36 \nStates have had disasters declared. This may be the largest number of \nStates in the shortest period of time, at least in recent memory, and \npotentially in history. This is a challenge to the budget because, as \nyou know, under our law the Federal Government is by law--it attempts \nto be every day--a reliable and trustworthy partner for cities, towns, \nand States that have been devastated by tornadoes, wildfires, \nhurricanes, et cetera.\n  Most recently, our minds, our eyes, and our hearts have been focused \non Missouri, with the terrible devastation to several of their cities--\nmost notably Joplin. But we remember a few weeks ago the tornadoes that \nripped through the southern part of the United States--in Alabama \nparticularly, in Georgia, and in some parts of Arkansas; and there was \nflooding in other parts of the country as well.\n  This is what Mother Nature has brought to us. We cannot control that. \nBut what we can control is how we respond to it. That is what I want to \nspeak to today. I want to begin with a quote from David Maxwell from \nthe Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. He said this in the \nWashington Post on April 30:\n\n       Anything that we've asked for, they've gotten us.\n\n  He was referring to FEMA.\n  Gregg Flynn, a spokesman with the Mississippi Emergency Management \nAgency, said Fugate and FEMA ``are unbelievably proactive towards the \nstates. They don't wait for things to happen. By the time the storm is \nout of the way, they want to know what we need.''\n  This is very good testimony, because many of us, including the \noccupant of the chair, have worked hard to make a better, stronger, \nmore proactive FEMA. In large measure, we have accomplished that, \nalthough there are still challenges for that agency. The biggest \nchallenge right now is that unless the Senate, the House, and the \nPresident do something differently, we are not going to have the money \nwe need to take care of these disasters.\n  So for people on the ground, like David Maxwell in Arkansas, and \nGregg Flynn in Mississippi, and whether it is Paul Rainwater, a CEO \nfrom my State who is still struggling in the aftermath of Katrina and \nRita 6 years ago, we are going to literally run out of money in the \ndisaster emergency relief fund in January of this year.\n  Let me put up a chart to show the challenge that is before us. The \nPresident requested $1.8 billion, which is a reasonable request based \non past averages of disasters, which we are prepared to budget in the \nbase budget of Homeland Security. Unfortunately, the estimate of the \nlow end of these disasters--again, there were 36 since January 1, and \ndisasters happen in all 50 States--the estimate is that we need $3.8 \nbillion at the low end, and at the high end it is $6.6 billion. So \nbetween $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion is required. But we have budgeted \nonly $1.8 billion in the base of Homeland Security.\n  As chair of this committee, I can tell you that our committee cannot \nabsorb in its base the entire weight and cost of these disasters. The \nHomeland Security budget has never in its history absorbed 100 percent. \nWe do a rough and good-faith estimate of what it might be, but these \nare exceeding even our expectations of what the disasters would be. Of \ncourse, no one is in a position to be able to foretell the future. Our \nSecretary of Homeland Security brought a great deal of skill and \nexpertise as a former Governor, an excellent manager, and all the \nprerequisite academic credentials, but she didn't show up on this job \nwith a magic wand and a fortune teller's globe. She doesn't have those \ntools available to her to be able to see into the future every disaster \nand what kinds of disasters are going to happen to the country. All we \ncan come forward with is a good-faith estimate, which we did, at $1.8 \nbillion.\n  The reason I come here today is to say there is a gap that must be \nfilled. I am strongly recommending that this Congress fund this off \nbudget in an emergency line item, which is what we have done 95 percent \nof the time in the last 40 years. Since 1992, $110 billion of the $130 \nbillion appropriated to the DRF has been emergency spending. These \nevents are unpredictable. You cannot plan for it. We must respond by \nlaw. If we don't, then projects all over this country will shut down.\n  I remind everyone that they are projects that create jobs--not only \ndo they restore hope and rebuild communities, but the projects create \njobs. To list a few of them, there are the repairs for two very \nimportant roads in Hawaii, which could potentially be stopped; sewer \nline repairs at a pump station replacement in Gary, IN; the townhall in \nthe village of Gulfport, which hasn't been rebuilt since the storm, for \n6 years, which is under construction--that could be halted. That is a \ndozen or more jobs in that small town of Gulfport. Those are not big \nnumbers nationally, but that is important to that city. There is an \nelementary safe room being built in Kansas now. That is a few jobs \nthere, but it is important to the couple of hundred schoolchildren who \nwere terrorized by tornadoes sweeping through that area. I can go on \nand on. In Missouri, the Polk County bridge collapsed, which is very \ninconvenient for people having to cross that every day. I am not \npersonally familiar with it, but I can imagine\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nthe difficulty families are going through who were used to having \naccess to the river.\n  I can list hundreds of projects that literally stop in their tracks \nif we don't figure this out. My strong recommendation is that we do \nwhat we have always done, which is appropriate and fund real \nemergencies. It is not appropriate to do off budget things you should \nhave budgeted for but failed to do it. That is not an emergency; that \nis bad planning.\n  I think I am a pretty good chairman of this committee. I know \nSecretary Napolitano is an excellent Administrator of Homeland \nSecurity. There is nothing we can give her to make it humanly possible \nto predict disasters and the magnitude of their destruction. That is \nimpossible. Again, we have to figure out a way to budget for this that \nis responsible and, I say, put a good-faith effort, or average in your \nbudget, and then anything that occurs, do it in addition to that off \nbudget, in an emergency.\n  Another reasonable suggestion that has met with resistance--and I can \nunderstand why--would be to take a percentage decrease against all the \nbudgets of the Federal Government and say we wanted to spend this money \nbut we had these disasters and we absorb it governmentwide.\n  I can promise you that the last and worst thing--and one that can \nhappen because I will oppose it vigorously, and so will many others--is \ntaking the entire amount of the DRF, the disaster relief fund, out of \nthe Homeland Security budget, because then you put the country in a \nposition where you are underfunding planning for the future, lowering \nyour defenses against real terrorist attacks that could potentially \nhappen to the country, because you are funding for disaster levels that \nwe were unable to plan for--for obvious reasons.\n  We cannot undermine the security of our Nation or weaken the entire \nHomeland Security Department budget because of an unusual natural \noccurrence over which we have no control and no foreknowledge of. There \nmay be other solutions that I haven't thought of.\n  Another would be very helpful if the President himself, knowing these \nnumbers--they come from his own executive agencies, which are \ntabulating these numbers--were to send us an emergency supplemental. I \nhave sent him several letters requesting that he send to the Congress \nan emergency supplemental to cover this gap. If he doesn't do that, \nCongress has the power to act, and I will be making a recommendation in \nthe Appropriations Committee to fill this gap.\n  What is not acceptable is to try to absorb this entire gap in the \nHomeland Security budget, which will leave our country in a very \nweakened position in terms of preparing for future disasters and \npotential terrorist attacks.\n  Might I remind everyone that hurricane season just started on June 1. \nIt is now June 15. We are 15 days into the hurricane season. We don't \nknow what the season will bring.\n  There may be other alternatives to closing this gap, but it is very, \nvery important. I am going to start work on this vigorously with my \nranking member, Senator Coats, to see what we can recommend, \npotentially jointly, I would hope.\n  Again, I would like to put up this chart because this reflects just \nabout every Senator's State, from Washington to Texas, to Nebraska, to \nNorth Carolina, to Florida, to Georgia, Arizona. Montana will be green \nshortly, and so will Vermont because there are disasters underway. So \nput your thinking caps on. We need to come up with a way to fund these \ndisasters, and it is going to be a big challenge as we start our \nappropriations process.\n  I am going to submit more technical information for the Record, but, \nagain, we don't have magic wands and crystal balls in the Department of \nHomeland Security. We have a lot of tools there to protect our country \nand to build after disasters, but magic wands and crystal balls are not \navailable. So we have to come up with a way to close this gap that \nmakes sense. I trust that over the next couple of weeks and months we \nwill be able to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago there was an economic \ndisclosure about the number of people gaining jobs in America. The good \nnews is it was on the positive side of the ledger, more jobs being \ncreated. The bad news is it was not nearly enough and not fast enough. \nEven though these jobs are being created in the private sector, we \nstill know too many Americans are out of work.\n  There are 13.9 million Americans unemployed. That is a little over 9 \npercent of all Americans actively seeking work. Worse, nearly 25 \nmillion Americans are underemployed. People working part time when they \nwant to work full time are taking a job that pays a fraction of what \nthey earned in previous employment. That is 15.8 percent of all \nAmericans who would like to work full time but cannot do it. That is \nnot a problem for these families, it is a crisis, and every minute we \nignore it is a minute not spent well by this body.\n  A year ago it became increasingly clear there was little appetite in \nWashington moving toward job creation. When the President was elected, \nhe was greeted on the day he was sworn in by news that that month--and \nthe following month--we had lost some 700,000 jobs in America. What we \nhad had 8 years before, a surplus and booming economy, had hit the \nskids and people were losing jobs, businesses were failing, and people \nfelt it in their savings accounts and IRAs all across America. The \nPresident tackled that, and I joined him, with many others, to try to \ninfuse in this economy the kind of spending that would build things, \ncreate jobs, and turn this economy around.\n  We believe it was successful but only partially successful. Then at \nthe end of last year, the President joined on a bipartisan basis with \nMembers of Congress to extend the tax cuts in an effort to try to \ninfuse that money into the economy so people would have more to spend.\n  Now, many of us took exception with the menu of tax cuts because they \nincluded tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America at a time when \nwe are facing record deficits. It is hard to understand, let alone \njustify, a tax cut for a wealthy person as necessary for economic \ngrowth. Most of the people who receive those tax cuts would not turn \naround and spend them on goods and services. They might invest or bank \nthem--invest overseas, for that matter. But that was the recipe. We \nwent through spending and economic stimulus. Then, last year, we went \ninto tax cuts as a stimulus and, still, we are not moving forward as \nquickly or as wholesomely as we would like.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  I spent the past year focusing on one aspect of this; that is, our \nNation's deficit. I was appointed to the President's commission--the \nBowles-Simpson commission--which took a look at this deficit, and for \n10 months we studied it. It is a daunting challenge. It reflects \npatterns of spending and taxing which now have us in a terrible state, \nwith a lot of red ink. Roughly 14 percent of our gross domestic product \nis generated each year at the Federal level in revenue--taxes. We spend \n24 percent of the gross domestic product of our country in Federal \nspending. That difference--14 percent of revenue, 24 percent of \nspending, a 10-percent difference--represents the annual deficit we \nface in the United States of America.\n  The Commission sat down and said there is only one way to tackle \nthis--and I agree with the premise. We need to do it together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, which reflects the political reality of the \nCongress, but we need to do something that isn't altogether politically \npopular. We need to put everything on the table. So we did.\n  The Bowles-Simpson commission suggested every aspect of government \nspending be brought to the table. That is a much more balanced approach \nthan the debate we went through a few months ago over the continuing \nresolution--that short-term spending bill. That debate focused on 12 \npercent of our budget. There is only so far we can\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\ntake that conversation. We can't balance our budget with a tiny slice \nof it. We have to take a look at the entire budget. The Bowles-Simpson \ncommission did that. It brought to the table all domestic discretionary \nspending on both the defense and nondefense side and, I might add, \nentitlement programs.\n  That is an area where a lot of people get nervous because we are \ntalking about Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to mention the \nmajor elements of entitlement programs. The reason why many Americans \nhave concerns over this debate is that many of them are very \nvulnerable. They know they have worked hard, and if they still have a \njob, they realize that even working hard, they are falling behind; \nwages aren't keeping up with the cost of living. So even hard-working \nfamilies look at their bank accounts and their future and say: No \nmatter how hard we work, it doesn't seem as though we are able to keep \nup with the increased cost of living. They realize their \nvulnerabilities. We all do. When it comes to health insurance, if you \ndon't have good health insurance, you could be one diagnosis or one \naccident away from having all your savings wiped out or being denied \nthe quality care every one of us wants for ourselves and members of our \nfamily, particularly our seniors. Those who are retiring before \nMedicare and those even on Medicare want to make sure they have \nadequate health care coverage. So when politicians in Washington start \ntalking about the future of Medicare, many people get nervous. They \nwonder if it is going to be there when they need it.\n  The House Republican budget proposed by Congressman Paul Ryan a few \nweeks back tackled the Medicare issue. I respect Paul Ryan, but I \nrespectfully disagree with Paul Ryan when it comes to his conclusion. \nAt the end of the day, the House Republican budget would have doubled \nthe out-of-pocket expenditures of senior citizens for Medicare. \nCurrently, that is estimated to be in the range of $500 a month. What \nthe Ryan budget proposed was to double that: an additional $6,000 in \npremiums individuals would have to pay once qualifying for Medicare. \nThese are people, by and large, who are retired. To have an additional \n$6,000 in out-of-pocket expenditures naturally raises an alarm. They \nare alarmed at the prospect that they would not have the money to pay \nfor Medicare. He also took the program from where it has been for the \nlast almost 50 years and turned it into a basic private insurance \nprogram. I think most people in America who are honest will tell us \nthat putting our health fate in the hands of the tender mercies of \nhealth insurance companies doesn't give people a lot of confidence.\n  So the House Republican budget proposal met with an icy, if not \nangry, reception across America.\n  That is not to say we can ignore Medicare. Medicare, if not attended \nto, will not meet its obligations indefinitely. We have to look to ways \nto make it fiscally solvent. I think we can. I think we can do it \nwithout endangering the basic promise of Medicare, without increasing \nthe costs beyond the reach of seniors. That is what we need to do.\n  The same thing holds true for Social Security. Many people are \nskeptical about Social Security, but here is the fact. Untouched, \nwithout Congress doing a thing, Social Security will make every payment \nthat has been promised, with a cost of living adjustment every single \nyear, for the next 25 years. We can't say that about many Federal \nprograms. We can say it about Social Security. But the reality is, in \nthe 26th year, it falls off the cliff. We would have to cut benefits by \nover 20 percent if we don't do something between now and then. I \nbelieve, and the Bowles-Simpson commission believed, the changes we \nmake today, 25 years in front--small changes--can play out to buy \nlonger solvency for Social Security.\n  Haven't we all been forewarned by what has happened over the last \ndecade; that we shouldn't privatize Social Security, we shouldn't \njeopardize Social Security? In the end, we don't know if that pension \nwe worked our lives for in a corporation is going to be there or \nwhether the corporation is going to be there. We don't know if our \nsavings will be of the same value that they are today when we want to \nretire. Social Security is the one constant. It is hardly enough to \nlive on, but a good, solid bedrock for many people to build their \nretirement. So we owe it to Social Security to make sure it is solvent \nfor years to come.\n  So here we stand in a situation where we are facing a crisis and the \ncrisis is one with a deadline and the deadline is August 2. Here is \nwhat it is: Each year, as the deficit on our budget increases, we need \nto borrow more money as a nation. In other words, the mortgage of the \nUnited States goes up by the amount of the deficit. So each year we \nhave to negotiate a new mortgage. We call it extending the debt ceiling \nof the United States. We need to do it this year. The Treasury \nSecretary said we have to do it by August 2. That is the deadline. \nFailing to do that, we will be in a default position. In other words, \nthe full faith and credit of the United States, which has never been \nquestioned, will be questioned. People will say, if the United States \nis not borrowing the money it needs to meet its current expenditures, \nthen we can't trust them to make payments in the future.\n  So what is likely to occur? If the Congress fails to extend the debt \nceiling before August 2--if we get into a political debate and that \nbecomes the major element of debate and discussion--if we fail to \nextend it, what will happen instantly is that interest rates will start \ngoing up. Interest rates that affect families, individuals, and \nbusinesses across America will start to go up. In the midst of a \nrecession, that is exactly the wrong thing. Interest rates going up at \nthat moment in time will discourage people from buying cars and homes \nand businesses from borrowing so they can expand their payrolls and put \nmore people to work. So it would be reckless for us not to extend the \ndebt ceiling.\n  I know it is a political football. People like to say--and I probably \nhave made these speeches in my own political career--this debt ceiling \nis a reflection that the United States doesn't have its act together. \nWe are not dealing with the deficit honestly. There is truth to that. \nBut at the end of the day, we have a responsibility to extend this debt \nceiling. If we end up watching interest rates going up and this \nrecession getting worse, let me tell my colleagues, there are no \npolitical winners in the House or Senate if that occurs.\n\n  What we need to do--clearly, what we need to do--is to extend the \ndebt ceiling as well as have an honest, comprehensive approach to deal \nwith our deficit. It will involve spending cuts, make no mistake. That \nhas to be done. It will also involve taking a look at entitlement \nprograms and making sure we have found all the health care savings we \ncan so we don't have these programs going bankrupt, and it will include \nrevenue. There are people who can afford to pay--people who are well \noff in America, blessed to live in this country who have done quite \nwell. Asking sacrifice from them at this moment in time is not unfair. \nI think it is the right thing to do. Bringing those together, we can \ncome up with a bipartisan agreement and I hope we can do it and do it \nsoon.\n  Let's not make the mistake of defaulting on America's debt. Let's not \nmake the mistake of jeopardizing the full faith and credit of this \ncountry. Let's not run up interest rates at a time when we need to \nrecover from this recession and put Americans back to work. Let's not \ncreate a new burden on small businesses when they try to borrow to \ncontinue expanding their operations and employment. Let's make sure we \nare doing the responsible thing here in Washington. I think we can.\n  I have been meeting with a group that was originally a group of six, \nand then it became a group of five. Then it kind of expanded to 10 and \n15 and 20 and 25. It is kind of a moving card game. But I will tell my \ncolleagues that I am encouraged by the people who come into the room, \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Senate side, who listened to the basic \noutline of what we have been talking about. Although they may not agree \nwith it and its particulars, they certainly agree with this premise: \nWhat we need to do must be bipartisan. What we need to do must include \neverything--meaning putting everything on the table--and what we must \ndo is come up with a credible, honest plan that will reduce our deficit \nby more than $4 trillion over the next\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\n10 years. That amount doesn't solve our problem. We will still have a \nnational debt, but it will finally turn the corner. It will finally \nbring that cost curve down, and it will show to the world, at a time \nwhen people are skeptical about the economies of Greece and Portugal \nand Ireland and other countries, that the United States can stand and \nwork together in a responsible fashion to deal with the deficit. I \nthink it is time to move forward in this bipartisan manner. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate who are aware of this effort, who feel this is \nthe right thing to do, will join in putting together something. It is \ngoing to be tough. It will not be easy, and there will be compromise \nneeded on both sides. But if that compromise is forthcoming, we can \nmeet our obligation. I don't know who will win politically if we do \nthis. I don't think most people in America care who wins politically. \nThey do care about having a job tomorrow, making enough money so they \ncan have a nice home and a future for their children, and the belief \nthat America's best days are still ahead. We can do that. It is going \nto be hard politically, but it is something that is absolutely \nessential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3798-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I am actually glad to have come to the \nfloor after my colleague from Illinois has just spoken. I was in \nIllinois this week talking with a number of people there in the \nbusiness community as part of what I do on the Banking Committee. I \nwish to say that in talking to many of the great civic and business \nleaders who exist in Illinois, one of the biggest concerns they have \nis, in fact, this debt ceiling issue and the reduction of debt. I \nappreciate the work of the Senator from Illinois in trying to reach a \ncompromise. As a matter of fact, I salute anybody who is trying to work \nto solve this problem.\n  I wish to say, from my standpoint, I know the debt ceiling is a major \nissue, and for me to be able to support it, we need to have dramatic \nchanges in the way spending is taking place in this country. I think \nthere are numbers of people on both sides of the aisle who feel that \nway. I have offered the only, to my knowledge, concrete proposal that \nhas bipartisan support in both the Senate and in the House. I wish to \nmention there are a number of discussions about the Medicare proposal \nPaul Ryan has put forth, and certainly it is not perfect.\n  I would love to see a proposal made from the other side since \neveryone knows Medicare is going to be insolvent in the year 2024. The \nworst thing we can do, of course, is not pay attention. I hope at some \npoint in the near future we will actually hear a concrete proposal from \nthe other side of the aisle regarding Medicare.\n  But let me go back to the State of Illinois and the state of our \ncountry and certainly the people in Tennessee. There is tremendous \nuncertainty out there in the business community. As a matter of fact, \nin talking to one of our leading economists last night, corporate \nbalance sheets today are flush with cash, but companies are unwilling \nto invest that cash in long-term assets because they are concerned \nabout what we are going to do here in Washington. They are concerned \nabout whether we as a country are going to actually deal with our debt \nceiling, deal with our indebtedness in a way that makes progress. So \nthere is tremendous uncertainty.\n  That is, in my opinion, one of the leading causes of the economic \nissues we are dealing with, the high unemployment. It has been 777 days \nsince this body even passed a budget. If you can imagine having a \ncountry such as ours with 535 people in the House and Senate spending \nmoney without a budget for that long, obviously it is a display of an \nincredible lack of discipline and certainly sends the wrong signal to \nthe business community.\n  So I do think our country is suffering, suffering economically. Every \nperson I talk to is concerned about the uncertainty of whether we as a \ncountry are going to be able to deal with our indebtedness, the \ntremendous amount of debt this country is piling up because we are \nspending money we do not have.\n  I do look at this August 2 deadline as a line in the sand for us as a \ncountry. There is plenty of time for us between now--June 15--and \nAugust 2 to actually come to an agreement on these big issues. One of \nthe things I hope will be a part of anything we do is something like \nthe fiscal straitjacket that the CAP Act outlines. I do not think there \nis anybody in this body who disagrees with the fact that we as a \ncountry are spending money we do not have and more money than we \nshould. As a country, we have spent about 20.6 percent of our country's \ngross domestic product for the last 40 years. That is the post-\nentitlement period. Today as a country we are spending almost 25 \npercent of our country's economic output on the Federal Government, and \nthat number is rising geometrically.\n  So we put forth a bill. It is called the CAP Act. Again, it has \nbipartisan support in the Senate, bipartisan support in the House, that \nwould take us, over a 10-year period, down to the 40-year average and \nsave our country about $7.6 trillion over what is called the \nalternative fiscal scenario as printed by CBO.\n  There is no doubt in my mind--I do not think there is anybody in this \nbody who would disagree with this--that the signals we are sending to \nthe country and the world about our inability to come to a conclusion \nabout our spending is affecting the economy. I cannot imagine there is \nanybody who would disagree with that. We have had people come in, \neconomists telling us what will happen if we do not raise the debt \nceiling, what will happen if we do and we do not do those things that \nare necessary to lower the amount of spending that is taking place here \nin Washington.\n  Again, I have offered something that is practical. People on both \nsides of the aisle have joined. I know there are discussions that are \ntaking place. They are called the Blair House negotiations between the \nVice President and Members of this body, and I am understanding that a \nfiscal straitjacket is part of that discussion; in other words, making \nsure that over the next 10 years whatever costs we cut are actually \nlocked in, and more cuts are gotten through the imposition, if you \nwill, of a declining fiscal straitjacket, where we, in essence, get \nback to the norm as it relates to spending and our economy in this \ncountry.\n  I want to say I think one of the greatest things we can do to \nactually spur the economy--as much as people care about spending in \nthis country today; and there are a lot of people who do--believe it or \nnot, they care, as they should, even more right now about the economy \nand their own family's situation. I think these two are intertwined. I \nthink if we as a body were to show fiscal discipline, show some \ncertainty into the future, show the business community and the world \ncommunity we have the ability to have discipline, to act responsibly, I \nbelieve it would unleash tremendous amounts of investment.\n  Again, a leading economist last night says he has never seen a \nsituation where this much cash resides on corporate balance sheets, but \ncorporations are unwilling to invest them in long-term assets. What \nthat means, what that translates into is they are not building plants, \nthey are not expanding because they are concerned about policies in \nWashington, one of which is: Can we control our spending?\n  So I do think that August 2 is a seminal moment in our country's \nhistory. There is nothing happening here in the Senate. Let's face it. \nWe are voting on judges we do not even need to vote on. We could pass \nthem out of here by unanimous consent. We have bills on the floor that \nmean nothing, that are never going to become law, just to fill up time. \nWe know that. It has to be the most boring time in the world for a \nPresiding Officer. Nothing is happening. The oxygen is taken out of the\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\nroom over this debt issue, and we are debating things that are never \ngoing to happen. It is almost a farce in many ways.\n  So there is plenty of time--it is June 15--for us to negotiate \nsomething that is meaningful as it relates to cuts, and certainly \nplenty of time to act, to put something in place such as the CAP Act as \npart of the overall need to reform our entitlements and make sure they \nare here for future generations.\n  Let me state one more time that I feel as if, in many ways, what we \nare reading in the media about these negotiations is almost a walking \ndown of expectations. In other words, most of us want to see something \nbig happen for this country. We see this as a true seminal moment for \nour country. But from what I read of the various snippets that are \ncoming out of these discussions, it is almost intended each day to tamp \ndown what our expectations are.\n  I want to say to everybody in this body, unless I see dramatic \nchanges in spending as a result of these negotiations, I absolutely \nwill not vote for this debt ceiling increase. If we are going to have a \ncalamity in this country--and there are economists who say we are going \nto have a calamity either way: in other words, if we do not act \nresponsibly and pass a debt ceiling, we are going to send a signal to \nworld markets that we do not have the ability to control spending; if \nwe do not raise the debt ceiling, there are those who will say there is \ngoing to be a calamity.\n  Here is what I would say. I am 58 years old. I came to this body \nbecause I wanted to solve our county's problems or be a part of that \nworking with others. I want to say--I want to go on the record--that I \nwould rather us have a calamity this summer on my watch while I am here \nso I can deal with it than I would to pass a debt ceiling and not do \nsomething that dramatically alters our fiscal situation in this country \nand pass it along to someone else who may come behind me. I think there \nis a lot of sentiment in that regard. I hope there is a lot of \nsentiment in that regard: that all of us--all of us--would rather bear \nthe brunt of irresponsibility while we are here than pass it on down \nthe road.\n  So I am here to talk about a component of a solution which is the CAP \nAct. There may be some variation of this that makes more sense. \nCertainly, I have no monopoly on wisdom. But I hope something like \nthis, if it is not exactly the CAP Act as written, is a component of \nthe negotiations. I know during these negotiations this is actually \nbeing discussed: meaning, how we cap spending and actually put Congress \nin a fiscal straitjacket, for lack of a better word.\n  This is a seminal moment. I hope we will not water down expectations. \nI hope we will rise to the occasion and, as the Senator from Illinois \nmentioned, deal with this in a responsible way. I hope very soon we \nwill actually have a debate on this floor about what it is that has \nactually been arrived at, what the deal is, so we can actually talk \nabout it in a responsible way and do those things we all know are very \nimportant to our country, very important to our country's solvency, and \ncertainly very important to all those Americans out there who are \nuncertain as to whether the heads of households, who provide such great \nopportunities for those people coming under them, have the opportunity \nfor good-paying jobs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3799-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3799-S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncomments and for the way he delves into any issue we work on and comes \nup with some unique ideas from his past business experience. I hope \npeople will look at his resume, the information in his biography, to \nsee the fantastic things he has done that show he has the capability to \nsolve problems such as this.\n  I particularly appreciate the solution the Senator has come up with. \nSome people say it does not go far enough. You could make it go further \nthan that, but it is timing that is important and actually getting a \ndebate that is important, and I appreciate the way the Senator put it \nout in a reasonable way where we ought to be able to do it. We need to \ndo it right now so we do not keep passing this debt down, so we get in \na responsible position.\n  I am going to talk about something very similar today. We are in a \njobs crisis in this country. I come to the floor this afternoon to talk \nabout jobs. There is not any more important issue for American families \ntoday than jobs.\n  For 3 long years, we have been waiting for the economy to get back in \ngear and start creating the jobs necessary to keep America strong. I am \nafraid that Congress and this administration have not done their part \nto foster the healthy job-creating economy we need. We have heard \nplenty of talk about job creation, but the rhetoric simply does not \nmatch up with any action. So today I will speak about the headwinds we \nface, as well as some of the simple solutions to help spur job \ncreation.\n  This week the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness \npresented President Obama with five steps to create job growth. I agree \nwith most of the suggestions. Some of them are steps I have been urging \nfor some time, such as streamlining job training programs and speeding \nup the government permitting processes. But, unfortunately, for the \nmost part, these are just baby steps. The truth is, the most \nsignificant step the Federal Government could take to allow greater job \ngrowth is even easier than a baby step. Washington government just \nneeds to get out of the way. Washington keeps putting up roadblocks.\n  Last month's dismal job numbers paint a very clear picture. \nUnemployment rose to 9.1 percent--far above the 8 percent level \npromised by the administration at the time of the passage of the \nstimulus bill. Nearly 14 million Americans remain unemployed and \nactively looking for work, and more than half of them are long-term \nunemployed. With only 54,000 jobs created last month, and 3 million job \nopenings, the problem is clear.\n  These numbers also reveal some solutions that could go into effect if \ngovernment would step out of the way. For example, 7,000 of the jobs \ncreated last month were in the mining industry. Those of us from mining \nStates know that the mining and domestic energy production industries \noffer good jobs with good pay and good benefits. Yet the administration \nhas made it incredibly difficult for this industry to continue creating \njobs. It has slowed the permitting process for existing mine plans, let \nalone new mining and drilling activities. Let me say that again. It has \nslowed the permitting process to a crawl and directed EPA to regulate \ngreenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n  Simply stated, the President's policies are making things worse. How \nbad is this permitting process? Fourteen different mines have asked for \nan extension so their mine plans could continue in a logical way. There \nwas a big announcement 6 weeks ago: The administration is going to \nallow 758 million tons of coal to come up for bid. That is 4 of 14 \napplications: 758 million tons. In my county alone, there are a million \ntons of coal shipped a day--a million tons a day. The amount permitted \nfor bid is a 2-year supply, and it is going to take 6 years to permit \nit. And we cannot get the other 10 of them to be put out for bid and to \ngo through that same delayed process. That is affecting jobs and it is \nalso causing resources to be left in the ground that could be \neffectively used in our economy, which raises the costs.\n  The broadest result of this misguided energy policy will be increased \nprices for Americans. That will only dig our economic hole deeper. \nAmerican families are already coping with the terrible job market and a \nstruggling housing market. Increasing reliance on foreign energy \nsources and ignoring the sources we could harvest here at home makes no \nsense.\n  In certain regions of the country, the result of this misguided \nenergy policy is lost jobs and bankrupted American companies. On the \ngulf coast, many of the thousands of jobs that were supported by the \noffshore drilling industry are simply gone due to the moratorium, \npermit, and bureaucratic delays on offshore drilling in the gulf. Also, \nwhen skilled people are out of a job, they go somewhere else to get a \njob. They go to other countries to get a job and it reduces the number \nof people\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nwho can do the work here. It is another way of sending jobs overseas.\n  Some of the production has moved to Brazil and other countries that \nare not impeding their domestic energy production. And we are their \ncustomers. We are the ones buying it at extra-high prices.\n  Ironically, one of the largest discoveries of oil in the Gulf of \nMexico was just announced last week. This discovery proves there are \nstill massive amounts of domestic energy available to help alleviate \nthe high prices if the government would simply get out of the way.\n  Unfortunately, the slowdown in exploratory drilling as a result of \nlast year's moratorium is expected to lead to a 20-percent production \ndecline next year. And things don't happen overnight. Permitting takes \nup to 6 years as well.\n  I do not know if the public is aware, but there is a Middle East \ncartel that helps set the price of oil. Years ago, they used to able to \nset prices much easier. They could cut back the supply and increase the \ncost or they could increase the supply and decrease the cost. Twice I \nwatched them drop the price of a barrel of oil down to $8 and put the \nAmerican oil industry out of business. They put it out of business long \nenough so that the people who were qualified to do the work got jobs in \nother countries. When they brought the price back up, it took years for \nus to bring the production back up.\n  Now, they have said Saudi Arabia has run out of energy, that they are \njust about to use up their supplies. Well, last week they announced \nthey are going to have this huge increase in production. How did that \nhappen? Well, there are new techniques. There are new technologies that \nare being used for drilling. It is helping to bring up more oil.\n  We ought to be doing that right here in the United States. We ought \nto be increasing our supply of oil. There are fields where only 20 \npercent of the oil was producible at the time it was drilled. New \ntechnologies, one of which is to put carbon dioxide, or CO2, \ndown the hole and force the oil up--that is good for another 10 or 20 \npercent of the oil, and it captures the carbon. Why aren't we talking \nabout capturing carbon? We ought to be encouraging that, not \ndiscouraging that.\n  We also have a company in my state that would like to convert low-\nsulfur coal to low-sulfur diesel fuel. Low-sulfur diesel is one of the \nthings we really want. With these fluctuations in prices we have seen \nover the years, they said: We have the money to build this $2 billion \nplant and get it operational. But what happens if Saudi Arabia and the \nMiddle East cartels decide to drive the price down again? What if that \nprice got down to a point where our production was unproductive, if \nthey put us out of business, if they bankrupted us?\n  Well, several years ago, Congress said: We can take care of that. We \nare going to pass loan guarantees. We will provide loan guarantees for \nyou. We are not going to give you the money, but if that price were to \ndrop dramatically, then we would have some responsibility in the \nsituation.\n  Of course, the chances of it ever dropping to that point are pretty \nnegligible.\n  We allocated I think about $8 billion for loan guarantees for these \ntypes of projects--that is no cost to the Federal Government--out there \nfor this company to go ahead and make low-sulfur diesel and even jet \nfuel. Our military needs jet fuel. But out of that $8 billion, none of \nit has been allocated--none of it. At the same time, we did programs \nfor solar and wind in the amount of $20 billion. Which do you think can \nproduce the most energy? But it is OK with me that we have the solar \nand the wind. I think it is a good idea, and we are developing a lot of \nthat in Wyoming too. But how come we can't turn a loan guarantee loose \nso that we can change coal into diesel with carbon sequestration? It is \nbecause of this adverse opinion on coal that creates a lot of problems.\n  So it is not just a problem in that area, this slowing down of the \nprocess; this is also affecting things such as medical devices.\n  We are interested in the health care of the American people, and we \nhave an agency that watches out for our safety and should watch out for \nour safety, and we help ensure that time after time. We did a food \nsafety bill, which is a part of that FDA plan.\n  But in 2003 it was obvious to the companies that make the medical \ndevices that the agency did not have enough people, enough resources to \nexpedite, to get their evaluation done in a timely manner, and the \nindustry agreed to put up money--not to have any benefit to their \nparticular company but for the whole industry--to get things \nstreamlined, with more people looking at it so they could get the \napprovals, so they could get these health devices out to people so that \nthey could be used.\n  Well, since 2003 when they put in the first amount of money, the \nresources for the FDA have doubled, the fees have tripled, and the \nproduction has been cut in half. It is taking too long.\n  Now, how do I gauge what is too long? Well, Europe does the safety \nprocess too. Europe approves these medical devices 2 years before we \ndo. Two years before people in the United States are able to use these \nthings, they are using them in Europe. And you are not hearing about \nany calamities with the medical devices in Europe. They are doing an \nadequate job of checking the safety and making sure what they are \nputting out produces the desired result. But not in the United States. \nWe are slowing that process down--putting more money in, but slowing \nthe process down.\n  There are things out there that people could really use. Before I \ncame to the Senate, I had a heart valve tear. At that time, they had to \ndo open heart surgery and go in and stitch it up, put a special ring in \nthere, which fortunately for me has held very well. It repaired my \nheart, and it is in as good or better shape than it was before that \ntime.\n  But there is a medical device, and now they can come in just like \nthey go in with a stent and put that into that part on the heart, pop \nthis little umbrella open, and I would be fixed. I wouldn't have to \nhave that invasive heart surgery. That has already been available in \nEurope for 2 years. It still hasn't been approved in this country.\n  That is a process which is bogged down, which is costing jobs. So \nwhat do the companies do about it? They said: Well, let's see, why \ndon't we build our stuff over in Europe? Now, if you build a plant, you \nare probably looking at 10, 20, 30 years of production before you are \nin a position to move that plant somewhere else, like back to the \nUnited States should we cure our problems. So we have to cure that \nproblem now before we drive all of that overseas and all of those jobs \noverseas. The people who do the manufacturing on those rings get good \npay, they have skilled jobs, but they do them in the country where the \nplant is, they don't do them in the United States. That is just one \nmore example.\n  Well, I have another one. Right now, they are in the process of doing \na rule and regulation about how long you can drive a truck, how long \nyou can idle a truck, what kind of medical inspection the driver should \nhave to have. One of the groups that brought that to my attention is \nthe owner-operators of trucking companies, and they say the people who \nare drafting this rule have never driven a truck.\n  That is one of the problems with a lot of these rules and \nregulations: the people who are making the rules have never owned a \nbusiness. And there is this tendency in government to be afraid that at \nsome point something might go wrong, and it might come back. They have \nnever had anybody come back on them for saying no or for slowing \nsomething down. Well, actually, they have never had anybody come back \non them for saying yes. I wish they would realize that. The outfit with \nthe liability in this is the company, not the one who approve the rule. \nThey just need a good process they can move through and we can have a \nlot more jobs in this country.\n  Another way we can assist the jobs, as I have been saying, is by \nsimply getting out of the way and by reducing the regulatory burden the \nFederal Government places on employers.\n  The first step here would be to repeal the health care law that is \nalready driving up costs and paralyzing employers who are uncertain of \ntheir future obligations. Unfortunately, the President and his \nsupporters in Congress are fighting this effort every step of the way. \nAlthough the President issued an Executive Order on January\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\n18 of this year directing agencies to reevaluate the regulatory \nrequirements they impose to be sure they are tailored to impose the \nleast burden, less prescriptive, and justified cost-benefit analysis, \nwe have yet to see any regulatory relief from any agency.\n\n  Speeches will not save America, action will. The President can say he \nwants to get things done, and if nobody does them, we are in worse \nshape than we were before, not better shape.\n  I had hoped the entire administration would take this directive on \nlooking at all of the regulations seriously, particularly because \nregulatory burden falls most heavily on small businesses whose hiring \nwill pull us out of this ongoing recession. Small businesses represent \n99.7 of all employer firms. They employ over half of all private sector \nemployees. They pay 44 percent of the U.S. private payroll. They \ngenerated 64 percent of the net new jobs in this country over the past \n15 years.\n  I owned and operated a small business. I can tell you that if I had \nthousands of pages of regulations from a health care law hanging over \nmy head, I would hesitate before creating any new position that \nincreased my exposure. The key is to stay under 50 employees. There is \nless regulation under 50. I know of some companies that already were at \n52, 54, 56. They said: Do you know what we are going to do? We are \ngoing to reorganize so that we are under 50 employees.\n  Although reorganization is always good--we should take a little dose \nof that here in the Federal Government, but we don't. Everything is \nbased on what we had before plus inflation--no reinventing, no doing \nthings differently. I am seeing that in Wyoming as they are trying to \nclose down some of the small post offices without any new ideas for \nthem, without even covering the costs. But that is another story, and I \nwill cover that later.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said earlier, we are here and we are \nnot getting anything done. I think that is part of the strategy. There \nwas no budget--647 days with no budget and bills left undone. We get to \nthis process here where, to keep us from doing amendments on this side, \nwe just keep the floor open like this for days. Then we have a cloture \nvote, and because we have not had an opportunity to put any of our \namendments in, we vote against cloture, and that keeps cloture from \nhappening, and the leader then pulls the bill, and that ends the \nprocess. We go to another bill on which we are also going to do the \nsame thing. Some of these are good ideas and ought to be passed, but we \ndon't make it to that point. I am sure that is for the next election, \nsaying: Those darn Republicans just held up everything. That is not how \nwe ought to be operating.\n  Reducing the regulatory burden that is imposed by the Federal \nGovernment would be an important step, but we also need to make sure \nthe administration's independent boards and agencies get the message. \nSo far, it is clear they have not.\n  An extraordinary effort is underway at the National Labor Relations \nBoard to deter Boeing from expanding into a right-to-work State, where \nit would create work for over 1,000 employees. Those thousand employees \nhave already rejected a union, but they have the right to do that. Now, \nthis would be 1,000 more people employed in a billion-dollar-investment \nfacility.\n  So what has happened in Washington State that might have the people \nthere upset? Well, I am not sure. Boeing has also hired 2,000 \nadditional employees out there, so it obviously has not hurt their \nemployment. There will be seven of the planes built in Washington State \nand three of them built in South Carolina per month. But the case has \ndrawn a great deal of attention not because Boeing is a big company but \nbecause the agency's fact-twisting and publicity-seeking reveals a \nstrongly biased agenda. Our economy cannot recover when this \nadministration's policies result in exporting jobs rather than \nairplanes.\n  The wisdom of the National Labor Relations Act is to defend the right \nof employees to collectively bargain when they choose to do so, not \nstepping in to limit employees' ability to exercise their right not to \nform or join a union.\n  At the National Mediation Board, we have seen rulemaking to change \nthe way election results are counted in order to favor organized labor.\n  When that did not work and the majority of employees still voted \nagainst the union, the agency launched multiple investigations trying \nto smear the employer. These government-sponsored efforts to increase \nunion density have done nothing to create jobs. In some cases, the \nFederal Government has been counterproductive to that goal and should \nget out of the way.\n  Pending before the Senate and being held hostage under political \npressure are three free-trade agreements--South Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama. These pacts have been negotiated for years, and they will open \nmarkets to our producers. Yet this administration has failed to submit \nthese agreements to Congress and is refusing to consider a reasonable \ncompromise. That is wrong and it is hurting over $1 billion worth of \nU.S. beef exports to Korea which would help ranchers all across the \nUnited States, including my home state of Wyoming. The Korea agreement \nnot only helps grow U.S. agricultural exports but would also open the \ndoor for future trade with China which is an even larger market for \nU.S. farm products. And that is just one industry. The Korea agreement, \nas well as the Columbia and Panama deals would also help our service \nmanufacturing and finance industries just to name a few.\n  In the committee on which I now serve as ranking member, the majority \nscheduled three hearings on the middle class and job growth. I am \nconcerned about the middle class. The first hearing asked the question \nof whether the American dream is slipping out of reach. I made the \npoint then that I am repeating today. The American dream starts with a \njob. The focus on pay, benefits, and organizing does nothing to create \na job. We are going to have another one of those hearings next week. I \nam not sure where it is going. We have not proposed any legislation yet \nto deal with these issues. We are just getting press. That doesn't get \njobs. Stalling the growth of the domestic energy production industry or \nincreasing the regulatory burden on American businesses doesn't \nincrease jobs either and neither does blocking free-trade agreements \nwith our partners around the globe. An unelected, unconfirmed general \ncounsel at a small agency is getting in the way of business management \ndecisions that create jobs.\n  The American dream is not out of reach, but it is suffering from \nneedless hand-slapping threats. Those should be changed to hand-\nclapping progress. But this administration has to stop getting in the \nway of job creation so Americans can have jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3801-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3801-S3802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last month, the Medicare trustees warned \nthat Medicare will go bankrupt in 13 years, which is 5 years earlier \nthan they had previously calculated. You heard me right. One of the \nmost important programs that the government actually runs--the Medicare \nProgram--designed to provide health care to seniors, is going to run \nout of money in 13 years, 5 years earlier than projected just last \nyear.\n  The Medicare trustees noted that Medicare's unfunded liabilities--\nthat is the number it is responsible for--are more than $24 trillion, \nbut that is also growing. Stated another way, this is a $24 trillion \ngap between Medicare's future benefit costs and the future taxes of \npremiums that are expected to be collected to pay for it.\n  Today, I am, along with nearly all my Republican colleagues, sending \na letter to the President of the United States, insisting he comply \nwith the law. What law would that be? Well, the law that was passed in \n2003 that, under these circumstances, requires the President to propose \na plan to deal with this funding crisis for Medicare. President Obama \nhas said he is willing to make some tough decisions. Yet he refuses to \nprovide concrete, constructive, and meaningful proposals to deal with \nthis impending insolvency of one of our most important government \nprograms.\n  The Medicare trustees have issued a Medicare funding warning in their \nannual report every year since 2006. They are required to do so under \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nand Modernization Act of 2003. In response to this warning, as I said, \nthe President is required by Federal law to submit to Congress proposed \nlegislation that would address this funding crisis. President Bush, in \n2008, in response to the 2007 Medicare trustees' warning, did exactly \nwhat the law requires. He submitted legislation to address this funding \ncrisis. Both the House and the Senate, in compliance with the law, \nintroduced legislation, but, unfortunately, it never went anywhere--\nkicking the can down the road once again.\n  The Medicare trustees have, in fact, issued a funding warning every \nyear since 2006, as I mentioned, including all 3 years President Obama \nhas been in office. However, for 3 years now, President Obama and his \nadministration have failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of \nthe law. Congress has never received a proposal from President Obama's \nadministration to address this funding crisis. This failure I wish I \ncould tell you was the result of an oversight but apparently not.\n  On Tuesday, in an e-mail to The Hill newspaper, on behalf of the \nadministration, they said they believed this law was ``advisory and not \nbinding.''\n  The law itself states--passed by both Houses of Congress, signed into \nlaw--that the President ``shall'' submit legislation to Congress, not \nthat he ``might,'' or ``if it is convenient,'' or ``if he finds time,'' \nor ``if it advances his political posture leading up to the next \nelection.'' It says he ``shall'' submit legislation.\n  Thank goodness we live in a country where no one is above the law. We \nare a nation of laws, where the law applies to the President of the \nUnited States and it applies to the most humble members of our society.\n  Medicare is going bankrupt. Unfortunately, the voices of reform--\npeople are stepping forward to try to solve this problem and make \nmeaningful suggestions so we can actually do what we are supposed to do \nin Congress, which is debate ideas and come up with solutions, where we \ncan have a vote and we can send legislation to the President and he can \nsign it or not. That is the way the process is designed to work, but so \nfar the voices missing from the reform debate are those of our friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  There is no House Democratic plan to save Medicare. There is no \nSenate Democratic plan to save Medicare. There is no plan for President \nObama to save Medicare. Unfortunately, their plan appears to be not to \nstep up and do what the law requires, to offer a proposal to save \nMedicare but, rather, to try to take a cynical political advantage \nleading up to the next election by attacking the very people who are \nmaking constructive proposals.\n  No one suggests that any single proposal is perfect. The Ryan plan is \nnot perfect. The Domenici-Rivlin plan offers a different approach. The \nPresident's own fiscal commission's report is entitled ``Moment of \nTruth.'' They reported back in December 2010. It was a bipartisan \ncommission appointed by the President himself. It makes constructive \nsuggestions on how to solve our spending crisis and to address the \nunsustainability of our entitlement program. But it appears that rather \nthan embrace any of these constructive ideas, rather than do his duty, \nas the law requires, the President seems content to scare seniors into \nopposing responsible reforms, while watching the program go bankrupt \nover the next few years.\n  By refusing to propose needed reforms to this important program, \nPresident Obama is not only abdicating his responsibility to lead as a \nPresident of the United States, he is violating Federal law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter I \nreferred to earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2011.\n     President Barack H. Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: We write to urge you to submit a \n     legislative proposal to Congress in response to the Medicare \n     funding warning issued in the 2010 Medicare Trustees' Report. \n     Such a proposal would help prevent the bankruptcy of this \n     vital program for America's seniors and keep the federal \n     government from going further into debt. Furthermore, such a \n     proposal would put your Administration back in compliance \n     with federal law.\n       Your Administration is currently in violation of section \n     802 of P.L. 108-173, the Medicare Prescription Drug, \n     Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The MMA \n     required the Medicare Trustees to include in their annual \n     report an estimate of whether general fund revenues will \n     finance more than 45 percent of total Medicare expenditures \n     in any of the following six years. If the Trustees estimate \n     in two consecutive years that the 45-percent limit will be \n     breached within a seven year timeframe, the Administration is \n     then required to submit a legislative proposal that would \n     address the funding crisis within 15 days of submitting its \n     annual budget proposal to Congress.\n       The Medicare Trustees have complied with federal law and \n     have issued funding warnings every year since 2007. In 2008, \n     the Bush Administration, in compliance with Section 802 of \n     the MMA, submitted a legislative proposal to Congress, which \n     was never acted upon. Your Administration, however, has \n     failed to submit such a proposal for the last three years.\n       This not only defies federal law but also abdicates your \n     Administration's responsibility to lead. As you know, \n     mandatory spending is currently projected to grow at an \n     average of 5.4 percent per year over the next 10 years, \n     growing from $2 trillion in 2012 to $3.3 trillion by 2021. \n     The largest claim on the budget over the next 75 years is \n     Medicare, estimated at $35 trillion.\n       We ask you to comply with the law and submit to Congress \n     the Administration's legislative proposal addressing the \n     Medicare funding warning included in the 2010 Annual Report \n     of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Cornyn; Mark Kirk; John Thune; Lindsey Graham; John \n           Barrasso; Roy Blunt; Lisa Murkowski; Mitch McConnell; \n           Daniel Coats; Lamar Alexander; Kelly Ayotte; Michael B. \n           Enzi; Richard Burr; James Inhofe; Pat Roberts; Jerry \n           Moran; Rob Portman; Marco Rubio; Ron Johnson; Rand \n           Paul; Saxby Chambliss.\n         Mike Crapo; Bob Corker; Tom Coburn; Chuck Grassley; \n           Johnny Isakson; John Hoeven; Jeff Sessions; Michael E. \n           Enzi; Patrick J.

Mr. President, last night, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I \ndid a telephone townhall meeting in Georgia. We had a little over 3,000 \npeople on the call, and I was able to handle 16 questions. As I \nlistened to the answers I was giving to the questions, I was struck by \nwhat a real problem we have in Washington. Washington is making things \nworse. Georgians are frightened for their jobs, the value of their \nhomes, and the education of their children. They are uncertain about \neverything. As you give answers about what is happening in Washington, \nyou realize Washington is making it worse.\n  I wish to give a couple of examples based on my experience. First of \nall, let's talk about legislation for a second. We have high \nunemployment--9.1 percent. We have people without jobs or \nunderemployed. We have a law called the Workforce Investment Act or \nWIA. I am on the subcommittee that overseas it and the Education \nCommittee. We have basically had an agreement on expansion of the \nreauthorization for the Workforce Investment Act for months, but it \nstill languishes in committee because there are arguments over labor \nprovisions that some want to be added to it.\n  Here we are, a nation in trouble, and we cannot pass the Workforce \nInvestment Act, which is intended to help the very problem we have.\n  Secondly, I am on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension \nCommittee, which does the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--the fundamental foundation of training and \nimproving our kids for the jobs of the 21st century. It has gone 4 \nyears without reauthorization, and it languishes in committee because \nof a lack of willingness to bring it forward. Our children remain \neducated and taught and motivated under a law now expired for 5 years. \nThat is not right, when we should be educating our children and \ntraining workers.\n  We in Washington are doing nothing. On the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich I serve, we are over the FAA\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\ncommittee and reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, \nwhich is critical to economic development. That conference committee \ncontinues to languish. What are the arguments? They are about changes \nin labor law.\n  We need to get the job done in Washington and go to work. We need to \nunderstand that the American people are in trouble and are hurting. Our \njob is to provide answers, not to make it worse.\n  I wish to talk about a second feature--about regulation for a \nsecond--or strangulation, if you will. I have told this story before on \nthe Senator floor, and I will tell it again. On January 3 of this year, \nI was in a cafe for breakfast and to meet with some businessmen. I \nwalked in the front door and Steve Hennessy of Hennessy Cadillac and \nLand Rover in Atlanta called to me and came running across the floor. I \nthought he was going to give me a bear hug, but he said: Johnny, \nyesterday, I fired a salesman and hired two compliance officers. This \nfinancial regulation in the Dodd-Frank bill is strangling my \nproductivity and raising my cost of doing business.\n  We have to recognize that regulation has consequences. It is not our \njob to eliminate risk in the marketplace. It is our job to mitigate \nrisk so people will take risks, in terms of seeking rewards, which is \nwhat the capitalistic system is based on.\n  I will talk about a few other regulations that are causing \nsignificant problems in our recovery. The qualified residential \nmortgage rule that is being promulgated now by the six regulators will, \nif it goes into effect on August 1--and they have put the effective \ndate off now--probably constrict the real estate market, which is \nalready suppressed by 70 percent, by another 40 percent. It is going to \ntake capital and risk capital and credit away from the Americans who \nare, in fact, buying homes today. In fact, in order to mitigate risk \nand try to eliminate it, it requires lenders to hold a 5-percent risk \nretention until the loan matures. It says you cannot loan anybody less \nthan 80 percent--more than 80 percent, and if you have anything more \nthan that, you cannot even have a private mortgage insurance policy to \nguarantee the money. So you are going to flood every buyer left to \nwhere? Through FHA, which is exempt from the Dodd-Frank bill, or Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, which are going out of business, which means you \nwill shift more of the burden of mortgage financing on people who are \nalready overstressed.\n  Regulatory intent should not do that. My dairy farmers in Georgia are \nlooking at a rule where milk is being categorized where it is going to \nhave to be contained in tanks and reservoirs that now meet the \nstandards of petroleum. That is higher investment and no additional \nprofit for the country. That is protracted. Water--the EPA wants to \ntake ``navigable'' from in front of the word ``water,'' in terms of the \nClean Water Act, so the government doesn't regulate just navigable \nwaters but every water.\n  Credit. Credit is becoming nonexistent for Main Street. I am a small \nbusiness guy. I was in a small business in Georgia for 33 years. A lot \nof small businesspeople use their credit cards to manage their cash \nflow over time. Because of the credit bill passed a couple years ago, \nthey don't have the flexibility to do that anymore. Bank credit is \nsuspended primarily because banks are being run by the FDIC under cease \nand desist orders or, if they are extending credit alone, they are \nextending it to the extent that a borrower can put that much money in \nthe bank. When you constrict credit, you suppress small business. When \nyou suppress small business, you suppress 72 percent of the employment \nin the United States.\n\n  I commend Senator Corker for his remarks about an hour ago on the \nfloor of the Senate because he focused on the big problem we have; that \nis, debt and deficits. It is kind of disappointing to me we have spent \nmore time on the SBA act, which has been pulled now--it was on the \nfloor the beginning of last month--than we have spent on all the \nappropriations bills in the last 3 years of this Congress. We debated \namendments, we protracted the debate but still nothing happened. We \nought to be talking about debt reduction, about deficit reduction, and \na long-term plan, over time, to amortize the debt of this country to a \nreasonable level.\n  We have a debt ceiling vote that is confronting us, and I have heard \nthe political statements made by people in both parties that there is a \ngame of chicken being played right now, with some saying we are going \nto push it right up to August 2 and force a vote. If we don't get it, \nwe will run the risk of America's credit going up in cost and \nuncertainty happening. Others are saying we are not going to do \nanything on a debt ceiling increase period until we have to at the last \nminute.\n  That is not the way to run a business. That is not the way to expand \ncredit. That is not the way to run a country. We ought to be sitting \ndown at the kitchen table of Washington, DC, in the Senate \nreprioritizing the way we spend money to begin to rein in our \nexpenditures, lower our deficit and lower our debt.\n  I bet in the last couple of years every family in America, as every \nfamily in Georgia, has had to sit around their kitchen table and \nreprioritize their expenditures. Things have changed. Their nest egg \nmay have shrunk. Their equity may be suppressed. Their job may be in \ntrouble. We have all had to do it. I have had to do it. Almost \neverybody in America has had to do that. Why doesn't the government do \nit? At a crisis moment of $14 trillion in debt, with no ceiling above \nit; with a deficit of $1.5 trillion, $300 billion more than \ndiscretionary spending, why aren't we sitting around that kitchen \ntable?\n  The questions I heard last night during my tele-townhall meeting made \nit clear to me Washington is making things worse. The American people \nwant to be confident that we will address the debt and the deficit \nproblem; that we are working on it and not that we are putting it off \nto a drop-dead date and then play chicken politics in the Senate.\n  People don't mind regulation that is fair, but they do mind \nregulation that is suppressive and that suppresses jobs. They don't \nmind having legislation debated in Washington on the floor of the \nSenate, one way or another depending on your position, but to leave it \nlanguishing in committees and not even bringing it up is not right. So \nmy challenge--for me and for every Member of the Senate, and for this \nadministration and for the President--is for us to lead.\n  We have a clock winding down on a debt ceiling increase that will be \nimportant for this country. But without substantial reform of the way \nwe do our business and a game plan for a downpayment on our debt and \ndeficit, and without an indication we are going to work together and \nhave shared sacrifice, there is nothing at all we can do in this \ngovernment except cause things to be worse. I don't want to be a part \nof that.\n  My last comment is this: I was 39 years old in 1983. A report was put \nout by the board of the Social Security Administration saying it was \ngoing broke in 2004. President Reagan and Tip O'Neill got together and \nsaid: We can't let that happen.\n  President Reagan said: I don't want it to go broke, but I am not \ngoing to raise the tax.\n  Tip O'Neill said: I don't want it to go broke, but I am not going to \ncut the benefit.\n  They went to the actuaries and said: What do we do?\n  The actuaries said: Put out the eligibility.\n  So they changed the law and said if you are an American born after \n1943 you can't get Social Security at 65; you have to wait until you \nare 66. I am 66. They put my Social Security off a year. I didn't miss \nit. They also made Social Security actuarially sound until 2050. Only \nin the last 2 years has that date come down, and it has come down \nbecause of unemployed Americans at age 62 taking discounted early \nSocial Security and putting more pressure on the system.\n  We could fix Social Security tomorrow just like they did in 1983 and \nnot take a penny away from anybody. We could move the eligibility out \nto be more reflective of life expectancy. I know Medicare is the big \npolitical football and everyone wants to say the Republicans are trying \nto kill Medicare, and the Democrats love to say they are trying to \nprotect it. Heck, I want to protect it. I have nine grandchildren. The \nrest of my life is about those grandchildren. I want to see to it they \nhave a country that is as free, as productive, and safe, and that the \nbenefits\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nare there for them that have been there for me. It is important we save \nMedicare, but we can't save it by looking the other way or by taking it \noff the table. We can't demonize a Democrat or a Republican for making \na constructive decision to save Medicare.\n  Instead of trying to make it the political issue of the 2012 \nelection, we should make it the personal issue of each Senator. We \nshould sit around that kitchen table, work together, and try to find a \nmeaningful solution to a problem that saves Medicare for future \ngenerations, and also doesn't cause an escalation in our debt and \ndeficit. We are capable of doing it, but we have not demonstrated a \nwill to do it.\n  I challenge my colleagues to do the same thing, and I challenge my \ncolleagues to do one other thing--to hold a tele-townhall in the next \ncouple of weeks. Talk to 3,500 of the citizens in your State and listen \nto the questions they are asking. They are scared, they are worried, \nand they feel threatened, and Washington is making it worse.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to voice concern about \nthe current state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In 1949, \nmore than 60 years ago, the United States joined with 11 other nations \nto create the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, in order to \nensure the mutual security of the member nations. From the beginning, \nthe United States has served as NATO's backbone and provided a major \nshare of the cost in manpower and resources. We have consistently \nanswered the call of our NATO allies when they needed us, even when \nthere was no clear United States interest involved.\n  For example, in 1993 the U.S. military answered the call to \nparticipate in the NATO air action to enforce a U.N. ban on all \nunauthorized military flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the \nDayton Peace Accords in 1995, the United States stationed over 10,000 \npersonnel in support of peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. For the \nfollowing 9 years we continued to retain a large number of forces \nthere.\n  In 1999 the United States again stepped up and provided a major share \nof the military resources for operations in Kosovo. At that time I \nargued that we were assuming too many commitments in areas of the world \nwhere our own interests were vague. When President Clinton announced \nthat he intended to send 4,000 U.S. troops for peacekeeping in Kosovo, \nI said:\n\n       If we think the United States has the responsibility to go \n     into all these civil conflicts, we are going to dissipate our \n     resources and we're going to place a heavy burden on our \n     taxpayers.\n\n  Today, after years of involvement with NATO-led operations in the \nBalkans, our forces are still a major component of the NATO Kosovo \nforce, and we are still contributing approximately 800 troops to that \neffort.\n  In fact, of the 22 nations now in NATO contributing troops in Kosovo, \nthe United States military makes up approximately 13 percent of the \ntotal force. As far as cost is concerned, the U.S. taxpayer is still \nfooting a very large bill for our presence in Kosovo. In fiscal year \n2010, the President asked for $252 million to pay for operations in \nKosovo. In fiscal year 2011 it was $312 million. Now as part of the \nfiscal year 2012 Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund, the \nPresident is asking for $254 million.\n  With this example in mind, I am now deeply concerned that we appear \nto be in the same position again, this time with NATO in Libya. On \nMarch 31, NATO assumed command and control of operation Unified \nProtector, and was thereafter responsible for enforcing the no-fly zone \nover Libya. With this transfer of authority and responsibility from the \nUnited States to NATO, there was also an implicit understanding that \nall of NATO member states would be expected to dedicate the necessary \nresources to adequately enforce U.N. Resolutions 1970 and 1973. \nHowever, almost immediately after taking command, NATO requested a 48-\nhour extension of support from American fighter aircraft. This request \nfor continued support from American air assets seemed to be at odds \nwith the President's statement that coalition forces would be able to \nkeep up the pressure on Qadhafi's forces. So, once again, our Nation is \ncalled upon to provide a large share of the resources and funding for \nanother NATO mission that is not in the vital security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Indeed, Secretary of Defense Roberts Gates stated on April 21 at a \nDOD press conference that ``while it is not a vital interest for us, \nour allies considered it is a vital interest. And just as they have \nhelped us in Afghanistan, we thought it important, the President \nthought it was important, to help them in Libya.''\n  We are now on track to spend more than $800 million of U.S. taxpayer \nmoney this fiscal year on operations involving Libya. I ask, with \nsignificant concern, how are these operations going to be paid for? \nWhere is DOD planning to get the extra almost $1 billion to spend on \nthis operation? What programs will need to be cut to fund this third \noperation in which we are now involved: Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya? \nWill the President be submitting a supplemental appropriations bill on \nLibya?\n  With the example of Libya in our minds, let us be clear as to exactly \nwhat our allies are contributing to the efforts in Afghanistan. As part \nof the International Security Assistance Force, which is the command in \ncharge of operations in Afghanistan, the United States is contributing \n70 percent of the total force, with 46 nations contributing the \nremaining 30 percent.\n  As we review the landscape of American military commitments overseas, \nlet me emphasize that with U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwe should not also be participating in such a major way in an open-\nended conflict in Libya, where we have no clear, vital national \nsecurity interests. Moreover, I believe our NATO allies who do have a \nvital interest in Libya should be willing to play a lead role in terms \nof funding as well as military resources. The fact is, NATO and the \nArab League should be shouldering the brunt of the military and \nfinancial burdens associated with Operation Unified Protector, just as \nwe are doing in Afghanistan, and have been doing in Iraq.\n  If we had all members of NATO contributing proportionately to the \nmission in Libya and also had the Arab League providing comparable \nfinancial and military assistance, the overwhelming commitment of our \nown U.S. forces would be lessened to a manageable degree. I am \nfrustrated that our NATO allies continue to contribute such a small \namount of resources for operations that are in the vital interest of \nmany NATO member states. In Libya, I believe if the U.S. military were \nto stop providing to our allies our unique military capabilities, NATO \noperations for both the no-fly zone as well as the civilian protection \nmission would be seriously degraded and could terminate.\n  How have we arrived at this unfortunate state of affairs? Why is it \nthat NATO nations are unwilling and unable to effectively operate \nagainst a weak and isolated nation such as Libya without significant \nmilitary contributions from the United States? One reason we are in \nthis position is because many NATO members are not contributing enough \nof their gross domestic product to defense. Instead, many NATO members \nsimply look to the United States and the American taxpayer to pay for \nany gaps in defense capabilities. Because many NATO nations do not \ninvest strategically in their military capabilities, they are heavily \ndependent on the United States to pay for advanced equipment such as \nintelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance platforms to support \ntheir NATO operations.\n  I agree with Secretary Gates' recent assessment, that NATO is turning \ninto a two-tiered alliance in which very few members except for the \nUnited States take on the hard power combat assignments. Instead, the \nmajority of the NATO partners limit themselves to soft power work such \nas delivering humanitarian aid. Indeed, of the 28 NATO members, only \n5--the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Greece,\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nand Albania--exceed the agreed-upon ratio of 2 percent of gross \ndomestic product to be spent on defense.\n  Two decades after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. share of \nNATO defense spending has now risen astoundingly to more than 75 \npercent. Secretary Gates put all of our efforts under NATO alliance \noperations together at 75 percent. We are all aware that the United \nStates is facing very hard and real serious fiscal constraints. Hence \nit is clear that we can no longer continue to pay for the vast majority \nof NATO operations that are not in the vital security interests of our \nNation. It is time for the United States to ask our allies to step up \nand keep the agreement they made when they became part of NATO, or for \nthe United States to consider reducing our spending level that we now \nprovide to NATO and also move to redeploy a large portion of our \nmilitary presence in Europe back to the United States.\n  I have spoken on the floor many times about my concerns for \nmaintaining such a large military presence in Europe and I will \ncontinue to fight for spending cuts to a largely unnecessary and \nexpensive U.S. military presence on the European continent. It was \ndecided in the last administration to cut back to two brigade combat \nteams in Europe, in Germany. We have now had the two be expanded to \nfour. The other two are now in limbo. So there are now four brigade \ncombat teams in Europe. Two were supposed to move back to the United \nStates and the military construction to house at least one of those has \nbeen done at a cost of over 400 million taxpayer dollars. So we have \nthe capability to bring home troops, taxpayers have spent $400 million \nin pursuit of that, the barracks sit empty, and we still have four \nbrigade combat teams in Europe, in Germany.\n  Unfortunately, here is the message we are sending to our European \nallies by that military presence, and by our operations in support of \nNATO, that American taxpayers are willing and able to shoulder the \nburden for their defense, and that there are apparently no consequences \nif the Europeans fail to do their fair share.\n\n  We need to change that message. We need to make our Nation's current \nfinancial difficulties a priority. Our message should be that NATO has \nbeen a valuable alliance for 60 years, and it can be in the future, \nwith a concerted effort by our allies to share the burden. That means \ntruly sharing. The United States should lead when and where our \ncapabilities are essential. We do have vast capabilities. When they are \nessential we have shown we will always be there. But others can lead \nwhere they have the capability to do so, and they need to do it with \npersonnel and with the appropriate level of funding.\n  The complacency of our allies is increasingly a threat to our \nnational security for we are shouldering more and more of the burden, \neven where our involvement is not in the vital interests of the United \nStates. The American taxpayer can no longer afford to write endless \nchecks for NATO operations. It is time for our allies to shoulder their \nresponsibilities and reduce their dependence on U.S. military forces.\n  We want to maintain our military strength. We have the greatest \nmilitary in the world. There is no doubt about that. But to keep our \nmilitary strong, we cannot over-deploy our forces. I have talked to \npeople who have been to Afghanistan six times on rotations--six times. \nMost of our people who have gone to Afghanistan have gone more than \nonce, and that is following all of the time they have been to Iraq as \nwell. We must keep our military strong by not overburdening them \nbecause our allies are not doing their share and supplying the troops \nthey agreed to provide when they became members of NATO. For us to keep \nthe strength we have, or to handle the big operations where we have the \nunique capabilities, we must be smarter about allocating and sharing \nthe responsibilities. We can continue to lead and take the biggest \nshare, but not 75 percent of the share and continue to remain strong, \nespecially with the financial constraints we have today.\n  We are in the midst of negotiating how we can lower our deficit so we \ndon't hit that $14 trillion debt ceiling without a plan for bringing \ndown the deficit so we will never have to lift that debt ceiling again. \nSo it is in everyone's interests for our allies to step up to the \nplate. They made agreements. It used to be a 3-percent gross domestic \nproduct commitment that was required for NATO. Now we are talking 2 \npercent, and only five countries--only five countries--meet that test. \nThat is not a sustainable alliance. If we allow them to drag down their \nstrongest member, it will not be in the interests of anyone if \nsomething big happens that requires an immediate and robust response.\n  So I appreciate that Secretary Gates, in his final days in office has \ntalked very straight to our NATO allies. I hope they are listening, and \nI hope they are prepared to act. Yes, they have financial constraints \ntoo; we understand that. But it is time the burden be shared. It is \ntime we have a real alliance in which we remain strong so we maintain \nthe strength to respond to the big emergencies when we are called. \nBeing dragged down by smaller contingencies that can be handled by \nothers, whether it is Kosovo or Libya--and, certainly, we also are \nconcerned about the situation in Syria and Yemen--we can let others be \nin the lead in those areas so that when the big things happen--such as \nAfghanistan which will continue to require our commitment--those major \nefforts can be led by the United States with our unique capabilities \nand our commitment.\n  Our military remains the best in the world. Our equipment is the best \nin the world. Our training is the best in the world. We need to \nmaintain that strength with an alliance that accepts its responsibility \nfor burden sharing. Where we are required to lead and are uniquely \ncapable we will do so but we cannot allow ourselves to be continually \nplaced in the position where these contingencies drag down our \ncapabilities for the future.\n  So I applaud Secretary Gates for starting this dialogue in earnest. \nWe have talked about it for a long time--for years, actually. We have \ntalked to our NATO allies about stepping up to the plate. Even in good \nfinancial times that didn't happen but for a few. I will say that Great \nBritain has always been there, and we have had other strong alliances, \nincluding Australia--not in NATO but certainly a strong ally. Canada is \nalso a strong ally, but it is time for us to reassess our contributions \nin NATO to preserve our strength so that we are there and prepared for \nmajor operations, which is in all of our interests.\n  Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. President, I am going to wait until the Senator from \nIllinois arrives before making a motion, but I wish to explain what I \nam going to do. I am going to make a motion when he does arrive.\n  I have an amendment. First of all, being the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have more than just a passive \ninterest in this EDA bill. But one of the things I have been trying to \ndo is get people to understand we have all these\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\namendments, and a lot of these amendments have nothing to do with the \nEconomic Development Administration. They have to do with everything \nelse that is out there. In fact, I am guilty of the same thing. I have, \nI think, five unrelated amendments. They are all good stuff, things I \nwish to get through, and that seems to be what this bill is all about.\n  But under all these amendments there is a bill and there is a reason \nfor introducing it. It is a foregone conclusion--I think we all \nunderstand if we were to pass the EDA bill out of here in any form \nsimilar to the way it was introduced, it would never pass the House, \nand that would be a done deal.\n  What I am going to attempt to do is--I am going to attempt today and \ntomorrow and however long it takes--to get an amendment in there that \nis going to provide oversight authority by the GAO. Through the audits \nand assessments, the GAO can ensure that the EDA grants are \ndistributed, and put some spending discipline in there, such as through \na competitive award process--it is all drafted in the amendment; by the \nway, the amendment is No. 459--and in accordance with the EDA criteria \nand requirements.\n  Additionally, the GAO would submit a report every year to the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the House T Committee, \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, to have efficiency \nassured.\n  What we are doing here is, instead of having a jump ball and saying \nwe are going to do any kind of an EDA program that we can sell through \nthe administration, we will actually have discipline in there so it \nwill have to be, first of all, gone over with the Government \nAccountability Office. Then, after that, it is not over because it has \nto come back to both committees in the House and the Senate. And, of \ncourse, I am the ranking member, and by the time that gets started, I \nmay end up being the chairman, if it is after the next election. But \nyou never know those things. So we would be able to look at it again.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to make certain that grant recipients \nare determined based on competitive procedures and to create more \naccountability for the EDA. Overall, I think Washington bureaucrats \nshould not be picking winners and losers but, instead, rely on a \nformula and strict rules to determine where agency dollars flow.\n  I know we are not on the bill now. We are still in morning business. \nI understand we are going to go back on the bill at 6 o'clock this \nevening. But I have to get a request in that my amendment be--at that \ntime, I am going to ask that the pending amendment be set aside for \nconsideration of amendment No. 459, which I have just described.\n  I think the chief complaint about some of the EDA process--by the \nway, I have to say about the EDA process, it has done so well in my \nState of Oklahoma. We had one project in Elgin, OK--a very small \ncommunity adjacent to the live range at Fort Sill--for a $2.25 million \nEDA grant. They ended up planning to construct a 150,000-square foot \nbuilding that would employ--the numbers were almost the entire \npopulation of Elgin, OK. It is something that would revive that part of \nthe State. The southern part of the State of Oklahoma and the south \ncentral part have historically been an area that is somewhat \nimpoverished, and through these EDA grants we have done a good job.\n  The good thing about EDA grants is they require a lot of local \nparticipation. Generally, it is through the city funds, the State \nfunds, and the county funds, and then an equal amount or a greater \namount from the private sector.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, the grants are usually about one to nine in \nterms of public participation. So the program is good. I am the first \none to admit, however, it may not work the same way in every State. I \ncan only say what our experience has been in Oklahoma.\n  What I am going to suggest with this amendment is something we are \ndoing anyway in Oklahoma. We are going through a competitive award \nprocess. That is a process that everyone understands. It is one that is \nall outlined in our rules. We know what they have to go through for \ncompetition. Then it is in accordance with the criteria.\n  The criteria is very important. One of these days we are going to get \naround to a transportation reauthorization bill that will come out of \nmy same committee. The last one we had was in 2005. Since then, that \nhas run out, and we are going kind of month to month. We have a dire \nneed for infrastructure in America with the roads, highways, and \nbridges. It is something we have fallen behind on, and we are going to \nbe getting to that.\n  The reason our 2005 bill was so successful in infrastructure for \ntransportation in the reauthorization bill is because we had a formula. \nThe formula took into consideration money to be spent on bridges and \nroads and highways, State by State, with such factors as to the \nfatalities in that State, the number of road lanes, miles, and all this \ncriteria. When we got through establishing the criteria in 2005, it \nmust have been good because nobody liked it. If it was something that \nupset everyone, then, obviously, it was one that was pretty good, and \nwe passed it. That was a $284.6 billion reauthorization bill. We should \nbe able to do something comparable now.\n  You might say, everyone is goosey about spending money nowadays. And \nthat is understandable with the deficits. President Obama's three \nbudgets have suggested and have put into effect $5 trillion of \ndeficit--not debt but deficit.\n  This last budget was around a little over $2.5 trillion. And I can \nremember back in 1995, back when President Clinton was in office, going \ndown to the floor and complaining because he had a budget to run the \nentire country of $1.5 trillion. Well, the deficit alone in the last \nbudget we have had here, as prescribed by the President, has exceeded \nthe amount it took to run the country during that period of time.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois is here. I would say to my good \nfriend from Illinois, what I am doing here is I am going to attempt \nnow--and it will be objected to, and I understand that because we are \nnot on the bill yet--I am going to continue to attempt to have an \naccountability amendment that takes the EDA process and subjects it to \na competitive award process, along with oversight by the GAO and by our \ncommittee and by the T Committee in the House of Representatives. I \nthink it is something that would make--frankly, if we do not do it, in \nmy opinion, there would be no way in the world that the House of \nRepresentatives would pass it. This offers discipline to it. I will go \nso far as to say that if we are not able to pass this amendment, to \nhave accountability, I will probably end up voting against the bill if \nit comes up for a vote.\n  So with that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \nresume consideration of S. 782 so that I can call up my amendment No. \n459 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what I am \nabout to say is no reflection on the Senator from Oklahoma nor the \nmerits of his amendment. We have almost 100 amendments filed and 17 \npending, and the majority leader has asked that we at least reflect on \nthose filed and set our schedule accordingly. I am not saying this will \nnot be considered, but at the moment we are going to object to the \noffering of additional amendments. So I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3806-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3806-S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, while it is important to address \nthe Federal budget deficit, too many Washington politicians have turned \na blind eye to the U.S. trade deficit. Working families in Ohio and our \nNation's manufacturers haven't forgotten about the devastating effects \nof our ballooning trade deficit.\n  How much bigger does our trade deficit need to get before Washington\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nwakes up and realizes we need a very different direction in trade? \nLet's put American workers and American businesses first for a change. \nLet's focus on enforcing existing trade laws and helping workers \nretrain for new jobs. Let's not pursue more of the same style of trade \nagreements that have wreaked havoc on our economy. That is really what \nthe debate over the Korea trade agreement and the Panama and the \nColombia Free Trade Agreements is all about.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Casey and I wrote a letter to the President, \nwhich 43 other Senators signed--in fact, it was signed by the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Rhode Island--affirming his decision to pass \ntrade adjustment assistance for workers before proceeding to the trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Our position on TAA \nhas been consistent since we asked unanimous consent to pass TAA in \nlate 2010. We need a long-term reauthorization regardless of what we do \non these free-trade agreements.\n  Senator Casey and I stood on this floor time after time, starting in \nDecember and into January and February, asking all of our colleagues to \nreauthorize, to extend trade adjustment assistance to those workers who \nlose their jobs through no fault of their own; they lose their jobs \nbecause of trade agreements this Congress passes and because of a trade \npolicy this administration and Congress has followed. We are likely \nfacing a situation in which TAA, unfortunately, is being linked with \nthe free-trade agreements.\n  If and when a deal is reached, we will examine both its contents and \nthe process in moving it forward. But when it comes to American \nworkers, we want at least a 5-year reauthorization of TAA, one that \nincludes the 2009 reforms and provides for an 80 percent health \ncoverage tax credit.\n  Time and time again a Republican Member stood up and objected to our \nmoving forward in helping American workers. I just don't understand, \nhow people here want to pass these trade agreements knowing that \nworkers will be dislocated, that plants will close down, people will \nlose jobs, and communities will be devastated because of the actions of \nthis body in passing trade agreements. Yet they say, no, they don't \nwant to do anything to help those workers.\n  That is why we believe TAA should be separate from the free-trade \nagreements. I ask my colleagues--especially those who call the free-\ntrade agreements with Korea and Panama and Colombia, the same people \nwho called NAFTA and CAFTA and PNTR with China job creators--if that is \nthe case, what sort of message does it send about these trade \nagreements if they must be linked to assistance for displaced workers? \nThey are saying the only way they want to do TAA is to connect it to \nKorea or connect it to Colombia or connect it to Panama. They are \nacknowledging, then, that when we pass these trade agreements, it is \ncosting us jobs. Why would we do that?\n  Because of that, Senator Casey and I want a clean vote on TAA and a \ntrade enforcement package, and we want to work with our colleagues to \nshape this package.\n  For the Korea Free Trade Agreement, I have two concerns. The first is \njobs--always jobs in these trade agreements. Ever since I have been in \neither the House or the Senate, every time there is a trade agreement--\nwhether it is the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, PNTR \nwith China--although not a trade agreement but allowing China into the \nWorld Trade Organization--or 2004 or 2005, if I remember right, when \nthe Central American Free Trade Agreement passed the Congress, and now \nwith Korea--the people behind these trade agreements have talked about \nall the jobs they will create. They tell us: Well, we are going to \nclose our trade deficit because of these trade agreements. Never does \nthat happen.\n  When we passed NAFTA, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. Today, as \nSenator Casey pointed out, we have a $90 billion trade deficit with \nMexico. When PNTR passed, my recollection from 12 years ago was that we \nhad about a $10 billion or $12 billion trade deficit with China. Now \nour annual trade deficit with China is $273 billion--last year. This \nyear, in 1 month it was $21 billion.\n  So, it is pretty clear the promises made with regard to these trade \nagreements and the reality that exists are different things. They do \nnot create jobs, they do not close our trade deficit, yet the promises \ncontinue. So my first problem with the Korea Free Trade Agreement is \njobs.\n  The ITC--the International Trade Commission--projects the Korea FTA \nwill increase the trade deficit, especially in auto parts, \ntransportation equipment, metal and iron, and textiles and apparel. The \neconomy is still facing extreme challenges. Since President Obama took \noffice--when we were losing 700,000 jobs a month in January and \nFebruary of 2009--we have seen some job growth. In the last 14 months, \nwe have seen manufacturing job growth for the first time since 1998. So \nthings are starting to turn around. But the last thing we do when the \neconomy is facing extreme challenges--the last thing we should do--is \npass a trade agreement of this magnitude with its short-term and long-\nterm effects on jobs.\n  Finally, we have an administration that is being a little more \ntruthful when it comes to promises about these trade agreements. As I \nsaid, during the NAFTA timeframe, we had President George H.W. Bush, \nand then President Clinton, who said it would provide all these jobs--\n200,000 jobs, I think one of them said. But this time, at least, the \nadministration is not saying they expect this is going to create jobs. \nThey say: This agreement is expected to support--whatever that means--\n70,000 jobs.\n  But let's do the math. The Congressional Budget Office said the cost \nof this trade agreement--yes, this trade agreement costs money because \nwe lose a lot of money in tariffs--is $7 billion over 10 years. That \nmeans if we are going to support--not create but support--70,000 jobs, \nand spend $7 billion to do it, the agreement costs about $100,000 for \nevery job supported--again, not created but every job supported.\n  This trade pact has unusually low rules of origin, allowing goods \nfrom Korea that are made with up to 65 percent of their parts from \nChina or other countries. When the European Union negotiated their \nKorea Free Trade Agreement, they had domestic content rules of 55 \npercent, meaning that 55 percent of the components in a product had to \ncome from South Korea.\n  The Obama administration improved this over the Bush agreement, but \nonly marginally, by saying only 35 percent has to come from Korea. That \nmeans 65 percent or two-thirds of the added value of the components of \nthese products shipped from Korea, with basically no tariffs coming to \nthe United States, can come from China or can come from a low-wage \ncountry with low or weak environmental laws and low worker standards \nand all of that. So it allows a back door for countries such as China \nto gain even more access to the American market.\n  We all recognize that we live in a world with global supply chains. \nBut this low domestic content threshold of 35 percent will clearly hurt \nAmerican manufacturers over the long term. So let's be clear. This is \nnot just a Korea Free Trade Agreement, it is effectively a global free-\ntrade agreement.\n  Second, the Korea FTA causes me concern because it includes what is \ncalled the ``investor-state'' enforcement in which a corporation is \nempowered to directly challenge laws as violations of a trade pact. \nBefore the North American Free Trade Agreement, there was no such thing \nas investor-state relations. That meant that a company could not sue \nanother foreign government. For instance, if the Canadians were unhappy \nwith some U.S. law, the Canadian Government could sue the U.S. \nGovernment, but a Canadian company couldn't sue the U.S. Government. So \nwhat these investor-state provisions do is to undermine sovereignty. It \nundermines what we have done in this body.\n  We fight in this body for strong clean air laws and strong \nenvironmental rules and strong pure food laws and strong consumer \nprotections. Under the investor-state relations, a company in Korea \ncould sue the U.S. Government for those kinds of strong environmental \nworkforce safety or food safety laws. We don't want to give a company \nin another country the standing to undermine our sovereignty on laws \nthat were democratically attained in this country.\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\n  This mechanism is not necessary for a pact between two countries with \nwell-established rules of law. We didn't do that in the U.S.-Australia \nFree Trade Agreement. It did not include these investor-state \nprovisions. Why would we do it now with Korea, which is also a country \nthat operates under a rule of law?\n  One more reason this Korea Free Trade Agreement undermines our \nsovereignty, weakens our environmental laws, weakens our food safety \nlaws, and dilutes what we stand for in the American values we hold so \ndear is about jobs, and it is about these investor-state provisions \nwhich undermine our sovereignty.\n  Before pursuing more of the same style of trade agreements that \ncaused our trade deficit to balloon to more than $600 billion, why not \nfocus on enforcing existing trade laws? We know some things we ought to \nbe doing before we look at passing new trade agreements. We need to \nbetter enforce trade laws. We have done that.\n  President Obama, to his credit--and again, I don't agree with him on \nthese trade agreements. I think he is wrong. But to his credit, more \nthan any President I think in at least 25 years, President Obama has \nbegun to enforce some trade rules. He enforced on oil country tubular \nsteel. His decision created hundreds of jobs in Youngstown and Lorain, \nOH. His decision on Chinese tires created hundreds of jobs in Findlay, \nOH, and other places around the State in tire-building. His and the \nCommerce Department's decision on the Chinese gaming the system on \ncoated paper, an industry that still exists in this country--not what \nit used to be, but it meant jobs in southwest Ohio and all over my \nState and all over States where paper is still manufactured in this \ncountry.\n  Another thing we should do before a new trade agreement is we should \nconsider reintroducing Super 301 so that we have the tools to fight \nback when countries such as China game the system.\n  I am working with the Republican Senator from Ohio, the Republican \nSenator from Missouri, the Democratic Senator from Missouri, and the \nDemocratic Senator from Oregon, Chairman Wyden of the Finance \nCommittee's subcommittee, to begin to enforce customs duties and make \nsure companies in countries that evade these customs duties can no \nlonger evade them. That will make a huge difference in job creation.\n  Those are the kinds of things we should be doing.\n  Paul Krugman, who has been a free-trader most of his life, a \ncolumnist for the New York Times, back in December said:\n\n       If you want a trade policy that helps employment, it has to \n     be a policy that induces other countries to run bigger \n     deficits or smaller surpluses. A countervailing duty of \n     Chinese exporting would be job creating here; a deal with \n     South Korea, not.\n\n  This comes from a Nobel Prize-winning economist, somebody who has in \nthe past been supportive of these free-trade agreements, believing that \nthey have created jobs. He realizes Korea won't create jobs. Beginning \nto enforce our trade laws is the way to go.\n  I will close with this. Some years ago, President Bush said that for \nevery billion-dollar trade surplus or every billion-dollar trade \ndeficit a country has, it translates into 13,000 jobs. In other words, \nif we have a trade deficit with China of $1 billion, that would mean we \nare selling to them $1 billion less than we are buying from them, and \nthe manufacture of those products we buy versus the ones we manufacture \nand sell is a net loss to the United States of 13,000 jobs. So for \nevery $1 billion trade surplus or trade deficit, it translates into \n13,000 jobs for that country.\n  The trade deficit with China last year was $273 billion. The trade \ndeficit we have with the entire world, the so-called multilateral trade \ndeficit, was $634 billion.\n  Mr. President, travel my State. Travel this country. See the kinds of \nmanufacturing job loss we have had. We have lost manufacturing jobs \nfrom 1998, the last 2 years of the Clinton administration, all 8 years \nof the Bush administration, and the first year and a half of the Obama \nadministration. We were losing manufacturing jobs through that whole \nprocess. Now we are starting to gain manufacturing jobs, but we can't \ncontinue to gain manufacturing jobs when we pass free-trade agreements \nthat clearly cause more companies to shut down in our country and more \nof those companies to move abroad.\n  The Korea Free Trade Agreement is a bad idea. It is imperative that \nwe do what the President has said we should do and what so many of my \ncolleagues have asked us to do; that is, pass trade adjustment \nassistance with a health coverage tax credit for those workers who have \nalready lost jobs from trade agreements and from trade policy. It is \nthe right thing to do. It is good for our country, it is good for our \neconomy, and it is especially good for workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3808-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, in April, the Senate unanimously passed the \nFood Safety Accountability Act. If enacted, this important bill will \nhold criminals who poison our food supply accountable for their crimes. \nNow more than ever, it is critical that the House pass this \nnoncontroversial legislation.\n  A recent E. coli outbreak in Germany--identified by scientists as a \nnew, deadly strain of the bacteria--has killed at least 35 people and \nspread to 10 countries. Thankfully, this particular outbreak has not \nyet hit the United States, but this tragedy, on the heels of several \nmajor outbreaks in the United States in recent years, highlights the \nimportance of ensuring that we take every step to protect our food \nsupply. The Food Safety Accountability Act promotes more accountability \nfor food suppliers by increasing the sentences that prosecutors can \nseek for people who violate our food safety laws in those cases where \nthere is conscious or reckless disregard of a risk of death or serious \nbodily injury.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who knowingly violate our food safety laws. Knowingly \ndistributing adulterated food is already illegal, but it is in most \ncases merely a misdemeanor right now, and the Sentencing Commission has \nfound that it generally does not result in jail time. The fines and \nrecalls that usually result from criminal violations under current law \nfall short in protecting the public from harmful products. Too often, \nthose who are willing to endanger our American citizens in pursuit of \nprofits view such fines or recalls as merely the cost of doing \nbusiness.\n  Last summer, a salmonella outbreak caused hundreds of people to fall \nill and triggered a national egg recall. Salmonella poisoning is all \ntoo common and sometimes results from inexcusable, knowing conduct like \nthat carefully targeted by the Food Safety Accountability Act. The \ncompany responsible for the eggs at the root of the last summer's \nsalmonella crisis had a long history of environmental, immigration, \nlabor, and food safety violations. It is clear that fines are not \nenough to protect the public and effectively deter this unacceptable \nconduct. We need to make sure that those who knowingly poison the food \nsupply will go to jail. This bill will significantly increase the \nchances that those who commit serious food safety crimes will face jail \ntime, rather than merely a slap on the wrist.\n  Food safety received considerable attention last year, and I was \npleased that Congress finally passed comprehensive food safety reforms, \nbut our work is not done. A provision almost identical to the Food \nSafety Accountability Act was passed by the House with strong, \nbipartisan support but failed to make it into the final legislation \nthat ultimately passed because of Republican objections in the Senate. \nNow that the Senate has unanimously passed this bill, it is again time \nfor the House to act.\n  The American people should be confident that the food they buy for \ntheir families is safe. The uncertainty and fear caused by the current \nE. coli outbreak in Europe only reinforces the\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nneed to pass the common sense Food Safety Accountability Act to protect \nour own food supply. I urge the House to quickly pass the Senate bill \nand join us in taking this important step toward protecting our food \nsupply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3809-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3809-S3810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORLD DAY AGAINST CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nacknowledge and celebrate the World Day Against Child Labor, which was \ncommemorated earlier this week.\n  An estimated 215 million children across the world are still trapped \nin the worst forms of child labor. A report issued by the International \nLabor Organization, ILO, in May 2010 offered some good news in the \nfight against child labor. There is a decline in the number of girls \ntrapped in child labor. There are fewer children doing hazardous work. \nWe are closer than ever to universal ratification of ILO Convention \n182, which prohibits the worst forms of child labor. Mr. President, 173 \nout of 192 participating nations have ratified this convention.\n  However, due to the economic crisis, there also have been setbacks. \nChild labor has been increasing among boys and in young people between \nthe ages of 15 and 17. Progress in reducing child labor in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica has stalled. While some people may point to the global economic \ncrisis as a cause of these setbacks, we cannot use this as an excuse \nfor complacency.\n  One can look at the country of Uzbekistan to see the dire need for \nmore action. According to School of Oriental and African Studies at the \nUniversity of London, over 2 million children are forcibly pulled from \nschool by government officials to work in cotton fields. Uzbek cotton \nis listed as a good produced by forced labor and child labor by the \nDepartment of Labor. It is listed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the State \nDepartment's Trafficking in Persons Report. Yet despite this clear, \ncompelling, and thoroughly documented evidence of Uzbekistan's abject \nfailure to live up to its international commitments under ILO \nConvention 182, business goes on as usual. Uzbekistan has received no \nsanction and continues to receive trade benefits from the United States \nunder the Generalized System of Preference.\n  The work performed by these children, stooped over to pick cotton \nunder a hot Sun, also falls under the category of hazardous work. \nHazardous work is by its very nature likely to harm the health and \nsafety of children. Hazardous work exposes children to physical, \nemotional, or even sexual abuse. It includes children working \nunderground in mines, underwater, at dangerous heights, or in confined \nspaces. Children work with dangerous machinery, equipment, and tools. \nThey may work in in unhealthy environments, exposed to hazardous \nsubstances like nicotine in tobacco fields or to extreme temperatures, \nnoise levels, or vibrations that can damage growing bodies. Some \nchildren are even forced to work such long hours that they are up for \nentire nights or are not allowed to return to their own home at the end \nof the day.\n  The ILO estimates that 115 million children perform hazardous work. \nForty-one million of these are girls and 74 million are boys. Sixty-two \nmillion are between the ages of 15 and 17, and 53 million are 14 years \nold or younger.\n  It is vitally important to get children out of the worst forms of \nchild labor, including hazardous work, so they may attend school, do \nwell in their studies, and gain the knowledge and skills necessary to \nbuild a decent life. To this end, the U.S. Government needs to approach \nthe scourge of child labor in a holistic manner. We need to address the \nunderlying poverty that forces so many children to forgo schooling in \norder to meet even their most basic needs.\n  Fortunately, through the Department of Labor, the United States has \nundertaken projects to do just that. In Ghana, DOL is working with the \nILO and the Government of Ghana to implement a new, holistic program to \nreduce child labor in the cocoa sector by 70 percent by 2020. This \neffort has gone hand-in-hand with a renewed effort by the international \ncocoa industry, which has pledged $7 million in new funding to this \nfight. I have been personally involved in this effort with my good \nfriend and colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Eliot \nEngel of New York.\n  In fact, this unified effort of the U.S. Government, the Ghanaian \nGovernment, and the cocoa industry recently reviewed innovative \nprograms proposed by the cocoa industry in support of its $7 million \npledge. It is my hope that this approach, governments working hand-in-\nhand with industry and implementing partners, can become a model to \ncombat the worst forms of child labor worldwide.\n  This is just one example of many Department of Labor programs that \nare in progress all over the world. Another such program, in Guatemala, \ntakes at-risk children and provides them afterschool activities that \nreinforce their education, giving them an opportunity for recreation \nand personal growth in stark contrast to the stunted prospects that \nfollow from being forced to work long hours. Another program, in \nLahore, Pakistan, has redesigned the looms people use to weave carpets, \neliminating hazards such as back injuries and bone deformities that \nhave plagued children. These and other Department of Labor projects \nform the backbone of U.S. efforts to combat the worst forms of child \nlabor.\n  It is not enough to do this just at the Department of Labor though. \nIn Afghanistan, a 2006 UNICEF report estimated that one in four \nchildren between the ages of 7 and 14 is subject to the worst forms of \nchild labor. As the Department of Defense and other departments are \nspending huge amounts of U.S. taxpayer dollars in Afghanistan, it is \nvitally important to require child labor protections in our various \nprograms and contracts in that country.\n  Starting this year, a Department of Defense contract to provide \nmarket access to Afghan carpet makers will work hand-in-hand with the \nproven GoodWeave certification system to assure that the carpets made \nunder this taxpayer-funded program are not made with the worst forms of \nchild labor.\n  So while there has been much progress made, and our efforts abroad \nare continuing to build success, we must remain vigilant, even here at \nhome. Regrettably, there are some States here in the United States that \nare trying to undermine the fundamental protections we have afforded to \nchildren for generations. For example, the Republican-controlled \nlegislature of Maine decided to pass a bill stripping State-level child \nlabor protections. Maine's Republican Governor decided it would be \nbetter for his State to take a step backward because he personally went \nto work at age 11, and, as he put it, ``It's not a big deal. Work \ndoesn't hurt anybody.''\n  Well, I would like to tell you how putting a job before children's \neducation can set them back. At a time when it seems that most new jobs \nrequire high skill levels, great harm is done by denying these children \na chance to acquire these skills. We need to be educating the next \ngeneration of doctors, engineers, and scientists. However, the OECD \nshows that the United States has slipped to the 23rd best country at \nscience education and 31st at math.\n  We are not going to catch up to other countries if our children are \nspending too much time working at McDonald's or Burger King. I agree \nthat having a part-time job after school or on weekends can be \nbeneficial. However, studies have shown that teenagers working more \nthan 20 hours a week have a greater tendency toward academic and \nbehavioral problems, as well as higher dropout rates. The United States \nshould aspire to being the country that outbuilds, outeducates and \noutinnovates. If we continue undermining our child labor laws and \nneglecting education, we will be the country that outgrills, outflips \nand outfries!\n  There are even some Members of the Senate who have questioned whether \nchild labor laws are constitutional. Apparently the protection of our \nmost vulnerable children from exploitation isn't part of protecting the \ngeneral welfare. Apparently the Supreme Court was incorrect when it \nunanimously upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act 70 years ago.\n  It is for all of these reasons that I continue the fight against the \nworst forms of child labor. It is also why I have come to the floor \ntoday to salute\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nthe World Day Against Child Labor. But 1 day is not enough. We should \nbe focused on the needs of these children not only on June 12 each year \nbut 365 days a year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3810-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SOUTHEASTERN DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenator Shelby's recently introduced bill, the Southeastern Disaster \nTax Relief Act, of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  As an Oklahoma native, I have seen and experienced just how \ndevastating severe weather can be. Since 1950, there have been \napproximately 3,300 tornadoes that have killed nearly 500 people in \nOklahoma alone. Scores more have been injured. According to the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, tornadoes cause $1.1 \nbillion of damage on average per year, and this does not account for \nthe unquantifiable cost of the loss of a loved one, a home, or a \nbusiness.\n  You may recall the F5 tornado that swept through Oklahoma on May 3, \n1999. This storm alone caused $1.9 billion in damages, killed 48 \npeople, and destroyed the town of Moore, OK. Survivors of this storm \ndescribed being trapped under the debris of their homes, the panicked \nrescue effort to find neighbors, and the overwhelming sadness \naccompanied by loss. When I visited Tushka, OK, on April 15 of this \nyear, following its devastating storms, I witnessed firsthand the same \ntype of devastation.\n  It is estimated that the damage caused by tornadoes in Oklahoma on \nMay 24 of this year will cost between $200 and $300 million. In \naddition, the storms in Joplin, MO, may have caused an additional $3 \nbillion in losses. Clearly, these areas are in need of assistance, \nparticularly since insurance payments will not remove out-of-pocket \nexpenses families and businesses will have to pay as they rebuild their \nlives.\n  Under the current Tax Code, there is some relief available to \nfamilies and businesses that experience damage in hard hit areas. In \naddition to being able to deduct most losses from the disaster on their \ntaxes, individuals who receive disaster mitigation assistance, such as \na FEMA grant, do not have to report the assistance as income. \nAdditionally, Congress has, in the past, passed a number of temporary \nprovisions to provide additional relief to victims of severe natural \ndisasters, such as the Heartland Relief Act, the Katrina Emergency Tax \nRelief Act, and the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act.\n  Senator Shelby's Southeastern Disaster Tax Relief Act does the same \nthing and provides targeted, temporary tax relief to folks who have \nbeen hit by strong storms in recent months. The provisions of his bill \nhave been selected from a number of the previous emergency tax relief \nacts enacted in past years. This is beneficial and worth mentioning \nbecause the IRS has already drafted guidance documents for all of the \nrelief provisions, making it easier for taxpayers to take advantage of \nthe relief. We also know the provisions in this bill will actually help \npeople recover. The relief has worked in the past, and it will work \nagain today.\n  Any individual or business located in a county that has been declared \na major disaster area by the president is eligible for the relief \nprovided by this bill if those counties are eligible for either \n``individual'' or ``individual and public'' assistance through FEMA.\n  These assistance designations are allowed only to the hardest hit \nareas. In my State of Oklahoma, the qualifying counties include \nCanadian, Delaware, Grady, Kingfisher, Logan, McClain, and Atoka. These \nare the areas around Piedmont, Tushka, and Grove, Oklahoma. Public \nassistance funds are generally made available to States and localities \nto help pay for the removal of debris and to repair, replace, and \nrestore disaster-damaged publicly owned facilities. Individual \nassistance, provided through FEMA and the SBA consists of grants and \nloans made directly to individuals. These grants are need-based, and \ncan be issued to provide temporary housing or to help repair or replace \na family's home if their insurance coverage falls short. In the most \nsevere cases, additional assistance is provided.\n  While it is good FEMA provides this assistance, many individuals and \nbusinesses will not qualify despite being hit hard by the storms. And \nwhile permanent tax provisions do help individuals and businesses \naccount for their losses and insurance payments, they do little beyond \nthat to help folks get back on their feet. This underscores the need \nfor the Southeastern Disaster Tax Relief Act.\n  Under the act, individuals would be allowed, among other things, to \nmake early withdrawals from their tax-preferred retirement plans \nwithout having to pay tax penalties. Current tax law discourages early \nwithdrawals by imposing a 10 percent tax penalty on most early \nwithdrawals from accounts like Roth IRAs. This is fine under normal \ncircumstances, but as individuals recover from disasters like this, \nthey should be able to tap into their own resources without being \npenalized. This will likely help many families avoid going into debt or \nrelying on government grants to repair their homes and property.\n  Individuals will also be able to deduct an unlimited amount of cash \ncharitable contributions to nonprofit entities when the donations are \nallocated toward disaster relief efforts in the affected areas. Current \npolicy limits the amount of income that can be deducted from charitable \ngiving. This bill would temporarily suspend this provision.\n  Businesses will be allowed to immediately expense 50 percent of the \ncost of demolishing and/or cleaning up damaged property. This will \nallow them to recognize their losses more quickly than current policy, \nwhich requires them to capitalize cleanup costs into the construction \nor repair of their property.\n  Small businesses will also be provided with a tax credit for 40 \npercent of wages up to $23,400 paid to employees retained while a \nbusiness is inoperable because of the storm. With unemployment hovering \naround 9 percent, this provision will help struggling employers retain \nand continue paying employees despite the fact that their business have \nbeen destroyed by the storm and remaining closed for business.\n  Public utility companies in Oklahoma and other states will be allowed \nto carry back the disaster losses to their property for 5 years. This \nwill allow them to quickly realize their losses from a tax perspective, \nand the consequent savings will be available for them to more swiftly \nrebuild their infrastructure so that service can be returned to their \ncustomers.\n  Lastly, States will be allowed to float additional private activity \nbonds beyond the caps presently set by statute. The amount will be \nlimited by the number of people whose primary residence is located in \nthe areas affected by the disasters.\n  The provisions I mentioned are only a sample of what is provided in \nthis bill. I must underscore, however, that this bill is highly \ntargeted and temporary. It is also deficit neutral. Most of the \nprovisions in the bill only last for the next year or so; others expire \nat the end of 2013 and 2014. In total, this bill is expected to provide \nover $5 billion in tax relief.\n  This bill has been designated an emergency--as I believe it should \nbe. It is targeted, temporary relief in response to an unpredictable \ndisaster. Usually we do not require ourselves to find immediate savings \nto offset the cost of emergency provisions, but in our present age of \ntrillion dollar deficits, we need to offset deficits wherever possible. \nSenator Shelby has offset the cost of this bill by rescinding $12 \nbillion in unobligated appropriations that remain unexpired. This \nprovision applies to all Departments except the Departments of Defense \nand Veterans Affairs.\n  In short, this bill is a necessary and commonsense tax proposal to \nhelp tornado victims. It is also fully paid for, making it fiscally \nresponsible. I urge swift consideration and passage of this act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3810-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3810-S3811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY BOGER\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of my longtime \nstaff members, who has decided for the second time to leave my employ. \nDorothy Boger's service as part of my staff started on the first day I \nbecame a Member of Congress; she was the veteran staffer, the only one \nwith any Hill experience, on my first day in office in 1993. While her \njob title was scheduler,\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nshe did so much more. She came to my office with several years of \nexperience working for her home State Congressman, the Honorable Clyde \nC. Holloway of Louisiana, and the training that she received there \nserved me very well over the next 18 years. On that first day, my \noffice was one of the few that had staplers, copy paper, and wastepaper \nbaskets--all because Dorothy already knew what to expect coming into a \nbrand-new office. During my 6 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Dorothy oversaw my office operation and my schedule; \nshe kept us running, paid attention to the details and made sure that \neveryone from Idaho got a dose of Southern charm. We often say that she \nis from southern Idaho, way southern Idaho.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1998, Dorothy came with me to \nstart up another office on the other side of the Hill. But, by that \ntime, her family priorities had shifted and after a few months, she \nrealized that she needed to be home with her young son and soon after \nshe had another on the way. It was hard to say good-bye the first time, \nand it was terrific when an opportunity presented itself that was \nperfect to bring her back to the office. She has contributed in the \nsecond go-round in the communications field, and it is difficult to \nrecognize that she means it this time when she says she is retiring.\n  Dorothy's priorities have always been very clear. She and her husband \nBill have a young family, and she has been able to arrange her schedule \nto be with them as much as possible. But this year has been very trying \nfor her as she has faced the loss of her beloved mother and eldest \nsister. She says that it has brought those priorities into even sharper \nfocus, and I cannot argue with her desire to spend time at home, have \nthe opportunity to visit family who live far away and enjoy more \nfreedom to accomplish all that makes her most happy.\n  We will miss her deeply, and for far more reasons than the delicious \ndouble chocolate Ghirardelli brownies that she frequently brings to the \noffice to share. Her positive spirit and support have left an indelible \nmark, and I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3811-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               USGS ALBUQUERQUE SEISMOLOGICAL LABORATORY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

I would like to congratulate the ASL for 50 years of \ndistinguished service to the State of New Mexico.\n  From its quiet location just outside of Albuquerque on the Isleta \nPueblo, ASL has become an indispensable hub for seismological research \nover the past 50 years.

Additionally, ASL provides vital data used to help monitor and \ndetect nuclear tests by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, \nCTBTO.\n  I thank the ASL for its important contributions to both the \nscientific community and the public good and wish it success in the \nnext 50 years and more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3811-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO JESSIE RUTH WALTON AND FRANCIS JAMES WALTON\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is crucial that we never forget \nto honor our veterans for their service and dedication to this nation. \nAs the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I would like \nto recognize and applaud the service of Mr. Francis James Walton and \nMrs. Jessie Ruth Walton, both of whom served our Nation during World \nWar II and turn 90 years old this year.\n  Mrs. Jessie Ruth Walton was born in Exeter, VA, on May 31, 1921. \nHeeding the call to service, she enlisted in the Navy WAVES in 1943 and \nwent on to serve her country during World War II as a pharmacist, \ndispensing needed medicine for the troops in Washington, DC, and in \nLong Beach, CA.\n  Mr. James Walton, Jessie's husband, was born in Cadillac, MI, on July \n14, 1921. He enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 1941. He served in \nCarlson's Raiders of the 2d Marine Battalion, an elite unit that was \namong the first U.S. special operations forces to see combat in World \nWar II. Jim's time in the Marines included deployment to the South \nPacific, where he fought in Bougainville and Guadalcanal Island, \ncontributing to a strategic victory that turned the tide for the Allied \nforces in the Pacific. A valiant warrior, he spent 30 days fighting \nbehind enemy lines, 30 days that must have felt a lifetime.\n  Following World War II, Jim returned to Michigan, where he obtained a \ncollege degree and married Jessie Ruth Meade. After his time in the \nservice, Jim began teaching and ultimately found a rewarding career at \nGeneral Motors, where he worked for 30 years before retiring. Together, \nJim and Jessie raised a family of four children--James, Susan, Julie, \nand Jane--who have picked up the mantle of their parents in service to \ntheir communities in a range of capacities. In particular, I am \ndelighted to note that their son Jim serves as president of Centralia \nCollege in my home State of Washington. Mr. and Mrs. Walton are also \nfortunate to have 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.\n  I am delighted to extend birthday wishes and gratitude to the Waltons \non this joyous occasion. I wish them and their family all the best as \nthey celebrate this wonderful milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3811-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3811-S3812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STEPHANIE WHEELER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of Social Security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, together \nwith Senator Snowe, legislation today to protect one of Americans' most \nvaluable but vulnerable assets: Social Security numbers.\n  The Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act would \nprotect personal privacy and reduce identity theft by eliminating the \nunnecessary use and display of Social Security numbers.\n  Since the 106th Congress, I have worked to safeguard Social Security \nnumbers. I believe that the widespread display and use of these numbers \nposes a significant, and entirely preventable, threat to Americans' \npersonal privacy.\n  In 1935, Congress authorized the Social Security Administration to \nissue Social Security numbers as part of the Social Security program. \nSince that time, Social Security numbers have become the best known and \neasiest way to identify individuals in the United States.\n  Use of these numbers has expanded well beyond their original purpose. \nSocial Security numbers are now used for everything from credit checks \nto rental agreements to employment verifications, among other purposes. \nThey can be found in privately held databases and on public records, \nincluding marriage licenses, professional certifications, and countless \nother public documents, many of which are available on the Internet.\n  Once accessed, the numbers act like keys, allowing thieves to open \ncredit card and bank accounts and even begin applying for government \nbenefits.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, between 8 and 10 million \nAmericans have their identities stolen by such thieves each year, at a \ncombined cost of billions of dollars.\n  What's worse, victims often do not realize that a theft has occurred \nuntil much later, when they learn that their credit has been destroyed \nby unpaid debt on fraudulently opened accounts.\n  One thief stole a retired Army Captain's military identification card \nand used his Social Security number, listed on the card, to go on a 6-\nmonth, $260,000 shopping spree. By the time the Army Captain realized \nwhat had happened, the thief had opened more than 60 fraudulent \naccounts.\n  A single mother of two went to file her taxes and learned that a \nfraudulent return had already been filed in her name by someone else, a \nthief who wanted her refund check.\n  A former pro-football player received a phone call notifying him that \na $1 million home mortgage loan had been approved in his name even \nthough he had never applied for such a loan.\n  Identity theft is serious. Once an individual's identity is stolen, \npeople are often subjected to countless hours and costs attempting to \nregain their good name and credit. In 2004, victims spent an average of \n300 hours recovering from the crime. The crime disrupts lives and can \ndestroy finances.\n  It also hurts American businesses. A 2006 online survey by the \nBusiness Software Alliance and Harris Interactive found that nearly 30 \npercent of adults decided to shop online less or not at all during the \nholiday season because of fears about identity theft.\n  When people's identities are stolen, they often do not know how the \nthieves obtained their personal information. Social security numbers \nand other key identifying data are displayed and used in such a \nwidespread manner that individuals could not successfully restrict \naccess themselves.\n  Limitations on the display of Social Security numbers are critically \nneeded.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and I \nworked together to pass a bill to prevent Federal, State, and local \nentities from printing social security numbers on government checks and \nto prohibit government entities from employing prisoners in jobs like \ndata entry that gave them access to people's social security numbers.\n  But comprehensive legislation is still needed.\n  The U.S. Government Accountability Office conducted studies of this \nproblem in 2002 and 2007. Both times--in studies entitled Social \nSecurity Numbers Are Widely Used by Government and Could Be Better \nProtected and Social Security numbers: Use Is Widespread and Could Be \nImproved, the GAO concluded that current protections are insufficient \nand that serious vulnerabilities remain.\n  The Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act would \nrequire government agencies and businesses to do more to protect \nAmericans' Social Security numbers. The bill would stop the sale or \ndisplay of a person's Social Security number without his or her express \nconsent; prevent Federal, State, and local governments from displaying \nSocial Security numbers on public records posted on the Internet; limit \nthe circumstances in which businesses could ask a customer for his or \nher Social Security number; commission a study by the Attorney General \nregarding the current uses of Social Security numbers and the impact on \nprivacy and data security; and institute criminal and civil penalties \nfor misuse of Social Security numbers.\n  I believe this legislation could play a critical role in halting the \ngrowing epidemic of identity theft that has been plaguing America and \nits citizens.\n  As President George W. Bush's Identity Theft Task Force reported to \nus now three years ago, ``[i]dentity theft depends on access to . . . \ndata. Reducing the opportunities for thieves to get the data is \ncritical to fighting the crime.''\n  Every agency to study this problem has agreed that the problem will \ncontinue to grow over time and that action is needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting the Privacy of Social \nSecurity Numbers Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of Social \n     Security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used Social Security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that Social \n     Security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     Social Security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of Social Security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of Social Security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a Social Security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Chairman of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission to impose unilaterally position limits and margin \nrequirements to eliminate excessive oil speculation, and to take other \nactions to ensure that the price of crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, \njet fuel, and heating oil accurately reflects the fundamentals of \nsupply and demand, to remain in effect until the date on which the \nCommission establishes position limits to diminish, eliminate, or \nprevent excessive speculation as required by title VII of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think every American understands that \nthe very high price of oil and gas is having a very negative impact on \nour fragile economic recovery. Also, in rural States, such as Vermont, \nMontana, and other rural States, it is wreaking real hardship on \nworking people who in many cases drive long distances to work. In \nVermont certainly, it is not uncommon for people to be driving 50 miles \nto their job and 50 miles back. When the price of gas gets to be $3.80 \na gallon or $4 a gallon, it really hurts. When wages are stagnant, when \nmany people have seen a decline in their paychecks, high gas prices \nhave just taken another chunk out of their limited income. It is \nsomething that as a Congress we have to address.\n  The price of oil today, while declining somewhat in recent weeks, is \nstill over $97 a barrel. In Vermont, it is over $3.80 a gallon at the \npump. The theory behind the setting of oil prices that we learned in \nhigh school is that oil prices are set by supply and demand. When there \nis limited supply and a lot of demand, oil prices go up. When there is \na lot of supply and limited demand, oil prices should go down.\n  So let's be clear: The fact is today there is more supply than there \nwas 2 years ago, today there is less demand than there was 2 years ago; \ntherefore, oil prices should be substantially lower than was the case 2 \nyears ago. The fact, however, is just the opposite. In Vermont today, \ngas prices are $3.80 a gallon. Two years ago, they were approximately \n$2.44 a gallon. So the explanation of supply and demand in terms of why \noil prices have soared just does not carry any weight.\n  While we cannot ignore the fact that big oil companies have been \ngouging consumers at the pump for years and have made almost $1 \ntrillion in profits over the past decade, there is mounting evidence \nthat the increased price of gasoline and oil has nothing to do with \nsupply and demand and everything to do with Wall Street speculators who \nare dominating the oil futures market and driving prices up, up, and \nup. Ten years ago, speculators only controlled about 30 percent of that \nmarket. Today, Wall Street speculators control over 80 percent--over 80 \npercent--of the oil futures market, and many of them will never use one \ndrop of that oil. So we are not talking about airlines that use gas and \noil. We are not talking about trucking companies. We are not talking \nabout home heating companies. We are talking about speculators whose \nonly function in this entire process is to make as much money as they \ncan by raising prices and then selling.\n  This is not just Senator Bernie Sanders making this point. Let me \nquote from a June 2 article from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Wall Street is tapping a real gusher in 2011, as heightened \n     volatility and higher prices of oil and other raw materials \n     boost banks' profits . . . by 55 percent in the first \n     quarter.\n\n  Banks' profits are soaring as a result of oil speculation. That is \nthe fact. It is not just the Wall Street Journal. The CEO of \nExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, in response to a question at a recent Senate \nhearing, estimated that speculation was driving up the price of a \nbarrel of oil by as much as 40 percent. That is the CEO of ExxonMobil. \nHe might know something about that issue.\n  The general counsel of Delta Airlines--a major consumer of fuel--Ben \nHirst, and the experts at Goldman Sachs have all said that excessive \nspeculation is causing oil prices to spike by 20 to 40 percent.\n  Even Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, told the \nBush administration back in 2008--when the Bush administration went to \nthem and said: We need to drive prices down. Produce more oil. Sell \nmore oil--they said that is not the problem. Saudi Arabia said: We have \nall the oil we need. The problem is speculation. And they estimated \nthat speculation could result in about $40 a barrel.\n  In other words, the same Wall Street speculators who caused the worst \nfinancial crisis since the 1930s through their greed, recklessness, and \nillegal behavior are back at it again, and this time they are ripping \noff the American people by gambling that the price of oil\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nand gas will continue to go up and up and in that process are driving \nthe price of gas and oil up and up.\n  Sadly--and this is the important point--this spike in oil and \ngasoline prices was entirely avoidable. This was avoidable. The Wall \nStreet Reform Act that we passed last year, the Dodd-Frank legislation, \nrequired--underline ``required''--the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to impose strict limits on the amount of oil Wall Street \nspeculators could trade in the energy futures market by January 17 of \nthis year.\n  We passed legislation that said to the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission: You have to impose rules by January 17 with strict limits \non excessive oil speculation.\n  Mr. President, 6 months have come and gone. They have not done what \nthey were required to do.\n  Almost 5 months later, the CFTC has still not imposed those \nspeculation requirements. In other words, the chief regulator on oil \nspeculation is clearly breaking the law and is not doing what he is \nsupposed to be doing.\n  Last month I held a meeting in my office with Mr. Gary Gensler, who \nis the Chairman of the CFTC, and six other Senators. I have to tell you \nthat I was extremely disappointed in both the tone of that meeting and \nthe complete lack of urgency at the CFTC with respect to cracking down \non oil speculators as required by the law.\n  Therefore, today I have introduced legislation, along with Senators \nBlumenthal, Merkley, Franken, Whitehouse, and Bill Nelson to end \nexcessive speculation once and for all--once and for all. The American \npeople cannot continue to be ripped off by Wall Street which is \nartificially driving up the price of oil and gas.\n  I am very pleased to also announce that Congressman Maurice Hinchey \nwill be introducing this legislation in the House. This legislation \nmandates that the Chairman of the CFTC take immediate action to \neliminate excessive oil speculation within 2 weeks--2 weeks.\n  One. Our bill requires the Chairman to establish speculative oil \nposition limits equal to the position accountability levels that have \nbeen in place at the New York Mercantile Exchange since 2001.\n  Two. This bill requires the Chairman of the CFTC to double the margin \nrequirements on speculative oil trading so that Wall Street investment \nbanks back their bets with real capital.\n  Three. Under this bill, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other Wall \nStreet investment banks engaged in proprietary oil trading would be \nclassified as speculators instead of bona fide hedgers.\n  Four. The Chairman of the CFTC would be required under this bill to \ntake any other action necessary to eliminate excessive speculation and \nensure that the price of oil accurately reflects the fundamentals of \nsupply and demand.\n  I am pleased to announce that this legislation already has the \nsupport of a very diverse group of organizations representing small \nbusinesses, fuel dealers, consumers, workers, airlines, and farmers. \nSome of those organizations are: Americans for Financial Reform; the \nConsumer Federation of America; Delta Airlines; the Gasoline and \nAutomotive Service Dealers of America; the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters; the Main Street Alliance; the National Farmers Union; New \nEngland Fuel Institute; Public Citizen; and the Vermont Fuel Dealers \nAssociation. This is just a few.\n  I want to thank all of those organizations for their support. The \nAmerican people are sick and tired of being ripped off at the gas pump. \nPeople in the northern States, whether it is Vermont or Minnesota, \nworry about what the price of home heating oil will be next winter. \nWhat we are seeing now in terms of excessively high oil and gas prices \nhas nothing to do with supply and demand and everything to do with Wall \nStreet speculation.\n  This Congress has told the CFTC to act. They have failed to act. Now \nis the time for us to tell them exactly what must happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Tester, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Begich, Mr. \n        Cardin, and Mr. Udall of Colorado:\n  S. 1201. A bill to conserve fish and aquatic communities in the \nUnited States through partnerships that foster fish habitat \nconservation, to improve the quality of life for the people of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National Fish \nHabitat Conservation Act, which I am introducing today along with my \ncolleagues Senators Crapo, Tester, Bingaman, Murkowski, Whitehouse, \nBegich, Cardin, and Mark Udall. This legislation would establish the \nmost comprehensive effort ever attempted to treat the causes of fish \nhabitat decline.\n  Healthy waterways and robust fish populations are vital to the well-\nbeing of our society and are a staple in many cultures throughout the \nUnited States. This bill will help provide clean water and sustainable \nfisheries in this country and provide recreational value to those who \nfish wild waters or canoe tranquil streams. This means more \nrecreational fishing opportunity, which translates into more jobs and \neconomic output. Currently, recreational fishing supports approximately \none million jobs and $45 billion in direct expenditures. Today, nearly \nhalf, 40 percent, of our fish populations are in decline, over 700 \nspecies in total, and 50 percent of our Nation's waters are impaired. \nUnless we act in an informed and coordinated fashion, fish habitats \nwill continue to be lost at a rapid pace. This bill is about better \nhabitat, better recreational fishing opportunity as well as a better \neconomy.\n  Currently, our Nation's efforts to address threats to fish species \nare often highly disjointed and not extensive enough to reverse this \ndownward trend. Under the National Fish Habitat Conservation Act, \nFederal Government agencies, State and local governments, conservation \ngroups, fishing industry groups and related businesses will work \ntogether collectively for the first time to conserve and protect \naquatic habitats critical to our Nation. The National Fish Habitat \nConservation Act will also provide people with clean and safe water \nsupplies and improve ecosystems through habitat conservation projects \nthat remediate problems on our waterways, including erosion, drainage \nissues and flooding.\n  This legislation leverages Federal, State, and private funds to build \nregional partnerships aimed at addressing the Nation's biggest aquatic \nhabitat problems. By directing critical resources towards this cause \nthrough partnerships, we can foster fish habitat conservation efforts \nand improve the quality of life for all Americans. Using a bottom-up \napproach, the goal of this effort is to foster landscape scale, multi-\nstate aquatic habitat improvements across the country that perpetuate \nnot only fishery resources but the tradition of recreational fishing, \nwhich is enjoyed by many Americans, spanning many generations. Over 40 \nmillion anglers utilize our waterways on a yearly basis, generating $45 \nbillion dollars in retail sales for the industry nationwide. That \nfigure does not even include Americans who utilize our waterways for \nother recreational purposes.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act authorizes grants to be \ndirected toward fish habitat projects that are supported by regional \nFish Habitat Partnerships. Based on the highly successful North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act model, this legislation establishes \na multi-stakeholder National Fish Habitat Board charged with \nrecommending projects to the Secretary of Interior for assistance. \nRegional Fish Habitat Partnerships are responsible for implementing \napproved on-the-ground projects that are designed to protect, restore \nand enhance fish habitats and fish populations.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act lays the foundation for a \nnew paradigm of how to care for fish habitats, displaying why they \nshould be restored and protected. This bill will bring together all of \nthe different groups that have a stake in the health and productivity \nof our Nation's fish habitats and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this important legislation and reverse the decline \nof our ailing waterways and fisheries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) healthy populations of fish and other aquatic organisms \n     depend on the conservation, protection, restoration, and \n     enhancement of aquatic habitats in the United States;\n       (2) aquatic habitats (including wetlands, streams, rivers, \n     lakes, estuaries, coastal and marine ecosystems, and \n     associated riparian upland habitats that buffer those areas \n     from external factors) perform numerous valuable \n     environmental functions that sustain environmental, social, \n     and cultural values, including recycling nutrients, purifying \n     water, attenuating floods, augmenting and maintaining stream \n     flows, recharging ground water, acting as primary producers \n     in the food chain, and providing essential and significant \n     habitat for plants, fish, wildlife, and other dependent \n     species;\n       (3) the extensive and diverse aquatic habitat resources of \n     the United States are of enormous significance to the economy \n     of the United States, providing--\n       (A) recreation for 44,000,000 anglers;\n       (B) more than 1,000,000 jobs and approximately \n     $125,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     recreational fishing; and\n       (C) approximately 500,000 jobs and an additional \n     $35,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     commercial fishing;\n       (4) at least 40 percent of all threatened species and \n     endangered species in the United States are directly \n     dependent on aquatic habitats;\n       (5) certain fish species are considered to be ecological \n     indicators of aquatic habitat quality, such that the presence \n     of those species in an aquatic ecosystem reflects high-\n     quality habitat for other fish;\n       (6) loss and degradation of aquatic habitat, riparian \n     habitat, water quality, and water volume caused by activities \n     such as alteration of watercourses, stream blockages, water \n     withdrawals and diversions, erosion, pollution, \n     sedimentation, and destruction or modification of wetlands \n     have--\n       (A) caused significant declines in fish populations \n     throughout the United States, especially declines in native \n     fish populations; and\n       (B) resulted in economic losses to the United States;\n       (7)(A) providing for the conservation and sustainability of \n     fish and other aquatic organisms has not been fully realized, \n     despite federally funded fish and wildlife restoration \n     programs and other activities intended to conserve aquatic \n     resources; and\n       (B) that conservation and sustainability may be \n     significantly advanced through a renewed commitment and \n     sustained, cooperative efforts that are complementary to \n     existing fish and wildlife restoration programs and clean \n     water programs;\n       (8) the National Fish Habitat Action Plan provides a \n     framework for maintaining and restoring aquatic habitats to \n     ensure perpetuation of populations of fish and other aquatic \n     organisms;\n       (9) the United States can achieve significant progress \n     toward providing aquatic habitats for the conservation and \n     restoration of fish and other aquatic organisms through a \n     voluntary, nonregulatory incentive program that is based on \n     technical and financial assistance provided by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (10) the creation of partnerships between local citizens, \n     Indian tribes, Alaska Native organizations, corporations, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and Federal, State, and tribal \n     agencies is critical to the success of activities to restore \n     aquatic habitats and ecosystems;\n       (11) the Federal Government has numerous regulatory and \n     land and water management agencies that are critical to the \n     implementation of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan, \n     including--\n       (A) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;\n       (B) the Bureau of Land Management;\n       (C) the National Park Service;\n       (D) the Bureau of Reclamation;\n       (E) the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n       (F) the National Marine Fisheries Service;\n       (G) the Forest Service;\n       (H) the Natural Resources Conservation Service; and\n       (I) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (12) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the \n     Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service each play a vital role in--\n       (A) the protection, restoration, and enhancement of the \n     fish communities and aquatic habitats in the United States; \n     and\n       (B) the development, operation, and long-term success of \n     fish habitat partnerships and project implementation;\n       (13) the United States Geological Survey, the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service each play a vital role in scientific evaluation, data \n     collection, and mapping for fishery resources in the United \n     States;\n       (14) the State and territorial fish and wildlife agencies \n     play a vital role in --\n       (A) the protection, restoration, and enhancement of the \n     fish communities and aquatic habitats in the respective \n     States and territories; and\n       (B) the development, operation, and long-term success of \n     fish habitat partnerships and project implementation; and\n       (15) many of the programs for conservation on private \n     farmland, ranchland, and forestland that are carried out by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, including the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service and the State and Private Forestry \n     programs of the Forest Service, are able to significantly \n     contribute to the implementation of the National Fish Habitat \n     Action Plan through the engagement of private landowners.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage \n     partnerships among public agencies and other interested \n     parties consistent with the mission and goals of the National \n     Fish Habitat Action Plan--\n       (1) to protect and maintain intact and healthy aquatic \n     habitats;\n       (2) to prevent further degradation of aquatic habitats that \n     have been adversely affected;\n       (3) to reverse declines in the quality and quantity of \n     aquatic habitats to improve the overall health of fish and \n     other aquatic organisms;\n       (4) to increase the quality and quantity of aquatic \n     habitats that support a broad natural diversity of fish and \n     other aquatic species;\n       (5) to improve fisheries habitat in a manner that leads to \n     improvement of the annual economic output from recreational, \n     subsistence, and commercial fishing;\n       (6) to ensure coordination and facilitation of activities \n     carried out by Federal departments and agencies under the \n     leadership of--\n       (A) the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service;\n       (B) the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreaffirm the United States' historic commitment to protecting refugees \nwho are fleeing persecution or torture; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nRefugee Protection Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senators \nLevin, Akaka, and Durbin, will reaffirm the commitments our Nation made \nin ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention, and help to restore the \nUnited States as a global leader on human rights. This bill would \nrepeal the most harsh and unnecessary elements of current law, and \nrestore the United States to its rightful role as a safe and welcoming \nhome for those suffering from persecution around the world.\n  During this challenging economic time, it can be tempting to look \ninward rather than to fulfill our global humanitarian commitments. \nHowever, this bill is necessary now more than ever. Millions of \nrefugees remain displaced and warehoused in refugee camps in Eastern \nAfrica, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. The ``Arab \nSpring'' is helping to move governments of the Middle East toward \ndemocracy, but some governments have responded to peaceful \ndemonstrations with violence. We will continue to see genuine refugees \nwho are in need of protection. I was pleased to be able to protect \nfunding for refugee assistance and resettlement programs in the fiscal \nyear 2011 appropriations continuing resolution, when many other \nprograms were cut.\n  In my home state of Vermont, I have seen how the admission of \nrefugees and asylum seekers has revitalized and enriched communities, \nresulting in the creation of new businesses, safer neighborhoods, and \nstronger schools. Since Senator Ted Kennedy authored the 1980 Refugee \nAct, more than 2.6 million refugees and asylum seekers have been \ngranted protection in the United States. And since 1989, almost 5,600 \nrefugees have been resettled in Vermont. We are fortunate to have the \nVermont Refugee Resettlement Program, with its decades of experience \nand award-wining volunteer program, leading this effort. Over the last \nfive years, many of these new Vermonters have come from Bhutan, Burma, \nand the Congo. Their culture is enriching my historically Anglo Saxon \nand French Canadian state.\n  Once resettled, these refugees have become nursing assistants, soccer \ncoaches, and small business owners. In Burlington's Old North End, \nthere are two thriving halal markets, side by side. The Nadia \nInternational Halal Market is run by an Iraqi refugee. Next door is the \nBanadir Market, run by a Somali Bantu refugee. Vermonters enjoy these \nnew additions to the culture, and these thriving small businesses \ncreate local jobs in a historically disadvantaged neighborhood.\n  Equally important are the family- and community-based values of these \nnew Vermonters. The Burlington Chief of Police has commented that \nrefugees have reduced crime in some historically troubled areas, \ncreating more family oriented neighborhoods.\n  Vermonters have played a tremendous role in welcoming refugees and \nasylees to their communities. Many have hosted refugee families in \ntheir homes until suitable housing could be found. The Ohavi Zedek \nSynagogue has made an effort to help all refugee families, regardless \nof their faith. The synagogue offers free English language classes so \nthat refugees can improve their English skills. In this year's Passover \nservice, refugees were encouraged to share their own personal tales of \nexodus.\n  The synagogue also runs a thrift shop where refugees who have been in \nthe country for less than a year are allowed to take whatever they need \nwithout charge. Yet, a refugee from Bhutan has offered to help make \nphysical improvements to the building's foundation, a testament to his \ndesire to give back to the communities that have helped refugees build \nnew lives. Many other places of worships have also reached out to these \nnew Vermonters.\n  The Association for Africans Living in Vermont, AALV, which now \nassists any refugee in Vermont regardless of the country of origin, \nhelps refugees access social services, organizes community cultural \nevents, and provides cross-cultural training to Vermont service \nproviders. The organization offers workforce development programs to \nensure refugees can find meaningful work that sustains their families. \nThe AALV New Farms for New Americans program enables refugees, many of \nwhom farmed in their home countries, to learn to grow crops well suited \nto the Vermont climate. This program can connect such refugees to their \nheritage, and invites them to become part of Vermont's longstanding and \nvibrant agricultural tradition.\n  In cooperation with Vermont Adult Learning, AALV offers the Personal\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nCare Assistant Workforce Training Program, which trains refugees to \nserve as personal care assistants, the first level of service in the \nnursing profession. Graduates are able to pursue additional training as \na licensed nursing assistant.\n  Vermont's resettlement program and the community support are not \nwithout their challenges. We experience many of the same hurdles faced \nby resettlement efforts and receiving communities across the Nation. \nThe Refugee Protection Act of 2011 includes provisions that will help \nthe nationwide resettlement effort operate more effectively. I want to \nacknowledge the leadership of Senator Lugar who has investigated the \nresettlement program and called for a GAO study to obtain \nrecommendations for improvement. I also appreciate the efforts of \nRepresentative Gary Peters of Michigan, who introduced a resettlement \nbill in the House of Representatives to improve communication among all \nstakeholders.\n  In addition to support and improvement of the resettlement program, \nthis bill addresses several areas of domestic asylum adjudication that \nare in need of significant reform. This bill would repeal the one-year \nfiling deadline for asylum seekers, removing an unnecessary barrier to \nprotection. The bill would allow arriving aliens and minors to seek \nasylum first before the Asylum Office rather than referring those cases \nimmediately to immigration court. The Asylum Office is well trained to \nscreen for fraud and able to handle a slight increase in its caseload. \nMeanwhile, as we learned in a May 18, 2011, hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, the immigration courts are overburdened, under-\nresourced, and facing steady increases in their caseloads.\n  The Refugee Protection Act ensures that persons who were victims of \nterrorism or persecution by terrorist groups will not be doubly \nvictimized with a denial of protection in the United States. Vermont \nImmigration and Asylum Advocates, a legal aid and torture treatment \nprovider, continues to see cases where persons granted asylum are later \nblocked from bringing their families to the United States or applying \nfor permanent residency by overly broad definitions in current law. \nThis bill would help such persons prove their cases without taking any \nshortcuts on national security. The bill also gives the President the \nauthority to designate certain groups of particularly vulnerable groups \nfor expedited consideration. All refugees would still have to complete \nsecurity and background checks prior to entry to the United States.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the need to treat genuine asylum seekers \nas persons in need of protection, not as criminals. It calls for asylum \nseekers who can prove their identity and who pose no threat to the \nUnited States to be released from immigration detention. Vermont \nImmigration and Asylum Advocates, like other legal aid providers across \nthe Nation, struggle to visit detention facilities located at a \ndistance from urban centers, or to reach clients who have been \ntransferred to far away locations. I appreciate efforts made by the \nObama administration to parole eligible asylum seekers and to improve \nthe conditions of detention overall, but more must be done. The Refugee \nProtection Act will improve access to counsel so that asylum seekers \nwith genuine claims can gain legal assistance in presenting their \nclaims. It will require the Government to codify detention standards so \nthat reforms are meaningful and enforceable.\n  There is no question that the United States is a leader among nations \nin refugee protection, but we can do better. The refugees we welcome to \nour shores contribute to the fabric of our Nation, and enrich the \ncommunities where they settle. I urge all Senators to support the \nRefugee Protection Act of 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section by section \nanalysis and a list of support organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Leahy-Levin-Akaka-Durbin Refugee Protection Act of 2011\n\n\n                           Sectional Analysis\n\n       The Refugee Act of 1980 was a landmark piece of legislation \n     that sought to fulfill the United States' obligations under \n     the 1951 Refugee Convention. Unfortunately, in the \n     intervening years, U.S. law has fallen short of those \n     obligations. Last year, on the thirtieth anniversary of the \n     Refugee Act of 1980, Senator Leahy, introduced the Refugee \n     Protection Act of 2010 (S. 3113, 111th Congress), a \n     comprehensive package of improvements to our law. On June 15, \n     2011, Senator Leahy, along with Senators Levin, Akaka, and \n     Durbin, introduced a new version of the bill for the 112th \n     Congress. The Refugee Protection Act of 2011 will ensure that \n     refugees and asylum seekers with bona fide claims are \n     protected by the United States, restoring the United States \n     as a beacon of hope for those who suffer from persecution.\n     Sec. 1. Short Title.\n       The short title is the Refugee Protection Act of 2011.\n     Sec. 2. Definitions.\n       This section defines the terms ``asylum seeker'' and \n     ``Secretary of Homeland Security.''\n     Sec. 3. Elimination of Time Limits on Asylum Applications.\n       This section eliminates the one-year time limit for filing \n     an asylum claim. The stated intent of Congress in 1996 in \n     enacting the one-year deadline was to prevent fraud, not to \n     deprive bona fide applicants from securing protection under \n     our laws. Yet, even in 1996, problems related to fraud had \n     been resolved through administrative reform implemented by \n     the Immigration & Naturalization Service, which opposed the \n     implementation of an application deadline. Since the one-year \n     deadline was enacted, and despite exceptions available in the \n     law for extraordinary or changed circumstances that may \n     prevent the timely filing of an application, many asylum \n     seekers with genuine claims have been denied protection. The \n     exceptions to the one-year deadline are not uniformly applied \n     to applicants, leading to unfair treatment of those who have \n     legitimate reasons for applying after the one-year deadline. \n     Moreover, a significant number of applicants have \n     subsequently met the higher standard for withholding of \n     removal, demonstrating that their claims were valid. This \n     section allows such an asylum seeker to reopen his asylum \n     claim if he is still in the United States, has not \n     subsequently been awarded lawful permanent residence status, \n     is not subject to a bar to asylum, and should not be denied \n     asylum as a matter of discretion.\n     Sec. 4. Protecting Victims of Terrorism from Being Defined as \n         Terrorists.\n       Under current law, any asylum seeker or refugee who is \n     individually culpable of engaging in terrorist conduct, or \n     direct support for it, is barred under prohibitions to entry \n     for a threat to national security, serious non-political \n     crime, persecution of others, or engaging in terrorist \n     activity. Changes in the law since September 11, 2001, have \n     resulted in innocent activity, or coerced actions, being \n     labeled as ``material support'' for terrorism, a \n     determination that can render genuine refugees ineligible for \n     protection in the United States. This section would amend the \n     law to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are not barred \n     from admission to the United States under an overly broad \n     definition of ``terrorist organization'' in the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (INA).\n       This section would define the term ``material support'' to \n     mean support that is significant and of a kind directly \n     relevant to terrorist activity. This section also gives the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to waive \n     application of the terrorism bars for certain applicants.\n       This section clarifies that those who committed certain \n     acts (such as military-type training, solicitation, or other \n     non-violent actions) under duress may not be deemed \n     inadmissible if they pose no threat to the United States. It \n     gives the Secretary discretion to consider the age of the \n     applicant at the time the acts were committed in determining \n     whether those acts were committed under duress.\n       This section also creates an exception for those who were \n     forced to recruit child soldiers under duress, or who engaged \n     in such recruitment under the age of 18. Finally, this \n     section would repeal an unduly harsh provision in current law \n     that makes spouses and children inadmissible for the acts of \n     a spouse or parent.\n       All applicants for asylum or refugee status must meet all \n     of the other traditional background and security checks.\n     Sec. 5. Protecting Certain Vulnerable Groups of Asylum \n         Seekers.\n       To be eligible for asylum under the Refugee Convention and \n     domestic law, an applicant must show that he or she has \n     experienced persecution or have a well-founded fear of future \n     persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, \n     political opinion, or membership in a particular social \n     group. This section makes several modifications to current \n     law to ensure that particularly vulnerable groups of asylum \n     seekers have a full and fair opportunity to seek protection \n     in the United States.\n       Subsection (a) codifies the holding of the landmark Board \n     of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision in Matter of Acosta, 19 \n     I. & N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985). That holding defined the basis \n     of persecution based on membership in a ``particular social \n     group'' as one comprised of individuals who share a common \n     characteristic they either cannot change, or should not be \n     required to change because the\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n     characteristic is fundamental to their identity or \n     conscience. The Acosta precedent has been clouded in recent \n     years by BIA opinions that require asylum applicants to prove \n     additional factors, some of which are unnecessary or contrary \n     to the spirit of domestic law and the Refugee Convention. \n     Most damaging is a requirement that the social group in \n     question be ``socially visible,'' a factor that could \n     endanger certain categories of refugees, such as victims of \n     gender persecution or LGBT asylum seekers. These are groups \n     that, as Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \n     described, are at great pains to remain socially invisible. \n     This subsection codifies the definition of social group in \n     Matter of Acosta such that inappropriate, additional factors \n     such as social visibility cannot be required by the BIA.\n       Subsection (b) makes additional changes to current law. \n     Paragraph (1): United States law has long recognized that \n     persecutors may have mixed motives for harming their victims. \n     For example, a militia that operates outside government \n     control may persecute a particular race of persons because of \n     xenophobia and also because it seeks to deprive the \n     persecuted race of valuable land and property. The fact that \n     the persecutor is motivated by two intertwined goals should \n     not prevent the victims from obtaining protection. \n     Nonetheless, the REAL ID Act of 2005 raised the burden of \n     proof that asylum seekers must meet in order to show that \n     they fear persecution on account of one of the five grounds \n     enumerated in the Refugee Convention and in U.S. law. (The \n     five grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in a \n     particular social group, or political opinion.) The REAL ID \n     Act requires that the asylum seeker demonstrate that harm on \n     account of a protected ground is ``at least one central \n     reason'' for the feared persecution. See INA \n     Sec. 208(b)(1)(B)(i). The ``one central reason'' language is \n     modified in this section, which does not fully repeal the \n     notion of persecutor intent but applies it in a manner that \n     is both realistic and fair. This paragraph strikes the \n     language that requires the protected ground (e.g., race) to \n     be one central reason for the persecution and requires \n     instead that the protected ground ``was or will be a factor \n     in the applicant's persecution or fear of persecution.''\n       Paragraph (2): The REAL ID Act of 2005 added requirements \n     to the INA with regard to an asylum seeker's duty to provide \n     corroborating evidence when it is requested by an immigration \n     judge. The REAL ID Act stated that ``such evidence must be \n     provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and \n     cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.'' Corroborating \n     evidence can be an important component of an asylum claim, \n     but asylum seekers must have a fair opportunity to respond to \n     requests for corroboration. In addition, as courts have \n     noted, it is sometimes virtually impossible for asylum \n     seekers to obtain certain types of corroborating evidence. \n     Therefore, this paragraph requires that when the trier of \n     fact seeks corroborating evidence, the trier of fact must \n     provide notice and allow the asylum applicant a reasonable \n     opportunity to file such evidence unless the applicant does \n     not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the \n     evidence.\n       Paragraph (3) renumbers text in the statute.\n       Paragraph (4): As noted above, an asylum seeker must show \n     that his or her well-founded fear of persecution is on \n     account of one of the five grounds of asylum. This link is \n     often called the nexus requirement. Some genuine asylum \n     seekers have been denied asylum because of a lack of clear \n     guidance on how the nexus requirement may be established when \n     the persecutor is a non-state actor. The Department of \n     Justice issued draft regulations in 2000 that made clear that \n     an asylum seeker can demonstrate nexus through either \n     ``direct or circumstantial'' evidence. This draft regulation \n     was consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in INS \n     v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992). This paragraph \n     would codify the draft regulation by making clear that either \n     direct or circumstantial evidence may establish that \n     persecution is on account of one of the five grounds.\n       Paragraph (5): The REAL ID Act also modified the INA with \n     regard to factors that an immigration judge may consider in \n     determining the asylum seeker's credibility. In short, the \n     REAL ID gave heightened importance to inconsistencies in an \n     asylum seeker's claim, even if those inconsistencies were \n     minor or immaterial to the heart of the claim. In practice, \n     an asylum seeker with limited English skills, with post-\n     traumatic stress disorder, or with other conditions, may make \n     simple, minor errors in the telling and retelling of their \n     story. This paragraph modifies the INA to state that if the \n     immigration judge determines that there are inconsistencies \n     or omissions in the claim, the asylum seeker should be given \n     an opportunity to explain and to provide support or evidence \n     to clarify such inconsistencies or omissions. Subsection (c) \n     makes identical corrections to the corroboration and \n     credibility determinations for removal proceedings that are \n     described in paragraphs (2) and (5) above.\n     Sec. 6. Effective Adjudication of Proceedings.\n       This section authorizes the Attorney General to appoint \n     counsel to an alien in removal proceedings where fair \n     resolution or effective adjudication of the case would be \n     served by doing so. In certain cases, such as those involving \n     highly complex asylum claims, unaccompanied minors, mentally \n     impaired persons, or individuals who are incapable of pro se \n     representation, delays in adjudication may result while an \n     alien prepares a case or searches for pro bono \n     representation. The immigration courts will operate more \n     efficiently (with savings to taxpayers) if the Attorney \n     General is provided explicit authority to exercise discretion \n     to appoint counsel in certain instances, such as those \n     described above.\n     Sec. 7. Scope and Standard for Review.\n       This section prevents the removal of an alien during the \n     30-day period an alien has to file a petition for review to a \n     Federal Circuit Court of Appeals after the alien has been \n     ordered removed. Staying the removal during this period will \n     enable an applicant to carefully consider whether to file an \n     appeal rather than rush to file in order to preserve his or \n     her rights. In weak cases, the alien will likely decline to \n     appeal, and deport voluntarily or via government removal. \n     This section also restores judicial review to a fair and \n     reasonable standard consistent with principles of \n     administrative law. The standard in this section is that the \n     Court of Appeals shall sustain a final decision ordering the \n     removal of an alien unless that decision is contrary to law, \n     an abuse of discretion, or not supported by substantial \n     evidence. The decision must be based on the administrative \n     record on which the order of removal is based.\n     Sec. 8. Efficient Asylum Determination Process for Arriving \n         Aliens.\n       Under current law, an alien who requests asylum as they \n     attempt to enter the United States (an ``arriving alien'') is \n     subject to detention for part or all of the time that they \n     await an asylum hearing. Such asylum seekers are provided an \n     initial interview with an asylum officer to determine whether \n     they have a credible fear of persecution, but then must \n     pursue their asylum case in immigration court, rather than in \n     a non-adversarial proceeding. Generally speaking, the \n     adversarial immigration hearing is considerably lengthier and \n     costlier than a non-adversarial asylum hearing. Under this \n     section, the DHS asylum office would be given jurisdiction \n     over an asylum case after a positive credible fear \n     determination. The alien would then undergo a non-\n     adversarial asylum interview. If the asylum officer is \n     unable to recommend a grant of asylum, the case will be \n     referred to an immigration judge and the asylum seeker \n     placed in removal proceedings. This structure mirrors the \n     current process for asylum seekers who apply for asylum \n     from within the United States.\n     Sec. 9. Secure Alternatives Program.\n       This section requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     establish a secure ``alternatives to detention'' program. The \n     program will allow certain aliens in civil immigration \n     custody to be released under enhanced supervision to prevent \n     the alien from absconding and to ensure that the alien makes \n     all required appearances associated with his or her \n     immigration case. The program is to be designed as a \n     continuum of alternatives based on the alien's need for \n     supervision, which may include placement of the alien with an \n     individual or organizational sponsor, or in a supervised \n     group home. The program shall restrict the use of ankle \n     monitoring devices to cases in which there is a demonstrated \n     need for enhanced monitoring, and the use of ankle monitors \n     shall be reviewed periodically. The program shall be designed \n     to include individualized case management and referrals to \n     community based organizations. In designing the program, the \n     Secretary is instructed to consider prior successful \n     programs, such the Vera Institute of Justice's Appearance \n     Assistance Program.\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security currently has discretion \n     to detain asylum seekers. This section maintains such \n     discretion but clarifies that, consistent with a DHS policy \n     announced in December 2009, it is the policy of the United \n     States to release (``parole'') asylum seekers who have \n     established a credible fear of persecution. Under this \n     section, asylum seekers who have established identity will be \n     released within 7 days of a positive credible fear \n     determination unless DHS can show that the asylum seeker \n     poses a risk to public safety (which may include a risk to \n     national security) or is a flight risk. If parole is denied, \n     DHS must provide the asylum seeker with written notification \n     for the reason for denial conveyed in a language the asylum \n     seeker claims to understand.\n     Sec. 10. Conditions of Detention.\n       Regulations regarding conditions for detention shall be \n     promulgated, and must address several issues including access \n     to legal service providers, group legal orientation \n     presentations, translation services, recreational programs \n     and activities, access to law libraries, prompt case \n     notification requirements, access to working telephones, \n     access to religious services, notice of transfers, and access \n     to facilities by nongovernmental organization. This section \n     also limits the use of solitary confinement, shackling, and \n     strip searches. This section requires that, after the date of \n     enactment, facilities first used by ICE to detain alien \n     detainees must be located within 50 miles of a community in \n     which there is a demonstrated capacity to provide free or \n     low-cost legal representation.\n     Sec. 11. Timely Notice of Immigration Charges.\n       This section requires the Department of Homeland Security \n     to file a charging document with the immigration court \n     closest to\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n     the location at which an alien was apprehended within 48 \n     hours of the alien being taken into custody by the \n     Department. The Department is also required to serve a copy \n     of the charging document on the alien within 48 hours of \n     apprehension. This section will serve multiple purposes. It \n     will prevent asylum seekers and other aliens from languishing \n     in detention at taxpayer expense without being charged. It \n     will encourage efficient handling of cases by both the \n     Department of Homeland Security and the immigration courts, \n     which are operated by the Department of Justice. Finally, it \n     will ensure that if an asylum seeker or other alien is \n     transferred from one detention facility to another, \n     jurisdictional and due process protections will attach.\n     Sec. 12. Procedures for Ensuring Accuracy and Verifiability \n         of Sworn Statements Taken Pursuant to Expedited Removal \n         Authority.\n       This section modifies current policy to ensure that asylum \n     seekers are not harmed by error in the production of sworn \n     statements taken during the expedited removal process. It \n     requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security establish a \n     procedure whereby the interviews of asylum seekers are \n     recorded. The recording may be a video, audio or other \n     reliable form of recording. The recording must include a \n     written statement, in its entirety, being read back to the \n     alien in a language that the alien claims to understand, and \n     include the alien affirming the accuracy of the statement or \n     making any corrections thereto. If an interpreter is \n     necessary, such interpreter must be competent in the language \n     of the asylum seeker. Once a record is produced and signed by \n     the asylum seeker under these conditions, it may be \n     considered part of the record. The Secretary may exempt \n     facilities from the requirements of this section under \n     certain circumstances.\n     Sec. 13. Study on the Effect of Expedited Removal Provisions, \n         Practices, and Procedures on Asylum Claims.\n       A 2005 study by the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) documented \n     widespread problems in the implementation of expedited \n     removal policy by U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     immigration officers at ports of entry. A few months prior to \n     release of the Study, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     expanded expedited removal authority from immigration \n     inspectors at Ports of Entry--as applied to arriving aliens \n     without proper documentation--to Border Patrol agents who \n     apprehend an alien within 100 miles of the border within 14 \n     days after an entry without inspection. The 2005 USCIRF Study \n     did not analyze the implementation of expedited removal by \n     the Border Patrol, as USCIRF's data collection had been \n     completed by that point in time. This section authorizes the \n     Commission to conduct a new study to determine whether Border \n     Patrol officers exercising expedited removal authority in the \n     interior of the United States are improperly encouraging \n     aliens to withdraw or retract claims for asylum. The \n     Commission is also authorized to study whether immigration \n     officers incorrectly fail to refer asylum seekers for \n     credible fear interviews by asylum officers; incorrectly \n     remove such aliens to a country where the alien may be \n     persecuted; and/or detain such asylum seekers improperly or \n     in inappropriate conditions.\n     Sec. 14. Refugee Opportunity Promotion.\n       The immigration statute requires a refugee who is resettled \n     in the United States to remain on U.S. soil for a full year \n     before adjusting to lawful permanent residence. For many, \n     this requirement presents no obstacles, as resettled refugees \n     immediately begin to work, learn English, and contribute to \n     their local communities. Yet, the one-year physical \n     presence requirement poses a significant barrier to \n     resettled refugees who are eager and willing to serve the \n     United States Government overseas. This section waives the \n     continuous presence requirement for any refugee who, \n     during their first year of residence in the United States, \n     accepts employment overseas to aid the United States \n     Government, such as by working as a translator or in \n     another professional capacity.\n     Sec. 15. Protections for Minors Seeking Asylum.\n       The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) amended the immigration \n     statute to exempt unaccompanied alien children from the safe \n     third country and one-year filing deadline bars to asylum. \n     This section will amend the statute to expand these TVPRA \n     exemptions to all child applicants for asylum. This section \n     also expands the exemption to the bar to asylum for \n     applicants under 18 years of age who were previously denied \n     asylum. The proposed language also clarifies that \n     unaccompanied alien children who have previously been \n     removed, or who departed voluntarily, should not have their \n     removal orders reinstated, but should instead be placed in \n     removal proceedings. Finally, this section states that all \n     cases of children seeking asylum be adjudicated in the first \n     instance by an asylum officer in a non-adversarial \n     proceeding. These protections, which were provided to \n     unaccompanied minors in the TVPRA, are expanded in the bill \n     to all child asylum seekers.\n     Sec. 16. Legal Assistance for Refugees and Asylees.\n       The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to non-\n     profit organizations to assist resettled refugees with mental \n     health counseling, social services, education (including \n     English as a Second Language, or ESL), and other assistance \n     to help refugees assimilate into American communities. This \n     section would authorize the Secretary to make similar grants \n     to assist lawfully resettled refugees with legal advice on \n     applications for immigration benefits to which they may be \n     eligible after residing in the United States for certain \n     periods of time, e.g., family reunification, adjustment of \n     status, or naturalization.\n     Sec. 17. Protection of Stateless Persons in the United \n         States.\n       This section will enable individuals who are de jure \n     stateless to obtain lawful status in the United States. De \n     jure stateless persons are individuals who are not considered \n     to be citizens under the laws of any country. They do not \n     have a nationality and therefore cannot be returned anywhere. \n     (These individuals are not rendered stateless by any negative \n     action of their own, such the commission of crimes that leads \n     the country of origin to deny return, but generally by forces \n     beyond their control, such as the collapse of the country of \n     origin (e.g. the Soviet Union) and the succession of a state \n     or states that will not recognize certain former nationals.) \n     De jure stateless persons are ineligible for lawfully \n     recognized status in the United States based on the fact that \n     they are stateless. This section would make such persons \n     eligible to apply for conditional lawful status if they are \n     not inadmissible under criminal or security grounds and if \n     they pass all standard background checks. After five years in \n     conditional status, de jure stateless persons would be \n     eligible to apply for lawful permanent status.\n     Sec. 18. Authority to Designate Certain Groups of Refugees \n         for Consideration.\n       This section authorizes the President to designate certain \n     groups as eligible for expedited adjudication as refugees. \n     The authority would address situations in which a group is \n     targeted for persecution in their country of origin or \n     country of first asylum. The designation by the President \n     would be sufficient, if proved to the satisfaction of the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a well-founded \n     fear of persecution for members of the designated group. \n     However, each individual applicant would still have to be \n     admissible to the United States and pass security and \n     background checks before being admitted. Refugees admitted \n     under this authority would not be exempt from the annual \n     limit on refugee admissions. This section simply enables the \n     President to call for expedited adjudication where necessary \n     and appropriate. This section explicitly includes groups \n     previously protected under the Lautenberg Amendment, which \n     include, among others, Jews and Evangelical Christians from \n     the former Soviet Union, and religious minorities from Iran.\n     Sec. 19. Multiple Forms of Relief.\n       This section simply allows individuals applying for refugee \n     protection to simultaneously apply for other forms of \n     admission to the United States, such as through a family-\n     based petition. All applicants for admission must pass \n     security and background checks. This modification to current \n     law would not allow would-be refugees from gaming the system, \n     but simply enable them to escape harm or persecution at the \n     first opportunity a visa becomes available. This section also \n     allows the very small number of asylum applicants who win the \n     opportunity to apply for a green card through the diversity \n     lottery the ability to apply for that diversity visa from \n     within the United States. Typically, diversity visa \n     applicants must apply from their home country, a requirement \n     that would subject a genuine asylum seeker to risk of harm.\n     Sec. 20. Protection of Refugee Families.\n       This modification to current law would enable the spouse or \n     child of a refugee (a ``derivative'') to bring their children \n     to the United States when they accompany or follow to join \n     the spouse or parent who was originally awarded refugee \n     status (a ``principal''). Current law does not allow a \n     derivative's child to be admitted as a refugee, yet given the \n     long waits and often unsafe conditions that many derivative \n     applicants and their children face in camps overseas, the \n     United States should provide this group protection. This \n     section also aids children who were orphaned or abandoned by \n     their blood relatives and are living in the care of extended \n     family, friends, or neighbors who are granted admission to \n     the United States as refugees or asylees. Where it is in the \n     best interest of such a child to join that refugee or asylee \n     in the United States, this section creates a mechanism \n     whereby they may be admitted. This section also repeals an \n     unnecessary time limit in regulations on the filing of family \n     petitions related to refugee and asylee family reunification. \n     Finally, to facilitate the admission of eligible family \n     members, this section requires that U.S. Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services adjudicate family reunification \n     petitions for those following to join refugees and asylees \n     within 90 days of filing.\n     Sec. 21. Reform of Refugee Consultation Process.\n       Each year, the executive branch is charged with consulting \n     with Congress over the annual allocation of refugees to be \n     admitted to the United States. This section requires \n     meaningful consultation to take place between Cabinet-\n     level officers and the committees of jurisdiction of the \n     Congress by May 1 of each year.\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\n     Sec. 22. Admission of Refugees in the Absence of the Annual \n         Presidential Determination.\n       This section states that for a fiscal year in which the \n     executive branch does not determine the allocation of \n     refugees for that year, the admission of refugees is not \n     delayed. Rather, until a determination is announced for the \n     new fiscal year, in each quarter of the new fiscal year, the \n     number of refugees equal to one-quarter for the prior fiscal \n     year's allocation may be admitted.\n     Sec. 23. Update of Reception and Placement Grants.\n       When a refugee is resettled in the United States, the \n     federal government assists him or her through Reception and \n     Placement Grants to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \n     that help refugees find housing, place their children in \n     school, enroll in ESL classes, and take other initial steps \n     toward building a new life in the United States. Early in \n     2010, the administration increased the per capita grant level \n     to $1800 per refugee, up to $1100 of which may be awarded \n     directly to the refugee for immediate costs, and up to $700 \n     of which is used by the NGO to cover the cost of dedicated \n     staff and expenses. Prior to 2010, the per capita level had \n     not kept pace with inflation. For years it was set at a level \n     so low that refugees were effectively consigned to poverty \n     upon arrival in the United States, and NGOs were only able to \n     offset the cost of basic support services to the refugees by \n     raising additional funds. To ensure that the per capita \n     amount does not fall behind the minimum level required for \n     basic needs, this section requires the per capita amount to \n     be adjusted on an annual basis for inflation and the cost of \n     living. It also calls for better forecasting of financial \n     needs with regard to the number of refugees expected to be \n     resettled each year and allows for additional amounts to be \n     paid out in the event that a higher than anticipated number \n     of refugees is admitted in a fiscal year.\n     Sec. 24. Protection for Aliens Interdicted at Sea.\n       The U.S. government should apply one standard, consistent \n     with the Refugee Convention, to all asylum seekers \n     interdicted at sea, regardless of their nationality. Yet a \n     patchwork of policies has evolved over the past two decades \n     often in response to mass migrations at sea. The result is \n     disparate treatment of Cubans, Chinese and Haitians. This \n     section will require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     develop uniform policies to identify asylum seekers among \n     those interdicted at sea and to treat those individuals \n     fairly and in a non-discriminatory manner.\n     Sec. 25. Modification of Physical Presence Requirements for \n         Aliens Serving as Translators.\n       Under current law, in order to be naturalized, most non-\n     U.S. citizens must have continuous residence in the United \n     States for five years and physical presence for periods \n     totaling half that time (2\\1/2\\ years). This section would \n     permit absence from the United States while serving as a \n     translator for the U.S. government in Iraq or Afghanistan to \n     count toward the 2\\1/2\\ years physical presence required for \n     naturalization.\n     Sec. 26. Assessment of the Refugee Domestic Resettlement \n         Program.\n       This section directs GAO to conduct a study on the \n     effectiveness of the domestic refugee resettlement program \n     operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services. The study will \n     analyze issues pertaining to the definition of self \n     sufficiency, the effectiveness of ORR in helping refugees to \n     attain self-sufficiency, the unmet needs of the program, and \n     the role of community-based organizations. The GAO study will \n     issue statutory recommendations.\n     Sec. 27. Refugee Assistance.\n       This section revises the formula for social services \n     funding allocated to states to include projections of future \n     refugee arrivals, as well as refugee data from prior years. \n     This section requires an annual report on secondary migration \n     and its impact on states.\n     Sec. 28. Resettlement Data.\n       This section expands and improves data collection and \n     reporting within ORR with regard to the mental health and \n     housing needs of refugees. It will also collect long term \n     employment and self-sufficiency data on resettled refugees.\n     Sec. 29. Protections for Refugees.\n       Current law makes refugees resettled in the United States \n     eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence after one \n     year. However, current law also suggests that a refugee who \n     does not adjust status after one year may be taken into \n     custody by DHS. (See Section 209 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1159). \n     The agency recently issued guidance to clarify interpretation \n     of the law, stating that detention of an unadjusted refugee \n     who is found to be inadmissible or deportable should be \n     determined under the statute relating to apprehension and \n     detention of aliens. (See Section 236 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n     1226.) Accordingly, this section of the bill strikes language \n     in current law that suggests that refugees may be taken into \n     custody simply for remaining unadjusted. This section also \n     allows a refugee to apply for lawful permanent residence up \n     to three months prior to obtaining a year of presence in the \n     United States.\n     Sec. 30. Extension of Eligibility Period for Social Security \n         Benefits for Certain Refugees.\n       This section extends social security benefits to elderly \n     and disabled refugees who have not yet naturalized. \n     Typically, certain eligible refugees may receive social \n     security for seven years. That period was extended for two \n     years in 2008 by a bipartisan bill supported by President \n     Bush. This section extends the social security funding for \n     one additional year.\n     Sec. 31. Authorization of Appropriations.\n       This section authorizes such sums as are necessary to carry \n     out the Act.\n     Sec. 32. Determination of Budgetary Effects.\n       This section contains standardized ``PAYGO'' language.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      The Leahy-Levin-Akaka-Durbin Refugee Protection Act of 2011\n\n\n                    Endorsements as of June 15, 2011\n\n       American Bar Association; American Civil Liberties Union; \n     American Humanist Association; American Immigration Lawyers \n     Association; American Jewish Committee; Amnesty International \n     USA; Association of Africans Living in Vermont; Asylum \n     Access; Center for American Progress Action Fund; Center for \n     Gender & Refugee Studies; Center for Victims of Torture; \n     CenterLink: The Community of LGBT Centers; Church World \n     Service, Immigration and Refugee Program; The Episcopal \n     Church; Family Equality Council; Golden Door Coalition of \n     Illinois; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; Hebrew Immigrant Aid \n     Society Chicago; Heartland Alliance for Human Needs & Human \n     Rights; Human Rights Campaign; Human Rights First; Human \n     Rights Watch; Immigrant Child Advocacy Project at the \n     University of Chicago; Immigration Equality Action Fund; \n     International Rescue Committee; Jewish Child and Family \n     Services (Metropolitan Chicago); Kids in Need of Defense \n     (KIND); Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service; National \n     Center for Transgender Equality; National Immigrant Justice \n     Center; National Immigration Forum; National Immigration Law \n     Center; National Council of Jewish Women; National Latina \n     Institute for Reproductive Health; Organization for Refuge, \n     Asylum & Migration; PFLAG National (Parents, Families and \n     Friends of Lesbians and Gays); RefugeeOne; Refugee Women's \n     Network, Inc.; Refugees International; State Coordinators of \n     Refugee Resettlement (SCORR); Tahirih Justice Center; United \n     African Organization; U.S. Committee for Refugees and \n     Immigrants; U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; Vermont \n     Immigration and Asylum Advocates; Women's Refugee Commission.\n       The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \n     supports the Refugee Protection Act of 2011.\n       *Deborah Anker, Clinical Professor of Law and Director, \n     Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, Harvard Law \n     School.\n       *Sabi Ardalan, Lecturer on Law, Harvard Immigration and \n     Refugee Clinical Program.\n       *Regina Germain, Adjunct Professor of Asylum Law and the \n     Asylum Practicum, University of Denver Sturm College of Law.\n       *Philip G.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of home infusion therapy under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join my colleague on the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, to introduce \nthe Medicare Home Infusion Coverage Act, which will help us improve \ncare and reduce costs. We are joined by Senator Isakson, Senator \nKlobuchar, and Senator Inouye, who also recognize the tremendous value \noffered by home infusion therapy.\n  Today many serious conditions, including some cancers and drug-\nresistant infections--requires the use of infusion therapy. Such \ntreatment involves the administration of medication directly into the \nbloodstream via a needle or catheter. Specialized equipment, supplies, \nand professional services, such as sterile drug compounding, care \ncoordination, and patient education and monitoring, are part of such \ntherapy. The course of infusion treatment often lasts for several hours \nper day over a 6-to-8 week period.\n  The regrettable fact is that Medicare patients requiring infusion \ntherapy must either bear that cost themselves, or endure \nhospitalization in order to receive coverage. Though Medicare pays for \ninfusion drugs, it does not pay for the services, equipment, and \nsupplies necessary to safely provide infusion therapy in the home. Not \nsurprisingly, even though home infusion therapy may cost as little as \n$100 a day, too few seniors can afford that cost.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  The result is that patients are hospitalized needlessly, driving \ncosts of treatment as much as 10-20 times higher than treatment in the \nhome. These unnecessary hospitalizations are not only wasteful to \nMedicare, but they may even place the patient at risk of contracting a \nhealth care-acquired infection.\n  Private coverage for home infusion therapy is commonplace. Private \nplans also recognize that patients benefit from avoiding \nhospitalization. At home they have familiar, comfortable surroundings, \nand family conveniently at hand, no small concerns when fighting a \nserious illness. In fact, according to a June 2010 Government \nAccountability Office report, ``Health insurers contend that the \nbenefit has been cost-effective, that is, providing infusion therapy at \nhome generally costs less than treatment in other settings. They also \ncontend that the benefit is largely free from inappropriate utilization \nand problems in quality of care.''\n  By extending coverage of infusion therapy to the home, we will \ncorrect this unintended and unnecessary gap in Medicare coverage. I \nhope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so we \nmay further the goals of improving patient safety and reducing our \nescalating health care costs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1204. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reform \nDepartment of Defense energy policy, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the \nDepartment of Defense Energy Security Act of 2011 or DODESA, that I am \nintroducing today.\n  This bill takes a number of important steps toward addressing some of \nour most critical national energy security challenges. It authorizes \nincreased development of alternative fuels and increased usage of \nhybrid drive systems and electric vehicles. The bill streamlines \ncommunication between agencies responsible for energy programs across \nthe DOD, and authorizes DOD to examine where the greatest potential \nexists for renewable energy programs. And it authorizes DOD to \ndetermine how best to incorporate smart grid technology and to work \nwith local communities to develop contingency plans in the event of a \npower outage caused by cyber attacks or natural disasters.\n  Simply put, this bill addresses the military's single largest \nvulnerability: Its dependence on fossil fuel. When you talk about that \ndependency in theater--you're talking about putting service members' \nlives at risk. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of \nservice men and women have been injured and killed each year in attacks \non fuel convoys. Osama bin Laden reportedly called those convoys our \nmilitary's ``umbilical cord.'' In the words of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen: ``Saving energy saves \nlives.'' He said: ``Energy needs to be the first thing we think about \nbefore we deploy another soldier, before we build another ship or \nplane.''\n  That dependence on oil also costs taxpayers a staggering amount of \nmoney. But our military's reliance on vulnerable energy resources is \nnot just on the battlefield. At home, defense facilities rely on a \nfragile national grid, leaving critical assets vulnerable. The Defense \nScience Board found in its 2008 report, ``More Fight--Less Fuel'' that, \n``critical national security and homeland defense missions are at an \nunacceptably high risk of extended outage from failure of the grid.''\n  All told, the military spends $20 billion on energy each year, \nconsuming a whopping 135 million barrels of oil and 30 million \nmegawatt-hours of electricity. It consumes more fuel and electricity \neach year than most countries.\n  The Pentagon's energy consumption has serious national security \nimplications, but it also presents opportunities. As the Logistics \nManagement Institute wrote, ``Aggressively developing and applying \nenergy-saving technologies to military applications would potentially \ndo more to solve the most pressing long-term challenges facing DOD and \nour national security than any other single investment area.''\n  That is why we have introduced this legislation. I say ``we'' because \nthis bill is the product of a joint effort with Congresswoman Giffords' \noffice. Gabby is a great friend, and we introduced this bill together \nlast Congress. This year, my staff has worked closely with hers on this \nupdated version. This is an issue that is near and dear to Gabby's \nheart, and I know that she is eager to continue her work on it in the \nHouse.\n  I am very proud of this legislation for a number of reasons.\n  First and foremost, DODESA will help the Department of Defense cut \nfuel consumption and long-term costs.\n  Secondly, it provides authorization that will expand existing \nrenewable energy studies and pilot programs through a Joint Contingency \nBase Resource Security Project. This project will help the service \nbranches share lessons learned as they study the best ways to \nincorporate renewable energy sources and fuel reduction initiatives, \nsuch as the Marine Corps' outstanding Experimental Forward Operating \nBase, and the Army's Net Zero Installations.\n  Third, Colorado is leading the way in this commonsense area of energy \nsecurity. In particular, I would like to highlight the leadership of \nFort Carson, in my home state, which has been chosen as one of two \nbases to participate in the Army's ``Triple Net Zero'' pilot program. \nThey are truly pioneers in this important work, and I appreciate all of \ntheir efforts.\n  In sum, our legislation will make America more secure, will save \ntaxpayer dollars, and it will save lives. There is no single solution \nto our energy security challenges. DODESA is not a silver bullet that \nwill solve all of our problems. However, it's part of a silver buckshot \nsolution that will require multiple changes in the way that we do \nbusiness.\n  We owe it to our service members and the American people to find ways \nto use energy smarter and more efficiently, and I believe this bill \ntakes a number of important steps in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the, text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire drug manufacturers to provide drug rebates for drugs dispensed \nto low-income individuals under the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Drug Savings Act of 2011. I am proud to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Senator Debbie Stabenow \nof Michigan, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Senator Sherrod \nBrown of Ohio and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, in introducing \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  The Republican budget would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it \nwith a voucher program that would double seniors' out of pocket costs \nand leave them at the mercy of private insurance companies. It would \nalso decimate the Medicaid program, leaving millions of vulnerable \nindividuals including seniors, children, and people with disabilities \nwith nowhere to turn for care. We need to responsibly reduce our \ndeficit, but taking away health care for seniors and other vulnerable \npeople should be off the table. Rather than dismantling Medicare and \nMedicaid, we can save hundreds of billions of dollars by holding drug \ncompanies accountable and using the purchasing power of the federal \ngovernment to negotiate lower drug prices.\n  That is why we are introducing the Medicare Drug Savings Act. The \nbill will eliminate a special deal from the 2003 Medicare prescription \ndrug law that allows drug companies to charge Medicare higher prices \nfor some seniors' prescription drugs. It would require prescription \ndrug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare for dually eligible \nbeneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid. This proposal would reduce the \ndeficit, saving taxpayers an estimated $112 billion over the next ten \nyears, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Similar proposals \nwere also included in the recommendations from the President's \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and the President's \nframework for deficit reduction.\n  Prior to the creation of the Medicare prescription drug program, \nbrand-name drug manufacturers paid a drug rebate for dually eligible \nbeneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid. However, when the new Medicare \ndrug program was established, drug companies no longer had to provide \nthese rebates, resulting in windfall profits for prescription drug \nmanufacturers, at taxpayers' expense.\n  The Medicare Drug Savings Act would require prescription drug \nmanufacturers to provide a rebate for drugs provided to dually eligible \nbeneficiaries as well as all other enrollees in the low-income-subsidy, \nLIS, plan in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. \nManufacturers would be required to pay the difference between the \nlowest current rebates they are paying to private Part D drug plans, \nand, the percentage of Average Manufacture Price, AMP, they currently \npay under Medicaid, plus an additional rebate if their prices grow \nadditional inflation. They would be required to participate in the \nrebate program in order for their drugs to be covered by Medicare Part \nD.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. In doing so, we will \nprotect Medicare for seniors, and end a giveaway to drug companies that \nis costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1207. A bill to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security \npolicies and procedures to protect data containing personal \ninformation, and to provide for nationwide notice in the event of a \nsecurity breach; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words on the \nintroduction of the Data Security and Breach Notification Act. Senator \nPryor and I introduced this bill in the 111th Congress, and given the \nrecent high-profile data breaches that have endangered the well-being \nof millions of ordinary American consumers, today's reintroduction of \nthis comprehensive bill is\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\ntimely. I want to thank and commend Senator Pryor for his leadership on \nthis issue and for his terrific work as Chairman of the Consumer \nProtection Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee.\n  As the recent breaches at Citigroup, Sony, and Epsilon have taught \nus, companies that collect and store sensitive consumer information \nshould have two important obligations: to maintain that information in \na manner that is safe and secure; and to notify affected consumers as \nquickly as possible in the wake of a security breach in order to allow \nthem to take necessary steps to protect themselves. Senator Pryor's and \nmy bill addresses both of these obligations. Currently, 47 States have \ndata breach notification laws on the books, but very few address how \ncompanies should secure their data from the outset to prevent such \nbreaches.\n  Our bill calls on the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate \nregulations that direct companies to establish and maintain reasonable \nprotocols to secure consumer data from unauthorized access. In this \nregard, the bill also has specific provisions addressing data brokers, \nwhich are companies that collect and sell massive amounts of \ninformation on individuals, largely without their knowledge. The Data \nSecurity and Breach Notification Act would allow consumers to access \nand, if necessary, correct the personal information that these data \nbrokers maintain and sell.\n  Furthermore, if a security breach occurs, our bill requires companies \nto notify affected consumers unless there is no reasonable risk of \nidentity theft, fraud or unlawful conduct. This breach notification \nstandard is very important and reflects the most consumer-protective \nstandard in the country. The presumption is that companies should \nnotify consumers of a breach. However, if the breached entity \ndetermines that there is no reasonable risk of harm, for instance, if \nthe company has made the data unusable through advanced encryption \ntechnology, then they are spared this obligation. The FTC and state \nAttorneys General are tasked with enforcing the law.\n  The Commerce Committee has a long, well-established history of \naddressing data security issues, and the Committee has reported data \nsecurity bills in past Congresses. As Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, I intend to work with Senator Pryor to enact this bill into \nlaw. Majority Leader Reid has introduced a cyber-security bill that \nprovides for the inclusion of a data security section, and the Obama \nAdministration has also released a cybersecurity proposal that contains \na breach notification provision. The bill that Senator Pryor and I have \nintroduced is a carefully balanced bill that protects consumers, but \nalso addresses the legitimate needs of business and does not impose \nneedless regulations and obligations. This bill has wide support from \nboth the consumer groups and many sectors in the business community, \nand I will work with Senator Pryor to address further concerns in order \nto garner consensus.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Begich, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1208. A bill to provide an election to terminate certain capital \nconstruction funds without penalties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to reform \nthe Capital Construction Fund to address major changes in the Nation's \nfisheries and to allow the Nation's fishers to have access to needed \nfunds to prevent overfishing and to help create jobs.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, program was originally developed \nat a time when American fishers were having a hard time competing with \nhighly efficient foreign fishing vessels, modern boats that often \nharvested U.S. fishery resources within sight of our own shores. The \ninitial idea behind the CCF Program was to enable U.S. fishers to \naccumulate the funds necessary to develop a modern fishing fleet by \nallowing them to deposit a portion of their fishing-related earnings \ninto a CCF savings account on a tax-deferred basis. Under the CCF \nprogram, monies subsequently withdrawn from the CCF accounts would \nremain tax free as long as they were invested in new or rebuilt fishing \nvessels. At the same time, any unauthorized withdrawals from CCF \naccounts were subject to severe interest and other penalties.\n  The program was a success; the CCF program helped the U.S. industry \nbuild a modern state-of-the-art fishing fleet. Unfortunately, that \nfleet has now become overcapitalized, a problem that has been \nexacerbated as managers have become more and more concerned about \npotential overfishing and have begun to reduce the amount of fish that \nthey allow fishers to catch each year. As a result, the U.S. commercial \nfishing fleet now has more harvesting capacity than the U.S. fishery \nresource can sustainably support. The problem now is that the monies \nthat remain on deposit in CCF accounts represent a potential for \nfurther overcapitalization at a time when less capitalization is \nneeded. Yet the CCF regulations currently penalize withdrawals made for \nanything other than a bigger or better boat.\n  The issue now is what to do about the money that remains ``stranded'' \nin existing CCF accounts. Ironically, just as the current generation of \nfishers is getting ready to retire, the program puts heavy penalties on \nthem if they take money out of their CCF accounts without using it for \nanything other than to further capitalize an already overcapitalized \nfleet.\n  The resulting situation is problematic for the fishers, the industry \nand the resource. That's why I am reintroducing legislation today along \nwith my colleague Senator Murkowski--to address the problem of stranded \ncapital still on deposit in various CCF accounts and to relieve the \npressure to increase further capitalization of the fishing fleet. My \nlegislation will enable CCF fundholders to make a one-time withdrawal \nfrom their CCF accounts without requiring them to reinvest it in the \nfishing industry. Instead, they will be required to pay the taxes due \non the monies withdrawn, but without having to pay interest or other \npenalties on such withdrawals. Those funds would be freed up for other \npurposes, including starting a new business and finding other ways to \nsupport and create jobs. An income-averaging formula would be applied \nto the withdrawals so as to avoid an excessive tax rate on the one-time \nwithdrawal. The fishers taking advantage of such an opportunity to take \nmoney out of their CCF accounts penalty free would then be required to \nclose their CCF accounts and would be prohibited from further \nparticipation in the program. This is a win-win-win situation. The \nfisher gets to take the money out of his CCF without having to pay \npenalties and interest, but still pays the taxes when due; the \ngovernment gets taxes on the withdrawals; and the resource and the \nfishers who remain in the fishery avoid further capitalization of an \nalready overcapitalized industry.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski, the fishing \ncommunity, and the bill's other supporters to advance this legislation \nto the President's desk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1211. A bill amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npreserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics used in \nthe treatment of human and animal diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPreservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011.\n  Introducing this bill today is bittersweet. As my colleagues know, we \nhave been working to pass this bill for almost a decade now. But for \nall those years it was one of our dearest colleagues, Senator Ted \nKennedy, who stood before this body to introduce the legislation.\n  We certainly miss Senator Kennedy's leadership, his passion, his \ndedication and his political skill.\n  But as I stand here today to introduce the Preservation of \nAntibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, I know that he would be proud to \nsee the continued work and support for this bill.\n  Today, I am joined by Senator Collins, Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nand Senator Boxer as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  It is my hope that in this Congress we can make some positive changes \nin this important area.\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n  Let me start by explaining what the Preservation of Antibiotics for \nMedical Treatment Act does.\n  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act directs the \nFood and Drug Administration to regulate the misuse of antibiotics in \nagriculture. It requires drug companies and producers to demonstrate \nthat they are using antibiotics to treat clinically diagnosable \ndiseases in farm animals. It requires that companies defend the process \nof adding gross amounts of antibiotics to the feed and water of \nlivestock and it requires them to prove that this practice does not \ncontribute to antibiotic-resistance among humans.\n  Unfortunately, it has become a common practice in industrial \nagriculture to use antibiotics for ``growth promotion.'' This practice \nallows for animals kept in cramped quarters to grow artificially fast, \nand artificially fat.\n  The most concerning part is that the low doses of antibiotics fed to \nthese animals breed antibiotic resistant pathogens. These pathogens \nmake their way into our food, our water, and our communities.\n  Antibiotic resistance is one of the most significant public health \nchallenges facing us today, and numerous peer-reviewed studies have \nconcluded that the overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture is \nmaking the problem worse.\n  A recent study published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious \nDiseases found that nearly 50 percent of grocery store meat was \ncontaminated with antibiotic resistant pathogens. Even more concerning, \n25 percent of all meat was contaminated with pathogens that were \nresistant to three or more types of antibiotics.\n  I have heard for years that antibiotics were the closest thing to a \n``silver bullet'' in human medicine. But today, tens of thousands of \npeople in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic resistant infections. \nSo unfortunately we are learning the hard way that these precious, life \nsaving drugs no longer work as well as they once did.\n  Antibiotic resistance is a real and growing problem, and its causes \nare man-made.\n  As our use of antimicrobial drugs has increased, so has the ability \nof bacteria to withstand their effects. The only way to preserve the \neffectiveness of antibiotics is to use them responsibly.\n  In human medicine, this means that doctors must use better discretion \nwhen prescribing antibiotics. As patients, we must do our part and \nfinish the prescriptions given to us.\n  But antibiotics are also used in animal medicine, so veterinarians \nand farmers must also ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly.\n  I was surprised to learn that the Union of Concerned Scientists \nestimates that 84 percent of all antibiotic usage in this country is in \nanimals such as chickens, pigs, and cattle. Even more surprising is the \nvast majority of antibiotic consumption by livestock is by animals that \nshow no clinical signs of illness.\n  This type of treatment, referred to by doctors and veterinarians as \nnon-therapeutic, creates the perfect breeding ground for antibiotic \nresistant bacteria. Unlike therapeutic doses of medicine that are \nprescribed when we, or any other animal gets sick, non-therapeutic \ndoses of antibiotics are routinely added to the food or water of \nlivestock that are not ill.\n  These doses are not large enough, or powerful enough, to eliminate \nall the bacteria inside their bodies. Instead, the small dose of \nantibiotics only kills off the weakest bacteria; leaving the strongest, \nmost resistant bacteria behind to reproduce.\n  Recognizing the impending health crisis, some have taken dramatic \naction. In 1998, Denmark became the first country to ban the routine \nuse of antibiotics in the food and water of livestock. The entire \nEuropean Union followed suit in 2006. Australia, New Zealand, Chile, \nKorea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan have also implemented full \nor partial bans on non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics.\n  But the majority of producers in the U.S. have not followed suit; and \nit is time for a wakeup call.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Preservation of Antibiotics for \nMedical Treatment Act. This legislation implements a precautionary \nprinciple when it comes to using antibiotics and requires that \nproducers and drug companies affirmatively demonstrate that the non-\ntherapeutic antibiotics in livestock production do not contribute to \nthe incidence of antibiotic resistant infections in humans.\n  Put simply, if growth promoting antibiotics can't be used safely, \nthey shouldn't be used at all.\n  The real strength of this legislation is that it takes an incremental \napproach. The new regulations regarding antibiotic use under PAMTA \nwould only apply to the limited number of antibiotics that are critical \nto human health and are used non-therapeutically.\n  This means that any drug not used in human medicine is left untouched \nby this legislation.\n  PAMTA also preserves the ability of farmers to use all available \nantibiotics to treat sick animals.\n  By focusing on only the most egregious misuses of medically important \nantibiotics, PAMTA tackles the problem of antibiotic resistance where \nwe know we can make the most difference.\n  I understand that some question the need for this legislation; they \nsay that there is no evidence that antibiotic use in agriculture leads \nto infections in humans.\n  Unfortunately they are wrong.\n  Rear Admiral Ali S. Khan, MD, MPH, Assistant Surgeon General and \nDirector of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently testified in \nfront of the House Energy Committee that ``studies related to \nSalmonella as both a human and animal pathogen, including many studies \nin the United States, have demonstrated that use of antibiotic agents \nin food animals results in antibiotic resistant bacteria in food \nanimals, resistant bacteria are present in the food supply and are \ntransmitted to humans, and resistant bacterial infections result in \nadverse human health consequences, e.g., increased hospitalization.\n  Doctor Joshua Sharfstein, Principal Deputy Commissioner of the Food \nand Drug Administration also testified at the hearing and agreed with \nRear Admiral Khan. The FDA, he said, ``supports the conclusion that \nusing medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes \nis not in the interest of protecting and promoting the public health.''\n  Quantitative evidence from the EU and Canada also support these \nconclusions. In response to public health concerns about the rise of \ncephalosporin, an antibiotic, resistance in Salmonella and E. coli, \nchicken hatcheries in Quebec voluntarily stopped using the drug in \nFebruary 2005. Following the ban, the public health agency of Canada \nreported a dramatic 89 percent decrease in the incidence of resistant \nsalmonella in chicken meat and 77 percent decrease in related human \ninfections. Once the drug was partially reintroduced in 2007, \nantibiotic resistant infections in people jumped back up 50 percent.\n\n  Unfortunately we are fighting an uphill battle with antibiotic \nresistant infections. Our tools and resources are diminishing even \nwhile the number and severity of these infections are increasing.\n  One example is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, MRSA \ninfections in 1974 accounted for only two percent of the total number \nof staph infections; in 1995 it was 22 percent; and by 2004 it was 63 \npercent.\n  CDC estimates that by 2005, there were 94,360 MRSA infections in the \nUnited States. Tragically, about 19,000 of them, 20 percent, were fatal \nbecause MRSA is nearly immune to almost every antibiotic used in modern \nmedicine.\n  By comparison, in 2005 there were 17,011 deaths due to AIDS; so the \nscope and consequence of this problem is stunning.\n  Of course not all MRSA is derived from the overuse of antibiotics on \nthe farm. Many infections are acquired in the hospital, and it is \nbelieved that these bacteria became resistant to antibiotics due to the \nmisuse of drugs in human medicine.\n  But MRSA is also infecting individuals who have not been in a \nhospital setting.\n  There is strong evidence that at least one strain of MRSA infecting \npeople is\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\ncoming directly from livestock. This strain, known as ST398, has been \nshown to disproportionately infect farmers and their families. Like all \nMRSA, ST398 is resistant to the antibiotics methicillin and oxacillin. \nBut resistance to other antibiotics is also common among ST398 strains, \nwhich makes treatment especially challenging.\n  A recent study by the CDC in December 2009 showed that hospital \nacquired strains of MRSA and community acquired MRSA strains such as \nST398 are trending in opposite directions.\n  The study found that community acquired MRSA, a type of MRSA that did \nnot emerge in the hospital setting and is not contracted there, \nincreased 700 percent between 1999 and 2006.\n  By contrast, hospital acquired MRSA cases declined roughly 10 percent \nover this same time period.\n  Over the past decade, it has become clear that MRSA is not just a \nproblem for hospital administrators. More and more individuals are \nacquiring this devastating infection in their homes, at their gyms or \nin restaurants.\n  While it is exceedingly difficult to determine the exact extent that \nantibiotic use in agriculture influences individual MRSA cases, we know \nfor certain that statistical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that a \nreduction of antibiotic use in agriculture will result in a reduction \nof highly resistant MRSA cases.\n  Since the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that as much as 84 \npercent of all antibiotic usage in this country is in veterinary \nmedicine, one can reasonably conclude that a reduction of antibiotic \nuse in agriculture will result in a reduction of highly resistant MRSA \ncases.\n  The reason I am so committed to this legislation is that a reduction \nin highly resistant infections will save lives. One of my constituents \nshared a truly heartbreaking story.\n  The Don family, from Ramona, California, is a tight knit family. They \nare active in the community, and loved by their neighbors. Until \nrecently, like most happy, healthy families, antibiotic resistant \ninfections just wasn't a subject that came up much.\n  So when Mr. and Mrs. Don sent their son Carlos off to sixth grade \ncamp in 2007, they never expected that an antibiotic resistant \ninfection would change their lives.\n  Carlos was the picture of health. He was a bright, vibrant, athletic \n12-year old, who loved to play football.\n  When he returned home from camp, he had a 104 degree fever and could \nbarely walk. It was the sickest his parents had ever seen him.\n  When Carlos didn't get better the next day, they took him to Urgent \nCare. He was given a dose of antibiotics that the doctors said would \nknock the bug out in a few days.\n  But the drugs didn't work.\n  The next day Carlos was in even worse shape and he had to be rushed \nto the hospital by an ambulance. His new doctors put him on every \nsingle antibiotic the hospital had to offer.\n  Even at the extremely high levels prescribed to Carlos, the drugs \nstill didn't work.\n  It took doctors 48 hours to find and acquire an antibiotic that was \nstrong enough to kill the infection.\n  By that time Carlos' lungs, kidneys, liver, intestines and heart had \nall failed.\n  The only thing left, doctors told his parents, was his brain. The \ndoctors said that Carlos knew his body was failing and that he was in a \nfight for his life.\n  It pains me to say that this story does not have a happy ending. \nCarlos lost his life because the antibiotics that we have relied on for \n80 years didn't work.\n  No parents should ever have to undergo the heartbreak and the tragedy \nthat the Dons went through in 2007.\n  Their son was as healthy and happy as any 12-year-old could be, but \nhe was cruelly taken away from them because of a disease that we could \nnot fight.\n  I believe that with this bill we have an opportunity to prevent other \nfamilies from suffering from this same tragic story.\n  There are some who believe this legislation may actually make our \nfood supply less safe. Their argument is that antibiotics keep our \nanimals healthy, and healthy animals make for healthy food.\n  But research shows us that these concerns are misguided. Over 375 \npublic, consumer, and environmental health groups including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, \nand the Infectious Diseases Society of America, support the legislation \nbecause they believe that reducing antibiotic use in agriculture will \nprotect the health and safety of Americans.\n  It is not just health groups that support this approach. The fact is \nthat farmers and meat producers can keep their animals healthy without \nadding hundreds of pounds of antibiotics to the food and water of their \nanimals.\n  In Denmark, one of the world's largest exporters of pork, producers \nhave made modest changes to their husbandry practices and reduced \noverall antibiotic use by over 50 percent. Pork production has grown, \nand other animal health indicators such as litter size and average \ndaily weight gain have improved.\n  In Iowa, hog farmers like Paul Willis and Jude Becker have shown that \nantibiotic-free production is possible in the heartland of America too.\n  In California, companies like Niman Ranch in Alameda have proved that \nBeef, Pork, Poultry and Lamb can be produced profitably in America on a \nlarge scale without the routine use of antibiotics. In fact, fast-food \nchain Chipotle Mexican Grill has grown a highly successful business \nbased on meats raised without antibiotics, much of it supplied by Niman \nRanch.\n  This bipartisan bill makes incremental changes to ensure that our \nactions on the farm do not negatively impact the health and well being \nof our farmers, their families, and every one of us who consumes the \nfood they produce.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass these critical \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Antibiotics \n     for Medical Treatment Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In January 2001, a Federal interagency task force--\n       (A) released an action plan to address the continuing \n     decline in effectiveness of antibiotics against common \n     bacterial infections, referred to as antibiotic resistance;\n       (B) determined that antibiotic resistance is a growing \n     menace to all people and poses a serious threat to public \n     health; and\n       (C) cautioned that if current trends continue, treatments \n     for common infections will become increasingly limited and \n     expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent.\n       (2) Antibiotic resistance, resulting in a reduced number of \n     effective antibiotics, may significantly impair the ability \n     of the United States to respond to terrorist attacks \n     involving bacterial infections or a large influx of \n     hospitalized patients.\n       (3)(A) Any overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to \n     the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human \n     medicine or in agriculture.\n       (B) Recognizing the public health threat caused by \n     antibiotic resistance, Congress took several steps to curb \n     antibiotic overuse in human medicine through amendments to \n     the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) made by \n     section 102 of the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \n     (Public Law 106-505, title I; 114 Stat. 2315), but has not \n     yet addressed antibiotic overuse in agriculture.\n       (4) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of \n     Sciences stated that--\n       (A) a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone \n     will have little effect on the current situation; and\n       (B) substantial efforts must be made to decrease \n     inappropriate overuse in animals and agriculture.\n       (5) In 2010, the FDA determined that--\n       (A) 1,300,000 kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold \n     for use on food animals in the United States in 2009;\n       (B) 3,300,000 kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used \n     for human health in 2009; and\n       (C) therefore, 80 percent of antibacterial drugs \n     disseminated in the United States in 2009 were sold for use \n     on food animals, rather than being used for human health.\n       (6)(A) Large-scale, voluntary surveys by the Department of \n     Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in \n     1999, 2001, and 2006 revealed that--\n       (i) 84 percent of grower-finisher swine farms, 83 percent \n     of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep farms administer\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n     antimicrobials in the feed or water for health or growth \n     promotion reasons; and\n       (ii) many of the antimicrobials identified are identical or \n     closely related to drugs used in human medicine, including \n     tetracyclines, macrolides, Bacitracin, penicillins, and \n     sulfonamides; and\n       (B) these drugs are used in people to treat serious \n     diseases such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, \n     venereal disease, skin infections, and even pandemics like \n     malaria and plague, as well as bioterrorism agents like \n     smallpox and anthrax.\n       (7) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic \n     use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contributes to the \n     development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in \n     people.\n       (8) The periodical entitled ``Clinical Infectious \n     Diseases'' published a report in June 2002, that--\n       (A) was based on a 2-year review by experts in human and \n     veterinary medicine, public health, microbiology, \n     biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more than 500 scientific \n     studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in \n     agriculture; and\n       (B) recommended that antimicrobial agents should no longer \n     be used in agriculture in the absence of disease, but should \n     be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals and \n     prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock.\n       (9) The United States Geological Survey reported in March \n     2002 that--\n       (A) antibiotics were present in 48 percent of the streams \n     tested nationwide; and\n       (B) almost half of the tested streams were downstream from \n     agricultural operations.\n       (10) An April 1999 study by the General Accounting Office \n     concluded that resistant strains of 3 microorganisms that \n     cause food-borne illness or disease in humans (Salmonella, \n     Campylobacter, and E. coli) are linked to the use of \n     antibiotics in animals.\n       (11) Epidemiological research has shown that resistant \n     Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are associated with \n     increased numbers of ill patients and bloodstream infections, \n     and increased death.\n       (12) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Cell \n     published a study demonstrating that low-dosage use of \n     antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, \n     raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using \n     low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion \n     and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.\n       (13)(A) In January 2003, Consumer Reports published test \n     results on poultry products bought in grocery stores \n     nationwide showing disturbingly high levels of Campylobacter \n     and Salmonella bacteria that were resistant to the \n     antibiotics used to treat food-borne illnesses.\n       (B) The Food and Drug Administration's National \n     Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds \n     that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria \n     (including the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter and \n     Salmonella) that are resistant to antibiotics important in \n     human medicine.\n       (C) In December 2007, the USDA issued a fact sheet on the \n     recently recognized link between antimicrobial drug use in \n     animals and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas \n     (MRSA) infections in humans.\n       (14) In October 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine \n     published an editorial urging a ban on nontherapeutic use of \n     medically important antibiotics in animals.\n       (15)(A) In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted \n     that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of \n     $4,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 in costs to United States \n     society and individuals yearly.\n       (B) In 2009, Cook County Hospital and the Alliance for \n     Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health \n     care cost of antibiotic resistant infections in the United \n     States was between $16,600,000,000 and $26,000,000,000 \n     annually.\n       (16) The American Medical Association, the American Public \n     Health Association, the National Association of County and \n     City Health Officials, and the National Campaign for \n     Sustainable Agriculture are among the more than 300 \n     organizations representing health, consumer, agricultural, \n     environmental, humane, and other interests that have \n     supported enactment of legislation to phase out \n     nontherapeutic use in farm animals of medically important \n     antibiotics.\n       (17) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration \n     testified that the Danish ban of the non-therapeutic use of \n     antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked \n     reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial \n     species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.\n       (18) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded \n     that restrictions overseas on the use of antimicrobial drugs \n     in the production of livestock could impact U.S. export \n     markets for livestock and poultry.\n       (19) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     301 et seq.)--\n       (A) requires that all drugs be shown to be safe before the \n     drugs are approved; and\n       (B) places the burden on manufacturers to account for \n     health consequences and prove safety.\n       (20)(A) The Food and Drug Administration recently modified \n     the drug approval process for antibiotics to recognize the \n     development of resistant bacteria as an important aspect of \n     safety, but most antibiotics currently used in animal \n     production systems for nontherapeutic purposes were approved \n     before the Food and Drug Administration began considering \n     resistance during the drug-approval process.\n       (B) The Food and Drug Administration has not established a \n     schedule for reviewing those existing approvals.\n       (21) Certain non-routine uses of antibiotics in animal \n     agriculture are legitimate to prevent animal disease.\n       (22) An April 2004 study by the General Accounting Office--\n       (A) concluded that Federal agencies do not collect the \n     critical data on antibiotic use in animals that they need to \n     support research on human health risks; and\n       (B) recommends that the Department of Agriculture and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services develop and implement \n     a plan to collect data on antibiotic use in animals.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to preserve the effectiveness of \n     medically important antibiotics used in the treatment of \n     human and animal diseases by reviewing the safety of certain \n     antibiotics for nontherapeutic purposes in food-producing \n     animals.\n\n     SEC. 4.

GUN SHOW BACKGROUND CHECK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held \n     annually across the United States, attracting thousands of \n     attendees per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees \n     and nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n     other organized events, at which a large number of firearms \n     are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the \n     national firearms market;\n       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n     interstate commerce;\n       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n     organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, \n     and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have \n     moved in interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n     which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n     which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n     without background checks and without records that enable gun \n     tracing;\n       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n     at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n     background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be \n     traced to later commit crimes;\n       (7) since the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence \n     Prevention Act (Public Law 103-59; 107 Stat. 1536) in 1993, \n     over 100,000,000 background checks have been performed by \n     Federal firearms licensees, denying guns to more than \n     1,600,000 illegal buyers;\n       (8) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n     flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n     attend these events and engage in the interstate \n     transportation of firearms obtained at these events;\n       (9) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n     exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n     markets, and other organized events;\n       (10) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n     transferred illegally to residents of another State by \n     Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, \n     and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug \n     offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal \n     possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited \n     persons; and\n       (11) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals \n     and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun \n     shows, flea markets, and other organized events.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(36) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n       ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \n     for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms \n     has been shipped or transported in, or otherwise affects, \n     interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       ``(B) at which--\n       ``(i) not fewer than 20 percent of the exhibitors are \n     firearm exhibitors;\n       ``(ii) there are not fewer than 10 firearm exhibitors; or\n       ``(iii) 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, transfer, \n     or exchange.\n       ``(37) Gun show promoter.--The term `gun show promoter' \n     means any person who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates \n     a gun show.\n       ``(38) Gun show vendor.--The term `gun show vendor' means \n     any person who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, \n     or exchanges 1 or more firearms at a gun show, regardless of \n     whether or not the person arranges with the gun show promoter \n     for a fixed location from which to exhibit, sell, offer for \n     sale, transfer, or exchange 1 or more firearms.''.\n       (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 932.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for allowing us to go forward with this agreement. Senator \nDeMint wanted to ensure that this agreement would in no way limit his \nability to offer and get votes on an amendment that he cares about, No. \n460, regarding the renewable fuel standards and the estate tax.\n  Senator DeMint is correct and this agreement does not preclude the \nSenate from considering his amendment, and I thank the Senator for his \ncooperation.\n  I also very much appreciate the understanding of Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Klobuchar, Senator Thune, Senator Coburn. We have worked really \nhard trying to get to this point. It has not been easy. Most everyone \ndid not get what they wanted. But that is what agreements are all \nabout; we have the opportunity to move forward on other things. We will \nhave to decide what more we can do on this bill. But I appreciate very \nmuch their understanding. In many conversations I had with them during \nthe day they were all very courteous and thoughtful and very good \nadvocates of their position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/15/senate-section/article/S3848-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3848-S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MONGOLIAN PRESIDENT TSAKHIAGIIN ELBEGDORJ'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON, DC\n\n  Mr. REID.
