Mr. President, Americans believe Congress is broken, and it \nis no mystery why. Political divisions in this Chamber are so great \nthey often prevent the Senate from performing even its most fundamental \ndifficulties. Divisions are so great they prevented this body from \nconfirming Presidential nominees, which is a constitutional obligation \nwe have. These days, it is no longer enough to be a qualified nominee. \nIt is no longer enough to have bipartisan support. And in the case of \njudicial nominees, it is no longer enough to be reported unanimously \nout of the committee.\n  Last year, my Republican colleagues blocked or delayed scores--scores \nof outstanding nominees. Why? Because they want to defeat President \nObama. They said so. That was their No. 1 goal. And it is he who made \nthese nominations. So that is the No. 1 goal, to go after him any way \nthey can. At the end of last year, Republicans refused to allow votes \non 16 judicial nominees who were reported out of the committee \nunanimously--Democrats and Republicans.\n  Unfortunately, this year may bring more of the same. Already this \nyear--the last few weeks--some Republicans have come to the floor and \nthreatened to drag out the confirmation process for every nominee for \nthe rest of the year. This Republican obstructionism is supposedly \nretribution for President Obama's recess appointment of Richard \nCordray. No one questions his qualifications--no one. He was called \nupon by the President to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nIf we have a qualified leader at the helm, this Bureau will be able to \neffectively protest things that are wrong and protect middle-class \nfamilies from the greed and excess of big Wall Street banks. It will \nnot impact smaller financial service firms that help Americans\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\nwho do not want to use banks, and it will not impact the banks or \nnonbanks that deal fairly with consumers, but it will deal severely \nwith foreign nonbanks that are ripping off customers. This Bureau will \nserve as a watchdog against the kinds of abuses that nearly collapsed \nour financial system in 2008.\n  President Obama is right to recess-appoint Mr. Cordray. It is \nprotected in the Constitution. That is a constitutional obligation and \nbenefit President Obama has--or any President has. It is in the \nConstitution. President Bush had the same right to make recess \nappointments even though Democrats kept the Senate in pro forma \nsession. Bush did not exercise that right or challenge the pro forma \nsessions in court because Democrats worked with him to confirm hundreds \nof his nominees. Unfortunately, Republicans have refused to work with \nPresident Obama as we did with President Bush. Instead, they are \nthreatening political payback and more delays.\n  This brand of obstructionism is the reason Americans are \ndisillusioned with Congress. They believe Congress cannot get anything \ndone. It will take cooperation between Democrats and Republicans to \nturn that perception around. So we should show the American people \nthat, with cooperation--we know it works, cooperation between the two \nparties--this body can accomplish great things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S140-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STOCK ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as to the STOCK Act, I am glad to see that \nspirit of cooperation is alive as we move forward. At least I hope so. \nIt is bipartisan legislation. Members of Congress and their staff have \na duty to the American people. They may not use privileged information \nthey get on the job to personally profit. But the perception \nremains that a few Members of Congress are using their positions as \npublic servants to serve themselves instead.\n\n  Insider trading laws were created to level the playing field and stop \nWall Street excesses. And Members of Congress are not above the law. We \nmust play by the same rules by which every other American plays. The \nSTOCK Act will clear up any perception that it is acceptable for \nMembers of Congress to profit from insider training. It will end any \nconfusion over whether Members of Congress can be prosecuted for their \nserious crime. They can be.\n  I am really disappointed that I had to file cloture to stop a \nRepublican filibuster on this worthy legislation, but I did. Rather \nthan let us move to this, we had to file cloture to stop this \nfilibuster. So when we get on this bill--and we will get on this bill--\nwe are going to have an open amendment process. It is my wish that \nRepublicans will not abuse the comity that should be here in the \nSenate, and I hope these amendments that are offered will not be \nnongermane, nonrelevant. I hope we can legislate on issues that are in \nthe context of this legislation. I repeat, it is sure too bad we had to \nfile cloture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S140-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, President Obama is campaigning for reelection \non a ``soak the rich'' kind of platform. He argues that income \ninequality and economic fairness are the defining issues of our time. \nIn his narrative, the more prosperous and fair society requires more \nbalance or redistribution.\n  Unfortunately, for the President, polls suggest Americans aren't \nlining up behind this politics of resentment. For example, a Gallup \npoll reports that just 2 percent of Americans rank the divide between \nrich and poor as the most pressing economic issue facing our country, \nthat Americans are now less likely to view U.S. society as divided \nbetween the haves and have-nots than in 2008, and that only 46 percent \nbelieve reducing the wealth gap is extremely or very important; \nwhereas, 82 percent say that about accelerating economic growth.\n  Despite the class-warfare rhetoric they hear on a daily basis, most \nAmericans instinctively understand that adopting progrowth policies to \nboost mobility is wiser than adopting antigrowth policies to curb \ninequality. They realize if Washington increases tax rates, for \nexample, and the size of government to achieve greater economic \nbalance, the result will be less job creation and less opportunity for \neveryone.\n  Americans don't want the Federal Government to penalize success. They \nwant the Federal Government to make it easier for them to succeed on \ntheir own. As American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks \nwrote in his book, ``The Battle,'' earned success is the key to true \nhuman happiness and flourishing. Here is how he put it:\n\n       If we know we have the possibility of earning success, we \n     know we can improve our lives and our lot.\n\n  Most Americans, he notes, support principles that aim to ``stimulate \ntrue prosperity, not treat poverty.''\n  If we are looking to expand opportunities for earned success and \nprosperity, the best place to start is with a sweeping overhaul of our \nvery inefficient Tax Code. Progrowth tax reforms would make the system \nfairer and simpler. Right now, it functions as a mechanism to deliver \nwealth to favored constituencies rather than a means to pay for \ngovernment. In fact, syndicated columnist George Will recently noted \nthe Tax Code has been tweaked 4,500 times in the last 10 years. Most of \nthese tweaks, he wrote, have benefited ``interests sufficiently strong \nand sophisticated to practice rent-seeking.'' In other words, to get \nspecial benefits for themselves.\n  A fairer and more growth-oriented Tax Code would feature permanently \nlower rates--rates that would flatter but still be progressive. Such a \nTax Code would benefit small business owners and entrepreneurs, who are \nAmerica's biggest job creators. Many small businesses currently have \nthe cash to invest, to innovate, to expand, and to create jobs, but \nthey are sitting on the cash because of the threat of higher taxes.\n  Cutting the corporate tax rate would also fuel stronger growth and \ngreater mobility. The statutory U.S. rate is now the second highest \namong advanced economies, and it has damaged American competitiveness \nwhile holding down wages. Indeed, the most recent Global \nCompetitiveness Index from the World Economic Forum ranked the United \nStates now fifth, behind Finland, Sweden, Singapore, and Switzerland. \nIn 2008, America had the top ranking.\n  Coca-Cola's CEO Muhtar Kent recently underscored this development \nwhen he said China now has a more business-friendly environment than \nAmerica. Kent cited tax policy as a particularly large hindrance. His \nexperience may be different from a lot of others, but even for a major \nCEO to talk in these terms suggests we have more to do at home.\n  Beyond tax reform, policymakers must also stop shackling \nentrepreneurs with more and more regulations. The explosion of new \nhighly complex rules over the last 3 years has spawned a new class of \nbureaucrats entrusted with decoding and enforcing thousands of \nregulations that will affect American businesses.\n  My Republican Senate colleague Susan Collins of Maine has introduced \na bill I have cosponsored that would impose a temporary moratorium on \nnew regulations that adversely affect jobs and the economy. It would \nalso help if we could repeal the Obama administration's two signature \nlaws, the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nFrank Act, both of which have dramatically increased regulatory \nuncertainty and created new economic distortions.\n  Obviously, Republicans are not against all regulations, and we \nsupport a strong social safety net. But we are against economically \ndamaging regulations that fail a simple cost-benefit test. Both the ACA \nand Dodd-Frank would fail such a test, as would the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley \nlaw. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission surveyed publicly traded firms affected by section 404 of \nSarbanes-Oxley and it found that ``a majority felt that the costs of \ncompliance outweighed the benefits. This was especially true among \nsmaller companies.''\n  While President Obama pays lipservice to economic growth on the \ncampaign trail, many of his policies have undermined that goal. It is \nhard to create jobs at the bottom when you are obsessed with attacking \npeople at the top.\n  The case for growth and success-oriented policies is not just \npractical, it is moral. The biggest economic favor policymakers can do \nfor Americans is to support policies that make more opportunity, \nmobility, and the possibility of earned success.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today as we enter a \nnew year to honor a brave young soldier who, sadly, did not see this \nnew year. Army SSG Pernell Herrera died December 31, 2011, while \nserving in Afghanistan. He was 33 years old.\n  At times like this, words of elected officials seem so inadequate. \nWords will not ease the profound loss of Staff Sergeant Herrera's \nfamily. Words will not fully express our gratitude for Staff Sergeant \nHerrera's service to our Nation. But the death of a young soldier like \nStaff Sergeant Herrera demands our attention. It demands our respect, \nand it demands that we remember.\n  Pernell Herrera just wanted to serve his country. He enlisted in the \nNew Mexico National Guard in 2006. He was assigned to C Company, 1st \nBattalion, 171st Aviation Regiment, and he served honorably over the \nlast 5\\1/2\\ years. His journey ended in the course of that service. We \nare forever in his debt.\n  When we talk about our fallen soldiers, we honor their sacrifices and \nwe also honor their lives. Pernell Herrera was born in Los Alamos. He \ngrew up in Espanola and graduated from Espanola High School. He leaves \nbehind a son Julian and a daughter Alicia.\n  Pernell wrote about himself on his Facebook page the following \ndescription:\n\n       I am a very easygoing dad of one son, and one daughter. \n     They are the biggest joys of my life. I enjoy spending my \n     free time with my mom, and brother, family and friends. I'm \n     currently in Afghanistan with the United States Army. I have \n     served in the military for 5 years.\n\n  In the decade that our military has been fighting in Afghanistan, \nthousands of our fellow citizens have volunteered in service to our \ncountry. They have put their own safety at risk to protect the safety \nof others--in defense of the ideals we hold so dear. Some of these \nbrave warriors, such as Staff Sergeant Herrera, tragically, do not come \nhome.\n  To Staff Sergeant Herrera's family, I offer my deepest sympathies. We \nmourn your loss while we also honor his dedication to our country, and \nwe are thankful for his service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the lifeblood of our democratic government \nis the contract between the people and their elected representatives--a \ncontract that must be based on trust that elected officials will act \nfor the good of our Nation and in the interests of their constituents \nand not for personal gain. To ensure that we maintain that trust, our \nNation has laws and our Congress has rules that establish clearly the \nresponsibilities of government officials, Members of Congress, and \ntheir staffs and that provide for the enforcement of violations. The \nlegislation that will be before us is, in a way, preventive maintenance \nto protect that trust. It is a tightening of our legal and ethical \nguidelines as part of what must be a constant effort to ensure that the \ninterests of our Nation and our constituents come first. Our \nconstituents must have confidence that Members of Congress and our \nstaffs will not use our positions for our personal financial benefit.\n  There should be no doubt that regardless of our action on this \nlegislation, the STOCK Act, it is a violation of the trust our \nconstituents placed in us, a violation of the democratic process, a \nviolation of the securities laws, and a violation of congressional \nethics rules for Members of Congress or their employees to engage in \ninsider trading--the use of information not available to the public to \nmake investment decisions.\n  Insider trading is and will remain prohibited for Members of this \nbody to seek private profit through their public responsibilities, no \nmatter the fate of this bill. But questions have been raised about \ninsider trading by Members of Congress. The legislation before us today \nis designed to ensure that those questions are answered. It removes any \ndoubt that insider trading by Members and employees of Congress is \nagainst the law and against congressional rules. It is important to \nremove that doubt because any appearance of a breach in trust between \nCongress and our constituents is so corrosive to honest, open, and \neffective government.\n  Back in December, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held extensive discussions on the need to preserve that \ntrust, including a very productive hearing on December 1. Later in \nDecember, the committee held a markup and approved the Stop Trading on \nCongressional Knowledge Act, or the STOCK Act. I commend Chairman \nSenator Lieberman and our ranking member, Senator Collins, for their \nleadership and the many members of the committee, Democratic and \nRepublican, who made contributions to that process.\n  Two things became clear during our hearings and markup. First, there \nwas consensus that we should remove any uncertainty about the \nprohibition on insider trading. The second thing that became clear was \nthat there was a significant bipartisan desire to avoid any unintended \nconsequences as we sought to remove any uncertainty. We reported out \nthe legislation because of widespread agreement on our goals, but their \nremained concerns about the means, and it was understood that we would \nattempt to address those concerns before this bill came to the floor. \nSo a number of us have worked in the weeks since to make sure our goals \nand our means are in concert. The revised legislation, which will be \nbefore us, meets that objective. It should remove any uncertainty over \nthe prohibition on insider trading, and it avoids unintended, harmful \nconsequences that concerned some of us.\n  I will point to two provisions that I believe are important to \nachieving those goals. The first reassures the American people that \nthere are no barriers to prosecuting Members and employees of Congress \nfor insider trading. It does so through language establishing that \nMembers and employees of Congress have a duty arising from ``a \nrelationship of trust and confidence''\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nwith the Congress, the government, and, most important, with the \nAmerican people. Establishing such a duty removes any doubt as to \nwhether insider trading prohibitions apply to Congress. It is also \nimportant that the bill language makes clear that in offering this new \nlanguage, it does not in any way prevent enforcement of the anti-\ninsider trading provisions contained in current law. Again, I am \nconfident that, under current law, Members of Congress and our staffs \nare prohibited from insider trading. This bill will ensure that the \ncurrent prohibition is unambiguous and thereby strengthened.\n  The second major provision of the legislation instructs the ethics \ncommittees of both Chambers to issue clear guidance to Members and \nstaffs on the prohibition on profiting from inside information. This \nguidance will clarify that existing rules in both Chambers relative to \ngifts and conflicts of interest also prohibit the use of nonpublic \ninformation gained in the conduct of official duties for private \nprofit.\n  Finally, one other provision I will briefly mention, which is \nunrelated to insider trading but nonetheless an important step forward \nin terms of gaining the confidence of our constituents. As one of the \noriginators of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, I am well aware of \nthe value of transparency in government. The bill before us improves \ncongressional transparency by requiring that personal financial \ndisclosure filings required of Members and certain staff are made \navailable electronically to the public. I commend Senators Begich and \nTester for offering a measure that improves that transparent \ngovernance.\n\n  Mr. President, it is important we pass this legislation, that we \nclarify and strengthen our rules and our laws and end any uncertainty \nabout insider trading by Members of Congress. I hope we can promptly \npass this legislation.\n  Again, I commend our chairman and ranking member and all the members \nof our committee for the work they have put into this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S142-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I want to begin \ndebate, and I do so with gratitude that the distinguished ranking \nmember Senator Collins is here, as well as Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts, whose original legislation, along with Senator \nGillibrand, forms the basis of this proposal that comes out of our \ncommittee.\n  I want to go back to the beginning, to President Washington, whose \nFarewell Address seems to take on more relevance as time goes by, \nalthough it is obviously more than 200 years old now. Washington said \nin his Farewell Address that ``virtue or morality is a necessary spring \nof popular government'' and that we cannot ``look with indifference'' \nat anything that shakes that foundation or, continuing his metaphor, \ndries the spring.\n  I think we have to say in the long proud course of American history \nsince then there have been very few times where the springs of trust in \npopular government have been more dry than they are in our time.\n  I am grateful my colleague Senator McCain is not on the Senate floor \nnow because when we get to this subject, he usually says: When you look \nat the public opinion polls on Congress, the numbers of people who have \na favorable impression of this body are so low we are down to close \nrelatives and paid staff. Usually, when I am with him, I add: I'm not \nso sure about all the paid staff.\n  But, in any case, we have an opportunity with this piece of \nlegislation to take a small step forward toward rebuilding public trust \nin Congress and to restoring those necessary springs of popular \ngovernment--the trust of the people in us. This goes back just to last \nfall and early winter. A book appeared by an author named Peter \nSchweizer who was then interviewed on ``60 Minutes.'' He made \nallegations that some Members of Congress and their staffs have used \ninformation gained on their jobs to enrich themselves with timely \ninvestments, particularly in the stock market. Those allegations, as \nWashington might have said, certainly dried the springs of trust that \nwe should have with the American people, even more than they already \nare.\n  So today I am proud to rise to bring before the Senate the STOCK Act, \nwhich stands for Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012. \nThis piece of legislation puts into law language and reporting \nrequirements that will make it clear to the American people we \nunderstand being a Member of Congress means we have a responsibility to \nthe public, a public trust, and any Member of Congress or staff member \nhere who violates that trust will be punished.\n  This bill was reported as an original bill out of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs on December 14 with a \nbipartisan vote of 7 to 2. In advancing this bill, as I have said, \nSenator Collins and I worked closely with Senators Gillibrand and Brown \nof Massachusetts, both of whom sponsored versions of the STOCK Act. \nSenator Levin, who has just spoken, worked closely with us on the \nsubstitute amendment that will be filed, and I thank them all for their \ncontributions on this piece of legislation. I also thank the Senate \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for deciding this important piece of \nlegislation would be one of the first items we take up in Congress this \nyear.\n  The specific rules making insider trading illegal are found in a \nlarge body of Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory activities \npursuant to section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and \ncourt decisions interpreting those activities. Our Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on this topic \nin December, and the Securities and Exchange Commission actually filed \na statement with us for the record declaring its belief that currently \nthere is authority in the law to investigate and prosecute \ncongressional insider trading cases. The chief enforcement officer of \nthe SEC said:\n\n       Trading by congressional members or their staffs is not \n     exempt from the Federal securities laws, including the \n     insider trading prohibitions.\n\n  But other witnesses at that hearing, including Georgetown University \nLaw Professor Donald Langevoort and Columbia Law School Professor John \nCoffee told us that while the SEC might be technically right, in their \nopinion there was ambiguity in the law and they couldn't be sure how a \ncourt would rule if there was a challenge to the SEC's authority to \nbring an insider trading case against a Member of Congress or a staff \nmember.\n  That is because, as the professors explained, a person may be found \nto have violated insider trading laws only if he or she breaks a \nfiduciary duty, a duty of trust and confidence owed to somebody--\ntypically to the shareholders of a company or to the source of the \nnonpublic information. They argued it is possible a judge might decide \nthat Members of Congress do not have a fiduciary duty--in the way in \nwhich it has normally been interpreted--to anyone with respect to the \nnonpublic information that we receive while carrying out our duties.\n  Now, I must say that I find it hard to see it that way. It seems to \nme self-evident that a public office is a public trust and that Members \nof Congress have a duty to the institution of Congress, of course to \nthe government as a whole, and ultimately, most importantly, to the \nAmerican people not to use information gained during their time in \nCongress--and unavailable to the public--to make investments for \npersonal benefit. But the fact is there\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\nare some very experienced and intelligent legal experts who told our \ncommittee they couldn't certify a judge would see it exactly that way.\n  That is the first purpose of this act, the STOCK Act: to clarify the \nambiguity of securities law by explicitly stating that Members of \nCongress and our staffs have a duty of trust to the institution of \nCongress, to the United States Government, and to the American people--\na duty that Members of Congress violate if we trade on nonpublic \ninformation we gain by virtue of our public position.\n  The bill also requires the ethics committees of both Houses of \nCongress to issue guidance to clarify that Members and staff may not \nuse nonpublic information derived from their positions in Congress to \nmake a private profit.\n  Besides these changes--and this is different and important--our \ncommittee decided the STOCK Act should require Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs to file public reports on our purchases or sale of stocks, \nbonds, commodities, futures, or other financial transactions exceeding \n$1,000 in value within 30 days of the transaction. Right now, as the \nActing President of the Senate knows, these trades are reported once a \nyear in our annual disclosure statements. This proposal would change \nthat to within 30 days of the trade.\n  More timely reporting of this kind will allow not just the SEC but \nthe public to assess whether there is anything suspicious or wrong \nabout the timing of the trade and conduct in the Senate. That kind of \nreal transparency will be an additional deterrent to unethical or \nillegal behavior.\n  The bill also contains another important provision offered in \ncommittee by Senators Jon Tester and Mark Begich that will require the \nfinancial disclosure forms filed by Members and staff to be filed \nelectronically and perhaps even more significantly, therefore, be \navailable online for public review. The fact is, our reports are now \navailable for public review. But people have to go to the Office of the \nSecretary of the Senate and ask for copies of them. There is no \nsensible reason to make someone physically come to the House or Senate \nto see a copy of one of our financial disclosure forms. They are public \nrecords and they ought to be easily available to the public online, and \nthis proposal will make sure that happens.\n  Those are the three major provisions of the proposal, as I see it: to \naffirm a clear fiduciary duty under the insider trading law so it is \nclear Members of Congress and our staffs are covered by them; secondly, \nto require disclosure of trades in excess of $1,000 within 30 days; \nand, third, that those trades and our annual financial report will be \nelectronically filed and, therefore, be available online.\n  May I say, as we begin the second session of the 112th session of \nCongress, we begin with so much distrust of our Federal Government that \nI think passing the STOCK Act could have a positive effect on how we \nare being perceived, and particularly if, as I hope, we pass it on a \nbipartisan basis. The STOCK Act was passed out of our committee in \nexactly that way. I believe it has the support of Members and leaders \nof both parties in the House and Senate, and President Obama has \npromised to sign it as soon as it comes to his desk.\n  So let me end by quoting again from our first President, this time \nfrom his Inaugural Address, where he set the ideals for the new \ngovernment that our country would have. He said:\n\n       The foundations of our national policy will be laid in the \n     pure and immutable principles of private morality . . . and \n     the preeminence of free government [will] be exemplified by \n     all the attributes which can win the affections of its \n     citizens and command the respect of the world.\n\n  Enacting this proposal into law will say to our disappointed, our \nskeptical, our troubled constituents that we understand and accept \nWashington's wisdom.\n  I thank the Chair, and at this time I yield to my dear friend, the \ndistinguished ranking member of our committee, Senator Collins.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today the chairman \nof our committee, Senator Lieberman, and the sponsor of this bill, \nSenator Scott Brown, in urging our colleagues to begin consideration of \nwhat is known as the STOCK Act.\n  This legislation is based on a bill that was first introduced in the \nSenate by Senator Scott Brown and a similar one introduced by Senator \nGillibrand. Put simply, the STOCK Act is intended to ensure that \nMembers of Congress do not profit from trading on insider information.\n  As a cosponsor of Senator Brown's bill, I wish to commend him for his \nleadership in this area. I also wish to recognize Chairman Lieberman \nfor moving this important bill forward in such an expeditious manner.\n  Press reports on ``60 Minutes'' and elsewhere have raised questions \nabout whether lawmakers have been exempt, either legally or \npractically, from the reach of our laws prohibiting insider trading. At \na time when polls show record low public confidence in Congress, there \nis a strong desire on our part to address the concerns that underpin \nthe public's skepticism and assure the American people that we are \nputting their interests ahead of our own.\n  The STOCK Act is intended to affirm that Members of Congress are not \nexempt from our laws prohibiting insider trading. While several of the \nwitnesses who appeared before our committee's hearing on this bill \ntestified that there is no legal exemption for Members of Congress, \nconfusion and uncertainty nevertheless persists. For example, on the \neve of our markup, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by a Yale \nlaw professor who wrote that ``the Securities and Exchange Commission \nhas determined that insider trading laws do not apply to Members of \nCongress or their staff.''\n  This, however, is directly contradicted by the statement for the \nrecord submitted to the committee by the SEC's Enforcement Director who \nsaid: ``There is no reason why trading by Members of Congress or their \nstaff members should be considered exempt from the Federal securities \nlaws, including trading prohibitions.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the SEC \nstatement at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to me, this illustrates the confusion \nover this issue. So I am pleased the committee not only reported \nSenator Brown's bill but unanimously adopted an amendment I offered \nwith Chairman Lieberman that states clearly that Members and their \nstaff are not exempt from insider trading laws.\n  The need for this unambiguous statement can likely be traced back to \nthe nature of the insider trading laws. As our committee has learned, \nour Nation's insider trading laws are not, generally speaking, based on \nstatutes passed by Congress but rather on court precedents. As one of \nour witnesses, law professor Donna Nagy from Indiana University, \npointed out during our hearing:\n\n       Congress has never enacted a Federal securities statute \n     that explicitly prohibits anyone from insider trading. . . . \n     The explicit statutory ban on insider trading . . . is \n     entirely absent in U.S. securities law.\n\n  Rather, the SEC pursues insider trading cases under the general \nantifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws, most commonly \nsection 10B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule 10b5, a \nbroad antifraud rule promulgated by the Commission. Therefore, what \nconstitutes insider trading has largely been determined by the courts, \nincluding the Supreme Court, on a case-by-case basis.\n  Under the case law, two different types or theories of insider \ntrading violations have developed; one where the defendant is a classic \ncorporate insider using nonpublic information to trade on the company's \nstock and a second where the defendant has misappropriated inside \ninformation in violation of a duty owed to the source of the \ninformation, such as a lawyer who trades on advanced notice of a \nbusiness transaction. Both types of cases, however, share common \nelements:\n  There must be a breach of a duty, such as a traditional fiduciary \nduty or a duty of trust and confidence; the breach must involve \nmaterial information, which is the type of information a reasonable \ninvestor would consider important in making a decision to buy or\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\nsell stock; the information must be nonpublic; and the defendant must \nreceive a personal benefit, which the Supreme Court has said may \ninclude not only financial gain but also reputational benefits.\n  As the Supreme Court has held, under section 10B, the chargeable \nconduct must involve a deceptive device or contrivance used in \nconnection with the purchase or sale of securities. In criminal \nprosecutions for insider trading, under rule 10b5, the government must \nprove that a person willfully violated the provision with culpable \nintent.\n  Although the witnesses who came before the committee generally agreed \nthat Congress enjoys no exemption from insider trading laws, they also \nstressed the need to clarify the relevant duty that applies to Members.\n  The bill reported by the committee, in language refined by Senator \nLevin, addressed this issue by affirming a duty arising from the \nrelationship of trust and confidence already owed by Members and their \nstaff to the Congress, the U.S. Government, and the citizens we serve. \nAt our markup, we clarified that this does not create a new fiduciary \nduty, in the traditional sense, but rather recognizes or affirms our \nexisting duty.\n  As reported, the bill would also have amended the Congressional \nAccountability Act to prohibit Members and staff from using nonpublic \ninformation gained through the performance of their official duties for \npersonal benefit. This proposed prohibition, however, was not limited \nto the trading context or otherwise tethered to financial transactions. \nBecause it was not anchored in financial transactions, I expressed some \nconcerns about the potential breadth of this term and the potential for \nunintended consequences.\n\n  These concerns were echoed by several members of the committee during \nour consideration of the bill. Therefore, following the markup, we \ncontinued to refine the bill while adhering to the fundamental \nprinciple that Members of Congress should be subject to the same \ninsider trading laws as other Americans. I believe we have come up with \na solution that addresses the potential problem that troubles all of \nus; that is, public officials using public office for private gain. We \nneed, however, to make sure that in doing so, we do not inhibit our \nability to gather information so we can serve our constituents to the \nbest of our ability.\n  The proposed substitute offered by Senator Reid, Senator Brown, and \nSenator Lieberman reflects the work of our committee members as well as \nother bill sponsors. It would require the Senate Ethics Committee and \nthe House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to issue guidance \non the relevant rules of each Chamber, clarifying that Members and \nstaff may not use nonpublic information derived from their positions in \nCongress to make a personal profit. This would cover insider trading \nmatters, as well as land deals and other financial transactions where \nnonpublic information could be wrongly converted into a private gain.\n  Similar to the reported bill, the substitute includes a \nstraightforward statement making clear that Members and their staff are \nnot exempt from insider trading prohibitions arising from the \nsecurities laws.\n  In keeping with an amendment that Senator Paul successfully offered \nat our markup, the substitute applies the same framework--clarification \nof the prohibition against using nonpublic information for private \nprofit and the affirmation of existing duty that we have--to the \nemployees of the executive and judicial branches, as well as the \nlegislative branch. Similar to the reported bill, the substitute \nincludes earlier deadlines for financial reporting requirements and \ngreater transparency for financial disclosure statements, as the \nchairman mentioned, by requiring that they be available online and in a \nsearchable format.\n  I believe we need to reassure a skeptical public that we understand \nthat elective office is a place for public service, not private gain; \nthat it is an honor and a trust we have been given by the people we \nrepresent. Underscoring that important message is clearly the intent of \nthis bill, and that is why I support it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes to vote to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      [From U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Dec. 1, 2011]\n\n   Statement on the Application of Insider Trading Law to Trading by \n Members of Congress and Their Staffs, Before the United States Senate \n        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\n                          (By Robert Khuzami)\n\n       Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, and Members of \n     the Committee:\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide a statement for \n     the record on behalf of the U.S. Securities and Exchange \n     Commission on the subject of insider trading.\n       Insider trading threatens the integrity of our markets, \n     depriving investors of the fundamental fairness of a level \n     playing field. To deter this conduct and to hold accountable \n     those who fail to play by the rules, the detection and \n     prosecution of those who engage in insider trading remains \n     one of the Division of Enforcement's highest priorities.\n       My statement provides a summary of the Division of \n     Enforcement's recent work in the area of insider trading, an \n     overview of the law of insider trading as developed through \n     our enforcement program and judicial precedent, and a \n     description of how the current law of insider trading applies \n     to securities trading by Members of Congress and their \n     staffs.\n\n\n                 Enforcement's Insider Trading Program\n\n       Insider trading has long been a high priority for the \n     Commission. Approximately eight percent of the 650 average \n     annual number of enforcement cases filed by the Commission in \n     the past decade have been for insider trading violations. In \n     the past two years, the Commission has been particularly \n     active in this area. In fiscal year 2010, the SEC brought 53 \n     insider trading cases against 138 individuals and entities, a \n     43 percent increase in the number of filed cases from the \n     prior fiscal year. This past fiscal year, the Commission \n     filed 57 actions against 124 individuals and entities, a \n     nearly 8 percent increase over the number of filed cases in \n     fiscal year 2010.\n       The increased number of insider trading cases has been \n     matched by an increase in the quality and significance of our \n     recent cases. In fiscal year 2011 and the early part of \n     fiscal year 2012, the SEC obtained judgments in 18 actions \n     arising out of its investigation of Galleon hedge fund \n     founder Raj Rajaratnam, including a record $92.8 million \n     civil penalty against Rajaratnam personally. The SEC also \n     discovered and developed information that ultimately led to \n     criminal convictions of Rajaratnam and others, including \n     corporate executives and hedge fund managers, for rampant \n     insider trading. In addition, we recently filed an insider \n     trading action against Rajat Gupta, a former director of both \n     Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, whom we allege provided \n     confidential Board information about both companies' \n     quarterly earnings and about an impending $5 billion \n     Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, \n     who traded on that information.\n       Among others charged in SEC insider trading cases in the \n     past fiscal year were various hedge fund managers and traders \n     involved in a $30 million expert networking trading scheme, a \n     former Nasdaq Managing Director, a former Major League \n     Baseball player, a Food and Drug Administration chemist, and \n     a former corporate attorney and a Wall Street trader who \n     traded in advance of mergers involving clients of the \n     attorney's law firm. The SEC also brought insider trading \n     cases charging a Goldman Sachs employee and his father with \n     trading on confidential information learned by the employee \n     on the firm's ETF desk, and charging a corporate board member \n     of a major energy company and his son for trading on \n     confidential information about the impending takeover of the \n     company.\n       The Division also has targeted non-traditional cases \n     involving the misuse or mishandling of material, non-public \n     information. This past fiscal year, the Commission charged \n     Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith with fraud for \n     improperly accessing and misusing customer order information \n     for the firm's own benefit. The Commission also censured \n     broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott LLC for failing to \n     enforce its own policies and procedures designed to prevent \n     the misuse of material, nonpublic information. Charles Schwab \n     Investment Management was charged for failing to have \n     appropriate information barriers for nonpublic and \n     potentially material information concerning an ultra-short \n     bond fund that suffered significant declines during the \n     financial crises. This deficiency gave other Schwab-related \n     funds an unfair advantage over other investors by allowing \n     the funds to redeem their own investments in the ultra short-\n     bond fund during its decline. The Commission also charged \n     Office Depot, Inc. and two of its executives for violating \n     Regulation FD by selectively disclosing to certain analysts \n     and institutional investors that the company would not meet \n     its earnings.\n       To respond to emerging risks, the Enforcement Division has \n     developed several new initiatives targeted at ferreting out \n     insider trading, which have enhanced our effectiveness in \n     this area. During our recent reorganization, the Division \n     established a Market Abuse Unit, with an emphasis on various \n     abusive market strategies and practices, including complex \n     insider trading schemes.\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n       The Market Abuse Unit has spearheaded the Division's \n     Automated Bluesheet Analysis Project, an innovative \n     investigative tool that utilizes the ``bluesheet'' database \n     of more than one billion electronic equities and options \n     trading records obtained by the Commission in the course of \n     insider trading investigations over the past 20 years. Using \n     newly developed templates, Enforcement staff are able to \n     search across this database to recognize suspicious trading \n     patterns and identify relationships and connections among \n     multiple traders and across multiple securities, generating \n     significant enforcement leads and investigative entry points. \n     While still in its early stages of development, this new data \n     analytic approach already has led to significant insider \n     trading enforcement actions that were not the subject of an \n     SRO referral, informant tip, investor complaint, media \n     report, or other external source.\n       As part of the reorganization, the Division also \n     established a cooperation program to encourage key fact \n     witnesses to provide valuable information. Insider trading \n     investigations are extremely fact-intensive. Enforcement \n     staff undertake the often painstaking work of collecting and \n     analyzing trading data across equity and options markets, \n     analyzing communications (email, telephone calls and instant \n     messages, among others) and analyzing market-moving events \n     (e.g., announcements of corporate earnings, product \n     development, and acquisitions and mergers) to identify \n     persons who may have engaged in insider trading or who may \n     have information about such activity. Our new cooperation \n     program is a valuable tool that can help us break open an \n     insider trading investigation earlier in the process, thereby \n     preserving resources. We are already seeing the effectiveness \n     of the cooperation program in our insider trading cases and \n     expect this trend to continue as more cooperators come \n     forward in our investigations.\n       With an aggressive investigative approach that includes \n     early coordination with the FBI, Department of Justice, and \n     other law enforcement agencies, we have been able to identify \n     potential cooperators who may assist criminal authorities \n     with their covert investigative techniques, helping amass \n     critical evidence in numerous insider trading investigations. \n     Our work with certain SROs has provided valuable early tips, \n     helping us mitigate the harm from insider trading schemes by \n     freezing the illicit proceeds before funds are moved to \n     offshore jurisdictions.\n\n\n                         Law of Insider Trading\n\n       There is no express statutory definition of the offense of \n     insider trading in securities. The SEC prosecutes insider \n     trading under the general antifraud provisions of the Federal \n     securities laws, most commonly Section 10(b) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and Rule \n     10b-5, a broad anti-fraud rule promulgated by the SEC under \n     Section 10(b). Section 10(b) declares it unlawful ``[t]o use \n     or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \n     security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or \n     contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as \n     the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in \n     the public interest or for the protection of investors.'' \n     Rule 10b-5 broadly prohibits fraud and deception in \n     connection with the purchase and sale of securities. As the \n     Supreme Court has stated, ``Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \n     prohibit all fraudulent schemes in connection with the \n     purchase or sale of securities, whether the artifices \n     employed involve a garden type variety of fraud, or present a \n     unique form of deception,'' because ``[n]ovel or atypical \n     methods should not provide immunity from the securities \n     laws.''\n       There are two principal theories under which the SEC \n     prosecutes insider trading cases under Section 10(b) and Rule \n     10b-5. The ``classical theory'' applies to corporate \n     insiders--officers, directors, and employees of a \n     corporation, as well as ``temporary'' insiders, such as \n     attorneys, accountants, and consultants to the corporation. \n     Under the ``classical theory'' of insider trading liability, \n     a corporate insider violates Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \n     when he or she trades in the securities of the corporation on \n     the basis of material, nonpublic information. Trading on such \n     information qualifies as a ``deceptive device'' under Section \n     10(b), because ``a relationship of trust and confidence \n     [exists] between the shareholders of a corporation and those \n     insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason \n     of their position with that corporation.'' That relationship \n     ``gives rise to a duty to disclose [or to abstain from \n     trading] because of the `necessity of preventing a corporate \n     insider from . . . tak[ing] unfair advantage of . . . \n     uninformed . . . stockholders.' ''\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that corporate \n     ``outsiders'' can also be liable for insider trading under \n     the ``misappropriation theory.'' Under this theory, a person \n     commits fraud ``in connection with'' a securities \n     transaction, and thereby violates Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-\n     5, when he or she misappropriates confidential and material \n     information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a \n     duty owed to the source of the information. This is because \n     ``a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a \n     principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in \n     breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the \n     principal of the exclusive use of that information.'' The \n     misappropriation theory thus ``premises liability on a \n     fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted \n     him with access to confidential information.'' Under either \n     the classical or misappropriation theory, a person can also \n     be held liable for ``tipping'' material, nonpublic \n     information to others who trade, and a ``tippee'' can be held \n     liable for trading on such information.\n       A common law principle is that employees owe a fiduciary \n     duty of loyalty and confidence to their employers. In \n     addition, employees often take on contractual duties of trust \n     or confidence as a condition of their employment or by \n     agreeing to comply with a corporate policy. Accordingly, \n     employees have frequently been held liable under the \n     misappropriation theory for trading or tipping on the basis \n     of material non-public information obtained during the course \n     of their employment. This includes prosecution of federal \n     employees who, in breach of a duty to their employer, the \n     federal government, trade or tip on the basis of information \n     they obtained in the course of their employment. For example, \n     the SEC recently brought insider trading charges against a \n     Food and Drug Administration employee alleging that he \n     violated a duty of trust and confidence owed to the federal \n     government under certain governmental rules of conduct when \n     he traded in advance of confidential FDA drug approval \n     announcements.\n       In light of existing precedent regarding the liability of \n     employees--including federal employees--for insider trading, \n     any statutory changes in this area should be carefully \n     calibrated to ensure that they do not narrow current law and \n     thereby make it more difficult to bring future insider \n     trading actions against any such persons.\n\n\n Application of Insider Trading Law to Trading by Members of Congress \n                            and Their Staff\n\n       The general legal principles described above apply to all \n     trading within the scope of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. \n     There is no reason why trading by Members of Congress or \n     their staff members would be considered ``exempt'' from the \n     federal securities laws, including the insider trading \n     prohibitions, though the application of these principles to \n     such trading, particularly in the case of Members of \n     Congress, is without direct precedent and may present some \n     unique issues.\n       Just as in any other insider trading inquiry, there are \n     several fact-intensive questions--including the existence and \n     nature of the duty being breached and both the materiality \n     and nonpublic nature of the information--that would drive the \n     analysis of whether securities trading (or tipping) by a \n     Member of Congress or staff member based on information \n     learned in an official capacity violates Section 10(b) and \n     Rule 10b-5.\n       The first question is whether the trading, or communicating \n     the information to someone else, breached a duty owed by the \n     Member or staff. Although there is no direct precedent for \n     Congressional staff, there is case law from other employment \n     contexts regarding misappropriation of information gained \n     through an employment relationship. This precedent is \n     consistent with a claim that Congressional staff, as \n     employees, owe a duty of trust and confidence to their \n     employer and that a Congressional staff member who trades on \n     the basis of material non-public information obtained through \n     his or her employment is potentially liable for insider \n     trading under the misappropriation theory, like any other \n     non-governmental employee.\n       The question of duty is more novel for Members of Congress. \n     There does not appear to be any case law that addresses the \n     duty of a Member with respect to trading on the basis of \n     information the Member learns in an official capacity. \n     However, in a variety of other contexts, courts have held \n     that ``[a] public official stands in a fiduciary relationship \n     with the United States, through those by whom he is appointed \n     or elected.'' Commenters have differed on whether securities \n     trading by a Member based on information learned in his or \n     her capacity as a Member of Congress violates the fiduciary \n     duty he or she owes to the United States and its citizens, or \n     to the Federal Government as his or her employer.\n       Existing Congressional ethics rules also may be relevant to \n     the analysis of duty for both Members and their staff. For \n     example, Paragraph 8 of the Code of Ethics for Government \n     Service provides that ``Any person in Government service \n     should . . . [n]ever use any information coming to him \n     confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a \n     means for making private profit.''\n       The second question is whether the information on which the \n     Member or staff trades (or tips) is ``material''--that is, is \n     there ``a substantial likelihood'' that a reasonable investor \n     ``would consider it important'' in making an investment \n     decision? Materiality is a mixed question of fact and law \n     that depends on all the relevant circumstances. In some \n     scenarios, it may be relatively clear that an upcoming \n     Congressional action would be material to a particular issuer \n     or group of issuers, while in others it may be more \n     challenging to establish that.\n       The third critical question is whether the information on \n     which the Member or staff traded (or tipped) is \n     ``nonpublic.'' The Commission has stated that ``[i]nformation \n     is nonpublic when it has not been disseminated in a manner \n     making it available to investors generally.'' Whether \n     information is ``nonpublic'' would likely depend on the \n     circumstances under which the Member or staff learned the \n     information and the extent to which the information had been \n     disseminated to the public.\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\n       As with all issues of liability with regard to insider \n     trading and other claims under Section 10(b), the conduct at \n     issue must be intentional or reckless. Since all of these \n     issues are inherently fact-specific, it is difficult to \n     generalize about the likely outcome of any particular \n     scenario. However, trading by Congressional Members or their \n     staffs is not exempt from the federal securities laws, \n     including the insider trading prohibitions.\n\n\n   Application of Tipper and Tippee Liability Theories to Members of \n                        Congress and Their Staff\n\n       Communication of nonpublic information to others who either \n     trade on the information themselves or share it with others \n     for securities trading purposes, could be analyzed under the \n     case law relating to tipper and tippee liability and also \n     would turn on the specific facts of the case.\n       A person can be liable as a tipper where he or she \n     discloses information in breach of a fiduciary duty or other \n     similar duty of trust or confidence and the tippee trades on \n     the basis of that information. The same duty requirement \n     described above is applicable in the tipper context, as are \n     the requirements that the tipped information be nonpublic and \n     material. In addition, a court may require a showing that the \n     Member of Congress or staff member personally benefited from \n     providing the tip.\n       A person who trades on the basis of material, nonpublic \n     information conveyed by a Member or staff member in breach of \n     a duty also could be liable for illegal insider trading as a \n     tippee. An additional element of liability is that the tippee \n     knew or should have known of the tipper's breach of duty in \n     disclosing the information.\n       Investigations into potential trading or tipping by Members \n     of Congress or their staff could pose some unique issues, \n     including those that may arise from the Constitutional \n     privilege provided to Congress under the Speech or Debate \n     Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 6, cl.1. The Supreme Court \n     has stated that ``[t]he Speech or Debate Clause was designed \n     to assure a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of \n     speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation or \n     threats from the Executive Branch.'' The Clause ``protects \n     Members against prosecutions that directly impinge or \n     threaten the legislative process.'' While the ``heart'' of \n     the privilege is speech or debate in Congress, courts have \n     extended the privilege to matters beyond pure speech and \n     debate in certain circumstances. There may be circumstances \n     in which communication of nonpublic information regarding \n     legislative activity to a third party falls ``within the \n     `sphere of legitimate legislative activity,' '' and thus may \n     be protected by the privilege.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The SEC's continued focus on insider trading and innovative \n     investigative techniques demonstrates our commitment to \n     pursuing potentially suspicious trading in a variety of \n     contexts. While recent innovations in the Division of \n     Enforcement are enhancing our ability to obtain that \n     evidence, to establish liability we must satisfy each of the \n     elements of an insider trading violation, including the \n     materiality of the information, the nonpublic nature of the \n     information, the presence of scienter, and a fiduciary or \n     other duty of trust and confidence that was violated by the \n     trading or tipping. While trading by Members of Congress or \n     their staff is not exempt from the federal securities laws, \n     including the insider trading prohibitions, there are \n     distinct legal and factual issues that may arise in any \n     investigations or prosecutions of such cases. Any statutory \n     changes in this area should be carefully calibrated to ensure \n     that they do not narrow current law and thereby make it more \n     difficult to bring future insider trading actions against \n     individuals outside of Congress.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I now yield the floor to the sponsor of the bill, \nSenator Brown.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I wish to thank Ranking \nMember Collins and Chairman Lieberman for doing something very unusual \naround here, which is to get something out in a very short period of \ntime, having it not only come up and being filed by Senator \nGillibrand--her bill and even my bill--and then you both working \ntogether to move it forward for a hearing. That hearing going very well \nand coming out so quickly is unheard of, and I wish to thank you for \nthat.\n  I also wish to thank Leader Reid for bringing this bill to the floor \ntoday as well as, as I said, Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member \nCollins, and Senator Gillibrand. We have worked together to draft a \nbipartisan version of the STOCK Act, an act that passed out of \ncommittee by an overwhelming margin. That is appropriate because this \nisn't a partisan or ideological issue. It is about cleaning up \nWashington.\n  Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg of fighting to preserve \n``government of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' I \nthink that if the approval ratings are any indication, the American \npeople have lost faith that we are living up to Lincoln's ideal, and we \nneed to do it better. They have lost faith that Congress works for \nthem. They believe too many Members of Congress have come to Washington \nto make themselves rich or to do other things instead of taking care of \nthe people's business and that Congress only steps in to bail out the \npeople with the most money or the most lobbying power, and that is not \nright.\n  With the bill before us today, we can take a small step to \nreestablishing the trust between the American people and Congress. If \nwe can pass the STOCK Act this week, it will send a very strong and \nunified message to the American people that Congress does not consider \nitself to be above the law. We can start to finally address that \ndeficit of trust that the President referenced in his State of the \nUnion Address. Members of Congress must live by the same rules that \ngovern every other American citizen.\n  As you may recall from a ``60 Minutes'' investigation only 2 months \nago, we learned that Members of Congress, their staff, as well as other \nFederal employees, may be using material nonpublic information for \ntheir personal gain, either through stock trades, real estate deals or \nother financial activity. Everyone agrees this should be illegal or it \nalready is, as referenced by the ranking member and her very thorough \nexplanation of the law and the problems with it. But somehow, despite \nall the evidence, there has never been a single Member of Congress or \ncongressional staffer charged with insider trading.\n  I have to admit, similar to you and many others, I was shocked by \nthis report. I think we all were. As a result, I filed my version of \nthe STOCK Act, which would prohibit Members and employees of Congress \nfrom using material nonpublic information for their personal benefit.\n  When Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing on the state of insider trading law as it applies to Congress, \none thing was very clear. Although, as Ranking Member Collins said, the \nSEC theoretically has the ability to prosecute Members, there has been \nno precedent for it, and the state of law at this point is very \nunsettled. To remove any and all doubt, we need to act, and we need to \nact now. In addition to clarifying that insider trading is indeed a \ncriminal offense, we are increasing the transparency of Members' \ntrading activity to make sure our investment decisions are out there \nfor everyone to see as plain as day. As President Ronald Reagan liked \nto say: Trust but verify.\n  In conclusion, I wish to say that Senator Coburn has a phrase that I \nthink is very accurate in this context. He talks about all the earmarks \nand contracts and Washington spending that end up in the hands of those \npeople he calls well-heeled and well-connected. In my opinion, no one \nis more well-connected, with more access to a wide range of privileged, \nnonpublic information, than Members of Congress, their friends, \nemployees or family members.\n  At a time when our economy is struggling and the average American \nfamily has to make hard economic choices, congressional Members and \nstaff should not be lining their pockets on insider information. \nServing our country is a privilege, one I cherish very much. I believe \nwe must level the playing field and show the American people that the \npeople in Congress do not consider themselves to be above the laws we \nexpect everyone else across the country to obey.\n  I believe it is time to listen to our constituents and remember that \nevery seat in this room is the people's seat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \nstrong advocacy on such an important issue. I would like to recognize \nChairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins for their leadership and \nadvocacy and their work on getting this out of the committee so \nquickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture tonight on this \nbipartisan bill to ensure clearly and unambiguously that all Members of \nCongress, their staffs, and Federal employees play by the exact same \nrules as all the American people. The American people deserve the right \nto know their lawmaker's only interest is what is best\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nfor the country, not their own financial interests. Members of Congress \nand their families and staff should not be able to gain personal profit \nfrom information to which they have access that everyday middle-class \nAmericans do not. It is simply not right. Nobody should be above the \nrules. I introduced a bipartisan bill in the Senate with 28 of our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to close this loophole.\n  The STOCK Act legislation is very similar to the legislation \nintroduced by my friends in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman \nLouise Slaughter and Congressman Tim Walz. I thank them for their \nlongstanding advocacy and dedication to this important cause. I again \nthank Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, and all the committee \nmembers for their work in acting swiftly to move this bipartisan, \ncommonsense bill to the floor for a vote. I also thank Leader Reid for \nhis leadership in moving this body forward to this important debate and \nan up-or-down vote that the American people deserve.\n  Our bill, which has received the support of at least seven good-\ngovernment groups, covers two important principles:\n  First, Members of Congress, their families, and their staff should be \nbarred from buying or selling securities on the basis of knowledge \ngained through their congressional service or from using the knowledge \nto tip off anyone else. The SEC and the CFTC must be empowered to \ninvestigate these cases. To provide additional teeth, such acts should \nalso be in violation of Congress's own rules, to make it clear that the \nactivity is inappropriate.\n  Second, Members should be required to disclose transactions within 30 \ndays, to make this information available online for their constituents \nto see, providing dramatically improved oversight and accountability \nfrom the current annual hard copy reporting.\n  I am pleased that the final product that passed with bipartisan \nsupport out of the committee is a strong bill with teeth and includes \nmeasures such as ensuring that Members of Congress cannot tip off \nothers with nonpublic information gained through their duties and \nensuring that trading with this information would be a violation of \nCongress's own ethics rules.\n  Some critics have said this bill is unnecessary and is already \ncovered under current statutes. I have spoken with experts tasked in \nthe past with investigations of this nature, and they strongly \ndisagree. We must make it unambiguous that this kind of behavior is \nillegal.\n  My home State newspaper, the Buffalo News, noted:\n\n       . . . the STOCK Act would ensure that it is the people's \n     business being attended to.\n\n  President Obama said in his State of the Union--send him the bill and \nhe will sign it right away.\n  We should not delay. It is time to act. I urge my colleagues to vote \nyes tonight for cloture so we can pass this bill without delay. Let's \ntake this step to begin rebuilding the trust necessary in Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today the Senate will be given the \nopportunity to ban insider trading by Members of Congress and their \nstaff. Insider trading is illegal for everyone in America, and there is \nno doubt about that. But when it comes to the information that folks in \nCongress learn before the general public learns it, there are no clear-\ncut rules, and that is unacceptable. Folks in Congress clearly have \nadvanced knowledge of which bills and issues Congress will consider. \nThey know how those bills will affect basic goods and services, and \noften the legislation we pass impacts how well a company does on the \nstock market.\n  Good men and women work for Congress, and I have the deepest respect \nfor my colleagues. I would say all come to the Senate with good \nintentions and carry out their daily responsibilities without thinking \nabout using information they learn for personal financial gain. That is \nwhy banning insider trading should be an easy lift. The fact that \nMembers of Congress and their staffs are allowed to buy and sell stocks \nbased on privileged information is incredible to me.\n  Congress has historically low approval ratings from the American \npeople. They believe many in Congress do not represent them and have \nforgotten what it means to be a normal American. Most folks would \nassume Congressmen and Senators already cannot trade stocks based on \ninformation they get in their jobs, but it turns out this may not be \ntrue. That is just one more example of why the American people have \nlost faith in this institution.\n\n  As elected officials, it is our duty to regain the trust of the \nAmerican people. We have an obligation to be as transparent and as \naccountable as possible. That is why I was the first Member of Congress \nto post my public schedule online for everybody to see. My constituents \ncan look at my schedule every day to see with whom I meet and which \nhearings I attend.\n  Now we have the opportunity to help regain trust in this body by \nbringing our own rules in line with the rest of America. By adding \ntransparency and accountability, the American people will know we are \nworking on their behalf without considering personal financial gains.\n  This bill contains a provision Senator Begich and I sponsored to \nensure that the annual financial disclosure forms filed by Members of \nCongress are available electronically. As with most transparency, full \ntransparency means the public has the right and the ability to see our \nrecords. In the 21st century, there is no reason we can't do it right \naway. Letting those disclosures sit in a filing cabinet somewhere in \nthe Capitol Complex is not transparency; putting the files online in a \nsearchable format is.\n  At a time of hyperpartisanship, this is an opportunity for both sides \nto work together on a bill we sorely need. There is not a Democratic or \nRepublican angle to this. Every elected official should want to make \nsure the rules we are held to are consistent and transparent and in \nline with the rest of the Nation. In fact, this is as nonpartisan a \nbill as can be, with ideas from Senator Gillibrand and Senator Scott \nBrown but carried by Senator Lieberman. This bill covers each section \nof the political spectrum. It is a straightforward bill that is long \noverdue. The STOCK Act will be a step toward ensuring that when people \nrun for Congress or come to work for Congress, they are doing so \nbecause they want to work on behalf of the American people and not for \ntheir own personal benefit.\n  I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes on \nthis act so we can restore faith in Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I failed to reference--I \nwas hopeful I could have Nathaniel Hoopes participate in the \nlegislative process and participate on the floor in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was going to reserve the right to object to Mr. \nBrown's motion on behalf of Mr. Hoopes because I was about to that say \nthe above-mentioned Mr. Hoopes got his start in my office and I was \nlooking for an opportunity to say that.\n  We have about 20 minutes until the vote on the motion occurs. \nObviously, we are all here together--Senator Collins, Senator Brown, \nSenator Gillibrand, Senator Tester, and I--to urge Members to vote for \ncloture, to take up this measure. It would be a ray of light--warm \nlight--if we pass this measure, this cloture vote, overwhelmingly. Then \nwe could go on to debate it.\n  Some people may have amendments--obviously, I presume they will--they \nwant to offer. I hope that in considering amendments, our colleagues \nwill focus on the problem that stimulated this legislation, that led \nSenator Brown and Senator Gillibrand to introduce it and led our \ncommittee to pass it out on a bipartisan vote, which was the concern \nthat Members of the Congress and our staffs are not covered by insider \ntrading laws. This legislation makes clear that we are covered by \ninsider trading laws and therefore can be investigated and prosecuted \nfor violation of those laws, both by the SEC and the Justice \nDepartment, but we have also asked the ethics committees of both Houses \nof Congress to issue interpretive guidance, making clear that insider \ntrading is also a violation of the ethics rules of both Chambers.\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\n  I am sure there are a lot of different aspects that Members of \nCongress, including ourselves on our committee who worked on this bill, \nmight have in mind to also correct problems that exist, perhaps to also \ntry to help rebuild public confidence in the institution of Congress, \nbut I really appeal to our colleagues not to do so in a way that will \nmake it more difficult or at worst impossible to fix the wrong, the \nproblem that motivated this legislation, which is fear that Members of \nCongress and our staffs are not covered by insider trading laws.\n  I have talked to Senator Collins about this. Members have other \nideas. Please introduce them as legislation. To the extent they are \nforwarded to our committee, we will give them hearings and due \nconsideration and try to approach them thoughtfully and then follow the \nwill of the majority of members of our committee. In other words, let's \ntry to not make this measure so sweet or so good that it cannot pass.\n  I say to my colleagues, I just had a very unusual metaphor come to \nmind. I go to Dr. Seuss, one my favorite Dr. Seuss books I have not \nread in a while, ``Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose.'' I don't know if \nyou remember Thidwick, but he was a very good-natured moose. One by one \nthrough the pages of the book as Dr. Seuss records it, other animals in \nthe forest want to lodge in his enormous antlers. He welcomes them \nuntil finally there is too much there and his antlers fall off and they \nall fall to the ground. We don't want this wonderful bill, which really \ndoes accomplish some very important things, to be so loaded that it \nfalls to the wayside like Thidwick's antlers and does not pass.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in a spirited debate, but let's \nexercise the kind of restraint, on a bipartisan basis, that will allow \nus to have a significant, bipartisan, good-government accomplishment \nhere at the beginning of this session of Congress.\n  I listened to a conversation a while ago where somebody was asked, \nwhy is the public opinion of Congress so bad? And the answer was that \nit is because Congress has been so bad. This has not been a time in the \nhistory of this great institution that I think any of us feel good \nabout. This is an opportunity to do something real that we can not only \nfeel good about but, more important, that our constituents can feel \ngood about.\n  I hope we will have a resounding vote at 5:30.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I concur, and I have \nalways felt one good deed begets another good deed, and so on and so \nforth. This is a measure the American people are clamoring for. We need \nto reestablish the trust with the American people, and this is the \nfirst step in doing that very thing.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman for referencing something I failed \nto reference as well. I would encourage my colleagues on my side of the \naisle and my friends on the other side of the aisle to keep all \namendments germane. We need to make sure we move for cloture, get \ncloture, and then have a free, fair, and spirited debate on the issues \nthat concern them but don't get sidetracked to the point where the bill \ngets killed or pulled. I think that would be a travesty and a mistake. \nSo I am going to encourage my colleagues to make sure if they have a \nconcern, let's air it out and take a full and fair vote on it and move \nforward.\n  I love hearing the Senator's stories. I am reading his book because \nof his knowledge and history and the way he can weave things back and \nforth. That is a very good analogy.\n  I too have concerns. We have referenced many times that there may be \nforces beyond us who want to make sure this doesn't come out of this \nChamber and go next door and then ultimately be signed by the \nPresident. I am not one of them. I want to make sure--as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, the Senator from Maine, and many of the other Members \nand the cosponsors--that this bill comes out in a good and fair form.\n  We are here for a very specific reason, to address a very specific \nissue that affects people, quite frankly, in a manner that I never \nthought was possible. If there are other concerns, I commend the \nchairman for publicly stating to bring them up in a separate matter on \na separate bill and address them if there are issues we have missed. I \nhave a fear--and I hope I am wrong--that by making it, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut referenced, too perfect or too sweet, it could fail, \nand I don't want to see that. I want to make sure we have a laser-sharp \nbill that addresses a very specific issue, and if we do it together and \nwork in a true bipartisan manner, we have an opportunity right now in \nthis moment in our history of this country to do something special.\n  I was sent here to do the people's business, and I do it each and \nevery day by working across party lines with good people and good \nDemocrats like the Senator from Connecticut and others. I take that \nrole very seriously. We have an opportunity right now to send a very \npowerful message for which the American people are yearning. They want \nus to do well. They want us to be good. They want us to be better than \nwe have been representing ourselves right now.\n  So I am encouraging--just to reference and take it a step further--my \ncolleagues to do the same thing. Let's put our party differences aside. \nLet's put the inner party differences aside and push this legislation \nthrough in a thoughtful, methodical, respectful, and responsible manner \nthat will make the American people say: OK, it is a good first step. \nWhat is next, Congress? Are we going to do the postal bill and try to \nsave the postal bill? I hope that is the next issue. We need to work in \na truly bipartisan manner.\n  Once again, who is here? It is me, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Cochran who are pushing to try to save the post \noffice. That should be the next issue. What is after that? We need to \naddress our fiscal and financial issues so we can come out of this 3-\nyear recession in a lean-and-mean manner so we can be a better country \nand be able to compete on a global basis.

It is a very \nstrong statement of support for the principles and exactly the kinds of \nthings Senator Collins, Senator Brown, Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nTester, and I have been saying.\n  As the President said in his State of the Union speech, if we can get \nthis bill to his desk--and the sooner the better--he will sign it as \nsoon as he possibly can.\n  If there is no one else who wishes to speak at this time, I would \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one week ago today, I addressed the \nSenate on President Obama's decision to bypass the Senate, and the \nConstitution as well, by making four ``recess'' appointments at a time \nwhen the President's recess appointment power did not apply.\n  I explained in detail why the legal memo released by the Obama \nadministration attempting to justify President Obama's actions did not \nhold legal water.\n  Last Thursday, I laid out the case that this is not an isolated \nincident or a technical legal squabble. Rather, the President's recent \nactions are part of a pattern of disregard for the constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances.\n  Today, I will address why such criticisms are justified and why such \ncriticisms are necessary.\n  First, is it legitimate for a U.S. Senator to criticize a legal \nopinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel and the Senate-confirmed \nhead of that office?\n  I have no doubt Senators may criticize such opinions and, when the \nfacts warrant, ask whether that office and its head are exercising the \nindependence that is required for the Constitution to be upheld. \nRecently, we read some in the media apparently disagreed with this. \nThey say it is wrong for a Senator to ever criticize a Senate-confirmed \nofficial's independence and judgment. They say that all a Senator can \ndo is criticize the official's substantive arguments.\n  I say nonsense. When the media makes these claims, it merely seeks to \ndivert attention from the weakness of the opinion's actual conclusions \nand reasoning. In my statement last week, I laid out my disagreement \nwith the contents of the Office of Legal Counsel. Of course, Senators \nand administration officials can reach different conclusions on the \nlaw; each can have a reasonable point of view; but that is not the case \nhere.\n  If the Office of Legal Counsel is to be ``the Constitutional \nconscience of the administration'' that some in the media characterize \nit to be, it must exercise a certain level of independence, as I \nmentioned in my statement.\n  When a President who takes an expansive view of his power asks the \nJustice Department officials, who owe their job to him, whether he has \nthe constitutional or legal authority to take such action, there is \nalways the chance that pressure will overtake their responsibilities to \nprovide their best legal judgment.\n  That is why at Ms. Seitz' confirmation hearing and in a followup \ncommunication, we took very painstaking efforts to give her the \nopportunity to state on the record her commitment to providing \nindependent legal advice, to make sure she would place loyalty to the \nlaw and loyalty to the Constitution above her loyalty to the President. \nThat was our purpose. Ms. Seitz promised to act independently. She \npromised not to stand idly by if she thought the Constitution was being \nviolated.\n  The only way to tell whether the office has given independent advice, \nthe only way to tell whether pressure has been resisted, is to review \nthe arguments and the reasoning the Office of Legal Counsel provides.\n  The media cannot address criticism of whether the head of that office \nis independent and has used good judgment without such a review. It is \nnot enough that the media might agree with her conclusions. In this \ncase, the analysis in the Office of Legal Counsel opinion was so poor \nas to raise legitimate questions concerning judgment and independence.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to give the President \nobjective legal advice before that person acts. It is not supposed to \nprovide a weakly thought-out rationalization for a Presidential \ndecision to act that has already been made.\n  Here, the arguments in the opinion are so weak that a fair-minded \nperson can question the independence and judgment of the opinion's \nauthor. For instance, the opinion is internally inconsistent. It \ncorrectly recognizes that a President's ability to make recess \nappointments turns on the capacity of the Senate to conduct business. \nBut in determining whether the pro forma sessions constitute a recess, \nthe opinion does not consider at all the capacity of the Senate to \nconduct business and what it could do. Rather, it relies upon what \nindividual Senators said, not what the institution said or can do, and \nit ignores not only what theoretically the capacity of the Senate had \nto act but even its actual actions.\n  Similarly, the established meaning of the word ``recess'' is the same \neach\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\ntime it appears in the Constitution. Giving the term the same meaning \nmeans that the President can make recess appointments, but that this is \na limited power.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel, contrary to clearly established \nprecedent, inconsistently defines the term ``recess'' differently when \nit was used in different parts of the Constitution. But we cannot do \nthat. The only thing consistent in the opinion is that it interprets \nrecess each time in a way that expands the power of the President to \nmake recess appointments and in such a way as to leave open the \nquestion of whether that power is limited in any meaningful way.\n  Former Federal Circuit Judge Michael McConnell, himself a former \nJustice Department lawyer who has defended Presidential power, found \nthe arguments in the Office of Legal Counsel opinion to be so \nimplausible--those are his words--that ``it is difficult to escape the \nconclusion that the Office of Legal Counsel is simply fashioning rules \nto reach the outcome that it wishes.''\n  Since the outcome that the Office of Legal Counsel wishes is to \nexpand Presidential power contrary to the text of the Constitution, and \nalso many decades of historical practice, it is quite fair to question \nthe independence, the judgment, and the adherence to statements made \nduring the confirmation process by the head of that office.\n  The media again focused more on personalities than on substance, and \nthey will say the Bush administration reached a similar conclusion, so \nhow can Ms. Seitz be criticized. That is where the media is coming \nfrom.\n  There are three points to be made that set the record straight for \nthe newspaper.\n  First, President Bush did not make recess appointments when the \nSenate was in pro forma session. Secondly, President Bush did not even \nclaim he could make such recess appointments while declining to do so. \nThird, his Office of Legal Counsel did not issue any opinion that would \nbe binding on future Justice Department advice.\n  Unlike the public actions of the Senate-confirmed head of OLC, a \nlower level official in the previous administration, the Bush \nadministration, apparently wrote a secret memorandum to the file on \nthis subject.\n  The existence of such a memorandum was not known until the Office of \nLegal Counsel's opinion referred to it and sought to rely on it. It is \nnot possible to evaluate the reasoning of that memorandum because the \nDepartment of Justice has not agreed to release it, despite my request \nthat they do release it.\n  If the Office of Legal Counsel is to exercise the independent \njudgment that is necessary for it to properly perform its functions, it \ncannot rely on some sort of secret memo or memos from lower level \nofficials. That approach creates incentives for the Office of Legal \nCounsel heads to avoid accountability. An incentive is created for the \npreparation of secret memoranda that make outlandish claims of \nPresidential power if they cannot be reviewed by anybody. No one knows \nof the memo. So its arguments do not face the transparency of public \nscrutiny. The President and Office of Legal Counsel take no \nresponsibility for its conclusions.\n\n  Then the Office of Legal Counsel later issues a public opinion on the \nsubject. To bolster very weak arguments, it cites earlier memos. But it \navoids transparency as well by keeping the memoranda secret, so no one \ncan see that the opinion's weak arguments may be supported by only \nother weak arguments. It avoids accountability by suggesting that this \nquestion was already decided by an earlier Office of Legal Counsel \nmemorandum.\n  Instantly, the number of administrations that support expanded \nPresidential power goes from zero to two, neither one of which is said \nto be responsible for that expansion. That bootstrapping can never lead \nto a reasoned, objective analysis of Presidential power.\n  It cannot produce the independent OLC that Ms. Seitz promised the \nSenate she would provide at her confirmation. The media has also made \nthe strange argument that Ms. Seitz' opinion must be professional and \nher judgment and independence cannot be questioned because of her high \nprofessional reputation.\n  Is that not a little bit backward? The legitimacy of the argument \ncontained in a legal opinion is not established by the reputation of \nthe person who wrote it. Reputations are not steady. They are \nestablished by the quality of the professional work, not the other way \naround.\n  In the past, a prominent Democratic Senator called for a judge to \nresign because of his legal work as Office of Legal Counsel head. The \nWashington Post, in an earlier editorial, criticized the opinions of \nother Bush administration OLC lawyers as displaying ``the logic of \ncriminal regimes'' and ``bringing shame to the American democracy.''\n  If the Post truly believes that criticizing Office of Legal Counsel \nlawyers is beyond the pale, they should retract their earlier opinions \nand condemn the far harsher rhetoric that was hurled against Bush OLC \nlawyers.\n  While explaining what is wrong with the newspapers, I now go to \nexplain why my criticisms were not just legitimate but they were \nabsolutely necessary. Last Thursday, I laid out in great detail a long \nseries of abuses of executive authority and usurpation of legislative \nauthority by President Obama and his administration.\n  In fact, he made his willingness to bypass Congress a campaign issue \nwith slogans such as ``We can't wait for Congress,'' and those \nheadlines and slogans were splashed all across the White House website. \nPresident Obama has made the decision to run for reelection not on his \nrecord, for obvious reasons, but against Congress. In doing so, he is \ndaring Congress to defend its role as representatives of Americans from \neach of the 50 States in the face of his unilateral agenda.\n  Some have suggested this is a clever political trap laid by President \nObama; that if Congress resists the President's power grabs, it will \nvalidate his slogans and play into his electoral strategy. This may or \nmay not be true. However, the stakes are greater than the next \nPresidential election, and the implications of the President's actions \nwill be felt well beyond any short-term political gain.\n  The Framers of the Constitution foresaw the temptation by one branch \nof government to try to usurp the powers of the other branches. In \nFederalist 51, James Madison explained how the Constitution was \ndesigned to prevent power grabs through an ingenious system of checks \nand balances.\n  He wrote this long quote:\n\n       But the great security against a gradual concentration of \n     several powers in the same department consists in giving to \n     those who administer each department the necessary \n     constitutional means and personal motives to resist \n     encroachments of the others.\n       The provision for defense must in this, as in all other \n     cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition \n     must be made to counteract ambition.\n\n  Of course, this assumes a desire on the part of each branch to guard \nits constitutionally granted powers.\n  If some Members of Congress are not willing to resist an encroachment \nbecause they place party loyalty above constitutional responsibilities \nor if members are reluctant to push back for fear of political \nconsequences, then the system of checks and balances will not work as \nintended by our Constitution writers.\n  All Members of Congress swore an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution. That is our first obligation. I want to be clear that \nthis is not an argument about constitutional semantics; it is one of \nfundamental principle.\n  As Madison explains in Federalist 51: The ``separate and distinct \nexercises of the different powers of government'' is ``essential to the \npreservation of liberty.''\n  This also goes beyond an argument about the ends to which President \nObama has used the new powers he now claims. His agenda is \ncontroversial, to be sure, or he would not have had to bypass Congress.\n  Still, even those who support this President's policies should not be \nso quick to look the other way. Once the walls separating the powers \nallotted to each branch of government are eroded, they are very \ndifficult walls to rebuild.\n  The most eloquent expression of the philosophy on which our Nation \nwas founded is, of course, the Declaration of Independence. I quote the \nall familiar:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\n     endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, \n     that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \n     Happiness.\n       That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted \n     among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the \n     governed. . . .\n\n  Based on these fundamental principles, the Constitution laid out a \nform of government designed to protect individual rights by resisting \nthe concentration of power. This can be frustrating to those who would \nlike a more activist government. Still, these features of our \nConstitution perform a very important role in preventing one faction of \nAmericans from dominating another faction of Americans.\n  I am sure President Obama is convinced his agenda is what is best for \nthe country and that the ends justify the means in pursuing that \nagenda. But that is not the Machiavellian ideas that any of our \nConstitution writers had.\n  Naturally, he doesn't see any danger in concentrating power in the \nPresidency because he believes he will use that power very wisely. \nMoreover, he has gone out of his way to identify himself with the \nschool of thought that the constitutional separation of powers is an \noutdated barrier to change.\n  Last month, President Obama gave a speech in Kansas in which he \nsought to link his agenda to Teddy Roosevelt's famous ``New \nNationalism'' speech at the same place in 1910. The original speech \nmarked the beginning of Roosevelt's break with many of his past \npolicies and with the incumbent Republican President, William Howard \nTaft.\n  Roosevelt then went on to challenge Taft in the 1912 election, \nheading up the Progressive Party ticket. You know that both Roosevelt \nand Taft lost.\n  In that 1910 speech to which President Obama paid tribute, Roosevelt \ndescribed his new nationalism as ``impatient of the impotence which \nsprings from overdivision of governmental power.''\n  This philosophy seeks to fundamentally transform the United States \nfrom a nation founded on the principle that protecting the unalienable \nnatural rights of each citizen is the paramount goal of government to \none that empowers an enlightened elite to take whatever actions they \ndeem necessary to correct perceived wrongs in society. In other words, \nthrow the Constitution out the door. This may start out with very good \nintentions, but there is no guarantee that once our constitutional \nprotections are gone, future leaders will always act in the most \nenlightened way. In fact, the single-minded pursuit of a better society \nat the expense of individual rights has led to some of history's worst \ntyrannies.\n  Moreover, not only is the concentration of power in the executive \nbranch contrary to the founding principles of our Nation, it is foreign \nto the realities of American civic life. With a country as large and as \ndiverse as ours, no individual can claim to speak on behalf of all \nAmericans. Our constitutional system, based on federalism, separation \nof powers, and checks and balances helps ensure that each American has \nthe opportunity to live their life as they see fit.\n  I return to the words of James Madison:\n\n       It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard \n     the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to \n     guard one part of society against the injustice of the other \n     part.\n\n  The voices of all Americans deserve to be heard through the elected \nrepresentatives of the people. That is what is at stake. Those of us \nwho were elected to represent the people of our States should do just \nthat or we deserve not to be here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I want to take 60 or 90 seconds to \ndiscuss the subject that the Senator from Iowa discussed; that is, the \nappointment of Richard Cordray to the Consumer Protection Bureau. I \nchecked with the Senator's story earlier during this move through the \nBanking Committee on which the Presiding Officer sits. Never in history \nhas anybody in one party blocked even a vote of a Presidential nominee \nwho is admittedly qualified only because they don't like the agency.\n  That would be a little like, as Senator Reed from Rhode Island said, \nrefusing to confirm an appointee to run the FDA until the Congress \nweakens food safety laws. It runs counter to everything we believe. I \nwasn't insisting that my Senate colleagues all support Richard Cordray, \nformer attorney general from Ohio, who is eminently qualified for this \njob. We were saying to just let it come to an up-or-down vote.\n  Instead, the minority party filibustered, stopped that, and the \nPresident had no choice but to act because the agency simply could not \ndo its job. Only 2 years ago, this agency was created, this consumer \nbureau, to have a consumer cop on the beat to keep Wall Street banks \nand payday lenders and everybody in between honest. It took 60 votes in \nthe Senate, including the Presiding Officer and me, and 58 others, to \nsay this agency should be created and the consumer bureau should be in \neffect. That is the history of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S151-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S151-S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING BRANDON MOORE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise today to honor Detective \nBrandon Moore, of the Morrow County, OH, Sheriff's Department and \nOhio's first recipient of the Congressional Badge of Bravery.\n  Established in 2008, the Congressional Badge of Bravery is an annual \naward from the U.S. Attorney General to public safety officers who \ndisplay bravery in the line of duty.\n  Earlier this month, Congressman Jim Jordan and I had the honor of \npresenting the award to Detective Moore, along with Morrow County \nSheriff Steven Brenneman and sheriffs and law enforcement officers from \nacross central Ohio.\n  It was an honor to meet Detective Moore--to hear his story of heroism \nand to see his humility firsthand.\n  In October 2010, Detective Moore was shot multiple times and nearly \nkilled in the line of duty during an ambush and firefight.\n  When you hear about what happened, you can imagine the scene.\n  Then-Deputy Sheriff Moore received a report of neighbors engaged in a \nproperty dispute.\n  He traveled to the scene. But in the course of the investigation, he \nsuspected criminal drug activity in one of the homes.\n  The story quickly turned to the unimaginable.\n  One of the neighbors came out of his house with an assault rifle and \nstarted firing.\n  Detective Moore was shot in the groin, leg, foot, and abdomen.\n  As Detective Moore has described it, the normal reaction of fear, \nshock, doubt, and panic was overwhelmed by a calmness that only highly-\nskilled police training could provide.\n  Severely wounded and laying on the ground--Detective Moore first used \nhis belt to create a tourniquet on his leg. He then shot and disabled \nhis assailant from more than 50 yards away.\n  In doing so, he saved himself, three civilians, and other officers.\n  Yet his injuries were so life-threatening that he made the \nunimaginable call to his wife--Diandra, his high school sweetheart--\nexplaining what happened, wanting her to know how much he loved her and \ntheir children, Alec and Andrew.\n  Fortunately, help quickly arrived to the scene.\n  Detective Moore was airlifted to the hospital for multiple surgeries \nand where he stayed for a month.\n  Law enforcement from across central Ohio visited the hospital to show \ntheir support--speaking volumes of the solidarity of a sacred \nbrotherhood and sisterhood.\n  Today, Detective Moore is on the road to recovery--well ahead of \nschedule.\n  He was told it could take two or three years before he could return \nto duty. Detective Moore thinks he'll do it in 18 months.\n  He recently hit one of his goals of running a quarter of a mile \nwithout stopping. Before April, his goal is to run half a mile.\n  And as difficult as the recovery has been for him--he remains \ngrounded by humility and faith, and the love of his family.\n  Diandra has been with him on every step of the highs and lows of \nrehabilitation.\n  To their children, Alec and Andrew, when you're older, you'll \nunderstand more than most people, the meaning of duty, love, and faith.\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\n  I had the honor of meeting Detective Moore's parents, who raised him \nand his siblings near my hometown of Mansfield, OH.\n  His parents--mother Tommie and father Jim--still live there.\n  Jim is also a police officer--the sense of duty and faith runs deep \nin the family.\n  And it's not just for a father seeing a son follow his footsteps--\nit's also for a mother seeing both her husband and son put on a uniform \nto protect the public.\n  Like much of our great State, Mansfield is a place where you grow up \nwith the values of hard work and fair play--service, community, and \nfaith.\n  Detective Moore's story illustrates those values as clearly as any.\n  We ask a great deal from our law enforcement officials--to risk their \nlives each day and each night.\n  And while we may never guarantee their safety, in honoring their \nservice we give meaning to their sacrifice.\n  That's what the Congressional Badge of Bravery reflects--the very \ncharacter of our Nation that honors those who serve us.\n  We ask. And as he says himself, guided by faith in God, family, and \nhis fellow officers, Detective Moore gave. And we're all humbled by \nthat service.\n  Thank you, Detective Brandon Moore. A proud State and grateful Nation \ncontinue to offer our prayers and well wishes for you and your family.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S152-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S152-S153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER MICHAEL COPPS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise to honor Dr. Michael Copps. \nAt the end of last year, Dr. Copps retired from public service--though \nnot from public life.\n  For those of you who do not know him, I want to take this opportunity \nto tell you about him, the life he has led, what he has done for this \ncountry--and what he has done for all of us.\n  After earning a doctorate in U.S. history from the University of \nNorth Carolina, Dr. Copps headed south to the Big Easy. He taught \nhistory at Loyola University in New Orleans. It was there that he met \nhis wife Beth.\n  Academe had its pull. But so did Washington. So in 1970, he convinced \nhis wife to pack up their life and move north to the capital. He heard \nthe call of policy and politics and told her that after he got it out \nof his system, he would head back to university life.\n  He never did head back to the halls of the academy. But his keen \nmind, calm demeanor, and dedication to the public interest have taught \nall of us about what it is to lead an honorable life in public service.\n  He started in Washington in the office of Senator Fritz Hollings. He \neventually served for over a dozen years as Senator Hollings' chief of \nstaff. He is well known and well loved by so many who served in the \noffice of the South Carolina Senator. I know that Fritz Hollings too is \nproud to call him a colleague and friend.\n  From the Halls of the Senate, he headed on to industry. He took on \npolicy operations in Washington for a Fortune 500 manufacturing \ncompany. He also worked at a major trade association.\n  With the election of President Clinton, however, he again heard the \ncall of government service. He first served as Deputy Assistant \nSecretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce. During his tenure, he \nfostered public sector and private sector cooperation to strengthen \nAmerican industry. He led the U.S.-Russia Business Development \nCommittee's oil and gas working group. In this role, he pushed \nsuccessfully for the removal of an export tax for U.S. companies \nshipping oil out of Russia. He negotiated power, chemical, and \nautomotive policies with China. He built partnerships involving forest \nproducts, agriculture products, and electrical power in Russia, \nUkraine, and Turkey. He assisted generously with global automotive \nnegotiations and trade promotion initiatives.\n  Five years later, he was nominated and confirmed by this body, for \nAssistant Secretary for Trade Development at the U.S Department of \nCommerce. Again, he served nobly. He worked with the private sector to \nexpand commercial opportunities for U.S. businesses in the global \neconomy. He oversaw a reorganization of trade development within the \nDepartment, creating a new office focused on information technologies \nindustries. He also advocated internationally for the creation of \nindependent telecommunications regulatory regimes, transparent legal \nauthority for telecommunications, and investor-friendly climates for \ninformation technology.\n  He did all of these things at the Department of Commerce with his \ncharacteristic force, impressive analytical skills, and customary \ngrace.\n  But it was only sometime after his tenure at the Department of \nCommerce that I really came to know Dr. Copps. That was when, in 2001, \nhe was first nominated, and later confirmed, for the role of \nCommissioner at the Federal Communications Commission. He brought to \nthe role the same energy and enthusiasm that he displayed at the \nDepartment of Commerce. He brought the same sense of conviction, and he \nbrought the same belief that through expanding the stakeholders in any \ndialogue, we can enrich our conversation, grow our economy, and enhance \nour public life.\n  His accomplishments over the course of his two terms at the agency \nare too numerous to mention. So I will dwell only on a few.\n  First, as the Acting Chairman of the agency he led the national \ntransition to digital television. He was the man in charge of keeping \nthe television on, as our Nation's broadcasters ceased sending signals \nin analog form. His calm, clear focus, and ability to marshal public \nand private efforts to manage the transition kept millions and millions \nof households with access to television news, emergency information, \nand entertainment.\n  Second, he called early and often for policies to support broadband, \nunderstanding well before others that broadband is the great \ninfrastructure challenge of our age. It was here that his eye for \nhistory served him especially well, as he analogized between broadband \nnetworks and the railroads that criss-crossed our country more than a \ncentury before; between opening ports to new markets and opening \ncommunities through new communications networks; and between the need \nfor our interstate highway system and the need for new broadband \nbyways. He called for a national broadband plan well before it was \npopular to do so. He reminded us that rural Americans must not be left \non the wrong side of the digital divide. In fact, he tirelessly \npressured to expand service to the historically underserved--from rural \nareas, to Indian Country, to those with disabilities, and more--\nbelieving that access to communications technologies strengthens our \neconomy and our democracy.\n  Third, he was an early champion of the open and free Internet. As our \nlives migrated online, he saw the risks posed by the control of both \nconnectivity and content. He gave early voice to basic concepts that \ngrew to become network neutrality.\n  Fourth, and finally--he has emerged as an important voice on media \npolicy. He has never shied from asking the hard questions about our \nmedia institutions. He has criticized media concentration for diluting \nthe diversity, localism, and competition we need in our information \nsources. He has worried for all of us that with the shuttering of \nnewspapers and thinning of journalism's ranks, we are doing great harm \nto the public's need to know. He was not blind to the great \ninformational promise of the Internet, but instead a realist about its \nnear-term journalistic limitations. Without an informed citizenry, he \nreminded us over and over again, we risk what is essential for \ndemocracy. His zeal for this issue was anything but academic. He took \nto the road and held countless hearings outside of Washington--giving \nthousands of people across the country the opportunity to speak about \nthe changes in our media landscape, and the information they need in \ntheir communities.\n  As part of this, he also pressed for less indecency in the media, and \nless coarse content on our airwaves. His media policies had fans and \nalso detractors. But both uniformly respected how he took on these \nissues and how deeply committed he was to his cause.\n  Simply put, they do not make men like Michael Copps anymore. He \nrepresents the best in public service. So as Dr. Copps turns in his \nbadge and turns\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\nto spending more time with Beth and their family of five children, I \nwanted to come to the floor and congratulate him on his \naccomplishments. His has set an example for all of us. This one-time \nhistory professor has earned his place in history. I know I am grateful \nfor his service to this country. I am also grateful to call him a \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S153-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THE DICK FAMILY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor a family of \nentrepreneurs who have been loyal and persistent in contributing to the \neconomy of the Commonwealth, the Dick family of Science Hill, KY. The \nlate brothers Arl and Carl Dick opened two separate general stores over \n60 years ago which are still open for business and family operated \ntoday. In the midst of an economy where small businesses commonly \nstruggle, it is inspiring that Kentucky's very own Pulaski County has \ntwo successful family-run businesses that have withstood the test of \ntime.\n  The brothers Carl and Arl were Kentucky natives, but were living in \nOhio when they decided to return to their Pulaski County roots and open \na general store that would become a backbone in the local economy. At \nthe beginning of 1952, there were a total of three general stores in \nthe downtown area of Science Hill; one owned by local businessman Ed \nGibson and the other two belonging to the Dick brothers. The stores \nwere ahead of their time; they not only carried a full line of \ngroceries but were supplied with items such as shoes, clothes, and \nhardware as well.\n  None of the three stores were necessarily in competition with each \nother because each store specialized in carrying a different supply of \nitems. Carl's grandson James Dick, who grew up working in the family \nbusiness, started out as a delivery boy. If a customer requested an \nitem that a particular store did not have in stock, James would run \nfrom store to store to find the item and make sure it was delivered to \nthe customer.\n  Carl's son Russell Dick remembers the generosity his father showed to \ncustomers on a daily basis. Carl initiated a local system of credit so \nfarmers could obtain the items they needed with an agreement that they \nwould pay for the items as soon as their crops were sold. Carl was also \nnotorious for investing in the local economy. He would lend money to \nfarmers who wished to purchase new farm equipment and entrepreneurs who \nwere interested in starting local businesses, all of which was paid \nback to him in full.\n  For the past half century, the general stores of downtown Science \nHill have provided a family atmosphere for customers and have \nestablished a reputation for caring about their community. Carl Dick's \nGeneral Store--now run by Carl's son and daughter-in-law Russell and \nHazel Thurman Dick--and Science Hill Market, now run by Arl's widow \nRuth Elliot Dick, still value friendly, caring customer service above \nall else. This devotion to the local customer has led to the long-\nlasting success of this small Kentucky business in today's modern \neconomy.\n  The Pulaski County-area publication the Commonwealth Journal recently \npublished an article that illustrates the impact three generations of \nthe Dick family and their businesses have made on the community of \nScience Hill. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n             [From The Commonwealth Journal, June 19, 2011]\n\n          Carl Dick's General Store: A Science Hill Tradition\n\n                             (By Don White)\n\n       Wal-Mart would have had a tough time competing with the \n     Science Hill of yesteryear.\n       Three general merchandise stores once operated downtown, \n     all within a few feet of each other, carrying items ranging \n     from shoes and clothing, paints, wallpaper, and flooring, to \n     a full line of groceries.\n       Brothers Arl and Carl Dick each opened his own store at \n     about the same time, and both remain in business.\n       Arl's widow, Ruth Elliot Dick, is owner/manager of Science \n     Hill Market, and across the way is Carl Dick's General Store, \n     where his son and daughter-in-law Russell and Hazel Thurman \n     Dick hold down the fort, often assisted by their son, James.\n       The Pulaski County natives opened their stores in 1948 and \n     1952 after returning home from living in Ohio.\n       ``Arl's is the oldest, and the other store in town was \n     operated by Ed Gibson,'' says James. ``They were so close \n     together, it was almost like they were under the same roof,'' \n     notes the former delivery boy/floor sweeper/stocker, and \n     cashier who grew up in the business.\n       James supplemented the $5 per week paid for working in the \n     store with such chores as delivering mail, watering flowers \n     for residents at a nickel per job, and mowing lawns.\n       ``I was so young when I started mowing my customers had to \n     start the mower for me,'' he says laughingly.\n       Often, when things were extra busy in the store, James \n     welcomed the opportunity to make deliveries and figures he \n     went to every house in town, either by walking, riding a \n     bike, motorcycle or driving a golf cart.\n       ``When our store didn't have something a customer wanted, \n     chances were pretty good one of the others would, so I did \n     the running from store to store picking up and delivering the \n     items.''\n       The 45-year-old bachelor and 1984 Somerset High graduate \n     remains on the run, currently serving as president and CEO of \n     Morris & Hislope and Pulaski Funeral homes, in addition to \n     being a licensed funeral director. Life lessons learned in \n     the store are given credit for the success he enjoys today in \n     the world of business and helping people.\n       He learned about credit due to a big portion of the \n     customers purchasing items with an agreement to pay when \n     their crops were sold.\n       When adults would gather around the coal stove in the \n     center of the building and swap stories and words of wisdom, \n     James tried to stay within hearing distance.\n       ``Adults were always talking, and I was listening, picking \n     up lots of good advice along the way.''\n       His papaw stressed the value in remaining humble throughout \n     life, saying . . . ``If you've got a quarter in your pocket, \n     be sure and make people think it's a nickel,'' and to always \n     be thrifty.\n       ``I once ended up with $25 at the end of a month of \n     working, and they took me to Roses to pick out toys. I bought \n     all quality toys. Ended up with a basket full and plenty of \n     change left over.''\n       Well versed in local history, James says his pawpaw's store \n     was called Four Brothers and operated by the Randall brothers \n     when Carl took over.\n       Arl purchased his store from Millard Roy.\n       ``All the stores stayed extremely busy, and there was never \n     a feeling of one being in competition with the other because \n     each was known for certain items.\n       ``We specialized in shoes, feed and clothing,'' says James.\n       ``I can remember selling bibbed overalls for $2.98 per \n     pair,'' says Russell, also widely known as a used car dealer \n     from 45 years with two lots in Science Hill.\n       James has always been aware of the respect people in the \n     area have had throughout three generations of service for \n     Dick family members.\n       ``I have all good memories of growing up in Science Hill, a \n     really close-knit community that's a great place to live and \n     work.\n       ``It's been a pleasure to see all the progress, like \n     watching Charles Hall (former superintendent for the Science \n     Hill Independent School System) build that school into one of \n     the best in the state.''\n       At the visitation for his papaw, he heard from dozens of \n     people about the things he had done for them, including \n     lending money for the buying of farm equipment.\n       ``Vernon Merrick told me that papaw took a dollar off every \n     pair of shoes he bought his children, and that meant a lot.''\n       Coming to town to ``do your tradin' '' at the three stores \n     was a big deal.\n       ``I seldom meet an area family who didn't shop downtown,'' \n     he says.\n       And the best thing about the good ol' days is that they \n     aren't over yet in Science Hill, Kentucky.\n       Carl Dick's General Store is open Monday through Saturday \n     from 8 A.M. until 5 P.M., still selling everything from \n     delicious baloney sandwiches to diamond rings.\n       Even old-fashioned candy is still sold by the pound at \n     Christmas time.\n       In fact, the shelves are still stacked high with so much \n     merchandise, the walkways are passable, but very narrow.\n       ``Chances are, if you want it, we've got it, if we can find \n     it,'' says Hazel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S153-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S153-S154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMIE KAMAILANI BOYD\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I wish to congratulate an \ninnovative educator and health care professional from my State, Jamie \nKamailani Boyd, from Kaneohe, HI, on receiving the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation 2011 Community Health Leaders Award. The award was presented \nat a ceremony last November in Baltimore.\n  This award was given to ten individuals throughout the Nation who \nhave overcome challenges to improve health and quality of life in \ndisadvantaged or\n\n[[Page S154]]\n\nunderserved communities. The award provides $20,000 to each recipient \nfor personal development and another $105,000 to the project with which \nthe awardee is affiliated. I am confident that this funding will be put \nto good use in Dr. Boyd's hands.\n  Dr. Boyd is a nursing assistant professor and a health programs \ncoordinator for the University of Hawaii's Windward Community College, \nWCC. She is the first Native Hawaiian faculty member at the University \nof Hawaii to have earned a Ph.D. while also being a registered nurse. \nCarrying on a family tradition of nursing learned from her grandmother, \nshe set out to better the health care system in Hawaii by improving \nnurse training and patient care.\n  To help achieve those goals, Dr. Boyd created the Pathway out of \nPoverty program at WCC. The program is founded on Native Hawaiian \ncultural values and seeks to encourage and train Native Hawaiian and \ndisadvantaged students pursuing careers in nursing. She aims to reduce \npoverty, increase the number of Native Hawaiian nurses, and improve the \nquality of nursing care by producing more empathetic and culturally \ncompetent providers. Today, Dr. Boyd trains about 50 nurse's aides a \nyear with approximately one-quarter of them going on to pursue an RN \ndegree.\n  As an educator and former principal, I know firsthand about the \ncountless hours that go into creating curricula and reaching out to \nstudents. It makes me proud to see outstanding educators receive well-\ndeserved national recognition for their hard work. Dr. Boyd's \ndedication to her field and to the people of Hawaii is undeniable. I \napplaud her for earning this outstanding recognition, and I wish her \nmuch continued success in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S154-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEW MEXICO'S STATEHOOD\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this month marked the 100th \nanniversary of New Mexico's statehood. In recognition of this occasion, \nthe Senate Historian, Donald Ritchie, wrote a wonderful piece \nhighlighting the political and ethnic issues surrounding New Mexico's \nefforts to become a State. I thought it would be nice to share this \nhistorical note with the public by including it in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Ritchie's Senate Historical Minute, \ntitled ``New Mexico Enters the Union,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n               Senate Historical Minute--January 6, 1912\n\n\n                      New Mexico Enters the Union\n\n       A century ago, on January 6, 1912, New Mexico entered the \n     Union as a State. This ended a 64-year effort to achieve \n     statehood, stalled by a combination of political and ethnic \n     prejudice.\n       In 1848, the United States acquired vast territories in the \n     Southwest under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, which ended \n     the Mexican War. The problem was how to organize this \n     territory without inflaming tensions between the North and \n     South over the spread of slavery. The treaty had provided \n     that inhabitants of the territories would become citizens and \n     would be admitted into the Union as States ``at the proper \n     time (to be judged by the Congress of the United States).'' \n     President Zachary Taylor thought that sectional tensions \n     might be eased if New Mexico and California immediately \n     applied for statehood and avoided territorial status. The \n     Compromise of 1850 admitted California but ignored New \n     Mexico's application for statehood.\n       Over the next six decades, other Western States were \n     admitted ahead of New Mexico. Congress at that time was often \n     divided between a Democratic majority in the House and a \n     Republican majority in the Senate. Each party tried to block \n     the admission of a new State that might give the other party \n     two more Senators. Because New Mexico was viewed as a \n     potentially Democratic state, the Republican Senate thwarted \n     its admission. In 1888, Republican majorities in both houses \n     passed an omnibus statehood bill that enabled North and South \n     Dakota, Washington, and Montana to move towards statehood, \n     but omitted New Mexico.\n       Besides politics, New Mexico met resistance from Senators \n     who questioned whether its largely Spanish-speaking, Catholic \n     population was capable of self-government ``in the Anglo-\n     Saxon sense.'' Senator Albert Beveridge, who chaired the \n     Committee on Territories, traveled through New Mexico and \n     Arizona in 1902 and came back convinced that neither was \n     ready for statehood. President Theodore Roosevelt, however, \n     was anxious to settle the issue, and to break the logjam he \n     proposed combining the territories of New Mexico and Arizona \n     into a single State. Its capital would be in Sante Fe, but it \n     would take the name Arizona. When submitted to the voters, \n     New Mexico passed the proposal, but Arizona soundly defeated \n     it.\n       In his last annual message to Congress, President Roosevelt \n     abandoned the idea of a combined territory and proposed that \n     each should gain statehood. Senator Beveridge continued to \n     fight statehood, but in 1910 Congress adopted the Enabling \n     Act to admit both New Mexico and Arizona. New Mexico \n     immediately submitted an acceptable constitution, but \n     objections were raised against Arizona's more progressive \n     constitution. As a result, New Mexico's admission was blocked \n     by a Senate filibuster until Arizona's constitution was also \n     approved. New Mexico at last became a State on January 6, \n     1912, and Arizona followed a month later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S154-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF PAUL LANEY\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

Sheriff Laney \nhas just been named the Sheriff of the Year for 2011 by the National \nSheriff's Association, and I can tell you that it is a well-deserved \nhonor.\n  Sheriff Laney has long been known for his tireless, diligent and \ninnovative efforts on behalf of the people of Cass County. He is always \nout in public putting the best face on the Sheriff's Department and \nworking hard to strengthen community bonds in that part of the Red \nRiver Valley. Last year he received the 9-1-1 Government Leader Award \nfrom the E9-1-1 Institute for his work in helping create the Fargo-\nMoorhead regional dispatch center, which was the first in the nation to \nintegrate services across State lines.\n  Sheriff Laney also played a strong and pivotal role in coordinating \nresponse to major flooding in both 2009 and 2010 in Cass County. The \nflooding in 2009 was the worst ever seen in the region, and his \nleadership made a major difference in a situation that many thought \nwould end in catastrophic loss.\n  I congratulate Sheriff Laney for being named Sheriff of the Year.

The following essays were selected as \n``Honorable Mentions.''\n  The Statements follow.\n\n    Hannah Apfelbaum, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable \n                                Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       America is not living up to its full potential. We have one \n     of the highest child poverty rates in the Western world, a \n     high unemployment rate, and test very low in math and science \n     compared to other developed countries. And that's not all--we \n     also face environmental challenges and the decline of the \n     middle class. We must use our differences to unite us by \n     tackling all aspects of the issues we face. But America is \n     asking how, specifically, do we solve these problems?\n       First, we need to decide what problems not to solve. Iraq \n     and Afghanistan are not in ideal condition. This does not \n     mean, however, that we should be pouring all of our money \n     into military efforts there. Instead, we need to make more \n     money available for the most pressing issues in our own \n     country.\n       One way to make more money available is to stop giving the \n     wealthiest people the biggest tax cuts. It is understandable \n     that politicians are concerned about backlash from these \n     influential citizens, but the majority of people in this \n     country--the middle class--needs to be taken into account. \n     With the national debt becoming greater and greater, these \n     tax cuts simply are not sustainable.\n       So where should our money go? The first priority should be \n     education. Successful experiences in the early years of \n     school make children much less likely to drop out or end up \n     in prison--an entity that tax dollars pay for, with less than \n     stellar results. Investment in public elementary schools \n     benefits both the children and the general public. We also \n     need to spend money on college financial aid programs. The \n     most successful students who cannot pay their own tuition \n     deserve to have this opportunity, and will most likely make a \n     large contribution to society in their adult lives. All \n     contributions to education will help make Americans qualified \n     to obtain jobs that will provide them with comfortable wages, \n     and stimulate the economy.\n       We also need to spend money on healthcare. Every American \n     has the right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness.'' Life, especially, is very hard to maintain \n     without adequate healthcare. The right to be safe is \n     something that needs to be provided\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\n     to all citizens. It is simply not acceptable for a child in \n     need of a treatment such as chemotherapy to not be able to \n     access it. It is time that we live up to this responsibility. \n     And in providing safety, a clean environment is also \n     essential. Clean air helps reduce our risk of cancer, lung \n     disease and numerous other health issues.\n       America--now is the time to make choices for the benefit of \n     our national community. We need to fund education. We need to \n     fund healthcare. We need to take environmental action. It is \n     time for each of us to advocate and actively work for these \n     policies so that America can reach its full potential.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Erin Clauss, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       My fellow Americans, as we move into 2012, there are \n     serious issues that must be resolved. The American middle \n     class is in crisis. Hard-working Americans are losing their \n     jobs, and are unable to care for and provide for their \n     families. This nation is drowning in debt. Americans are \n     unable to pay for basic needs, like healthcare.\n       The Occupy Wall Street movement has brought to all of our \n     attention how important fixing the economy is. As of November \n     2011, 7.6 million Americans have lost their jobs during this \n     recession. The unemployment rate is declining, but there is \n     still much work to be done. These people want to be able to \n     support themselves. They don't want to be living off food \n     stamps and have their homes foreclosed on. They want to work. \n     They want to be able to afford to give their children a \n     college education. The United States has the most expensive \n     college tuition in the world, leaving young adults struggling \n     with debt. They have difficulty paying off that debt when \n     they are unable to find a decent job after graduation.\n       Part of the solution must be to raise taxes on America's \n     wealthiest citizens. This isn't about class warfare. It's \n     about saving the American economy. Those who can afford to \n     pay more have the responsibility to do so. To be able to pay \n     off our debt and bring back the so-called ``American dream,'' \n     we desperately need to raise revenue, and this is the clear \n     solution.\n       Due to this recession, many Americans cannot afford to buy \n     health care. They are uninsured and unprotected. Over 44 \n     million Americans do not have health insurance. This is an \n     outrage. Health care is a basic right that should be \n     guaranteed for everyone. If, in the Declaration of \n     Independence, we, as a nation, claim to guarantee the rights \n     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we must do \n     so. By allowing insurance companies to deny our people \n     adequate medical care, we are taking away their right to \n     life. This must be remedied.\n       What we really need now is compromise. Nothing can or will \n     be achieved if the leaders of our nation, the representatives \n     of the people, refuse to compromise and work together towards \n     the betterment of our country. This crisis is not unsolvable. \n     We have the tools to fix the situation in our nation today, \n     but only if both sides are willing to make concessions to \n     help us move forward into the future as a powerful nation.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Yamuna Dahal, Winooski High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The United States of America is country of opportunity and \n     success. We believe in our country and our confidence. We \n     believe that we would eventually succeed overcoming any \n     obstacles. We never fear to try something new. We are always \n     trying to show the world our power of unity and diversity. We \n     got the best entrepreneurs in this country whose continues \n     hard work and confidence made our country the best among the \n     world, we do have some issues that need to be fixed.\n       Our parliament system is based on equality and liberty. Our \n     democratic governmental system enhances the public voice to \n     be heard. Anyone, who is capable and willing of leading this \n     country, could be elected freely regardless of their \n     ethnicity, race or social background.\n       For the last decade, our country is facing many problems. \n     The average income for the American family is falling down. \n     Many of our American families are losing their jobs because \n     companies outsourced their jobs to foreign land. Companies \n     and rich peoples are getting richer whereas the average \n     income families are falling towards the poverty line. There \n     are others concerns like illegal immigration, and increasing \n     crime. There are also issues such as recovery of hurricane \n     Katrina at New Orleans, Oil spill at the Gulf of Mexico and \n     California fire. I could go on and on and never finish \n     mentioning our problems.\n       However, for our generation increasing college tuition is a \n     matter of headache. Our parents' incomes are spent paying \n     their college loans and home mortgages. Today `saving for the \n     children's college' is rarely heard from average income \n     family parents. Today, it's very hard to get accepted for \n     scholarship at colleges and university so the only way to go \n     to college is to `take a loan.' However, in this economy, \n     many of our college graduates are jobless and are under the \n     debt of more than 100K dollars. And the numbers of those \n     college graduates are increasing along with their debts. Many \n     students get frosted about their college loans and choose to \n     go to community college. Universities and research centers \n     are beyond their imagination. It is decreasing our confidence \n     and our hope for the better future. As a young high school \n     student, I myself have to start thinking about college and my \n     future jobs as early as my eighth grade.\n       To prevent ruining our future the government should put a \n     limit for private colleges and universities tuition. There \n     should be more scholarships available for needy students. \n     High school students should get opportunity to take college \n     courses during summer to reduce their semesters when they \n     actually go to college. They should be properly trained about \n     money management and time management. The government should \n     increase and improve community colleges and government state \n     universities and reduce the price. The number of colleges and \n     universities should be increased in the remote site of the \n     country and make it more accessible for everybody.\n                                  ____\n\n\nJulienne DeVita, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Dear Fellow Americans: Today, I stand before this great \n     nation, to speak to the concerned, hardworking Americans, \n     with the intent of bettering the state of this country. I \n     would like to bring to your attention three of the most \n     pressing issues which I feel need to be addressed in 2012 in \n     order for the United States of America to reach it's full \n     potential; the environment, our economy, and college \n     education costs.\n       This past year, after 10 years of war, and frustration, the \n     United States Military Forces found and defeated a key leader \n     of the Al Quaida movement; Osama Bin Laden. This brought \n     relief and feelings of security back to Iraqi and American \n     citizens. We ended a war and are bringing our troops back \n     home. Now however, it is the time for our government to focus \n     on domestic issues, three important things that need to get \n     done in our country.\n       Firstly, fossil Fuels are a finite commodity in our world \n     today, and whose dwindling supply has lead our country to \n     face the unavoidable subject of Global Warming. We need to \n     focus the public's attention not only on the devastating \n     effects of the environment, but ultimately what will happen \n     to human life on this planet. There needs to be more public \n     awareness of the long-term disastrous affects that global \n     warming will inevitably bring to our world. We need to \n     commission scientists to create more practical and affordable \n     solutions to this problem.\n       Another issue that is of paramount importance is the state \n     of our economy. We must invest in America; American jobs, \n     American-made products, and the American people. Companies \n     need to be rooted in this country so that more jobs can be \n     made available to the 8.6 percent of unemployed Americans. \n     Financial incentives must be available for businesses to stay \n     in the U.S. and employ the American workers.\n       America needs to close the vast gap between rich and poor \n     in this country. Actions that progress the wealth down \n     through the middle and lower class are essential. Since 1978, \n     the cost of college tuition has increased more than 900 \n     percent. Costs of a college education have to be more \n     affordable for our young adults who are planning and \n     investing in their futures.\n       As we reach towards these goals, our country's leaders have \n     to come together and put aside their religion, skin color, or \n     the fact that they are a Democrat or Republican in order to \n     address these issues and find solutions. We must put aside \n     our differences and compromise towards the common good. \n     Individually we are not as strong as when we all work \n     together.\n       We are a country rich of talent, knowledge, and resources. \n     By vowing to work together on the issues of the environment, \n     our economy, and college education costs, we will be ensuring \n     a better future for all Americans. Let's make our future one \n     to look forward to.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Alden Fletcher, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Our union is a union of people, a people who recently have \n     been vocal about the state in which they find themselves. \n     From the tea party to Occupy Wall Street, everywhere there is \n     a movement rising up, demanding similar changes to a broken \n     system. The people are hurting, they have lost their jobs, \n     they are dealing with a harsh economic recession and thus far \n     our government has failed them.\n       Our government has proven itself incapable of effectively \n     dealing with the diverse and complicated problems currently \n     threatening this nation. Our legislative body is crippled by \n     partisan gridlock, the executive branch has been lenient in \n     its duty to protect the American people and their rights, \n     and, the power of common citizens in politics is being \n     marginalized in favor of the interests of the wealthy. The \n     need for reform is evident.\n       First the influence of special interests in government must \n     be diminished; legislators should be motivated by a desire to \n     ensure public good, not a job at a lobbying firm. In \n     addition, the effects of Fec v. Citizens United must be \n     reversed, and new restrictions must be established that limit \n     an organization's media power and its access into the \n     political system.\n       Second, we must be certain that the federal government is \n     vigorous in its regulatory capacity. Whistblowers, people who \n     report\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n     nefarious or negligent activity against the public, must be \n     protected to the utmost; further initiatives need to be taken \n     that increase accountability within the government \n     bureaucracy. This will guarantee that the federal government \n     does not abuse its power in the same manner as it has with \n     national security.\n       Our country is a democracy, and it is the citizens' \n     prerogative to keep government in check. However, many states \n     have instituted laws that place unnecessary burdens upon \n     voting rights. In order for a democracy to function it \n     requires popular participation and it should be the \n     imperative of government to encourage all those who are \n     eligible, to vote. Through the means of a constitutional \n     amendment, the federal government must be granted increased \n     jurisdiction over national elections. Thus the government can \n     create standardized voting requirements, implement automatic \n     voter registration and facilitate absentee balloting, all of \n     which are vital steps to giving underrepresented groups, for \n     instance young people, more of a say in the national debate.\n       Finally there must be a new a sentiment of cooperation and \n     compromise in Washington if there is to be progress. A \n     government that continually threatens to shut down due to \n     petty disputes does little to serve the people. Changing the \n     way this nation is governed will allow us to tackle issues \n     from climate change to inequality, from the rising cost of \n     college education to promoting human rights across the globe. \n     However, if no action is taken we can accomplish nothing, and \n     it is our responsibility to be an educated and vigilant \n     electorate, to ensure that this does not happen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Jack Du Pre, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The state of this nation is declining. It has become an age \n     where men and women of higher education status can't find \n     work and an age where the natural order of employment has \n     been shaken by a decline in productivity and availability of \n     jobs. Teens, like me, cannot find work due to the fact that \n     many ``white collar'' workers have no choice but to take jobs \n     that they would normally not consider. At a resort near my \n     school, the common denominator of the wait staff this summer \n     was that most held Masters Degrees and two held PhD level \n     educations. Waiting tables was what they could find for work.\n       From our youngest days in school we are charged to go to \n     college and further our education. We are taught that the \n     American dream is alive, well and available for those \n     diligent and hard working. The present realities make that \n     seem more like a fairy tale and the realities of the current \n     economic situation more of a harsh reality. America is in \n     need of a direct approach to stimulate the economy. The \n     answer is not pouring more money into the economy, but \n     deciding what will be made here and made with precision, \n     passion and pride. The economy is stagnant because of lack of \n     direction and focus.\n       In conclusion, the mending needs to come from three places. \n     It needs to come from a Congress joined by a common \n     interest--America and not divided by partisan rhetoric and a \n     current state of blaming the other side. It needs to come \n     from American corporations who decide to invest in America \n     and in American ingenuity. Lastly, it needs to come from the \n     people who are mired in frustration and apathy. If all three \n     forces face the future and address the issue of what America \n     truly needs, then the country can begin to live as it has in \n     the past, as a beacon for other countries as a place where \n     dreams can come true.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Emma Hamilton, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       At the dawn of 2012, the United States is facing a \n     multitude of pressing issues. Currently, the U.S. poverty \n     rate is 15.1 percent, the highest since 1993; the \n     unemployment rate is 8.6 percent; and an unprecedented string \n     of natural disasters has overcome our country in 2011. \n     Compounding all these problems is our divided Congress, which \n     has proven to be largely ineffective in addressing these \n     daunting issues in a concerted and resolute manner. In this \n     critical time, it is imperative that change comes soon.\n       The root of many of our country's problems originates with \n     our degraded education system. There is a great gap in \n     opportunities for early education, which is in large measure \n     based on income. Studies have proven that a quality early \n     education is essential for a successful future. Re-building \n     and strengthening our early education system must become a \n     top priority if the country wants to see future positive \n     change.\n       When American children are born, they are told that if they \n     follow the rules: go to school, work hard, and attend \n     college, then they will be rewarded with a promising future. \n     Nowadays, graduates fresh out of college find that even \n     though they followed the rules, they struggle to find the \n     promising future that they were led to believe would be \n     there. America needs to find a way to put our educated people \n     back to work with jobs that will build our economy, \n     community, and country.\n       This past year extreme tornadoes ripped through the \n     southeast. Hurricanes and tropical storms flooded communities \n     along the eastern seaboard. Furthermore, the summer of 2011 \n     was the hottest ever in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, \n     causing heat waves and record droughts. This extreme weather \n     has cost our country over $35 billion dollars. Most can agree \n     that the climate is drastically changing at unprecedented \n     rates. The time has come that the human race faces the \n     effects it has on Mother Earth. The United States emits more \n     than 5,425 million tons of carbon dioxide every year, ranking \n     it second highest worldwide. We must join together as a \n     nation to find quick solutions to this ever-growing problem \n     before it is too late.\n       In 2011, Congress proved to be one of the most divided and \n     uncompromising Congresses the American public has ever seen. \n     In a time of crisis, America needs congressional leadership \n     with creative solutions and a willingness to work together to \n     get things done. It is vital that Congress moves forward \n     without partisan bickering and focuses on making positive \n     change.\n       During a time of high unemployment, living with a degrading \n     education system, and increasing environmental catastrophes, \n     our country cannot afford to wait anymore. The time has come \n     for Americans to come together to solve the problems we are \n     facing. Although we are confronted with many issues, there is \n     hope for a brighter future. America has repeatedly shown it \n     is strong and can and will restore itself to become the \n     thriving and great nation it is capable of being.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Zach Holman, Champlain Valley Union High School, (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       I stand before our great nation to address the current \n     state of the nation. 2011 was a struggle for many people, \n     students were ending college carriers thousands of dollars in \n     debt, scraping every last penny to cover medical bills \n     because health insurance is too costly, or many were just not \n     able to find a job whether he or she was an adult or \n     teenager. 2011 is behind us and 2012 is here, things will \n     improve. For this year there are three crucial changes our \n     government must make to make America truly great again and \n     fully prosperous we must get people working, enact a one-\n     payer healthcare system that ensures coverage to all, and a \n     higher education program that makes college affordable for \n     levels of income and status.\n       The past few years have led to the demise of the middle \n     class. This is due to the fact higher paying positions do not \n     exist and no one is hiring. Everyone from the age of 16 to 65 \n     is under pressure to find work and yet most cannot. This \n     year, 2012, it will change. At the end of the 2011 the \n     unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent, an improvement, not \n     a solution. We must make it so those able to and willing to \n     work can. My plan is to start programs that train a work \n     force for different skilled positions that there is a demand \n     for. Then I will make sure that these positions are \n     available. If this means subsidizing certain industries to \n     increase demand and promote hiring, I see that it happens. It \n     is time to get America working again whether you are a \n     teenager or elderly adult jobs will be available.\n       This country has attempted to tackle the healthcare \n     problem, and each time it does not succeed in the way most \n     hope. It is time to throw away the old system and start new; \n     it is a new year and a time for new ideas. The only way to \n     bring quality healthcare to all Americans is through a one-\n     payer system. A system that makes sure no citizen goes \n     uncared for. To make this possible we must de-privatize \n     insurance companies and give coverage to all. Life is not a \n     luxury only people of certain socioeconomic statuses deserve, \n     it is a basic human right and a one-payer system is the only \n     way to make it possible.\n       Education is my last topic for the night. Today only \n     students in dire need of financial aid receive it to attend \n     college. This is not right and does not work. Middle class \n     families barely can afford the outrageous price of tuition \n     for one child let alone two or more. We must enact new forms \n     of aid that make college affordable for all and give everyone \n     an equal opportunity.\n       The country needs help, but with a few small changes \n     success is possible. God bless you and God bless the United \n     States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Katie Leavitt, Woodstock Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Crises encourage friendships. They force people to act as a \n     community and work together, especially when they involve \n     those that they care about. They create situations that bring \n     out the good in people who would otherwise never step up to \n     lend a hand.\n       The town of Woodstock has lived through a crisis this past \n     fall: Hurricane Irene.

Community members recognized \n     that friends and relatives who were dear to them were in \n     trouble, so they stepped up to help make a change, because in \n     light of a crisis, they cared. When a tree lay across my road \n     after taking out a power line, everyone in my neighborhood \n     helped those who weren't able to get to their homes by \n     providing them with food, showers, and shelter. My family \n     even created a path through our field to allow people to \n     drive through to the other side. Crises involving family, \n     friends, and neighbors force people into action, and they \n     create a better environment through a sense of urgency and \n     caring.\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\n       A major issue in our country today is the poverty crisis. \n     One cannot enter a city without passing someone with all \n     their belongings in a bag, asking for any money to help \n     alleviate their situation. The majority will walk by and do \n     nothing. The whole country begs for change: an end to \n     poverty, yet they walk right by when a person in need asks \n     for help. The only feeling in walking by is guilt that you \n     have more than they, and can relieve the guilt by handing \n     them a dollar or two. However, this does nothing to solve the \n     problem as a whole; it only gives one temporary peace of \n     mind. They do nothing to truly help because there is no \n     intrinsic pull to help them, just a sudden guilt. They feel \n     no real sense of urgency to do anything, as they have no \n     connection to the person. It is the sense of caring for this \n     person and the urgency to alleviate their situation that they \n     lack.\n       The solution to the crisis of poverty is to replicate this \n     feeling. To find a way to make people truly care about those \n     that they walk by in the street everyday to get to work. \n     Organize committees to issue government grants to motivated \n     groups of people who will find a way to engender the feeling \n     of community in their own hometowns and cities. Grant them \n     the money for them to create ways for the poor and wealthy \n     alike to become friends, and begin to form a community. \n     That's all it takes: when you know someone, and you realize \n     they are having a crisis, you go out of your way to help fix \n     the problem, because that's the way it always works: absolute \n     neediness from people you care about brings everyone \n     together. The wealthier people will begin to look around and \n     realize that their new friends are deep in the middle of a \n     crisis, and they will do something about it. Trust me. I've \n     seen it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Theophila Lee, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       As a nation, the most pressing concern we currently face is \n     our current education system. An issue of vital important to \n     the next generation of this country, and therefore to the \n     nation itself, I am dismayed by the lack of progress our \n     nation seems to be making in this area. Instead of further \n     sensationalizing the statistics of the abysmal standards of \n     U.S. students in comparison with their international cohorts, \n     I have decided instead to give some practical suggestions.\n       The change has to come from all levels--from the students, \n     the teachers, the schools, and the communities. At the basic \n     levels, subjects should be taught in a more integrated way. \n     History, literature, and art should be interwoven and studied \n     together. This ability to reach across traditional \n     disciplines and explore their relationships will develop \n     increasing well-roundedness in student. It will force pupils \n     to make interdisciplinary connections, an educational \n     experience that I believe ultimately makes a better informed, \n     creative, and open-minded student. Collaboration should be \n     encouraged more often. For teachers, teaching skills should \n     be continually sharpened, with time to take courses, attend \n     conferences, and share lessons and tips with other teachers, \n     online and in person. Should school districts want to explore \n     the option of merit pay, they should base it on the above \n     criteria, certainly not test scores of a teacher's students. \n     Additionally, schools (with the assistance of the community \n     at large) should require that students complete various \n     internships with businesses, government agencies, etc. This \n     allows students to explore their passions and expose them to \n     the world of work through school-to-career programs and \n     internships.\n       Finally, I find it appalling that lowering the cost of \n     college tuition while still maintaining the quality of our \n     higher education system is still not a high enough priority.\n       Our higher education system is something America should be \n     proud of; every year, the Ivy League and top liberal arts \n     colleges receive an increasing number of international \n     applicants, all who recognize the superiority of a U.S. \n     education. However, the price tag is an entirely different \n     issue. While it's understandable that cutting costs will \n     inevitably create conflict, couldn't college presidents be \n     held more accountable for the rising costs? This previous \n     semester, a Stanford professor tried an experiment where he \n     opened up his class to anyone online--for free. Expecting to \n     get only 10,000 people, he instead found that by the end of \n     his course, 140,000 pupils from all around the world had \n     enrolled. Perhaps the government should encourage top \n     colleges to explore technology in higher education through \n     government subsidies. More paying students would lead to \n     lower prices. It would also reduce the frenzy of high-school \n     seniors as we find ourselves competing with as many as 10 \n     other students for a place in our top choice college. I \n     believe this would be a win-win situation for both parties \n     involved.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Giovanina Mier, St. Johnsbury Academy (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       In the eternal words of our country's Preamble of the \n     Constitution, it is stated that the purpose of the United \n     States is ``to form a more perfect union, establish justice, \n     insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, \n     promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of \n     liberty for all''. Today, over 224 years later, these words \n     may seem distant and unreachable. However, they still remain \n     the foundation of our government and ideals that we, as the \n     American people, should strive to achieve.\n       In recent years, our government and political systems have \n     become increasingly polarized and radical. While this is not \n     inherently unfortunate, it has led to the inability of groups \n     of differing opinions to compromise. Without compromise, \n     democracy cannot function. In order for the people to \n     exercise their sovereignty in such a way as to spark change \n     and improvement in both our country and the world, we must \n     first be able to express the will of the majority. With two \n     equally unbending political parties pitted against each \n     other, our government has become stagnant. This effects even \n     minor problems, but is especially crucial in the economic \n     recovery that is the desire of every American. With the \n     inability to come to agreements on smaller negotiations, how \n     can we expect to solve the larger problems of our staggering \n     debt, unemployment, and inflation? The economic recession has \n     injured every American, from the college student unable to \n     find a job with a Master's degree in their field to the small \n     business that must close its doors.\n       These problems facing the American people cannot be solved \n     by simply holding fast to one's beliefs. While it is valuable \n     to have those in government that adequately and accurately \n     represent the ideas, morals, and beliefs of the American \n     public, compromise does not mean that one has to entirely \n     renounce everything they hold to be right and true. Instead, \n     compromise asks that we come to a place at which both parties \n     can agree upon one idea or principle. Does that seem so much \n     to ask? Of course, compromise in practice is more difficult \n     than in theory, but by striving for this ideal, we can create \n     a foundation upon which compromise becomes possible. The \n     intensive media coverage extended to the extreme ends of the \n     political spectrum drowns out the rest of the American \n     public; yet listening to the less heard voices of the \n     moderate American people is one of many ways in which we can \n     begin to meet the challenges of compromise.\n       To restore our country to prosperity and success that will \n     extend to all Americans, we must listen to both the minority \n     and majority. We must not allow the media to create \n     entertainment and triviality out of such serious matters of \n     government and politics that affect all of us so greatly. We \n     must overcome our differences and disparities to become a \n     more unified nation truly built upon compromise, and achieve \n     the dreams articulated in the Preamble of our Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Travis Kent Reed, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       In the past our country has been a world leader in freedom \n     and democracy, but this unfortunately is no longer true. When \n     I was little, I remember my father explaining to me that in \n     places like Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany if people were \n     suspected of opposing the government or expressing a \n     divergent viewpoint, they would simply disappear. Today the \n     United States government has made moves toward emulating its \n     past enemies and even such fictional totalitarian states as \n     ``The Party'' from the book 1984, by passing bills that \n     designates the world as a battlefield and allowing the \n     indefinite detention of any person suspected of terrorism, \n     including American citizens, without trial or other \n     Constitutional rights.\n       Recently Occupy Wall Street protestors have been labeled in \n     the same vein as domestic terrorists and the United States \n     military has been mobilized to stop these protestors who are \n     being attacked and brutalized for attempting to carry out \n     their rights to peaceable assembly guaranteed in the Bill of \n     Rights. Just recently a bill was sent to committee to be \n     discussed. Called ``Stop Online Piracy Act'', it was \n     introduced by Representative Lamar Smith of Texas. This bill \n     is one that would seriously engender freedom of speech on the \n     Internet by allowing for copyright holders to take down any \n     website with a copyright claim against it. For sites like \n     YouTube, and Reddit that had previously been protected by the \n     Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1996, this would mean \n     death. What is the terrifying thing about this bill is that \n     it isn't the only one like it. In the Senate there is a bill \n     called Protect IP ACT, introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy \n     which will perform the same function as the SOPA. These bills \n     have been introduced into a nation that has long criticized \n     countries like China for censorship and the suppression of \n     human rights.\n       Our nation has long prided itself on how it treats its \n     citizens and how the rights of the individual are the \n     backbone of our democracy. It seems today our country is \n     going away from this model and the value placed on the \n     citizen is less and less important. While the wars of \n     terrorism are being fought, a greater threat is looming, and \n     the rights of the American people are slipping away, quietly \n     and with deliberate purpose.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Dahlia Somers, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       America has been able to spread her objectives of freedom \n     and democracy throughout the world. Together we have overcome \n     one difficulty after another and now we face a new challenge: \n     to create an even greater and more progressive America. To \n     remain a world leader change is inevitable: otherwise our \n     country will take a back burner to rising super powers. We \n     will always be a great nation, but to remain an important one \n     the\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n     issues of economy, education, healthcare, and environment \n     must be addressed.\n       Currently we are in debt to China for over $15 trillion; \n     this means our population of roughly 311 million citizens has \n     a debt share of around $49 thousand each. East Asian \n     countries and European countries surpass us in education--\n     especially in the academic subjects of math and science. \n     Japan has a universal health care system and an average \n     population life expectancy of 82.25. Germany understands that \n     our environment has a finite supply of resources and imposes \n     an environmental tax on its citizens.\n       Focusing on the economy, we need to generate more jobs and \n     discontinue outsourcing. It is time for heavy regulation, and \n     an end to the laissez-faire relationship with big businesses. \n     This is evident in the Wall Street bailout, the outraged 99 \n     percent, and the unacceptable (though declining) unemployment \n     rate of 8.5 percent. The warfare against the middle classes \n     must be addressed, and the lower classes must be bolstered.\n       Education is success. The focus of education should be \n     aimed at life achievement rather than standardized tests. The \n     problem now is that schools don't have a large enough budget: \n     if teachers had larger salaries more competition would be \n     created and our children would be taught by the best \n     qualified. Parents, when they motivate and assist their \n     children, can become invaluable components in this exciting \n     process.\n       Our healthcare system is a painful topic. America has the \n     most expensive healthcare system without the better results \n     of less expensive European systems. We should follow the \n     European models. Well, at least all children, seniors, and \n     disabled should have assured healthcare. Vermont is an \n     innovator in healthcare, and if we are successful the rest of \n     America might follow our example.\n       The environmental issue is not to be taken lightly. Global \n     warming is real and we perpetuate the harm caused to our \n     planet. It is our responsibility to work with other powerful \n     countries to limit our ecological footprints and conserve the \n     world's natural resources. Steps must be taken not only on a \n     political level but on a cultural one as well. It must become \n     part of our culture to consume less extravagantly and recycle \n     more diligently.\n       To make these ideals a reality our government must find \n     harmony between the Democrats and the Republicans. We need to \n     remember that this is not an issue of which party is most \n     correct, but what can be compromised to create a better \n     America. We still haven't seen all America can be, she is \n     still growing and we, the present and the future, must guide \n     her to the best outcome.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Kidder Spillane, CVU, (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Dear Fellow Americans, I am reporting to you as the New \n     Year is starting I would like to inform the state in which \n     the country is in and in which subjects we are going to push \n     our efforts toward.\n       I believe the most important subject to address first is \n     our problem with oil. We depend a lot on Middle Eastern \n     countries for their foreign oil. The oil is running out and \n     we need to put a lot of our efforts into alternative energy \n     sources including solar, wind and even hydroelectricity. We \n     can't just make this happen overnight it's going to take a \n     lot of time and effort; this can be looked upon as a \n     positive. This brings me to my next subject, if we create \n     more alternative energy productions this will open a lot more \n     opportunities for job creation. In November of 2011 the \n     unemployment rate dropped to 8.4 percent from 9 percent. \n     There are still over 13 million American without a job, and \n     these alternative energy products can reduce that number \n     significantly.\n       The next subject I would like to address is healthcare. \n     Healthcare is a necessity that I feel every American should \n     be able to have with no cost. Healthcare shouldn't be \n     something people have to worry about, our country should \n     provide universal healthcare across the nation it is our \n     right to get the treatment they need to survive.\n       The country is in debt, that's the truth we are in a \n     deficit of $1.48 trillion. This is a cause of overspending by \n     the U.S. simply just raising the taxes for everyone is not \n     the answer. I believe the way people should be taxed is the \n     answer if a wealthier individual has the money to be able to \n     pay more in taxes than he is doing than he should be paying \n     more than somebody who is working a middle class job living \n     in the suburbs. There needs to be a higher minimum tax \n     payment on the less wealthy citizens. Not just a low \n     percentage of somebody's income.\n       I also believe we need to support student loan reforms. In \n     the future almost 60 percent of future jobs will require more \n     than a high school diploma. We want every American to have \n     the opportunity, and the ability to get a college diploma. \n     People shouldn't have to be in so much debt from their loans. \n     We need to help the people that aren't able to pay for \n     college by themselves. The interest rate on student loans \n     will be lowered.\n       Thank you fellow Americans. It is not just congresses job \n     to make this happen we need to unite as a nation everybody \n     needs to be a part of the action of strengthening our nation. \n     This is a tough time right now with the economy it's going to \n     take effort from all Americans.

Madam President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord these essays written by Vermont High School students as part of \nthe Second Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' essay contest \nconducted by my office. The following essays were selected as \n``Honorable Mentions.''\n  The Statements follow.\n\n    Hannah Apfelbaum, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable \n                                Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       America is not living up to its full potential. We have one \n     of the highest child poverty rates in the Western world, a \n     high unemployment rate, and test very low in math and science \n     compared to other developed countries. And that's not all--we \n     also face environmental challenges and the decline of the \n     middle class. We must use our differences to unite us by \n     tackling all aspects of the issues we face. But America is \n     asking how, specifically, do we solve these problems?\n       First, we need to decide what problems not to solve. Iraq \n     and Afghanistan are not in ideal condition. This does not \n     mean, however, that we should be pouring all of our money \n     into military efforts there. Instead, we need to make more \n     money available for the most pressing issues in our own \n     country.\n       One way to make more money available is to stop giving the \n     wealthiest people the biggest tax cuts. It is understandable \n     that politicians are concerned about backlash from these \n     influential citizens, but the majority of people in this \n     country--the middle class--needs to be taken into account. \n     With the national debt becoming greater and greater, these \n     tax cuts simply are not sustainable.\n       So where should our money go? The first priority should be \n     education. Successful experiences in the early years of \n     school make children much less likely to drop out or end up \n     in prison--an entity that tax dollars pay for, with less than \n     stellar results. Investment in public elementary schools \n     benefits both the children and the general public. We also \n     need to spend money on college financial aid programs. The \n     most successful students who cannot pay their own tuition \n     deserve to have this opportunity, and will most likely make a \n     large contribution to society in their adult lives. All \n     contributions to education will help make Americans qualified \n     to obtain jobs that will provide them with comfortable wages, \n     and stimulate the economy.\n       We also need to spend money on healthcare. Every American \n     has the right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness.'' Life, especially, is very hard to maintain \n     without adequate healthcare. The right to be safe is \n     something that needs to be provided\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\n     to all citizens. It is simply not acceptable for a child in \n     need of a treatment such as chemotherapy to not be able to \n     access it. It is time that we live up to this responsibility. \n     And in providing safety, a clean environment is also \n     essential. Clean air helps reduce our risk of cancer, lung \n     disease and numerous other health issues.\n       America--now is the time to make choices for the benefit of \n     our national community. We need to fund education. We need to \n     fund healthcare. We need to take environmental action. It is \n     time for each of us to advocate and actively work for these \n     policies so that America can reach its full potential.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Erin Clauss, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       My fellow Americans, as we move into 2012, there are \n     serious issues that must be resolved. The American middle \n     class is in crisis. Hard-working Americans are losing their \n     jobs, and are unable to care for and provide for their \n     families. This nation is drowning in debt. Americans are \n     unable to pay for basic needs, like healthcare.\n       The Occupy Wall Street movement has brought to all of our \n     attention how important fixing the economy is. As of November \n     2011, 7.6 million Americans have lost their jobs during this \n     recession. The unemployment rate is declining, but there is \n     still much work to be done. These people want to be able to \n     support themselves. They don't want to be living off food \n     stamps and have their homes foreclosed on. They want to work. \n     They want to be able to afford to give their children a \n     college education. The United States has the most expensive \n     college tuition in the world, leaving young adults struggling \n     with debt. They have difficulty paying off that debt when \n     they are unable to find a decent job after graduation.\n       Part of the solution must be to raise taxes on America's \n     wealthiest citizens. This isn't about class warfare. It's \n     about saving the American economy. Those who can afford to \n     pay more have the responsibility to do so. To be able to pay \n     off our debt and bring back the so-called ``American dream,'' \n     we desperately need to raise revenue, and this is the clear \n     solution.\n       Due to this recession, many Americans cannot afford to buy \n     health care. They are uninsured and unprotected. Over 44 \n     million Americans do not have health insurance. This is an \n     outrage. Health care is a basic right that should be \n     guaranteed for everyone. If, in the Declaration of \n     Independence, we, as a nation, claim to guarantee the rights \n     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we must do \n     so. By allowing insurance companies to deny our people \n     adequate medical care, we are taking away their right to \n     life. This must be remedied.\n       What we really need now is compromise. Nothing can or will \n     be achieved if the leaders of our nation, the representatives \n     of the people, refuse to compromise and work together towards \n     the betterment of our country. This crisis is not unsolvable. \n     We have the tools to fix the situation in our nation today, \n     but only if both sides are willing to make concessions to \n     help us move forward into the future as a powerful nation.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Yamuna Dahal, Winooski High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The United States of America is country of opportunity and \n     success.

We \n     got the best entrepreneurs in this country whose continues \n     hard work and confidence made our country the best among the \n     world, we do have some issues that need to be fixed.\n       Our parliament system is based on equality and liberty. Our \n     democratic governmental system enhances the public voice to \n     be heard. Anyone, who is capable and willing of leading this \n     country, could be elected freely regardless of their \n     ethnicity, race or social background.\n       For the last decade, our country is facing many problems. \n     The average income for the American family is falling down. \n     Many of our American families are losing their jobs because \n     companies outsourced their jobs to foreign land. Companies \n     and rich peoples are getting richer whereas the average \n     income families are falling towards the poverty line. There \n     are others concerns like illegal immigration, and increasing \n     crime. There are also issues such as recovery of hurricane \n     Katrina at New Orleans, Oil spill at the Gulf of Mexico and \n     California fire. I could go on and on and never finish \n     mentioning our problems.\n       However, for our generation increasing college tuition is a \n     matter of headache. Our parents' incomes are spent paying \n     their college loans and home mortgages. Today `saving for the \n     children's college' is rarely heard from average income \n     family parents. Today, it's very hard to get accepted for \n     scholarship at colleges and university so the only way to go \n     to college is to `take a loan.' However, in this economy, \n     many of our college graduates are jobless and are under the \n     debt of more than 100K dollars. And the numbers of those \n     college graduates are increasing along with their debts. Many \n     students get frosted about their college loans and choose to \n     go to community college. Universities and research centers \n     are beyond their imagination. It is decreasing our confidence \n     and our hope for the better future. As a young high school \n     student, I myself have to start thinking about college and my \n     future jobs as early as my eighth grade.\n       To prevent ruining our future the government should put a \n     limit for private colleges and universities tuition. There \n     should be more scholarships available for needy students. \n     High school students should get opportunity to take college \n     courses during summer to reduce their semesters when they \n     actually go to college. They should be properly trained about \n     money management and time management. The government should \n     increase and improve community colleges and government state \n     universities and reduce the price. The number of colleges and \n     universities should be increased in the remote site of the \n     country and make it more accessible for everybody.\n                                  ____\n\n\nJulienne DeVita, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Dear Fellow Americans: Today, I stand before this great \n     nation, to speak to the concerned, hardworking Americans, \n     with the intent of bettering the state of this country. I \n     would like to bring to your attention three of the most \n     pressing issues which I feel need to be addressed in 2012 in \n     order for the United States of America to reach it's full \n     potential; the environment, our economy, and college \n     education costs.\n       This past year, after 10 years of war, and frustration, the \n     United States Military Forces found and defeated a key leader \n     of the Al Quaida movement; Osama Bin Laden. This brought \n     relief and feelings of security back to Iraqi and American \n     citizens. We ended a war and are bringing our troops back \n     home. Now however, it is the time for our government to focus \n     on domestic issues, three important things that need to get \n     done in our country.\n       Firstly, fossil Fuels are a finite commodity in our world \n     today, and whose dwindling supply has lead our country to \n     face the unavoidable subject of Global Warming. We need to \n     focus the public's attention not only on the devastating \n     effects of the environment, but ultimately what will happen \n     to human life on this planet. There needs to be more public \n     awareness of the long-term disastrous affects that global \n     warming will inevitably bring to our world. We need to \n     commission scientists to create more practical and affordable \n     solutions to this problem.\n       Another issue that is of paramount importance is the state \n     of our economy. We must invest in America; American jobs, \n     American-made products, and the American people. Companies \n     need to be rooted in this country so that more jobs can be \n     made available to the 8.6 percent of unemployed Americans. \n     Financial incentives must be available for businesses to stay \n     in the U.S. and employ the American workers.\n       America needs to close the vast gap between rich and poor \n     in this country. Actions that progress the wealth down \n     through the middle and lower class are essential. Since 1978, \n     the cost of college tuition has increased more than 900 \n     percent. Costs of a college education have to be more \n     affordable for our young adults who are planning and \n     investing in their futures.\n       As we reach towards these goals, our country's leaders have \n     to come together and put aside their religion, skin color, or \n     the fact that they are a Democrat or Republican in order to \n     address these issues and find solutions. We must put aside \n     our differences and compromise towards the common good. \n     Individually we are not as strong as when we all work \n     together.\n       We are a country rich of talent, knowledge, and resources. \n     By vowing to work together on the issues of the environment, \n     our economy, and college education costs, we will be ensuring \n     a better future for all Americans. Let's make our future one \n     to look forward to.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Alden Fletcher, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Our union is a union of people, a people who recently have \n     been vocal about the state in which they find themselves. \n     From the tea party to Occupy Wall Street, everywhere there is \n     a movement rising up, demanding similar changes to a broken \n     system. The people are hurting, they have lost their jobs, \n     they are dealing with a harsh economic recession and thus far \n     our government has failed them.\n       Our government has proven itself incapable of effectively \n     dealing with the diverse and complicated problems currently \n     threatening this nation. Our legislative body is crippled by \n     partisan gridlock, the executive branch has been lenient in \n     its duty to protect the American people and their rights, \n     and, the power of common citizens in politics is being \n     marginalized in favor of the interests of the wealthy. The \n     need for reform is evident.\n       First the influence of special interests in government must \n     be diminished; legislators should be motivated by a desire to \n     ensure public good, not a job at a lobbying firm. In \n     addition, the effects of Fec v. Citizens United must be \n     reversed, and new restrictions must be established that limit \n     an organization's media power and its access into the \n     political system.\n       Second, we must be certain that the federal government is \n     vigorous in its regulatory capacity. Whistblowers, people who \n     report\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n     nefarious or negligent activity against the public, must be \n     protected to the utmost; further initiatives need to be taken \n     that increase accountability within the government \n     bureaucracy. This will guarantee that the federal government \n     does not abuse its power in the same manner as it has with \n     national security.\n       Our country is a democracy, and it is the citizens' \n     prerogative to keep government in check. However, many states \n     have instituted laws that place unnecessary burdens upon \n     voting rights. In order for a democracy to function it \n     requires popular participation and it should be the \n     imperative of government to encourage all those who are \n     eligible, to vote. Through the means of a constitutional \n     amendment, the federal government must be granted increased \n     jurisdiction over national elections. Thus the government can \n     create standardized voting requirements, implement automatic \n     voter registration and facilitate absentee balloting, all of \n     which are vital steps to giving underrepresented groups, for \n     instance young people, more of a say in the national debate.\n       Finally there must be a new a sentiment of cooperation and \n     compromise in Washington if there is to be progress. A \n     government that continually threatens to shut down due to \n     petty disputes does little to serve the people. Changing the \n     way this nation is governed will allow us to tackle issues \n     from climate change to inequality, from the rising cost of \n     college education to promoting human rights across the globe. \n     However, if no action is taken we can accomplish nothing, and \n     it is our responsibility to be an educated and vigilant \n     electorate, to ensure that this does not happen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Jack Du Pre, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The state of this nation is declining. It has become an age \n     where men and women of higher education status can't find \n     work and an age where the natural order of employment has \n     been shaken by a decline in productivity and availability of \n     jobs. Teens, like me, cannot find work due to the fact that \n     many ``white collar'' workers have no choice but to take jobs \n     that they would normally not consider. At a resort near my \n     school, the common denominator of the wait staff this summer \n     was that most held Masters Degrees and two held PhD level \n     educations. Waiting tables was what they could find for work.\n       From our youngest days in school we are charged to go to \n     college and further our education. We are taught that the \n     American dream is alive, well and available for those \n     diligent and hard working. The present realities make that \n     seem more like a fairy tale and the realities of the current \n     economic situation more of a harsh reality. America is in \n     need of a direct approach to stimulate the economy. The \n     answer is not pouring more money into the economy, but \n     deciding what will be made here and made with precision, \n     passion and pride. The economy is stagnant because of lack of \n     direction and focus.\n       In conclusion, the mending needs to come from three places. \n     It needs to come from a Congress joined by a common \n     interest--America and not divided by partisan rhetoric and a \n     current state of blaming the other side. It needs to come \n     from American corporations who decide to invest in America \n     and in American ingenuity. Lastly, it needs to come from the \n     people who are mired in frustration and apathy. If all three \n     forces face the future and address the issue of what America \n     truly needs, then the country can begin to live as it has in \n     the past, as a beacon for other countries as a place where \n     dreams can come true.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Emma Hamilton, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       At the dawn of 2012, the United States is facing a \n     multitude of pressing issues. Currently, the U.S. poverty \n     rate is 15.1 percent, the highest since 1993; the \n     unemployment rate is 8.6 percent; and an unprecedented string \n     of natural disasters has overcome our country in 2011. \n     Compounding all these problems is our divided Congress, which \n     has proven to be largely ineffective in addressing these \n     daunting issues in a concerted and resolute manner. In this \n     critical time, it is imperative that change comes soon.\n       The root of many of our country's problems originates with \n     our degraded education system. There is a great gap in \n     opportunities for early education, which is in large measure \n     based on income. Studies have proven that a quality early \n     education is essential for a successful future. Re-building \n     and strengthening our early education system must become a \n     top priority if the country wants to see future positive \n     change.\n       When American children are born, they are told that if they \n     follow the rules: go to school, work hard, and attend \n     college, then they will be rewarded with a promising future. \n     Nowadays, graduates fresh out of college find that even \n     though they followed the rules, they struggle to find the \n     promising future that they were led to believe would be \n     there. America needs to find a way to put our educated people \n     back to work with jobs that will build our economy, \n     community, and country.\n       This past year extreme tornadoes ripped through the \n     southeast. Hurricanes and tropical storms flooded communities \n     along the eastern seaboard. Furthermore, the summer of 2011 \n     was the hottest ever in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, \n     causing heat waves and record droughts. This extreme weather \n     has cost our country over $35 billion dollars. Most can agree \n     that the climate is drastically changing at unprecedented \n     rates. The time has come that the human race faces the \n     effects it has on Mother Earth. The United States emits more \n     than 5,425 million tons of carbon dioxide every year, ranking \n     it second highest worldwide. We must join together as a \n     nation to find quick solutions to this ever-growing problem \n     before it is too late.\n       In 2011, Congress proved to be one of the most divided and \n     uncompromising Congresses the American public has ever seen. \n     In a time of crisis, America needs congressional leadership \n     with creative solutions and a willingness to work together to \n     get things done. It is vital that Congress moves forward \n     without partisan bickering and focuses on making positive \n     change.\n       During a time of high unemployment, living with a degrading \n     education system, and increasing environmental catastrophes, \n     our country cannot afford to wait anymore. The time has come \n     for Americans to come together to solve the problems we are \n     facing. Although we are confronted with many issues, there is \n     hope for a brighter future. America has repeatedly shown it \n     is strong and can and will restore itself to become the \n     thriving and great nation it is capable of being.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Zach Holman, Champlain Valley Union High School, (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       I stand before our great nation to address the current \n     state of the nation. 2011 was a struggle for many people, \n     students were ending college carriers thousands of dollars in \n     debt, scraping every last penny to cover medical bills \n     because health insurance is too costly, or many were just not \n     able to find a job whether he or she was an adult or \n     teenager. 2011 is behind us and 2012 is here, things will \n     improve. For this year there are three crucial changes our \n     government must make to make America truly great again and \n     fully prosperous we must get people working, enact a one-\n     payer healthcare system that ensures coverage to all, and a \n     higher education program that makes college affordable for \n     levels of income and status.\n       The past few years have led to the demise of the middle \n     class. This is due to the fact higher paying positions do not \n     exist and no one is hiring. Everyone from the age of 16 to 65 \n     is under pressure to find work and yet most cannot. This \n     year, 2012, it will change. At the end of the 2011 the \n     unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent, an improvement, not \n     a solution. We must make it so those able to and willing to \n     work can. My plan is to start programs that train a work \n     force for different skilled positions that there is a demand \n     for. Then I will make sure that these positions are \n     available. If this means subsidizing certain industries to \n     increase demand and promote hiring, I see that it happens. It \n     is time to get America working again whether you are a \n     teenager or elderly adult jobs will be available.\n       This country has attempted to tackle the healthcare \n     problem, and each time it does not succeed in the way most \n     hope. It is time to throw away the old system and start new; \n     it is a new year and a time for new ideas. The only way to \n     bring quality healthcare to all Americans is through a one-\n     payer system. A system that makes sure no citizen goes \n     uncared for. To make this possible we must de-privatize \n     insurance companies and give coverage to all. Life is not a \n     luxury only people of certain socioeconomic statuses deserve, \n     it is a basic human right and a one-payer system is the only \n     way to make it possible.\n       Education is my last topic for the night. Today only \n     students in dire need of financial aid receive it to attend \n     college. This is not right and does not work. Middle class \n     families barely can afford the outrageous price of tuition \n     for one child let alone two or more. We must enact new forms \n     of aid that make college affordable for all and give everyone \n     an equal opportunity.\n       The country needs help, but with a few small changes \n     success is possible. God bless you and God bless the United \n     States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Katie Leavitt, Woodstock Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Crises encourage friendships. They force people to act as a \n     community and work together, especially when they involve \n     those that they care about. They create situations that bring \n     out the good in people who would otherwise never step up to \n     lend a hand.\n       The town of Woodstock has lived through a crisis this past \n     fall: Hurricane Irene. In the months and weeks afterward, the \n     town saw first hand that people come together and do the \n     right thing when they need to. Community members recognized \n     that friends and relatives who were dear to them were in \n     trouble, so they stepped up to help make a change, because in \n     light of a crisis, they cared. When a tree lay across my road \n     after taking out a power line, everyone in my neighborhood \n     helped those who weren't able to get to their homes by \n     providing them with food, showers, and shelter. My family \n     even created a path through our field to allow people to \n     drive through to the other side. Crises involving family, \n     friends, and neighbors force people into action, and they \n     create a better environment through a sense of urgency and \n     caring.\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\n       A major issue in our country today is the poverty crisis. \n     One cannot enter a city without passing someone with all \n     their belongings in a bag, asking for any money to help \n     alleviate their situation. The majority will walk by and do \n     nothing. The whole country begs for change: an end to \n     poverty, yet they walk right by when a person in need asks \n     for help. The only feeling in walking by is guilt that you \n     have more than they, and can relieve the guilt by handing \n     them a dollar or two. However, this does nothing to solve the \n     problem as a whole; it only gives one temporary peace of \n     mind. They do nothing to truly help because there is no \n     intrinsic pull to help them, just a sudden guilt. They feel \n     no real sense of urgency to do anything, as they have no \n     connection to the person. It is the sense of caring for this \n     person and the urgency to alleviate their situation that they \n     lack.\n       The solution to the crisis of poverty is to replicate this \n     feeling. To find a way to make people truly care about those \n     that they walk by in the street everyday to get to work. \n     Organize committees to issue government grants to motivated \n     groups of people who will find a way to engender the feeling \n     of community in their own hometowns and cities. Grant them \n     the money for them to create ways for the poor and wealthy \n     alike to become friends, and begin to form a community. \n     That's all it takes: when you know someone, and you realize \n     they are having a crisis, you go out of your way to help fix \n     the problem, because that's the way it always works: absolute \n     neediness from people you care about brings everyone \n     together. The wealthier people will begin to look around and \n     realize that their new friends are deep in the middle of a \n     crisis, and they will do something about it. Trust me. I've \n     seen it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Theophila Lee, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       As a nation, the most pressing concern we currently face is \n     our current education system. An issue of vital important to \n     the next generation of this country, and therefore to the \n     nation itself, I am dismayed by the lack of progress our \n     nation seems to be making in this area. Instead of further \n     sensationalizing the statistics of the abysmal standards of \n     U.S. students in comparison with their international cohorts, \n     I have decided instead to give some practical suggestions.\n       The change has to come from all levels--from the students, \n     the teachers, the schools, and the communities. At the basic \n     levels, subjects should be taught in a more integrated way. \n     History, literature, and art should be interwoven and studied \n     together. This ability to reach across traditional \n     disciplines and explore their relationships will develop \n     increasing well-roundedness in student. It will force pupils \n     to make interdisciplinary connections, an educational \n     experience that I believe ultimately makes a better informed, \n     creative, and open-minded student. Collaboration should be \n     encouraged more often. For teachers, teaching skills should \n     be continually sharpened, with time to take courses, attend \n     conferences, and share lessons and tips with other teachers, \n     online and in person. Should school districts want to explore \n     the option of merit pay, they should base it on the above \n     criteria, certainly not test scores of a teacher's students. \n     Additionally, schools (with the assistance of the community \n     at large) should require that students complete various \n     internships with businesses, government agencies, etc. This \n     allows students to explore their passions and expose them to \n     the world of work through school-to-career programs and \n     internships.\n       Finally, I find it appalling that lowering the cost of \n     college tuition while still maintaining the quality of our \n     higher education system is still not a high enough priority.\n       Our higher education system is something America should be \n     proud of; every year, the Ivy League and top liberal arts \n     colleges receive an increasing number of international \n     applicants, all who recognize the superiority of a U.S. \n     education. However, the price tag is an entirely different \n     issue. While it's understandable that cutting costs will \n     inevitably create conflict, couldn't college presidents be \n     held more accountable for the rising costs? This previous \n     semester, a Stanford professor tried an experiment where he \n     opened up his class to anyone online--for free. Expecting to \n     get only 10,000 people, he instead found that by the end of \n     his course, 140,000 pupils from all around the world had \n     enrolled. Perhaps the government should encourage top \n     colleges to explore technology in higher education through \n     government subsidies. More paying students would lead to \n     lower prices. It would also reduce the frenzy of high-school \n     seniors as we find ourselves competing with as many as 10 \n     other students for a place in our top choice college. I \n     believe this would be a win-win situation for both parties \n     involved.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Giovanina Mier, St. Johnsbury Academy (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       In the eternal words of our country's Preamble of the \n     Constitution, it is stated that the purpose of the United \n     States is ``to form a more perfect union, establish justice, \n     insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, \n     promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of \n     liberty for all''. Today, over 224 years later, these words \n     may seem distant and unreachable. However, they still remain \n     the foundation of our government and ideals that we, as the \n     American people, should strive to achieve.\n       In recent years, our government and political systems have \n     become increasingly polarized and radical. While this is not \n     inherently unfortunate, it has led to the inability of groups \n     of differing opinions to compromise. Without compromise, \n     democracy cannot function. In order for the people to \n     exercise their sovereignty in such a way as to spark change \n     and improvement in both our country and the world, we must \n     first be able to express the will of the majority. With two \n     equally unbending political parties pitted against each \n     other, our government has become stagnant. This effects even \n     minor problems, but is especially crucial in the economic \n     recovery that is the desire of every American. With the \n     inability to come to agreements on smaller negotiations, how \n     can we expect to solve the larger problems of our staggering \n     debt, unemployment, and inflation? The economic recession has \n     injured every American, from the college student unable to \n     find a job with a Master's degree in their field to the small \n     business that must close its doors.\n       These problems facing the American people cannot be solved \n     by simply holding fast to one's beliefs. While it is valuable \n     to have those in government that adequately and accurately \n     represent the ideas, morals, and beliefs of the American \n     public, compromise does not mean that one has to entirely \n     renounce everything they hold to be right and true. Instead, \n     compromise asks that we come to a place at which both parties \n     can agree upon one idea or principle. Does that seem so much \n     to ask? Of course, compromise in practice is more difficult \n     than in theory, but by striving for this ideal, we can create \n     a foundation upon which compromise becomes possible. The \n     intensive media coverage extended to the extreme ends of the \n     political spectrum drowns out the rest of the American \n     public; yet listening to the less heard voices of the \n     moderate American people is one of many ways in which we can \n     begin to meet the challenges of compromise.\n       To restore our country to prosperity and success that will \n     extend to all Americans, we must listen to both the minority \n     and majority. We must not allow the media to create \n     entertainment and triviality out of such serious matters of \n     government and politics that affect all of us so greatly. We \n     must overcome our differences and disparities to become a \n     more unified nation truly built upon compromise, and achieve \n     the dreams articulated in the Preamble of our Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Travis Kent Reed, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       In the past our country has been a world leader in freedom \n     and democracy, but this unfortunately is no longer true. When \n     I was little, I remember my father explaining to me that in \n     places like Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany if people were \n     suspected of opposing the government or expressing a \n     divergent viewpoint, they would simply disappear. Today the \n     United States government has made moves toward emulating its \n     past enemies and even such fictional totalitarian states as \n     ``The Party'' from the book 1984, by passing bills that \n     designates the world as a battlefield and allowing the \n     indefinite detention of any person suspected of terrorism, \n     including American citizens, without trial or other \n     Constitutional rights.\n       Recently Occupy Wall Street protestors have been labeled in \n     the same vein as domestic terrorists and the United States \n     military has been mobilized to stop these protestors who are \n     being attacked and brutalized for attempting to carry out \n     their rights to peaceable assembly guaranteed in the Bill of \n     Rights. Just recently a bill was sent to committee to be \n     discussed. Called ``Stop Online Piracy Act'', it was \n     introduced by Representative Lamar Smith of Texas. This bill \n     is one that would seriously engender freedom of speech on the \n     Internet by allowing for copyright holders to take down any \n     website with a copyright claim against it. For sites like \n     YouTube, and Reddit that had previously been protected by the \n     Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1996, this would mean \n     death. What is the terrifying thing about this bill is that \n     it isn't the only one like it. In the Senate there is a bill \n     called Protect IP ACT, introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy \n     which will perform the same function as the SOPA. These bills \n     have been introduced into a nation that has long criticized \n     countries like China for censorship and the suppression of \n     human rights.\n       Our nation has long prided itself on how it treats its \n     citizens and how the rights of the individual are the \n     backbone of our democracy. It seems today our country is \n     going away from this model and the value placed on the \n     citizen is less and less important. While the wars of \n     terrorism are being fought, a greater threat is looming, and \n     the rights of the American people are slipping away, quietly \n     and with deliberate purpose.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Dahlia Somers, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       America has been able to spread her objectives of freedom \n     and democracy throughout the world. Together we have overcome \n     one difficulty after another and now we face a new challenge: \n     to create an even greater and more progressive America. To \n     remain a world leader change is inevitable: otherwise our \n     country will take a back burner to rising super powers. We \n     will always be a great nation, but to remain an important one \n     the\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n     issues of economy, education, healthcare, and environment \n     must be addressed.\n       Currently we are in debt to China for over $15 trillion; \n     this means our population of roughly 311 million citizens has \n     a debt share of around $49 thousand each. East Asian \n     countries and European countries surpass us in education--\n     especially in the academic subjects of math and science. \n     Japan has a universal health care system and an average \n     population life expectancy of 82.25. Germany understands that \n     our environment has a finite supply of resources and imposes \n     an environmental tax on its citizens.\n       Focusing on the economy, we need to generate more jobs and \n     discontinue outsourcing. It is time for heavy regulation, and \n     an end to the laissez-faire relationship with big businesses. \n     This is evident in the Wall Street bailout, the outraged 99 \n     percent, and the unacceptable (though declining) unemployment \n     rate of 8.5 percent. The warfare against the middle classes \n     must be addressed, and the lower classes must be bolstered.\n       Education is success. The focus of education should be \n     aimed at life achievement rather than standardized tests. The \n     problem now is that schools don't have a large enough budget: \n     if teachers had larger salaries more competition would be \n     created and our children would be taught by the best \n     qualified. Parents, when they motivate and assist their \n     children, can become invaluable components in this exciting \n     process.\n       Our healthcare system is a painful topic. America has the \n     most expensive healthcare system without the better results \n     of less expensive European systems. We should follow the \n     European models. Well, at least all children, seniors, and \n     disabled should have assured healthcare. Vermont is an \n     innovator in healthcare, and if we are successful the rest of \n     America might follow our example.\n       The environmental issue is not to be taken lightly. Global \n     warming is real and we perpetuate the harm caused to our \n     planet. It is our responsibility to work with other powerful \n     countries to limit our ecological footprints and conserve the \n     world's natural resources. Steps must be taken not only on a \n     political level but on a cultural one as well. It must become \n     part of our culture to consume less extravagantly and recycle \n     more diligently.\n       To make these ideals a reality our government must find \n     harmony between the Democrats and the Republicans. We need to \n     remember that this is not an issue of which party is most \n     correct, but what can be compromised to create a better \n     America. We still haven't seen all America can be, she is \n     still growing and we, the present and the future, must guide \n     her to the best outcome.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Kidder Spillane, CVU, (Honorable Mention)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Dear Fellow Americans, I am reporting to you as the New \n     Year is starting I would like to inform the state in which \n     the country is in and in which subjects we are going to push \n     our efforts toward.\n       I believe the most important subject to address first is \n     our problem with oil. We depend a lot on Middle Eastern \n     countries for their foreign oil. The oil is running out and \n     we need to put a lot of our efforts into alternative energy \n     sources including solar, wind and even hydroelectricity. We \n     can't just make this happen overnight it's going to take a \n     lot of time and effort; this can be looked upon as a \n     positive. This brings me to my next subject, if we create \n     more alternative energy productions this will open a lot more \n     opportunities for job creation. In November of 2011 the \n     unemployment rate dropped to 8.4 percent from 9 percent. \n     There are still over 13 million American without a job, and \n     these alternative energy products can reduce that number \n     significantly.\n       The next subject I would like to address is healthcare. \n     Healthcare is a necessity that I feel every American should \n     be able to have with no cost. Healthcare shouldn't be \n     something people have to worry about, our country should \n     provide universal healthcare across the nation it is our \n     right to get the treatment they need to survive.\n       The country is in debt, that's the truth we are in a \n     deficit of $1.48 trillion. This is a cause of overspending by \n     the U.S. simply just raising the taxes for everyone is not \n     the answer. I believe the way people should be taxed is the \n     answer if a wealthier individual has the money to be able to \n     pay more in taxes than he is doing than he should be paying \n     more than somebody who is working a middle class job living \n     in the suburbs. There needs to be a higher minimum tax \n     payment on the less wealthy citizens. Not just a low \n     percentage of somebody's income.\n       I also believe we need to support student loan reforms. In \n     the future almost 60 percent of future jobs will require more \n     than a high school diploma. We want every American to have \n     the opportunity, and the ability to get a college diploma. \n     People shouldn't have to be in so much debt from their loans. \n     We need to help the people that aren't able to pay for \n     college by themselves. The interest rate on student loans \n     will be lowered.\n       Thank you fellow Americans. It is not just congresses job \n     to make this happen we need to unite as a nation everybody \n     needs to be a part of the action of strengthening our nation. \n     This is a tough time right now with the economy it's going to \n     take effort from all Americans. Thank you for your time \n     America. God bless you and may god bless the United States of \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S158-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 3800.

A bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline project and \nprovide for environmental protection and government oversight; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation I \nam introducing. I am pleased to introduce this legislation, along with \n43 cosponsors, making that 44 Members of the Senate sponsoring \nlegislation to improve the Keystone XL project.\n  This legislation would approve Keystone XL under article 1, section 8 \nof the Constitution. That provision, the commerce clause, gives \nCongress the authority to regulate commerce with foreign countries, and \nthat is the authority Congress needs to use, just as Congress used that \nauthority in 1973 to approve the Alaskan Pipeline.\n  Moving forward with the Keystone project will create tens of \nthousands of jobs--tens of thousands of jobs at a time when our country \nbadly needs those jobs, at a time when we have more than 13 million \npeople out of work, or 8\\1/2\\ percent unemployment. It will create \nthose jobs without spending one Federal taxpayer dollar. Not one. This \nis private sector investment--more than $7 billion that will help \ngenerate tens of thousands of jobs at a time when our economy badly \nneeds them and when we need to get people back to work.\n  Also, this will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East--\n830,000 barrels a day. The Keystone XL Pipeline will move 830,000 \nbarrels of oil a day from Canada and from States such as my own, the \nState of North Dakota. That is 830,000 barrels of oil a day we don't \nhave to get from the Middle East at a time when we have rising tensions \nin the Middle East, at a time when Iran is threatening to close the \nStrait of Hormuz, at a time when we could see gas prices going to $4, \nmaybe even $5 a gallon.\n  The reality is, even if we don't build the project, the oil will \nstill be produced. The oil in Canada will still be produced. It is just \nthat it would not come to the United States. It will go to China, and \nwe will have worse environmental stewardship, not better. Building the \nproject will actually help us provide better environmental stewardship \nbecause we don't need to haul that oil overseas, around the world. We \nwould not need to continue bringing in oil from the Middle East. That \n830,000 barrels a day will go to our refineries where there are higher \nstandards with better environmental stewardship.\n  President Obama recently turned down this project. He turned down the \nproject because he said he couldn't make a decision in 60 days. He said \nhe couldn't make a decision on the project in 60 days. That was too \nsoon. But the project has been under review for more than 3 years. Let \nme repeat that. This project has been under review by the \nadministration for more than 3 years. The EPA and the State Department \nhave been reviewing the project.\n  In our legislation we simply say this has been under review for more \nthan 3 years, and it is time to make a decision. It is time to move \nforward. Furthermore, for the one portion of the route that was \ncontested, the Nebraska portion, we say: Take as much time as you need \nto reroute in Nebraska--after 3 years--to make sure we provide enough \ntime for the decision.\n  I have a chart here that shows this timeline. Let's take a minute and \ngo through it.\n  The application was originally submitted in September of 2008. \nSeptember of 2008 is when the process started. So as you can see, it \nhas been under review in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.\n  The State Department itself, EPA through the NEPA process and the \nState Department, has responsibility to make a decision on the project \nand, as you can see, on their own timeline they had planned to render a \ndecision before the end of last year. As a matter of fact, I received a \nletter from Secretary of State Clinton indicating they intended to have \na final decision before the end of the year. Yet, when we passed our \nearlier legislation, the President said, Well, we can't make a decision \nin 60 days.\n  Do you mean 3 years and 60 days? How long does it take to study this \nprocess and make a decision--particularly when in the last bill which \nwe passed 89-10 by this body, and now in this legislation again we say, \nas to the only contested portion of the rule where you may want to \nreroute through Nebraska due to the Oglala aquifer, we provide as much \ntime as needed to do the rerouting. But at some point we have got to \nmake a decision to move forward with the project.\n  So maybe you say, Well, okay, it has been studied for 3 years, but \nmore time is needed somehow because it is a unique project. Actually, \nit is not a unique project.\n  Before coming to the Senate last year, I was the Governor of North \nDakota for 10 years. While I was Governor, TransCanada built a very \nsimilar project. The red line here is the Keystone project. It goes \nfrom Calgary down to Patoka, IL, much the same route, bringing oil from \nCanada into our refineries. That was permitted, not in 3 years, that \nwas permitted in 2 years. In 2 years, that was permitted. We have been \nstudying Keystone XL, a sister pipeline--very similar. It goes down to \nCushing into the refineries along the gulf coast. We have been studying \nfor 3 years a very similar project already approved in 2.\n  You may say, Well, I don't know. Still, you only have one kind of \nproject there and maybe there is some new or challenging thing you have \nto take into account. So, yes, we have been studying it for 3 years and \nyou need that kind of time because somehow we are recreating the wheel \nor doing something new and different. Well, that is not quite the case, \neither.\n  Let's go to my third chart. These are the oil and gas pipelines in \nthe United States. All these red lines show oil and gas pipelines \nthroughout our country, already existing, already in place, already \nmoving oil and gas around the country. So now we are going to bring \nanother one through here with all these pipelines, with the latest \ntechnology, the latest safeguards. And you mean to say that, after 3 \nyears, that is not time to figure out whether we can approve another \npipeline when we have hundreds of pipelines all over this country that \npeople count on every day for their supply of oil? For their supply of \ngas? That is the situation.\n  Clearly, we can make this decision. Clearly, after more than 3 years \nof study, it doesn't make sense to not move forward, particularly when \nwe are talking about tens of thousands of jobs that we need. Not only \nwill it not cost our Federal Government revenue, it will generate \nhundreds of millions in revenue back to local, State, and Federal \nGovernment.\n  In addition to creating jobs, it reduces our dependence on Middle \nEast oil. And if we don't do it, the oil goes to China. It is still \nproduced, but it goes to China. So, actually, we have better \nenvironmental stewardship with the project.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last year did a study. In that study, \nthey cited 351 infrastructure projects that are being held up in the \ncountry right now--351 infrastructure projects that are being held up \nin the country right now due to regulations and bureaucratic delays. If \nwe can get those projects going, based on the study the U.S. Chamber \ndid, that would generate almost $1.1 trillion in gross domestic product \nfor our country. It would generate--their estimate--1.9 million jobs,\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\nnot with more government spending, but enabling the private investment \nto go forward by taking the bureaucratic delays out of the way, by \nreducing the regulatory burden, by green-lighting projects like \nKeystone XL, which has been under study for more than 3 years.\n  Back to one of these earlier charts. In my home State of North \nDakota, we now produce more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day. We need \nto put 100,000 barrels a day into this pipeline so we can get it to \nmarket, so we can get it to consumers and companies throughout this \ncountry. That is 100,000 barrels a day right now that we have to move \nthrough other means, such as truck or rail. That is equal to 500 \ntruckloads a day, or 17 million truck miles a year. Think of the toll \non our roads, think of the traffic fatalities that result when that \nproduct should be going through pipeline. And at the same time that we \nhave less traffic safety, tremendous wear and tear on our roads, we \nsuffer a discount. Our companies, our mineral owners, our people suffer \na discount because it is more expensive to transport that product by \nrail and by truck. Those are the realities of getting our economy \ngoing.\n  Again, I go back to the national security concern: 830,000 barrels a \nday that we have got to get from the Middle East.\n  With these kinds of developments, with this kind of infrastructure, \ntogether with Canada and some oil that we get from Mexico, by building \nKeystone XL Pipeline we can produce more than 80 percent of the oil we \nconsume right here in our country. That means we don't have to get it \nfrom the Middle East. And look what is going on in the Middle East. \nLook at Iran, threatening to blockade the Strait of Hormuz. That is a \nfundamental national security issue.\n  Unions across this country have said, Hey, we need these jobs. We \nsupport this project. We want to move forward with this and other \ninfrastructure projects. But it is not just about the jobs and the \neconomy, although that is vitally important to all the people who are \nout of work; it is a vital and national security issue, and it is going \nto continue to be a more important national security issue as we \ncontinue to see gas prices rise and as we continue to see instability \nin the Middle East.\n  Again, back to the environmental issues. This oil will be produced. \nIt is either going to China or it is coming here. If we bring it here, \nwe have better environmental stewardship because it goes in a pipeline \nto refineries that have the lowest emission standards. If we don't, the \npipeline goes to the west coast. They load it on tankers. You have to \nhaul it to places such as China where it is refined in refineries with \nhigher emissions. And then, guess what. We have to ship oil from the \nMiddle East--generating more emissions--to bring to our refineries. \nAgain, it makes no sense. It is time to move forward.\n  There is clear precedence and clear authority. Article 1, section 8 \nof the Constitution gives Congress the constitutional authority to act \nunder the commerce clause. Congress exercised that authority in 1973 \nfor the Alaskan pipeline. It is time for Congress to exercise its \nauthority again for the good of our economy and for the good of our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S166-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S166-S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 356--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF TIBET\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Udall of Colorado) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 356\n\n       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism, and His \n     Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the most revered \n     figure in Tibetan Buddhism;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to enforce policies that infringe on fundamental \n     freedoms of Tibetans, including punitive security measures \n     against monasteries, mass arrests, and restrictions on \n     freedom to practice religion;\n       Whereas both the Dalai Lama and the Kalon Tripa, Dr. \n     Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister democratically elected by \n     the Tibetan exile community, have specifically stated that \n     they do not seek independence for Tibet from China;\n       Whereas, in his inaugural address on August 8, 2011, Kalon \n     Tripa Sangay stated that he will ``continue the Middle-Way \n     policy, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the \n     People's Republic of China'';\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's 2011 Report \n     on Tibet Negotiations, since 2002, nine rounds of talks \n     between the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     envoys of the Dalai Lama ``have not borne concrete results'';\n       Whereas, despite persistent efforts by the Dalai Lama and \n     his representatives, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China and envoys of the Dalai Lama have not held any \n     formal dialogue since January 2010;\n       Whereas, since March 2011, at least 16 Tibetans have set \n     themselves on fire, and at least 12 have died;\n       Whereas the repressive policies of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China have created an environment of \n     despair, hopelessness, and frustration among many Tibetans;\n       Whereas, on November 1, 2011, the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Heiner \n     Bielefeldt, expressed concern over ``restrictive measures'' \n     implemented by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China in Tibetan monasteries, stating that such measures \n     ``not only curtail the right to freedom of religion or \n     belief, but further exacerbate the existing tensions, and are \n     counterproductive'' and affirming that ``the right of members \n     of the monastic community, and the wider community to freely \n     practice their religion, should be fully respected and \n     guaranteed by the Chinese Government'';\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2012, Maria Otero, Under Secretary \n     for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, and United \n     States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, issued a \n     statement expressing concern about ``reports of violence and \n     continuing heightened tensions in Tibetan areas of China, \n     including reports of security forces in Sichuan province \n     opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring \n     others'';\n       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but \n     the July-December 2010 International Religious Freedom Report \n     of the Department of State states that ``the [Chinese] \n     government's repression of religious freedom remained severe \n     in the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas'';\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     announced that he would relinquish his last remaining \n     governmental duties in the Central Tibetan Administration, \n     and would turn over political authority to the leadership \n     democratically elected by Tibetans in exile;\n       Whereas, on March 20, 2011, the Tibetan government in exile \n     conducted competitive democratic elections that were \n     monitored by international observers and deemed free, fair, \n     and consistent with international standards;\n       Whereas nearly 50,000 people in over 30 countries, more \n     than half of all the eligible Tibetan exiles voters, \n     participated in the March 20, 2011 elections;\n       Whereas Dr. Lobsang Sangay was elected Kalon Tripa, or \n     prime minister, of the Central Tibetan Administration after \n     receiving 55 percent of votes in the March 20, 2011, election \n     and was inaugurated on August 8, 2011;\n       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay was selected to study in the \n     United States under the Department of State's Tibetan \n     Scholarship Program, earning a doctorate in law from Harvard \n     University, and served as a Senior Fellow at the East Asian \n     Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School;\n       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay, while at Harvard University, \n     promoted dialogue among Tibetan exiles and Chinese students \n     and visiting Chinese scholars to enhance mutual understanding \n     and advance the prospects for reconciliation; and\n       Whereas it is the objective of the United States \n     Government, consistent across administrations of different \n     political parties and as articulated in the Tibetan Policy \n     Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public Law 107-228;

and\n       (B) urges that the agreement to permit China to open \n     further diplomatic missions in the United States should be \n     contingent upon the establishment of a United States \n     Government consulate in Lhasa, Tibet.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Lieberman, \nRubio, Boxer, Durbin, McCain, Webb, and Mark Udall to submit a \nresolution expressing our deep concern about the current situation in \nTibet and our steadfast support for the Tibetan people.\n  Once again, we have seen how harsh and counterproductive Chinese \npolicies have heightened tensions and led to deadly violence.\n  According to press reports and the International Campaign for Tibet, \nsince the beginning of the Chinese New Year on Monday, security forces \nin Sichuan province have opened fire three times on Tibetans who \ngathered peacefully to protest Chinese policies on Tibet.\n  At least six Tibetans have been killed and many more wounded.\n  These attacks come on top of a recent spate of self-immolations \nmostly by Tibetan monks and nuns.\n  Since March 2011, at least 16 Tibetans, including four this month \nalone, have set themselves on fire and at least 12 have died.\n  I know I join my colleagues in mourning these tragic deaths and the \ndeath of Tibetans in this latest round of unrest.\n  In addition, I call on Chinese security forces to exercise maximum \nrestraint and stop targeting Tibetan protesters.\n  Violence is not the answer to the legitimate grievances of the \nTibetan people.\n  We must raise our voice with this resolution to call on Beijing to \nrespect the right of Tibetans to practice their own religion freely and \npreserve their distinct cultural and linguistic identity.\n  This resolution mourns the death of Tibetans who have self-immolated \nand deplores the repressive policies targeting Tibetans; calls on the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China to suspend implementation \nof religious control regulations, reassess religious and security \npolicies implemented since 2008 in Tibet, and resume a dialogue with \nTibetan Buddhist leaders, including the Dalai Lama or his \nrepresentatives, to resolve underlying grievances; calls on the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China to release all persons \nthat have been arbitrarily detained; to cease the intimidation, \nharassment and detention of peaceful protestors; and to allow \nunrestricted access to journalists, foreign diplomats, and \ninternational organizations to Tibet.\n  The resolution commends His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his decision \nto devolve his political power in favor of a democratic system; \ncongratulates Tibetans living in exile for holding, on March 20, 2011, \na competitive, multi-candidate election that was free, fair, and met \ninternational electoral standards; and reaffirms the unwavering \nfriendship between the people of the United States and the people of \nTibet.\n  Over the past several years I have been following the situation in \nTibet with increasing concern.\n  I became involved in this issue when I first met His Holiness the \nDalai Lama during a trip to India and Nepal in the fall of 1978.\n  At that time, as Mayor, I invited His Holiness to visit San Francisco \nand he accepted.\n  In September 1979, I was delighted to welcome the Dalai Lama to San \nFrancisco to receive his first public recognition in the United States.\n  He inspired me to act and I have had the privilege to call him a \nfriend for over 30 years.\n  Over this time, I have come to the view that Chinese policies on \nTibet are intended to suppress the Tibetan culture and people.\n  These policies include punitive security measures including \npermanently placing Chinese officials in monasteries; surveillance, \nmass arrests, and detentions; and restrictions on freedom to practice \nreligion including requiring monks to denounce the Dalai Lama.\n  We have seen how these policies have created an atmosphere of \ndespair, hopelessness, and frustration among many Tibetans.\n  Despite nine rounds of talks between the United Front Work Department \nof the Communist Party of China and envoys of His Holiness, a \ncomprehensive solution to the Tibetan issue remains out of reach.\n  As a friend of China and the Dalia Lama, I am saddened to see the \nsituation in Tibet deteriorate to this point.\n  The Dalai Lama has been trying to engage the Chinese leadership for \nover fifty years.\n  In the 1990s, I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from \nthe Dalai Lama requesting a face to face meeting.\n  In my view, the Dalai Lama's concerns are driven by a strong Tibetan \nbelief and experience that the Chinese Government continues to suppress \nthe Tibetan culture and way of life.\n  As my colleagues know, the Dalai Lama has made it clear that he does \nnot support independence for Tibet, but rather meaningful cultural and \nreligious autonomy for the Tibetan people within the People's Republic \nof China.\n  Most recently, in his March 2011 statement marking the 52nd \nanniversary of the peaceful Tibetan uprising he stated:\n\n       In our efforts to solve the issue of Tibet, we have \n     consistently pursued the mutually beneficial Middle-Way \n     Approach, which seeks genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people \n     within the [People's Republic of China].\n\n  The newly elected prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, \nDr. Lobsang Sangay, has affirmed this policy in his inaugural address:\n\n       Guided by the wisdom of our forefathers and foremothers, we \n     will continue the Middle-Way policy, which seeks genuine \n     autonomy for Tibet within the People's Republic of China.\n\n  Despite these repeated and unequivocal statements, Beijing continues \nto insist that His Holiness seeks independence for Tibet.\n  I am stunned that this message has fallen on deaf ears.\n  Let there be no doubt: the clear goal of His Holiness and the Tibetan \npeople is autonomy within China.\n  This autonomy can only come about through meaningful dialogue and \nnegotiation, not actions that would undermine Tibetan culture.\n  As such, I urge the administration to work with our friends and \nallies in the international community and call on the Chinese \nGovernment to begin a substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on \nnational reconciliation, respect for the Tibetan culture, and \nmeaningful autonomy for Tibet.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the Tibetan people and support \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S167-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S167-S168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 357--COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \nBATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BATTLE TO THE CIVIL \n                                  WAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Paul) submitted the following \nresolution;

Bush honored \n     Vaclav Havel with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the \n     highest civilian award of the United States Government, for \n     being ``one of liberty's great heroes'';\n       Whereas, after leaving office as president of the Czech \n     Republic in February 2003, Vaclav Havel remained a voice on \n     behalf of democratic dissidents worldwide and against \n     authoritarian regimes, including Belarus, Iran, Cuba, and \n     Burma:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Vaclav Havel and offers its \n     heartfelt condolences to the Havel family and the people of \n     the Czech Republic;\n       (2) recognizes Vaclav Havel's courage and commitment to \n     democratic values in the face of communist repression;\n       (3) recognizes Vaclav Havel's pivotal historical legacy in \n     defeating the ideology of communism, peacefully ending the \n     Cold War, and building a Europe that is democratic, united, \n     and at peace;\n       (4) recognizes Vaclav Havel's solidarity with democratic \n     dissidents throughout the world and support for the expansion \n     of freedom, including in Belarus, Iran, Cuba, and Burma; and\n       (5) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     causes of freedom, democracy, and human rights for which \n     Vaclav Havel stood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/30/senate-section/article/S168-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S168-S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1470.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tunnel Prevention Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the international border between the United States \n     and Mexico becomes more secure, trafficking and smuggling \n     organizations intensify their efforts to enter the United \n     States by increasing the number of tunnels and other \n     subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.\n       (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport \n     narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be \n     used to transport people and other contraband.\n       (3) Between May 1990 and May 2011, law enforcement \n     authorities discovered 137 tunnels, 125 of which have been \n     discovered since September 2001. While law enforcement \n     authorities discovered only 2 tunnels in California between \n     1990 and 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in the \n     number of border tunnels discovered in California since 2001.\n       (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new \n     section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), \n     which--\n       (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of an \n     unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an \n     international border into the United States; and\n       (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting others \n     to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean \n     passage on the person's land.\n       (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean \n     passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or \n     illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the \n     underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would \n     further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial \n     options.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) National security zone.--The term ``national security \n     zone'' means any Southwest Border land designated by the \n     Secretary as being at a high risk for border tunnel activity, \n     as authorized under section 8(b).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security.\n       (3) Southwest border land.--The term ``Southwest Border \n     land'' means all parcels of real property in the United \n     States that--\n       (A) are located within 1 mile of the international border \n     between the United States and Mexico; and\n       (B) are not owned by a Federal, State, tribal, or local \n     government entity.\n\n     SEC. 4. ATTEMPT OR CONSPIRACY TO USE, CONSTRUCT, OR FINANCE A \n                   BORDER TUNNEL.\n\n       Section 555 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any \n     offense under this section shall be subject to the same \n     penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission \n     of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION FOR INTERCEPTION OF WIRE, ORAL, OR \n                   ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       Section 2516(1)(c) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``, section 555 (relating to \n     construction or use of international border tunnels)'' before \n     the semicolon at the end.\n\n     SEC. 6. FORFEITURE.\n\n       (a) Criminal Forfeiture.--Section 982(a)(2)(B) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting ``555,'' after \n     ``545,''.\n       (b) Civil Asset Forfeiture.--Any merchandise introduced \n     into the United States\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n     through a tunnel or passage described in section 555(a) of \n     title 18, United States Code, shall be subject to seizure and \n     forfeiture in accordance with section 596(c) of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1595a(c)).\n\n     SEC. 7.

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Notification to Land Owners.--The Secretary is \n     encouraged to annually provide each known nongovernmental \n     owner and tenant of land located in a national security zone \n     with a written notification that describes--\n       (1) Federal laws related to the construction of illegal \n     border tunnels; and\n       (2) the procedures for reporting violations of such laws to \n     U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n       (b) Designation of Border Tunnel High Risk Areas.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may designate any Southwest \n     Border land that the Secretary has a substantial reason to \n     believe is at a high risk for border tunnel activity as a \n     national security zone.\n       (2) Publication.--The Secretary shall--\n       (A) publish any designations made under paragraph (1) in \n     the Federal Register; and\n       (B) allow appropriate notice and comment in accordance with \n     the chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Administrative Procedures Act'').\n       (c) Rulemaking.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 9.
