Madam President, later today the Senate will take up \nS.J. Res. 6, Senator Hutchison's resolution of disapproval of the FCC's \nnet neutrality regulations. I would like to start by thanking Senator \nHutchison for her leadership on this important issue.\n  While we all understand the importance of an open Internet, I think \nwe can also agree that the growth of the Internet in the last 15 years \nis an American success story that occurred absent any--any--heavyhanded \nregulation here in Washington. We should think long and hard before we \nallow unelected bureaucrats to tinker with it now.\n  Everywhere I go in Kentucky, I hear from businesses large and small \nthat they are struggling to comply with the mountains of rules and \nregulations coming out of Washington. At a time when the private sector \nwould like to create jobs and grow the economy, it\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\nseems as if too many here in Washington want to create regulations and \ngrow government. So, like many Americans, I was heartened 2 months ago \nwhen the President came to the Capitol and laid out a very specific \ntest for judging the merits of Federal regulation. Like most of my \ncolleagues, I applauded when the President told us that ``we should \nhave no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the \nAmerican people require. Every rule should meet that common-sense \ntest.''\n  As it turns out, the FCC didn't get the memo. The net neutrality \nregulations we are debating today clearly fail that commonsense test. \nThey are a solution in search of a problem. It is an overreaching \nattempt to fix the Internet when the Internet is not broken. According \nto the FCC's own data, 93 percent of broadband subscribers are happy \nwith their service. If Americans weren't happy with their provider or \nfelt the provider was favoring some form of content over others, they \ncould switch providers. But now the FCC says its regulations are \nnecessary because of what might happen in the future--what might happen \nin the future--if broadband providers have incentives to favor one type \nof content over another, despite the fact that after 15 years, there is \nno evidence of this occurring in any significant way. If Internet \nproviders were so interested in doing this, wouldn't they have done it \nby now? Instead, the FCC has exceeded its authority to grow the reach \nof government under the guise of fixing a problem that doesn't even \nexist.\n  So why should this matter to anyone? Simply, the growth of the \nInternet is one of the great success stories of our lifetime. Just 15 \nyears ago, the thought that you could read a book, watch a ball game, \nand video conference with your kids all on a device the size of a \nmagazine would have been something from science fiction. Today, it is \nreality. The Internet has transformed society precisely because people \nhave been able to create and innovate largely free from government \nintrusion.\n  Businesses are free to invest and grow on the Internet, safe in the \nknowledge that consumers and technology will determine their fate, not \nthe whims of Washington regulators. This investment in broadband \ninfrastructure is the cornerstone of our high-tech economy, which \nemploys nearly 3.5 million Americans. But the FCC's regulations could \njeopardize its future growth by dictating what sort of return \nbusinesses can earn on their investment. As my colleague Senator \nHutchison and I recently noted, ``Lower returns mean less investment, \nwhich in turn means fewer jobs.'' Some estimates suggest we could lose \n300,000 jobs as a result of these rules.\n\n  Thankfully, it is not too late to act. A bipartisan majority in the \nHouse voted to overturn these rules earlier this year. The Senate \nshould take the opportunity to do the same. In order to protect the \ngrowth of the Internet and its ability to create the jobs of the \nfuture, I would encourage my colleagues to support the Hutchison \nresolution.\n\n\n                        Bipartisan Jobs Creation\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak now on another issue.\n  When something good happens here in the Senate, I think it is \nimportant that we all acknowledge it. So I would like to start this \nmorning by thanking our friends on the other side for finally agreeing \nto join us in making some progress on the nearly two dozen bipartisan \njobs bills the House has already passed, and I want to urge them to \nkeep at it, to keep pressing ahead with jobs bills both parties will \nactually support. That way, we will show the American people we are \ncapable of accomplishing something together up here when it comes to \njobs.\n  For months, House Republicans have been executing on a plan to \nidentify ideas which would not only help spur private sector job \ncreation but which would also attract strong bipartisan support. For \nweeks, I have been urging the Democratic majority in the Senate to take \nup these bills so they can become law.\n  This week, Senate Democrats finally agreed to move ahead with two of \nthese bipartisan proposals--a repeal of the 3-percent withholding rule \nthat would ease the burden on government contractors and a veterans \nbill which not only helps returning service men and women find jobs but \nwhich also helps those who hire them. Neither of these bills is going \nto solve the jobs crisis, but they will help a lot of Americans who \ndeserve it, and they will go a long way in showing the American people \nthere is plenty we can agree on up here.\n  My suggestion now is that we don't stop there. Let's just keep it up. \nLet's take up and pass the rest of the bipartisan jobs bills House \nRepublicans have already passed with bipartisan support right across \nthe dome. I have highlighted one of those bills already this week, one \nthat makes it easier for businesses to raise the capital they need to \nexpand and create jobs. This morning, I would like to highlight \nanother--the Shareholder Registration Thresholds Act, H.R. 1965. This \nis a bill that increases the number of shareholders who are allowed to \ninvest in a community bank before that bank is required to shoulder \ncostly new burdens from the SEC.\n  For 3 years now we have been talking about the urgent need for \ngrowing businesses to have access to capital so they can expand and \nhire. Yet, because of an outdated law, the smaller community banks that \nwant to make loans to help these growing businesses are subject to \nburdensome regulations that shouldn't even apply to them. H.R. 1965 \nwill increase the threshold of shareholders that triggers the \nrequirement from 500 to 2,000. A companion bill in the Senate that \nwould do the same thing is cosponsored on the Republican side by \nSenator Hutchison, among others, and on the Democratic side by Senator \nPryor, among others. And Senator Toomey has a bill--S. 1825--to expand \nthis legislation by applying it to businesses other than banks.\n  Now, we should take up these bills in the Senate and pass them as \nsoon as possible with the same show of bipartisan support the two \nparties mustered on behalf of H.R. 1965 last week. Just like the \nbipartisan House-passed jobs bill I highlighted yesterday, H.R. 1965 \npassed the House last week with nearly unanimous support. The vote was \n420 to 2, with 184 Democrats voting in support. Only 2 people out of \nthe entire 435-Member House voted against the bill.\n  The President's jobs council has endorsed the idea, and top Democrats \nhave been vocal proponents of this legislation proposed by House \nRepublicans.\n  Here is House minority leader Congressman Hoyer on H.R. 1965 just \nlast week:\n\n       We need to see lending to small businesses and homeowners, \n     but they're hamstrung in their attempt to raise capital by \n     outdated SEC registration requirements.\n\n  I completely agree with Steny Hoyer.\n  Here is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee:\n\n       Small businesses need access to loans and other lines of \n     credit in order to build their businesses and to create jobs. \n     Before us is a measure that would allow small businesses to \n     get the support they need.\n\n  I completely agree with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Look, it is \nnot every day that Congresswoman Jackson Lee and I agree on \nlegislation. So I think we should lock this down. Let's pocket another \nbipartisan accomplishment right here and help the job creators who need \nit.\n  This is precisely the kind of approach we should be taking here in \nthe Senate--putting aside these giant partisan bills that Democrats \nknow Republicans won't support and focusing on smaller proposals that \ncan actually garner support from nearly everyone and make it onto the \nPresident's for a signature.\n  These are small steps but they are progress. Let's keep at it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7230-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Recently, the Des Moines Register reported that an Iowa-\nbased insurance company has decided to exit the health insurance \nmarket, abandoning insurance sales directly to individuals and \nfamilies. So what is the net effect of all of that? Thirty-five \nthousand policyholders will lose their insurance. It calls to mind the \nfamous promise by the President: If you like your plan, you can keep \nit.\n  The story doesn't stop there. It has an even more profound impact on \nthe lives of real people. The impact goes on. One hundred ten employees \nwill lose their jobs. Seventy of those employees are in Nebraska. That \ncalls to mind Speaker Pelosi's broken promise: The law will create 4 \nmillion jobs--400,000 jobs almost immediately.\n  The driving factor for all of this is a Health and Human Services \nregulation required by the health care law which micromanages how \ninsurance companies can spend their revenues.\n  Unfortunately, this job loss in Nebraska is not an anomaly. A recent \nsurvey of nearly 2,400 independent health insurance agents and brokers \nfrom all over came to this conclusion. One month after this HHS \nregulation took effect, more than 70 percent had experienced a decline \nin their revenues. And, more shocking, nearly 5 percent had lost their \njobs.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported that most of the \ninsurers they interviewed were reducing individuals' commissions. These \nare not the big insurance companies that were railed against in the \nhealth care debate. These are not the big insurance companies that are \nbeing squeezed. The good folks who are being squeezed are the mom-and-\npop agencies that we find on Main Street throughout the United States. \nYes, these are the folks we go to to support the local football team, \nthe local high school, the local 4-H club, whatever the civic cause may \nbe. And yet, with unemployment hovering around 9 percent, the health \ncare law puts the hammer on these people. I reached the conclusion long \nago that the health care law is bad for job creation and it is bad for \nkeeping your job.\n  The Des Moines-based insurance company's CEO's job loss, according to \nhim, was:\n\n       A fairly predictable consequence of the regulation.\n\n  UBS Investment Research called the health care law:\n\n       The biggest impediment to hiring . . . which has the added \n     drawback of straining State and Federal budgets.\n\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses said:\n\n       Small business owners everywhere are rightfully concerned \n     that the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and \n     new taxes in the health care law will devastate their \n     businesses and their ability to create jobs.\n\n  What we are seeing with this law is a massive amount of \noverregulation. According to a recent Wells Fargo-Gallup small business \npoll, government regulations are the most important problem facing our \nsmall business owners. If we just focus again on the health care law, \nthat legislation alone has resulted in 10,000 pages of new Federal \nregulations and notices--10,000 pages. How could any small business \ncomply?\n  The employer mandate penalizes employers for growing. It is as simple \nas that. It forces employers who do not provide acceptable coverage to \npay a penalty of $2,000 per full-time employee. But, you see, the \npenalty is applied to firms with more than 50 employees. And as a small \nbusiness owner in the Bellevue, NE, area recently explained to me:\n\n       I'm not growing my business over 50 employees. I don't want \n     to deal with your health care law.\n\n  Well, as I mentioned, this discussion starts, at least today, with \nthat article in the Des Moines Register.\n  With me today is the very respected Senator from the State of Iowa, \nSenator Grassley. I would ask Senator Grassley, what impact does he see \narising out of this health care law in his State and, even more \nbroadly, across this country?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Johanns for his leadership in this \narea. He has spoken on regulations quite regularly on the Senate floor \nand also in our caucus, and I thank the Senator for his leadership in \nthat area.\n  No. 1, I would say there is a certain irony between a President who \nis going around the country now and talking about, We have got to pass \nlegislation to create jobs, at the very same time as the Senator \ndemonstrated in his remarks that there is a health care bill law being \ninstituted that is making people unemployed.\n  There is also a certain irony in what the President does and the \nSecretary of HHS does with what Speaker Pelosi said at the time the \nbill was up: You know, we have got to pass this bill to see what this \nbill does. Well, now we are finding out what it does, and people don't \nlike what it does.\n  You spoke about regulations causing unemployment, and you spoke about \n10,000 pages of regulations. That is probably 10,000 pages of \nregulations out of the 66,000 pages of regulation that we have had this \nyear, and 10,000 of that deals with health care. But think about the \nother 57,000 pages that deal with other pieces of legislation that are \na problem for small businesses--particularly small businesses. I guess \nit is a problem for all business, but particularly for small business. \nAnd so far, a few regulations have been issued adding up to that 10,000 \npages.\n  People can read this 2,700-page bill and understand what is in it, \nand most of them read it and understood what was in it before Speaker \nPelosi said, ``We have got to pass it to find out what is in it,'' and \ndidn't like what was in it. But in this bill, there are 1,693 \ndelegations of authority to write regulations. So if you have 10,000 \npages so far based upon the new regulations that have been written, \njust think what it is going to be like when all of the pages are \nprinted for the 1,693 regulations. So I think we are at the tip of the \niceberg so far in this legislation, and the damage that is done to \nemployment and lack of job creation has just started. That is my \ncomment on that.\n  I have some remarks I wish to make, if it is okay with the Senator; \nand if he has to go to a committee meeting, I understand.\n  This is not the first time this situation has happened in Iowa, and \nit is coming at a time when people need stability. American families \nare struggling to put food on their table, pay their utility bills as \nwinter arrives, and purchase health insurance as costs are \nskyrocketing.\n  In other words, the President has promised: Pass this legislation and \nit is going to keep health care premiums down, but that is misleading \npeople, and at a time when, as Senator Johanns said, another promise \nmade was: If you like what you have, you are going to be able to keep \nit.\n  Well, I don't know exactly the figure--I have got it here coming up. \nThere is a figure of several thousand people in our State who aren't \ngoing to be able to keep the health insurance they like and they \nalready have because of this company closing down individual policies.\n  Unemployment continues to hover around 9 percent and 1 million \nAmericans are underemployed, and here we have a health care bill that \nis causing more people to be unemployed, as well as not keeping the \nhealth insurance they want. With the economic situation our country is \nfacing, Congress must reexamine its actions and realize the errors that \nwere made because of partisan votes. This bill was an entirely partisan \npiece of legislation, unlike most social contracts in America that have \nbeen passed, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, civil \nrights legislation. Those were bipartisan pieces of legislation because \nit was felt that when you are making this difference in America, you \nought to have a broad consensus that major changes such as this ought \nto be made. But in this particular case, it was very partisan.\n  I want to go over to what Senator Johanns said about the Des Moines \nRegister article. The American Enterprise Group, an insurance company \nparticipating in individual health insurance markets in Iowa and \nNebraska, is leaving the market. This action\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nshows the importance of repealing and replacing the health care \noverhaul passed by Democrats in Congress and signed by the President \nlast year before the situation deteriorates even further. Just think \nwhat it is going to be like when we get the rest of these 1,693 \ndelegations of authority to the bureaucracy to write regulations.\n  American Enterprise notified 110 employees in Iowa and Nebraska that \nthey will lose their jobs sometime during the next 3 years. American \nEnterprise is leaving the individual health insurance market as a \nresult of the instability caused by the implementation of this health \ncare reform bill. American Enterprise stated it will no longer sell \nindividual health insurance policies because of the regulatory \nenvironment created by the health care reform bill.\n  This isn't an isolated incident for Iowa, this one company, because \nthe Principal Financial Group left the small group insurance market in \n2010, and Principal Financial isn't a small Main Street operation. It \nis one of the major financial groups in the United States, but still, \nthey could not find it to be competitive to stay in the individual \nmarket.\n\n  This has cost many Iowans their jobs, while leaving scores of small \nbusinesses and their employees to choose from health insurance plans in \na health insurance market where there is less and less competition. The \nregulatory culprit in this incident is a medical loss ratio regulation \nof this legislation. This regulation requires insurers to pay a certain \npercentage of premiums in claims.\n  I know supporters will defend the regulation as ``keeping insurers in \ncheck.'' But the real world effect is to force insurers to leave the \nmarket, thereby reducing competition and choice available to \nconsumers--not exactly what the President promised, that we are going \nto have competition, keep price down, and people are going to have \nchoice, they are going to be able to keep what they want if they have \nit. But in this case, for these people, that isn't a promise kept. That \nturns out to be a falsehood.\n  The small group and individual markets happen to be very vulnerable. \nThat is the problem. Insurers risk and set their premiums accordingly. \nInsurers are making a rational decision to get out of the market \nbecause the risks have become too great. Competition is reduced. Costs \nrise.\n  Once upon a time, the President promised Americans that if they liked \nthe insurance program they have, they can keep it. This is more \nevidence that that promise rings hollow.\n  This recent planned pullout will leave 35,000 individuals without \ninsurance plans that they have grown accustomed to. Forcing people to \nchoose a different insurance option can lead to higher costs and may \nlimit the health care accessibility these individuals have depended on \nfor years. This is especially detrimental when these individuals have \npreexisting conditions or acute chronic disease. The President \nspecifically promised that if these people want to keep their health \ncare coverage, they would be able to do it with the passage of that \nlaw. This is just one of the many examples of how this overhaul has led \nto broken promises made by the President when pushing through the \npassage of this legislation in a partisan way.\n  These problems will certainly continue as more regulations are \nwritten. The Congressional Budget Office expects people in the \nindividual market to see an average of a 10-percent to 13-percent rise \nin premium costs solely based on the passage of the health care law. \nDoes that increase accessibility or affordability? No, of course it \ndoesn't.\n  Not only has the health care overhaul caused health insurance \ncompanies to leave parts of the health insurance market and health \ninsurance costs to increase, it has also put added burden on employers. \nSome employers will no longer offer their employees health care \ncoverage. Higher taxes and mandates put on employers by the new health \ncare law have left many employers without resources to maintain current \ncoverage for family members of their employees. The negative impact \nthis legislation is having on large employers and those insured by \nemployers was demonstrated by the National Business Group on Health. In \nits recent annual survey, overall planned costs for larger employers \nare expected to rise by 6 percent in 2012. The National Business Group \non Health also notes that 7 out of 10 employers will lose their \ngrandfather status, meaning employees will lose their current health \ncare plans and employers will be subject to additional regulations.\n\n  According to the same survey, 3 out of 10 employers are unsure if \nthey will continue to insure employees due to the health care overhaul. \nOther employers will increase the employee share of the insurance \npremium, and many employers state they will likely lower the level of \nhealth care coverage offered to their employees. Walmart, as an \nexample, will not allow many of its new part-time employees to receive \nhealth care insurance through the company. Many of these workers are \nunderemployed. They work hard yet do not always have adequate resources \nto purchase health care insurance on their own, especially as costs in \nthe insurance markets continue to increase due to the new law.\n  Additionally, many businesses are simply dropping coverage for their \nown employees because of the extra costs incurred in the legislation. \nIt is more affordable for some employers to drop coverage for their \nemployees and pay the fine associated with the employer mandate. An \nemployer must provide health insurance for their employees if they have \nmore than 50 employees or 50 full-time equivalents. Employers who are \nrequired to insure employees will be fined $2,000 per employee who \nseeks health insurance through one of the exchanges created under the \nhealth care overhaul, and any employer-sponsored plan must meet the \ndefinitions of HHS on what an adequate plan is under the mandate.\n  This requirement will increase insurance costs for employers and \nemployees when they must upgrade health insurance benefits in order to \nmeet the standards defined by HHS. Forcing employers to provide health \ninsurance when they have a tough time hiring new employees just adds to \nthe burden employers are facing in this struggling economy. Employers \nwill likely pay their increased health insurance costs by reducing \nemployee take-home pay or by increasing the employee share of health \ninsurance premiums. Also, employers will continue struggling in future \nyears as the Federal Government increases year by year the requirements \nof health insurance benefits needed to avoid a penalty.\n  Furthermore, employers already faced with economic uncertainty have \nto deal with the government regulations that continue to change, adding \nto uncertainty. An HHS rule released last November allows fully insured \ngroup plans to switch insurance providers as long as the insurance \nbenefit provided to the beneficiaries remains comparable. However, this \nis only for group plans that switched after November 15 last year.\n  HHS wrote this new rule so more group plans can find affordable \ncoverage and shop around for similar coverage at cheaper rates. But if \nthe group insurance plan carrier was changed before November 15, the \nplan would lose grandfather status and then be subject to a whole bunch \nof new regulations. Ironically, what created the need for this new rule \nwas another rule the President's administration and HHS crafted in June \nlast year that stated plans would lose their grandfather status if they \nswitched carriers. This chaotic situation shows what happens when the \ngovernment is given more authority to regulate the health insurance \nmarket.\n  What we have is a mess. We need to put a halt to the implementation. \nWe need to repeal the law and start over again with commonsense \nsolutions. We need to move away from the regulatory and bureaucratic \nnightmare that is costing Americans their coverage and too many \nAmericans their jobs.\n  With 10,000 pages of regulations at this point, just think what it \nwill be like when all 1,693 regulations get written.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for this \nexplanation of what this law is doing and the impact it is having. \nToday, of course, we are starting our discussion with the article from \nthe Des Moines Register which talked about the regulatory impact. But \nwe cannot forget there are other pieces to this law that\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\nhave just as severe an impact. I would like to spend a minute or two \ntalking about the destructive taxes that are in this legislation.\n  When we add it all up, the new health care law basically requires new \ntaxes of about $\\1/2\\ trillion--not to pay down the national debt, not \nto solve the Nation's debt woes but to create a new entitlement. The \nTreasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration has \nlooked at the impact of the health care law on the Tax Code and said \nthis: ``The law is the largest set of tax law changes in 20 years.''\n  That is no small undertaking when we think about all that has \nhappened over the last couple of decades, that we ended up with an \nimpact on the Tax Code that is the largest set of tax law changes in 20 \nyears, according to the Treasury expert who looked at this. There are \n42 separate provisions adding to or amending the Internal Revenue Code \nin the health care law. So much of this law was put together in the \nlast days of this debate, people were scrambling around trying to read \nit and understand it and get information out to their constituents.\n  Speaker Pelosi said: We will probably have to pass this law to figure \nout what is in it. And we are now figuring out what is in it, and it is \nso much more than a health care law. There are 42 separate provisions \nthat add to or amend the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The Boston Globe weighed in on this. They pointed out the 2.3-percent \nexcise tax on medical device suppliers, according to the Globe, ``will \nforce industry leaders to lay off workers and curb the research and \ndevelopment of new medical tools.'' There is no question about it. When \nwe add up the tax law changes, the impact from a regulatory standpoint \nand the other provisions of this law, this is not going to result in \nthe promised jobs that Speaker Pelosi spoke of. It is a job killer.\n  If we look at what this law is doing, it will actually shrink the \nlabor force, actually create a disincentive to work or to receive a pay \nraise. I referenced earlier in my comments a small business owner in \nthe Bellevue, NE, area. I was sitting in a Business Roundtable a little \nmore than a year ago. We were just going around the room, and I was \nlistening to small businesses describe to me some of the challenges \nthey face.\n  A woman, a small business owner, said to me: Mike, we have studied \nthis health care law every which way we can. I am right on the edge of \nhaving 50 employees. I am told if I go over 50 employees, I am now \nsubject to all of the ramifications of the health care law. After \nlooking at this I have decided I will not grow my business beyond 50 \nemployees. I do not want to deal with this health care law.\n  Her discussion with me has stuck with me all of these months. Why is \nit that Washington would actually pass legislation that would \ndiscourage her from hiring additional employees to grow her business? \nIt makes no sense whatsoever. Why are we here in Washington creating a \ndisincentive for the small business owner? Why are we costing Americans \njobs?\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has looked at this legislation. They \nhave come to the conclusion that the American labor supply will be \nreduced by 100,000 workers. The CBO quote is this:\n\n       The law will encourage some people to work fewer hours or \n     to withdraw from the labor market.\n\n  The more we learn about this health care law, the more we come to \nrealize this is flawed policy. It passed and it was signed into law by \nthe President of the United States, but it goes beyond flawed policy. \nIt impacts real people who are trying to make a real living.\n  My comments today started with a story about 50 Nebraskans who lost \ntheir jobs or are about to lose their jobs because of the health care \nlaw. I am concerned that it is not going to stop there; that as \nemployers are more and more burdened with the thousands of pages of \nregulations, they will come to realize their best strategy is to try to \nfigure out how to deal with these new requirements and they will pull \nback on hiring, which is exactly what we do not want to have happen in \nthis economy.\n  With that, I conclude my remarks and our colloquy today.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois \nand the Senator from Tennessee be allowed to enter into a colloquy with \nme for the time that we have allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7233-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7233-S7238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am going to talk about a problem I have \ntried to solve for 14 years. Today, I think we have a new solution and \n``the'' solution--The Marketplace Fairness Act. Our solution has to do \nwith sales taxes that are not being collected at the present time. It \nis a loophole in the tax law.\n  I used to be a retailer. I never thought it was fair that I had to \ncollect the sales taxes but the people from out of State did not have \nto collect the same sales tax. I used to be a mayor, and this bill is a \njobs bill and an infrastructure bill. A lot of people do not realize \nthat sales taxes help pay for schools, police and firemen. They may not \nrealize it pays for infrastructure, such as streets and sewers. I \nalways tell people it is a little tough to flush the toilet over the \nInternet.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act would allow States--not require States--\nto be able to have the out-of-State online sellers, providing they sell \nmore than $500,000 in a year, to collect the State sales tax. I have \nalso been a State legislator, and I can tell you we never intended to \npass a law to tax the people on Main Street who buy the yearbooks and \nparticipate in community activities to be the ones to collect the tax, \nand anyone from out of State to not have to do it. This bill cleans up \nthat problem at the same time. Does it make much of a difference? Yes.\n  We are being asked as a Congress to give money to the States for \ntheir teachers, their firemen, and their infrastructure. It is because \nthere is a decreasing amount of revenue going to them through sales \ntaxes that are owed, but are not currently being collected. People may \nnot realize it, but when they buy something online, if the tax is not \ncollected by the seller, they still owe it. This is not a new tax; it \nis a tax that is already on the books. No legislator ever intended for \nit to just be for Main Street retailers. If States so choose, sales \ntaxes should be collected by all retailers. In our attempts to fix this \nproblem, we have received a number of support letters for this new \nbill. I hope everybody will take a look at them. They can view them \nonline. I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                                 November 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin, Enzi, Alexander and Johnson: On \n     behalf of the National Conference of State Legislatures \n     (NCSL) we would like to express our support and appreciation \n     for your introduction of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which \n     will provide those states that comply with the simplification \n     requirements outlined in the legislation, the authority to \n     require remote sellers to collect those states' sales taxes.\n       At a time when states continue to face severe budget gaps--\n     states closed shortfalls totaling $72 billion leading into \n     the FY 2012 budget process--it is essential states be allowed \n     to collect the revenue generated by uncollected sales taxes. \n     In 2012, states will collectively lose an estimated $23.3 \n     billion in uncollected sales taxes from out-of-state sales, \n     with more than $11.3 billion alone from electronic commerce \n     transactions, according to a study by the University of \n     Tennessee. The amount of uncollected sales taxes will \n     continue to grow, especially with the unprecedented growth of \n     online commerce.\n       The enactment of the Marketplace Fairness Act is imperative \n     in light of the current deliberations by the Joint Select \n     Committee\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\n     on Deficit Reduction and resulting sequestration if the \n     ``Super Committee'' is unsuccessful. Under either scenario, \n     states will likely face hundreds of billions in reductions in \n     many state-federal programs. While the $23.3 billion in \n     uncollected sales taxes will not match any funding \n     reductions, it will provide states with some fiscal relief. \n     In the words of Senator Roy Blunt, a sponsor of this \n     legislation, it is ``fiscal relief for the states that does \n     not cost the federal government a dime.''\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act is also a win for local main \n     street businesses throughout the country by leveling the \n     playing field between these main street businesses who have \n     to collect sales taxes and out-of-state merchants who \n     currently do not. Allowing some remote sellers to avoid \n     collecting this tax is unfair to the main street merchants \n     that make up the lifeblood of our local communities. The \n     legislation also removes the liability for businesses \n     collecting sales taxes, ensuring that sellers are held \n     harmless for calculations and collections using the \n     information and certified technology provided by the states \n     that have complied with the Act.\n       There will be some who claim that this is a new tax; \n     nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation \n     will not require any state to levy a sales tax on any product \n     or means of buying a product. It merely corrects a tax \n     avoidance problem that if not closed now, will only get worse \n     and possibly push states to seek new revenue sources to make \n     up for the uncollected sales taxes.\n       On behalf of our colleagues from across the country, we \n     thank you for introducing this vital legislation and in doing \n     so, enhancing state sovereignty and fiscal federalism.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Senator Stephen Morris,\n\n                                         President, Kansas Senate,\n                                                   NCSL President.\n\n                                        Senator Richard Moore,\n\n                                             Massachusetts Senate,\n     NCSL Immediate Past President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Streamlined Sales Tax\n\n\n                                        Governing Board, Inc.,\n\n                                                 November 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin, Enzi, Johnson and Alexander: The 24 \n     Streamline states want you to know they support your \n     introduction of the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n       Online retailers have a competitive price advantage over \n     brick-and-mortar retailers harming the brick-and-mortar \n     retailers. Many main street businesses are little more than \n     showrooms where consumers go to ``kick the tires'' on \n     products they later buy online harming the local business and \n     the community depending on the sales tax from that sale.\n       At a time when Main Street retailers face enormous \n     competitive challenges it is appropriate for Congress to end \n     this unfair treatment.\n       After our ten years of effort to simplify sales tax \n     administration we are encouraged by your effort to get \n     Congress to level the playing field for all retailers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Senator Luke Kenley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin, Johnson, Enzi and Alexander: On \n     behalf of the National Association of Counties (NACo) and the \n     nation's 3,068 counties, I applaud the introduction of the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act. At a time when counties continue to \n     make the tough decisions and provide services for our mutual \n     constituents with fewer resources, we appreciate your \n     legislative efforts to both assure a simpler system of \n     taxation and help our members recover tax revenues due from \n     purchases made by remote means.\n       Due to the changing nature of commerce and sales and use \n     tax collection, your legislation responds appropriately by \n     establishing a path to modernize the current system. \n     According to a University of Tennessee study in 2009, e-\n     commerce sales have grown from just over $900 billion in 1999 \n     to more than $2 trillion in 2006. That same study estimated \n     revenue loss for state and local government to the tune of \n     $10.1 billion to $11.3 billion in sales taxes in 2011 alone. \n     Although NACo has worked with other state and local \n     government representatives to champion for collection of \n     remote sales taxes for over a decade, there is no time better \n     than now for this legislation to move forward. Local \n     governments are facing declining revenues due in part to \n     rising mortgage foreclosures, and a reduction in assistance \n     from their states and the federal government.\n       While your legislation is important in moving us towards \n     collection of remote sales tax, it also serves the purpose of \n     creating equity for those businesses within our local \n     communities. The increasing strength of electronic commerce \n     creates exciting new marketplaces, but it has also put \n     traditional retail outlets at an unfair disadvantage because \n     of outdated and inequitable tax and regulatory environments.\n       NACo strongly supports your legislative efforts to require \n     collection of taxes made on remote sales, and we appreciate \n     that you recognize the longstanding Streamlined Sales Tax \n     Agreement Project (SSTA). We are also pleased that you have \n     excluded issues such as local telecommunications tax reform, \n     which should be addressed separately from collection of \n     remote sales and use taxes.\n       Thank you again for introducing this important legislation. \n     We look forward to working with you and other supporters of \n     the Act and the SSTA to see the collection of remote sales \n     taxes enacted to federal law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Lenny Eliason,\n\n                                Commissioner, Athens County, Ohio,\n     NACo 2011-2012 President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 9, 2011.\n     Hon.

Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin, Enzi, Johnson and Alexander: As \n     leaders of the local government associations listed above, we \n     applaud the introduction of the Marketplace Fairness Act, \n     which will both assure a simpler system of taxation and help \n     our members recover tax revenues that are due from purchases \n     made by remote means.\n       Your legislation responds appropriately to the changing \n     nature of commerce and sales and use tax collection.

We regard the ability to collect sales taxes from \n     remote sellers to be a matter of the highest importance. This \n     Act will significantly improve tax compliance for both state \n     and local governments while at the same time creating a level \n     playing field for all\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\n     businesses. This is because the current system disadvantages \n     in-state ``bricks and mortar'' stores to the advantage of \n     out-of-state businesses and this Act will help improve \n     business activities in our states and the employment these \n     in-state businesses generate.\n       We look forward to working with you during the legislative \n     process to enact final legislation into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patrick T. Carter,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Chairman, Republican Conference, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi, Senator Durbin, Senator Alexander and \n     Senator Johnson: On behalf of the National Retail Federation \n     (NRF), I am writing in support of the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act, which levels the playing field between local and out-of-\n     state merchants with respect to collection of sales taxes.\n       As the state of retailing evolves and internet sales become \n     a more prominent portion of total retail sales, it is \n     critical that the tax laws not discriminate between similar \n     businesses based on how their products are distributed. The \n     Marketplace Fairness Act will eliminate this discrimination \n     by removing the constitutional limitation on your State's \n     authority to collect sales and use taxes from remote sellers. \n     Over a quarter trillion dollars will go uncollected in the \n     next decade unless this legislation is enacted.\n       As the world's largest retail trade association and the \n     voice of retail worldwide, NRF's global membership includes \n     retailers of all sizes, formats and channels of distribution \n     as well as chain restaurants and industry partners from the \n     United States and more than 45 countries abroad. In the U.S., \n     NRF represents an industry that includes more than 3.6 \n     million establishments and which directly and indirectly \n     accounts for 42 million jobs--one in four U.S. jobs. The \n     total U.S. GDP impact of retail is $2.5 trillion annually, \n     and retail is a daily barometer of the health of the nation's \n     economy.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act will bring fairness to large \n     and small retailers alike and provide a business climate in \n     which these retailers have a better opportunity to grow and \n     create jobs. Our members look forward to working with you to \n     help this legislation become law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Retail Industry\n\n\n                                          Leaders Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, November 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the Retail Industry Leaders \n     Associations (RILA), and the millions of Main Street \n     retailers throughout the country, we would like to express \n     our strong support for the Marketplace Fairness Act. This \n     legislation levels the playing field for Main Street brick-\n     and-mortar businesses by closing a loophole that puts them at \n     a competitive disadvantage to the online retail giants. RILA \n     and our membership are grateful for your leadership on this \n     important issue and we are committed to helping make this \n     legislation law this Congress.\n       By way of background, RILA is the trade association of the \n     world's largest and most innovative retail companies. RILA \n     promotes consumer choice and economic freedom through public \n     policy and industry operational excellence. Its members \n     include more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers, and \n     service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 \n     trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs and \n     operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities \n     and distribution centers domestically and abroad.\n       Because of a decades-old loophole that pre-dates the \n     Internet, online-only companies can achieve as much as a 10-\n     percent price advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers by \n     not collecting state sales taxes. This special treatment has \n     the effect of the government picking winners and losers in \n     the marketplace, and main street businesses simply cannot \n     compete over the long term with online giants that enjoy a \n     government-sanctioned competitive advantage.\n       This loophole is costing jobs on Main Street while \n     shortchanging state budgets by an estimated $23 billion in \n     uncollected state sales taxes annually, a figure that will \n     only increase as Internet commerce continues to grow. Few \n     Americans know that their state requires them to pay the \n     sales tax on purchases made online if the vendor does not \n     collect it at the point of sale, leaving consumers vulnerable \n     to penalties, interest and increased scrutiny from state \n     auditors. If enacted, the Marketplace Fairness Act would \n     remove this burden from your constituents and in the process \n     empower states to address their budget deficits without \n     having to raise taxes--all without any cost to the federal \n     government.\n       In closing, we strongly support the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act to eliminate this antiquated loophole and view it as \n     critical to preserving Main Street businesses and the jobs \n     they provide. Thank you again for your leadership on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Katherine Lugar,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             International Council\n\n\n                                    of Shopping Centers, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2011.\n       Dear Senators Alexander, Durbin and Enzi: On behalf of the \n     more than 42,000 members of the International Council of \n     Shopping Centers (ICSC), I would like to thank you for your \n     leadership on the Marketplace Fairness Act. We strongly \n     support this bipartisan legislation that will level the \n     playing field for community-based retailers by offering long-\n     overdue sales tax fairness.\n       ICSC was founded in 1957 and is the premier global trade \n     association of the shopping center industry. Its members \n     include shopping center owners, developers, managers, \n     marketing specialists, investors, retailers and brokers, as \n     well as academics and public officials.\n       Under the current system, not all retail sales are treated \n     equally. While brick-and-mortar retailers must remit sales \n     and use taxes, many remote sellers, such as catalog and \n     online vendors, are exempt from such requirements. Our \n     current sales tax policy unfairly impacts local retailers--\n     many of whom have also been hit during the recession--and \n     places an impractical legal burden on taxpayers and \n     consumers, costing state and local governments billions in \n     much-needed revenue.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act would eliminate the present \n     system's lopsided manner of taxing community-based retailers, \n     remove the liability currently being pushed onto consumers, \n     and promote community investment. More importantly, it would \n     provide support for local businesses and necessary revenue to \n     states without adding to the federal deficit, establishing \n     new taxes or increasing existing taxes. This bill is a true \n     stimulus for our states and local communities.\n       It is time for the federal government to allow states to \n     enforce their laws and promote sound policy that will allow \n     community-based and internet retailers to thrive in the 21st \n     Century marketplace.\n       Thank you again for the dedication and strong leadership \n     that was required to create this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Betsy Laird,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                   Office of Global Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Some of the groups include: One is from the National \nConference of State Legislatures, one from the National Association of \nCounties, the National League of Cities, the Federation of Tax \nAdministrators, The National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, and \nthe Governing Board of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n  I want to read one from Amazon.com because they are one of the \nworld's largest online sellers. In the past, they have opposed previous \nversions of the bill, but they think we have this one right.\n  The letter states:\n\n       Thank you very much for your legislation on interstate \n     sales tax collection.\n       Amazon strongly supports enactment of your bill and will \n     work with you, your colleagues in Congress, retailers, and \n     the states to get this bipartisan legislation passed. It's a \n     win-win resolution--and as analysts have noted, Amazon offers \n     customers the best prices with or without sales tax.\n       If enacted, your bill will allow states to require out of \n     state retailers to collect sales tax at the time of purchase \n     and remit those taxes on behalf of customers, and it will \n     facilitate collection on behalf of third party sellers. Thus, \n     your bill will allow states to obtain additional revenue \n     without new taxes or federal spending and will make it easy \n     for consumers and small retailers to comply with state sales \n     tax laws.\n       Amazon is grateful for your hard work on the issue, and we \n     look forward to working with you and your colleagues in \n     Congress to pass this legislation.\n\n  We have a number of other supporters in addition to the others I just \nmentioned. We are appreciative of their support and look forward to \nworking with them to get this bill enacted.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is a bipartisan bill. The original \ncosponsors on it are five Republicans--Senators Alexander, Boozman, \nBlunt, Corker, and me and five Democrats--Senators Durbin, Tim Johnson, \nReed, Whitehouse, and Pryor. A key person in this debate has been the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, who introduced a previous version of \nthe bill. We encourage our colleagues to take a look at Senator \nDurbin's previously introduced\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nbill and the Marketplace Fairness Act to see the differences--I think \nour bipartisan bill is a very passable bill.\n  At this point, I would ask Senator Durbin if he has any comments he \nwould like to share as he has been an integral part of making the bill \na strong bipartisan product and realizing the plight the retailers and \nthe state and local governments are in.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, Senator Enzi. I want to give fair \nwarning to all who are witnessing the debate that bipartisanship is \nabout to break out on the floor of the Senate, and you can witness it. \nWe have a bipartisan effort led by Senator Enzi, who has really been \ndedicating his life in public service, as a former retailer, to being \nsensitive to the needs of Main Street and small business. For years, he \nworked with our former colleague, Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, \nand they did their best to pass this legislation. When Senator Dorgan \nretired, I approached Senator Enzi and said: I would like to join you \nin this effort. I am honored to be on the floor with him and our mutual \nfriend, Senator Alexander, in this combined bipartisan effort to deal \nwith an issue I think is essential to fairness in our economy and \nhelping small businesses thrive, which is the key to economic \nrevitalization.\n  If you ask the small businesses in my home State of Illinois what \nthey want, it is not a big handout from Washington, nor any special \nattention. Frankly, they ask for a level playing field: Let them \ncompete. What Senator Enzi has said is that many retailers in my State, \nhis, and every State are finding it more difficult to compete because \nthey have to rent a building or buy one. They have to pay the property \ntaxes. They, of course, have to pay utility bills and local taxes that \nmight be generated because of their sales either to the State or local \ngovernment. In each instance, they are investing back into the \ncommunity and State in which they live. That is part of the basic \nunderstanding we have in this country, that we are in this together and \nwe need to cooperate. The businessman down the street who is selling \nsomething in a store is also at the same time supporting the local \ncommunity to make sure it has traffic lights and make certain it has \npolice protection and utilities and streets and curbs and gutters and \neverything that goes with it.\n  But there has been a new phenomena in the American marketplace over \nthe last several decades, and now it is in full throat, and that is the \nInternet. Internet sales are an amazing entity--we can literally click \na mouse and buy a product that will arrive several days later at our \nhome or business place. It also has invited an inequity, an unfairness \nthat we address in this bill.\n  We are not creating any new taxes in this bill. I say to my friends \non both sides of the aisle, that is not our intention, nor does this \nbill do that. What it does is it provides a mechanism to collect \nexisting taxes that are owed under existing law, period. We do this in \na fashion--which Senator Alexander will describe in a moment--that \ncapitalizes on the technology and software available today to make this \na process that is not burdensome and does not slow down commerce in any \nway.\n  I recently went to Bloomington, IL, and a number of other communities \nin my State and sat down with local retailers and had them tell their \nstories--in many cases, depressing stories--about what they are going \nthrough. In one instance, this fellow sells camping gear, outdoor wear, \nsome snorkeling equipment, and ski equipment, and it is not unusual for \nhim and for others who are selling that type of sporting equipment to \nhave local customers come in and look for the product they want, \nactually get a fitting to make sure they get the right size, and then \nleave to order it on the Internet so they can escape any sales tax \nliability. Well, that isn't fair to the local merchant, and it \ncertainly wasn't the intention of Illinois or any other State to impose \na sales tax just on those businesses that physically exist in our \nStates.\n\n  This bill, the Marketplace Fairness Act, applies this sales tax \nacross the board to sales across the United States, and it is \nvoluntary. States have to decide they want to move into this field and \nuse this opportunity. I think that is the way to approach it. Some 24 \nStates, if I am not mistaken, have already signed up for this \nstreamlined coalition which allows them to make this happen. Other \nStates, by complying with this law and passing a local State law, can \ndo the same. It is their option. We don't impose it or demand it. It is \ntheir option, if they choose it, to use existing sales tax and to take \nthe initiative at the State level. As Senator Alexander has reminded me \nmany times, it is a States rights issue, as it should be, and that is \nwhat we are focusing on in this legislation.\n  I think it is an issue of fairness, and I think it goes beyond what \nwe are facing today in terms of the disparity between Democrats and \nRepublicans. We are coming together. We are coming together on behalf \nof tax fairness, coming together on behalf of States rights, coming \ntogether to make certain that small businesses across America have the \nresources they need to prosper, be profitable, and, we hope, to expand \ntheir workforce. We need to create more jobs, and I don't think it is \nunreasonable to expect that to happen as these local retailers become \nmore competitive and more profitable.\n  I might also add that the States that decide to opt in to it will \nhave a source of revenue that will be helpful to them in difficult \ntimes. Again, it is their decision.\n  I will not recount all of the groups that have endorsed this; Senator \nEnzi already has. It is a pretty impressive array. One of the most \nimpressive supporters he has read a letter from is Amazon--to think \nthat one of the largest if not the largest online retailer in America \nendorses this bill. When I think back on all of the battles that have \nbeen fought in all of the States by Amazon when each State tried to \naddress this, I believe it is telling that they have stepped forward \nand said: Here is a solution that can work. And if the largest online \nretailer in America--or one of the largest--feels that way, it should \nencourage many colleagues who don't want to destroy that part of our \neconomy, and I certainly don't either.\n  This is a positive step in the right direction. I thank Senator Tim \nJohnson, Senator Boozman, Senator Jack Reed, Senator Blunt, Senator \nWhitehouse, and many others who are going to join Senator Enzi, Senator \nAlexander, and myself in this effort to pass this bipartisan bill. \nLet's get this done. Let's work together on a bipartisan basis to solve \na problem that has haunted us for over a decade and do it in a fair \nfashion that does not create any new taxes but gives to the States the \nright to collect those taxes that are already on the book.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. The minority has \n20 seconds left.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask consent to extend the colloquy into Democratic \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to congratulate Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin \nand say how pleased I am to join as a cosponsor of their legislation. \nHere is what I want to congratulate them for. Senator Enzi said he came \nto this as a former mayor, as a former shoe shop owner, and as a former \nlegislator. I come as a former Governor.\n  In our constitutional framework, I have always thought it was our \nbusiness in Tennessee to decide what services we wanted to provide and \nwhat taxes we wanted to levy to pay for them. For example, we have a \nhigh sales tax, but we have no income tax. That is different from most \nStates. We have a low overall tax burden. For me, this is, as Senator \nDurbin and I have discussed, a matter of States rights.\n  I think the most important thing I could say today is that they have \nsolved the problem with this legislation. This problem has been there \nfor a long time. It has had the opposition of conservatives worried \nabout taxes. It has had the opposition of Amazon and other online \nsellers.\n  Twenty years ago, when technology for businesses to compute and \ncollect taxes was not nearly as innovative as it is today, the Supreme \nCourt said that without congressional approval, states could not \nrequire out-of-state businesses to collect sales taxes because this \ncreated too much of a burden on interstate commerce. Senator\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nEnzi and Senator Durbin, with this legislation, in my opinion, have \nsolved the problem, and this is going to happen.\n  I am not presumptuous enough to predict what the Congress will do and \nwhat the President will sign, but I think I have been around long \nenough and I have watched Congress enough to say this is going to \nhappen. And if I were Governor, if I were an online retailer, or if I \nwere a catalog retailer, I would make my plans to conduct my business \nin this way. Why do I say that? Well, for one thing, times have \nchanged.\n  This morning, I got up and looked up the weather in my hometown. So I \nwent online and put in weather, 37886--that is my ZIP Code--and back \ncame the information. Under the bill Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi \nhave proposed, the State would create a system for Amazon, let's say as \nan example, an online seller. All they would have to do, if I buy a \n$300 or $400 television set, is they put my name in, they put in my ZIP \ncode, and the software the State has provided will tell them what the \ntax is and will even electronically transfer the tax money back to the \nState. In other words, Amazon will do the same thing the appliance \nstore in Maryville, TN, will do, and that is what we intended to \nhappen.\n  I mean, when we passed a sales tax in Tennessee--I wasn't around \nthen, but I was around when it has been raised--we didn't intend to \nexempt some people over others. We didn't intend to subsidize some \nbusinesses over others. We made a general decision that when we buy \nthings in Tennessee, all sellers would collect the sales tax. We have a \nlocal sales tax and we have a State sales tax, and that is our right to \ndecide.\n  Some of the opposition in the past has come from conservative groups. \nIt was important, just yesterday, to see the chairman of the American \nConservative Union write a very strong article in support of a House \nversion of this same bill. I talked with him yesterday, Mr. Al \nCardenas, a businessman from Florida, and he is reviewing our bill.\n  Ten years ago, William F. Buckley wrote about this problem and said \nthat it was a loophole that needed to be solved and when States decided \nto subsidize some taxpayers over others and some businesses over \nothers, that was not good conservative philosophy.\n  So when you have Amazon supporting in a strong letter that Senator \nEnzi read, and when you have the chairman of the American Conservative \nUnion on the same day announcing his support for the same principles, I \nthink you have solved the problem.\n  As Amazon just said in their letter, they are in business to compete \nand they can sell their goods, they claim, cheaper online than they can \nbuy them in Senator Enzi's store in Gillette, WY. Maybe they can, maybe \nthey can't, but at least they will have a level playing field, and both \nthe store in Gillette, WY, and the online seller will do the very same \nthing. They will collect the sales tax that is already owed from the \npurchaser and they will send it directly to the State, which has been \nthe way things have worked for a long time.\n\n  This is an issue about preserving the States' right to collect or not \nto collect their own sales tax. It is about closing a tax loophole. It \nis about stopping the subsidization of some businesses over others, of \nsome taxpayers over others.\n  I will conclude my remarks in a moment, but first here is what \nWilliam F. Buckley said about it:\n\n       The mattress maker in Connecticut . . . does not like it if \n     out-of-State businesses are, in practical terms, subsidized; \n     that's what the non-tax amounts to. Local concerns are \n     complaining about traffic in mattresses and books and records \n     and computer equipment which, ordered through the Internet, \n     come in, so to speak, duty free.\n\n  Of course, Governors and legislators are up in arms as well. This \nloophole costs States $23 billion. Tennessee could use this money to \nward off a State income tax which we don't have and we don't want. \nWyoming could use the revenue to reduce its property tax. Other States \nmight reduce rising college tuitions, or they might reward outstanding \nteachers.\n  This has been a problem for the last 20 years, but Senator Enzi and \nSenator Durbin, with their legislation, have solved the problem.\n  I will stop where I started. This is not a new tax, it is an existing \ntax. It is not a tax on the Internet; it is on all sales. Senator Enzi \nand Senator Durbin, with their legislation, have solved the problem, \nand I predict that because of the voluntary agreements and the ease of \nout-of-State vendors doing the same thing Main Street vendors do, that \nvery soon we will eliminate these subsidies and close this loophole. I \ncongratulate them for their years of work in this area. I am happy to \njoin 10 Senators--5 Republicans, 5 Democrats--in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include for the Record the \narticle by Al Cardenas, the head of the American Conservative Union; \nthe essay by William F. Buckley; and a letter from Governor Bill Haslam \nof Tennessee, endorsing the Enzi-Durbin legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From National Review Online, Nov. 8, 2011]\n\n       The Chief Threat to American Competitiveness: Our Tax Code\n\n                            (By Al Cardenas)\n\n       More than three years after America's financial system hit \n     a crisis point, the state of our economy remains in turmoil. \n     As our nation's leaders grapple with immediate challenges \n     through dueling jobs plans and the Joint Select Committee on \n     Deficit Reduction tries to come to agreement on a trillion \n     and a half in reductions, we must also consider long-term \n     measures to strengthen our economic security. As it stands \n     now, the number one threat to the future of American \n     competitiveness isn't other countries. It's our tax law.\n       The United States Tax Code is difficult to understand and \n     even harder to navigate, for families and businesses alike. \n     Title 26 has been patchworked, reformed, and tinkered with \n     for decades, giving us an antiquated mess of laws rife with \n     inequities. Our corporate tax rate is among the highest in \n     the world. We refuse to shift to a Territorial Tax System \n     that would stop punishing our companies for bringing earned \n     overseas income back to the U.S. for reinvestment. Tax rates \n     for small businesses remain high and inconsistent.\n       A robust free-market system requires a level playing field, \n     where the government doesn't get to pick the winners and \n     losers. We should require the same of our system of taxation. \n     We need a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code that removes \n     loopholes, subsidies, and credits, one that lowers rates \n     across the board and expands the percentage of Americans \n     paying their fair share of taxes.\n       When it comes to sales tax, it is time to address the area \n     where prejudice is most egregious--our policy towards \n     Internet sales. At issue is the federal government exempting \n     some Internet transactions from sales taxes while requiring \n     the remittance of sales taxes for identical sales made at \n     brick and mortar locations. It is an outdated set of policies \n     in today's super information age, when families every day \n     make decisions to purchase goods and services online or in \n     person. Moreover, it's unfair, punitive to some small \n     businesses and corporations and a boon for others.\n       This is why the American Conservative Union applauds Rep. \n     Steve Womack for his sponsorship of the Marketplace Equity \n     Act of 2011, one of the first sincere attempts to modernize \n     our tax policy for the 21st century.\n       As conservatives we know that governmental power can be \n     used to destroy entrepreneurship, innovation and the free \n     market. There is no more glaring example of misguided \n     government power then when taxes or regulations affect two \n     similar businesses completely differently.\n       Over time, the company that has to comply with a tax or a \n     regulation will lose market share to its competitor who is \n     carved out from this government interference. In these cases \n     the winner is not the company who outcompetes, but the one \n     who gets special privileges from the government.\n       At its inception, the Internet was everyone's darling, the \n     latest example of American innovation and ingenuity. Internet \n     sales represented a miniscule portion of the total retail \n     market, and the novelty led to tax loopholes and unintended \n     consequences. Now, according to Forrester Research, Internet \n     sales account for nearly 10 percent of all sales of products \n     and services in America, with an annual growth rate of about \n     9 percent.\n       If we do not confront this issue, state and local \n     governments dependent on sales taxes will need to look for \n     other sources of revenues as Internet sales continue to \n     expand. Policy which allows for both online and brick and \n     mortar retailers to be susceptible to the same taxes will--\n     and should--allow for commensurate reductions in sales tax \n     rates. For instance, if Internet sales tax revenues will add \n     10 percent in revenue to a governing body's coffers, then, at \n     a minimum, a corresponding overall reduction in rates should \n     apply.\n       The current system is also inconsistent with states' \n     rights, and the Congress ought to carefully consider enacting \n     revenue neutral tax reform policies consistent with the Tenth \n     Amendment.\n       The free-market system can only operate effectively on a \n     level playing field of free and\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\n     fair competition. Whether it's the Department of Energy's \n     disastrous Solyndra project, or levying sales taxes, or a \n     multitude of other policy decisions that impact the private \n     sector, the government picking winners and losers is a \n     perversion of the free market system. Lawmakers on Capitol \n     Hill--especially conservatives--ought to at least acknowledge \n     this when deliberating important reforms to the tax code. As \n     we consider wholesale reform, exempting Internet sales can no \n     longer be justified.\n       The Marketplace Equity Act of 2011 begins this \n     conversation. It's not a perfect bill, but it's a critical \n     beginning to this dialogue and should spark bipartisan \n     support for revenue neutral reforms. Rest assured, we will \n     not be party to or stand for Trojan Horse legislation that \n     claims to strive for equity in the law merely to serve as a \n     cloak for secret tax increases.\n       We have a great opportunity to drastically lower rates, \n     especially corporate rates, and eliminate esoteric tax \n     preferences to stave off the next massive financial crisis. A \n     flatter, fairer, simpler tax code is the key to ensuring \n     American competitiveness for generations to come. Our leaders \n     in Congress are obligated to thoughtfully consider measures \n     to achieve this.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From National Review Online, Oct. 19, 2001]\n\n                      Get That Internet Tax Right\n\n                      (By William F. Buckley Jr.)\n\n       Congress is up against it: what to do about Internet \n     commerce?\n       To return to an example given earlier in this space, you \n     have a mother living in Hartford, Connecticut, looking for a \n     new mattress and spotting one on the website of a producer in \n     Massachusetts. The feel of it is right, and so is the price, \n     so the $500 order is placed. The mattress crossing the border \n     is not taxed, because writing the Constitution in \n     Philadelphia in 1787, it was decided: no tariffs within the \n     13 states. Interstate commerce would be regulated only by \n     Congress.\n       Which is all to the good, but Connecticut takes the \n     position that the family living happily in Hartford has to \n     pay its share of the cost of government, which entitles the \n     treasury to a use tax. If the mother in Hartford who sent out \n     for the mattress in Massachusetts were a perfect citizen, she \n     would write a check for $30 (6 percent) to the State of \n     Connecticut and sleep at complete ease with her conscience. \n     What she does do, is sleep at complete ease with her \n     conscience without sending in the check for $30. The reason \n     for it is that taxes of that order are pretty well \n     uncollectable. An uncollectable tax is one which would cost \n     more to exact it would yield in profit. There is, in \n     addition, the political question. People wouldn't like it \n     when Big Brother stared into every out-of-state package, \n     inquiring whether there is something in it for city hall.\n       So that one part of the pressure building on Congress is \n     collectivist: to let states come in with a transfer tax. But \n     a second pressure is from merchants who see themselves \n     affected by untaxed transactions. The mattress maker in \n     Connecticut is willing to compete with the company in \n     Massachusetts, but does not like it if out-of-state \n     businesses are, in practical terms, subsidized; that's what \n     the non-tax amounts to. Local concerns are complaining about \n     traffic in mattresses and books and records and computer \n     equipment which, ordered through the Internet, come in, so to \n     speak, duty free.\n       Three years ago, Congress voted to continue until 2001 the \n     tax-free character of interstate commerce. This meant not \n     only a prospective loss of tax to the affected states, it \n     meant also something on the order of a benediction on a \n     staggering development in technology. The Internet is the \n     happiest intellectual, journalistic, and educational \n     development in history, and the thought of letting the weeds \n     of prehensile government crawl about it struck some as on the \n     order of enforced shutters on sunlight, or taps on \n     waterfalls.\n       But, sigh, that was three years ago, which in the Internet \n     business is three millennia ago. The estimated commerce done \n     by the Internet in 1998 was $9 billion. Last year it was $26 \n     billion. Which means we have to come to earth, and face \n     homespun economic truths. If the advantage of tax-free \n     Internet commerce marginally closes out local industry, \n     reforms are required.\n       The mechanics of reforms call on holding not the buyer, but \n     the seller, responsible. It still won't be possible to target \n     the mother in Hartford directly when the mattress arrives, \n     but the exporter of it in Massachusetts can be required to \n     add $30 to the cost of the mattress, and send the check off \n     to Connecticut Internal Revenue. It is, finally, impossible \n     for Congress to wrestle with the problem without yielding to \n     legitimate demands of the states spending the money on \n     education, police, and fire departments, and deprive them of \n     revenue.\n       The question has not come up in the current welter of \n     proposals, but we have to watch carefully to prevent the \n     United States Postal Service from getting into the act. The \n     most calamitous exposure of the postal service since the days \n     of mail-train robberies is of course fax and the Internet. \n     These are, for all intents and purposes, absolutely free \n     transactions. One hundred messages can be sent out, or for \n     that matter one thousand, for less than the cost of a first-\n     class postage stamp. A rumor swept about the medium, a year \n     or so back, that a proposal was making way that would charge \n     five cents for every communication sent out on the Internet.\n       The very idea is heretical, like charging for Communion \n     wafers. To tax the Internet for the benefit of the postal \n     service is unsupportable reasoning. The postal service needs \n     to survive from its own revenues. If there is a shortfall, \n     the government can come up with it, as required, on the same \n     principle as rural free delivery. But to attempt to relieve \n     its problems by contaminating the Internet is something that \n     any congressman who has taken an oath to right reason is \n     bound to oppose.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 8, 2011.\n     Senator Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing to thank you for your \n     leadership in helping to advance a federal solution to a \n     problem states need Congress to address: the preservation of \n     their own right to enforce their own tax laws and returning \n     fairness to the marketplace.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act will bring much needed, and \n     long overdue, relief to the State of Tennessee. Tennessee and \n     other states are currently unable to compel out-of-state \n     businesses to collect sales taxes the same way local \n     businesses do. It is important for states to determine their \n     own tax policy and have the ability to collect the revenues \n     they are already owed. This is why your legislation is so \n     important.\n       The Internet has changed the way we do business and \n     provides small businesses the opportunity to grow, but we \n     need our laws to adapt to this new marketplace. Our state \n     relies on sales taxes for the majority of its revenue, and \n     each year we are losing hundreds of millions of dollars that \n     could be used to benefit Tennessee. What cannot happen is for \n     Congress to do nothing, which will prevent states from \n     enforcing their own laws.\n       Your legislation gives states the flexibility to determine \n     what works best for them, and I am grateful that you are \n     putting states' rights first and closing this online sales-\n     tax loophole. The Marketplace Fairness Act strikes the right \n     balance for Tennessee, and I fully support your efforts.\n           Warmest regards,\n                                                      Bill Haslam,\n                                     Governor, State of Tennessee.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Tennessee yield for \na moment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to go on the record on behalf of myself and, I am \nsure Senator Enzi, in saying that Senator Alexander doesn't give \nhimself enough credit. He has been an integral part of putting together \nthis bipartisan bill. We wouldn't be here without him. I want to thank \nhim for facilitating the bipartisan effort to put this bill together. I \nshare his feelings. I think we have finally found that sweet spot, and \nwe can pass this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to return to morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me also commend Senator Enzi and Senator \nDurbin and Senator Alexander because I too am a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and I think it does represent a remarkably thoughtful and \nbipartisan approach to the problem of providing resources to local \nStates and communities so they can carry out the very challenging \nissues of local governments. I am not surprised that Senator Alexander \nis a key element in this product. Both Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin \ndeserve to be complimented. I thank them for their leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7238-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7238-S7239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VOW TO HIRE HEROES ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise specifically to speak in strong \nsupport of the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. This legislation \nincorporates key components of the American Jobs Act and other \nbipartisan proposals designed to help veterans find jobs, including the \nHiring Heroes Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. These are \ncommonsense policies that Congress can and should pass immediately.\n  We are in the midst of an unemployment crisis that is obvious to \nevery American, and it is a growing problem that is sapping not only \nour economic strength but indeed our sense of national purpose and our \nmorale. The national unemployment rate has been hovering around 9 \npercent, and that means 14 million Americans are looking for work in \none of the toughest economies since the Great Depression. But what is \nunfortunate--some might\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\neven say shameful--is that almost 1 million of those Americans looking \nfor work are veterans returning home after valiantly serving our \ncountry. The unemployment rate for veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq is \nan indefensible 12.1 percent. It represents a significant blow to young \nmen and women who are returning home after serving their country in \nvery difficult circumstances. In 2010, 36 percent of Afghanistan and \nIraq-era veterans were unemployed for longer than 26 weeks. Again, that \nis a shameful statistic.\n  This unfortunate trend is mirrored in my home State of Rhode Island. \nWe have a very high unemployment rate--10.5 percent, one of the highest \nin the Nation. We have been unfortunately in that category for almost 2 \nyears now. But for veterans, the rate is 11.1 percent. They are doing \neven worse than other nonveterans in the unemployment category. That is \none more reason, by the way, that we should extend the unemployment \ncompensation legislation that is so necessary. I have joined Senators \nDurbin, Whitehouse, Levin, Merkley, and Gillibrand, and we have \nproposed to do this with the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act of 2011. We still have people coming back from \nAfghanistan; we still have people who are holding on to a job but very \nwell might lose it. They need these benefits, and if we don't pass this \nlegislation, then beginning next January, there is a very real \npossibility that they will not be able to get these benefits which are \nso essential.\n  We have to work together. I think it is a very good example of the \nwork Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, Senator Durbin, myself, and \nothers have done with respect to this legislation on sales tax. But we \nhave to work across the aisle, particularly for our American veterans, \nbut also for American workers throughout this country.\n  Again today we have a component of the American Jobs Act before us. \nThis bill is focused on veterans, but the jobs act overall should be \npassed. We have argued for it endlessly, because it will put Americans \nto work, it is fully paid for, and it will be an investment in our \ninfrastructure and in other programs that are long-term needs of this \nNation.\n  This particular legislation before us targeted at veterans would \nprovide incentives for businesses to hire these veterans, including a \ntax credit of $2,400 for hiring a veteran who has been unemployed for \nmore than 4 weeks but less than 6 months, a $5,600 tax credit for \nhiring a veteran who has been looking for a job for more than 6 months, \nand a $9,600 tax credit for hiring veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities who have been looking for a job more than 6 months. These \nincentives will help veterans secure employment and they should be \npassed immediately.\n  These veterans deserve our help as they transition from their \nmilitary service to their civilian careers. They have incredible skills \nof leadership, of diligence, of dedication, of self-discipline that add \nto their technical skills and make them incredibly important for the \ngrowth of our economy, and they have to have the opportunity to use \nthese skills for the benefit of their communities, as they did to \ndefend their country. This legislation provides that critical \nassistance.\n  It has other aspects to it. First, it would provide opportunities for \nmilitary personnel who are leaving active service for transitional \nassistance to be able to participate in workshops sponsored by the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Labor, and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. The workshops will help them write resumes, receive \ncareer counseling, and other things.\n  Second, it expands education and training opportunities for older \nunemployed veterans by essentially providing an additional year of \nMontgomery GI bill benefits for use at community colleges and technical \nschools. It also allows servicemembers to begin to seek civilian jobs \nin the Federal Government prior to formally separating from their \nmilitary service.\n  Earlier this week I was with the President when we announced these \ninitiatives and more. After that visit to the Rose Garden, I went to \nWalter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda to visit those \nyoung men and women who have served and who are now wounded warriors. \nTrust me, their spirit is undeterred, as is their commitment to their \ncountry. We owe them much more than we can ever repay, and the first \npayment of that huge debt is passing immediately--this week--this \nlegislation to help our veterans. So as we celebrate Veterans Day with \nspeeches, we will have a real accomplishment to bring to the American \npeople and the veterans who serve and defend us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today's debate concerns S.J. Res. 6. \nIn a larger context, though, we have been having this debate for 34 \nmonths. The theme is, the Obama administration's relentless imposition \nof new and destructive regulations has not helped us get into a \nrecovery and, in fact, I think is freezing our economy.\n  We have seen it with the Environmental Protection Agency when it \ntried to regulate carbon emissions and greenhouse gases using the Clean \nAir Act, a purpose for which Congress never intended the law to be \nused. We have seen it with the National Mediation Board when it \noverturned nearly a century of precedent and issued a new rulemaking to \nallow unions to be formed more easily but harder to decertify.\n  We have seen it with the National Labor Relations Board when it took \nthe shocking step of challenging Boeing's decision to create new jobs \nby building a new factory in South Carolina, simply because South \nCarolina is a right-to-work State.\n  Today's issue involves bureaucratic overreach into a symbol of \nAmerican innovation and creativity, the Internet, because the Federal \nCommunications Commission has now decided to regulate the Internet. \nLast December, three FCC Commissioners, on a party-line vote, voted to \nimpose rules that restrict how Internet service providers offer \nbroadband services to consumers. Those rules, known as net neutrality, \nimpose 19th century-style monopoly regulations on the most competitive \nand important job-creating engine of the 21st century, the Internet.\n  This marks a stunning reversal from the hands-off approach to the \nInternet that Federal policymakers have taken for more than a decade. \nDuring the last 20 years, the Internet has grown and flourished without \nburdensome regulations imposed by Washington. Powered by the strength \nof free market forces, the Internet has been an open platform for \ninnovation, spurring business development and much needed job creation.\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\n  The former Democratic FCC Chairman, William Kennard, stated in 1999 \n``[t}he fertile fields of innovation across the communications sector \nand around the country are blooming because from the get-go we have \ntaken a deregulatory, competitive approach to our communications \nstructure--especially the Internet.''\n  The present FCC is reversing that policy that has been successful \nbeyond our expectations. Broadband Internet networks have powered the \ninformation and communications industry, which in 2009 accounted for \nmore than 3.5 million high-paying jobs and about $1 trillion in \neconomic activity.\n  This industry has been an engine for major economic growth even \nduring these difficult times. Yet the FCC's rules could severely \njeopardize this industry's vast potential. Net neutrality is intended \nto limit how Internet service providers develop and operate their \nbroadband networks. The net neutrality order allows the FCC to tell \nbroadband providers what kind of business practices are reasonable and \nunreasonable. The FCC, however, did not bother to clearly define in its \nrules what the agency considers to be reasonable.\n  This point is vital to understand. With such an arbitrary and yet \npoorly defined standard, companies will be forced to err on the side of \ncaution. Rather than risk possible punishment from the FCC, many \ncompanies will simply decide: Maybe we will not invest right now in new \ntechnologies. Maybe it is too risky to develop and deploy new services. \nAt the very least, it will delay such investment.\n  This kind of regulatory uncertainty will be crippling for companies \nand particularly small providers. We have heard exactly that from a \nsmall wireless Internet provider in Wyoming called LARIAT. This is a \nprovider that is serving remote areas and trying to expand to other \nunserved years.\n  LARIAT testified before Congress that these FCC regulations are \nalready harming its ability to attract investors, grow its business, \nhire more workers, and serve new customers. Forcing broadband companies \nto ask the government for permission before moving forward is exactly \nwhat we should try to avoid when reviving our economy.\n  This FCC regime will lead to stagnation in Internet innovation in the \nUnited States, placing us at a disadvantage against overseas \ncompetitors who are not burdened with similar rules. Moveover, Internet \nproviders will end up spending resources on lawyers and lobbyists in \norder to comply with the FCC's rules, rather than investing those \ndollars in innovation.\n  Small companies will find it even more expensive to navigate \nWashington, DC. This certainly will not help consumers, particularly in \nrural areas, and will only increase the costs they have to bear. Before \nany new regulations are forced on American businesses, it is the \ngovernment's responsibility to clearly show, one, there is an actual \nproblem that needs to be addressed. That should be foremost.\n  With the FCC taking such a large departure from the agency's previous \nlight-touch approach, one might think the FCC could point to a long \nlist of net neutrality violations and problems that need to be fixed. \nThat is not the case here. In a 134-page regulatory order, the FCC \nspent only three paragraphs attempting to catalog alleged instances of \nmisconduct.\n  Within those three short paragraphs, every alleged problem was \naddressed under the FCC's existing rule or, if not, it was fixed by the \nprovider under pressure from the public or the competitive marketplace, \nwhere it should be fixed. As former FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker \nnoted in her statement dissenting from the FCC's net neutrality order, \nthe Commission was ``unable to identify a single ongoing practice of a \nsingle broadband provider that it finds problematic upon which to base \nthis action.'' To put it simply, the FCC has issued new rules without \neven demonstrating that intervention is actually necessary.\n\n  Despite protests to the contrary, these net neutrality regulations on \nbroadband providers clearly establish the FCC as the Internet's \ngatekeeper, a role for which the government is not suited. Innovation \ndoes not work on a government timetable nor does it thrive through a \nmaze of roadblocks.\n  Ironically, supporters of net neutrality insist that providers are \nthe ones who may become gatekeepers of the Internet. These people say \nthe openness of the Internet is far too important to be left \nunprotected by the government. This is a false premise. In fact, the \nInternet has been an open platform for innovation since its inception, \nand it has not needed any sort of net neutrality rules from bureaucrats \nat the FCC.\n  To make matters worse, Congress has never given the FCC the explicit \nauthority to regulate how Internet providers manage their networks. \nThat is why the new rules represent an unprecedented power grab by the \nunelected Commissioners at the FCC. In fact, current law states: ``It \nis the policy of the United States . . . to preserve the vibrant and \ncompetitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and \nother interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State \nregulation.''\n  That is the law today. The FCC has lost this fight already in the \ncourts. Last year, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the \nFCC's 2008 attempt to impose net neutrality in the Comcast v. FCC case. \nThe court ruled that the FCC was acting beyond the reach of its \ncongressionally provided authority and cautioned that regulations \nshould be imposed only with explicit congressional direction.\n  This was validation that regulatory agencies cannot make policy \nwithout congressional direction. Rather than back down, however, the \nFCC doubled down. The current FCC order tries an even more expansive \ninterpretation of the law than was used in the Comcast case. FCC \nCommissioners inexplicably claimed the agency can impose heavy-handed \nInternet regulation under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. \nThis was a section of the law that was intended to remove regulatory \nbarriers to broadband investment, not to raise them.\n  If the FCC's legal theory is left unchallenged, the FCC will have \nnearly unbounded authority to regulate almost anything on the Internet. \nIt is Congress's role, not the FCC's to determine the proper policy \nframework for the Internet. Over time, and aided by the current \nadministration, regulators throughout the government have gradually \ntried to seize increasing control over so many facets of American life. \nIt is time for the Senate to stop this overreach. We write the laws of \nthis country, not unelected bureaucrats. That is why we are here today.\n  Thanks to Senate majority leader Harry Reid, former Senator Don \nNickles, and the late Senator Ted Stevens, one of the tools Congress \nhas to stop rogue agencies is the Congressional Review Act. The \nCongressional Review Act allows Congress to review a rule before it \ntakes effect and even to nullify that rule if Congress finds it is \ninappropriate, or if it overreaches, or if Congress itself hasn't \ndelegated this power to an agency.\n\n  As Senators Reid, Nickles, and Stevens said at the time of this \nbill's passage, ``Congressional review gives the public the opportunity \nto call the attention of politically accountable, elected officials to \nconcerns about new agency rules. If these concerns are sufficiently \nserious, Congress can stop the rule.''\n  We believe the concern about the FCC's net neutrality rules is \nsufficiently serious to warrant the consideration of Senate Joint \nResolution 6, the disapproval resolution Senator McConnell and I \nintroduced to nullify the FCC's net neutrality order under the \nCongressional Review Act. The House has already passed its version of \nthe resolution, and we need only a majority of Senators to send this \nbill to the President's desk. Even a net neutrality supporter, Senator \nOlympia Snowe, who has authored net neutrality legislation, is a \ncosponsor and supporter of our resolution today.\n  While Senator Snowe and I don't agree on the need for a net \nneutrality law, we are in complete agreement--and she stated it \nbeautifully--that Congress, not the FCC, should determine what the \nproper regulatory framework is for the Internet.\n  If the Senate does not strike down these regulations soon, they will \ngo into effect on November 20, further jeopardizing jobs in this \nfragile economy. I guess you could say that it will allow more lawyers \nto be hired, but\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\nmore innovators? Probably not. That is not the mix we need to assure \nthat our economy will get back on track in this country.\n  Studies indicate that net neutrality rules could significantly affect \nour economy. If net neutrality reduces capital investment in broadband \ninfrastructure by even 10 percent, it could cost our country hundreds \nof thousands of jobs over the next decade.\n  We must preserve the openness of the Internet as a platform for \ninnovation and economic growth. We must keep the competitive advantage \nthat we have in this country for innovation. The last thing we ought to \nbe doing is putting restrictions on our providers, when many countries \nthat are also advanced in this area are not doing the same thing. So \nwhen we go to global competitiveness, we are putting our companies at a \ndisadvantage. Why would we do that?\n  We must stop the job-killing regulatory interference by our \ngovernment today in so many areas, and we can start right here, right \nnow, by keeping the Internet free, voting for this resolution of \ndisapproval, and saying to the regulatory bodies in this town: Congress \nmust authorize a delegation of authority for your agency to pass rules, \nand especially when Congress is in disagreement with those rules.\n  This is a key policy decision for our body. We need to step up to the \nresponsibility that Congress has. Our Constitution divided the powers \nbetween three branches of government. If Congress doesn't stand up for \nits one-third of the powers of this government and lets unelected \nbureaucrats run over our prerogatives, we will become a weaker branch, \nand our government will become weaker for it. We need to have three \nequal branches of government, and that means each branch must fulfill \nits responsibilities under the Constitution. Congress must delegate its \nauthority explicitly for a rule to be made. That is the way the \nConstitution intended for Congress to fulfill its job as the elected \nrepresentatives of the people of our country.\n  The House has passed this resolution. I hope the Senate will \ntomorrow. I hope the people will speak and say that even if you \ndisagree on the basic issue of net neutrality, it is not the right of \nthe FCC to pass sweeping regulations that will affect the economy of \nthis country without explicit authority from Congress, which it does \nnot have.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to come to the floor if they want \nto speak on this resolution. There is 4 hours, equally divided, and \nthat time is now running. I say to my Republican colleagues that we \nhave quite a list of those who want to speak. They must know that the \ntime will run out in about 3\\1/2\\ hours now. I ask them to contact me \nif they wish to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The senior Senator from the \ngreat State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Senate \nJoint Resolution 6, which was brought under the Congressional Review \nAct--about which I wish to talk--to disapprove the FCC's open Internet \nrules, such as they are.\n  Americans want the Internet to be free and open to them. They want to \ngo where they want to go, see what they want to see, do what they want \nto do on the Internet. They don't want to have somebody blocking them \nor to have gatekeepers. They want it to be a nice, open forum for them. \nThey care about the Internet. Everyone uses it. They want to be able to \ndevelop new businesses, and they want to read and watch video. They \nwant to reach out to friends and family and community. And they want to \ndo it online. They want to do all of these things on the Internet--\nwithout having to ask permission from their broadband provider. The FCC \nhas promulgated balanced rules that let Americans do all of these \nthings, and keep the Internet open and keep the Internet free.\n  Let us be clear from the outset. No matter how S.J. Res. 6 is dressed \nup in language that suggests it will promote openness and freedom, it \nwill not do that. The resolution is misguided. It will add uncertainty, \nin fact, into the economy, and it will hinder small businesses \ndependent upon fair broadband access, where otherwise they might be put \nin a slower lane. They want to be in a fast lane. They want to be able \nto compete with other parts of the country. This resolution will, in \nfact, undermine innovation. It will hamper investment in digital \ncommerce. It will imperil the openness and freedom that has been the \nhallmark of the Internet from the very start.\n\n  The FCC's rules were the product of very hard work, consensus, and \ncompromise. The agency had extensive input from stakeholders from all \nquarters. They opened up and said send in your comments. In fact, they \nhad written input from more than 100,000 commenters. About 90 percent \nof those filing supported the adoption of open Internet rules. On top \nof this, the rules are based on longstanding and widely accepted open \nInternet principles, which were first articulated during the second \nBush administration.\n  These rules do three basic things. First, they impose a transparency \nobligation on providers of broadband Internet service. This means that \nall broadband providers are required to publicly disclose to consumers \naccurate information regarding the network management practices.\n  Second, the rules prohibit fixed broadband providers from blocking \nlawful content, application, services, and devices. This means \nconsumers and innovators will continue to have the right to send and \nreceive lawful Internet traffic, with mobile broadband service \nproviders subjected to a more limited set of prohibitions. I will speak \nabout that in a moment.\n  Third, the rules aim to ensure that the Internet remains a level \nplaying field by prohibiting fixed broadband providers from \nunreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic--\nwhich they have done.\n  Finally, the rules are meant to apply with the complementary \nprinciple of reasonable network management, which provides broadband \nproviders the flexibility to address congestion or traffic that is \nharmful to the network. These are principles that I believe everyone \ncan support. I see nothing wrong with them. The word ``reasonable'' \nsomehow doesn't scare me. Maybe it should, but it doesn't.\n  I ask my colleagues, what is wrong with transparency? Why would we \nwant to promote Internet blocking or discrimination? Why would we want \nto have some people on the fast lane and some on the slow lane, \ndepending on whether you paid your Internet provider enough money? What \nis unreasonable about reasonable network management?\n  I believe that the FCC's effort, along with ongoing oversight and \nenforcement, will protect consumers, and I believe it will provide \ncompanies with the certainty they need to make investments in our \ngrowing digital economy.\n  While many champions of the open Internet would have preferred a \nstricter decision--and I am one of them; I myself have real \nreservations about treating wireless broadband differently from wired \nbroadband--I think the FCC's decision was nevertheless a meaningful \nstep forward. In a moment, I will talk about other people who feel the \nsame.\n  Supporters of the joint resolution fail to acknowledge that the FCC's \nopen Internet rules have received overwhelming support from broadband \nInternet service providers, consumers, and public groups, labor unions, \nas well as high-tech companies.\n  AT CEO Randall Stephenson stated earlier this year that while he \nwanted ``no regulation,'' the FCC's open Internet order ``ended at a \nplace where we have a line of sight and we know and can commit \nourselves to investments.''\n  Time-Warner Cable said at the time of the order's release that the \nrules adopted ``appear to reflect a workable balance between protecting \nconsumers' interests and preserving incentives for investment and \ninnovation by broadband Internet service providers.''\n  Numerous analysts from major investment banks have found that the \nopen Internet order removes what they call regulatory overhang and \nallows telecom and cable companies to focus on investment.\n  Google, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, Skype, and other leaders in \ninnovation all urged the FCC to adopt ``commonsense baseline rules . . \n. critical to ensuring that the Internet remains a key engine of \neconomic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.''\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\n  More than 150 organizations wrote Congress to oppose this joint \nresolution. I hate reading lists, but I am going to do it anyway: the \nCommunications Workers of America, the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the American Library Association, the \nAmerican Association of Independent Music, the Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights, the League of United Latin American Citizens, \nthe National Organization for Women, and Technet. There are a lot of \nfolks at Technet who have a lot at stake. I have their letters here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 14, 2011.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison: We write \n     to urge your support for the FCC's open Internet rule and \n     rejection of S.J. Res 6, a resolution of disapproval under \n     the Congressional Review Act. Americans have come to depend \n     on reliable open Internet access for their daily life and \n     work. Yet without a light touch FCC rule, households, \n     students and small businesses lack any recourse at all if \n     their Internet Access Provider (IAP) decides to prioritize \n     its own content and affiliated services or block other end \n     user choices.\n       The FCC's December 2010 decision was adopted after several \n     lengthy proceedings and unprecedented public input. The \n     result is a very modest rule designed to preserve open non-\n     discriminatory Internet access. In deference to the wishes of \n     IAPs, the FCC completely avoided Title II common carrier \n     regulation. The rule allows flexible network management and \n     does nothing to inhibit broadband network deployment, while \n     it affirmatively facilitates innovation and investment in new \n     online services, content, applications and access devices by \n     providing some minimal assurance they will not be blocked \n     arbitrarily.\n       CRA repeal would actually leave the American public worse \n     off than with no open Internet rule, as it would also rescind \n     FCC authority in this area. Congress has repeatedly entrusted \n     the FCC with a duty to protect the public interest in \n     nationwide communications by wire and radio. No other agency \n     can help your constituents with Internet access trouble if \n     FCC authority is terminated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Ed Black,\n                                            President & CEO, CCIA.\n                                                       Rey Ramsey,\n     President & CEO, Tech Net.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Open Internet Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2011.\n     Hon.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison: The \n     Open Internet Coalition (``OIC'') respectfully submits this \n     letter to indicate our opposition to a vote under the \n     Congressional Review Act to vacate the Federal Communications \n     Commission's Open Internet Order, which would preclude any \n     future action in this area by the Commission.\n       The OIC believes that such a vote would hurt consumers and \n     innovation, and respectfully asks the Senate to reject the \n     CRA measure.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Open Internet Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 12, 2011.\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Jay Rockefeller,\n     Ranking Member Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Rockefeller, and Ranking Member Hutchison: We, as \n     leaders and communicators representing many diverse religious \n     traditions, write to share our strong support for Internet \n     freedom. Specifically, we support the Federal Communication \n     Commission's Open Internet rules and urge you to oppose S. J. \n     Res 6 which would repeal these rules using the Congressional \n     Review Act. These rules are important for underserved \n     communities as well as the faith community.\n       The Internet is a critical tool for nonprofits and other \n     institutions nationwide. In particular, institutional \n     networks such as health care providers and institutions of \n     higher learning, as well as social service agencies and \n     community organizations use the Internet for communication, \n     organizing, and learning. The Internet is an increasingly \n     important tool that helps needy persons access the education \n     and services they need to improve their lives and the lives \n     of their families. In these difficult economic times, the \n     Internet is an essential tool for those seeking to get back \n     on their feet.\n       Not only are the open Internet rules important for those \n     the faith community serves, it is important for the religious \n     community itself. As the National Council of Churches \n     Communications Commission recently stated, Internet \n     communication is ``vital'' to faith groups to enable them to \n     communicate with members, share religious and spiritual \n     teachings, promote activities on-line, and engage people--\n     particularly younger persons--in their ministries. As the \n     resolution noted, ``Faith communities have experienced uneven \n     access to and coverage by mainstream media, and wish to keep \n     open the opportunity to create their own material describing \n     their faith traditions.'' Without robust open Internet \n     protections, our essential connection to our members and the \n     general public could be impaired. Communication is an \n     essential element of religious freedom: we fear the day might \n     come when religious individuals and institutions would have \n     no recourse if we were prevented from sharing a forceful \n     message or a call to activism using the Internet.\n       We are particularly concerned about the way Congress has \n     chosen to address this issue. Members of Congress have \n     already initiated action under the Congressional Review Act \n     to eliminate all open Internet protections. Even for \n     legislators who might not agree with every aspect of the \n     FCC's new rules, the proposed use of the Review Act is \n     extreme.\n       After many months of public hearings and reviewing \n     thousands of public comments, the FCC last December sought to \n     strike a balance between the needs of Internet providers and \n     the general public. The agency's compromise rules were \n     designed to guard against the most severe forms of abuse. The \n     result was a set of regulations that competing parties in the \n     industry and public sector were able to support. A number of \n     the new rules are critical to ensuring that all citizens can \n     gain access to high speed Internet.\n       Among other things, the new disclosure rules will make it \n     easier for low-income families to choose an Internet provider \n     at a price they can afford.\n       In addition to new policies, the rules adopted last year \n     reestablished a number of non-controversial common-sense FCC \n     policies, including protecting the right of an Internet user \n     to access any lawful Internet content. If the Review Act is \n     used to void the FCC regulations, not only would it restrict \n     the FCC's ability to protect Internet users in the future, it \n     would also dismantle even these limited and essential \n     protections put in place during the Bush Administration.\n       We hope that the House and Senate will reject the use of \n     the Congressional Review Act to overturn these important \n     rules. We hope that Congress will instead work to preserve \n     openness online, and to ensure that all people, particularly \n     people of faith, are able to take full advantage of the power \n     of the Internet.\n           Sincerely,\n         Andrea Cano, Chair, United Church of Christ, OC Inc.; \n           Rev.

Rockefeller, IV,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchinson,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Rockefeller, and Ranking Member Hutchinson: on \n     behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human \n     Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more \n     than 200 national organizations to promote and protect the \n     rights of all persons in the United States, along with the \n     undersigned organizations, we write to urge you to oppose the \n     use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA), S. J. Res. 6, to \n     repeal the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Open \n     Internet rules. Though the organizations represented by this \n     letter have taken different views on the Open Internet rules, \n     we are united in the view that congressional plans to \n     overturn these rules using the CRA would cause significant \n     harm, particularly to the constituencies represented by our \n     organizations, and divert attention from other critical media \n     and telecommunications issues that are so vital to our \n     nation's economic and civic life.\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\n       The CRA, 5 U.S.C. 801-808, is a blunt instrument. The terms \n     of the Act require complete repeal of the agency action in \n     question in a simple ``yes or no'' vote. For this reason, use \n     of the CRA would mean that critical long-established \n     protections will be repealed along with newer proposals \n     adopted for the first time in December. Use of the CRA would \n     eliminate the FCC's authority to enforce its reasonable Open \n     Internet principles, including those that prevent private \n     blocking of constitutionally-protected speech.\n       A free and open Internet is of particular concern to civil \n     rights organizations because the Internet is a critical \n     platform for free speech. It is also a tool for organizing \n     members and for civic engagement; a chance for online \n     education and advancement which is essential to economic \n     development and job creation; a means by which to produce and \n     distribute diverse content; and an opportunity for small \n     entrepreneurs from diverse communities who might not \n     otherwise have a chance to compete in the marketplace.\n       As you know, the FCC adopted Open Internet rules in \n     December after an extensive and detailed process. As a \n     result, the Commission for the first time adopted a set of \n     enforceable rules that many diverse parties agree will \n     protect against severe abuse, promote free expression on the \n     Internet, and encourage job-creating investment in broadband \n     networks. These rules include a number of non-controversial \n     commonsense policies, such as the right of a consumer to \n     reach any lawful content via the Internet while preserving \n     network providers' ability to manage their networks. The \n     rules adopted in December will help get all Americans online: \n     for example, consumers with low incomes will be better able \n     to select a service at a price they can afford under the \n     Commission's new transparency rules.\n       We also urge Congress and the Commission to move forward on \n     other critical media and telecommunications policy \n     initiatives. As we explained to the FCC last fall, we believe \n     it is critical for the Commission to renew its focus on \n     expanding broadband adoption among people of color; closing \n     the digital divide; extending universal service support to \n     broadband services; adopting provisions to protect consumer \n     privacy; and implementing the 21st Century Communications & \n     Video Accessibility Act of 2010.\n       In closing, we strongly urge you to oppose use of the \n     Congressional Review Act to repeal the Federal Communications \n     Commission's Open Internet rules. We also hope that Congress \n     and the Commission will move forward expeditiously to \n     implement the National Broadband Plan to expand deployment \n     and adoption of new technologies and high-speed Internet for \n     all Americans.

Jay Rockefeller,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science \n         and Transportation.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, Chairman Rockefeller, \n     and Ranking Member Hutchison: The American Library \n     Association (ALA), the Association of Research Libraries \n     (ARL), and EDUCAUSE respectfully ask you to oppose S.J. Res. \n     6 and any other legislation to overturn or undermine the \n     ``Net Neutrality'' decision adopted by the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) in December 2010.\n       ALA, ARL and EDUCAUSE believe that preserving an open \n     Internet is essential to our nation's educational \n     achievement, freedom of speech, and economic growth. The \n     Internet has become a cornerstone of the educational, \n     academic, and computer services that libraries and higher \n     education offer to students, teachers, and the general \n     public. Libraries and higher education institutions are \n     prolific generators of Internet content. We rely upon the \n     public availability of open, affordable Internet access for \n     school homework assignments, distance learning classes, e-\n     government services, licensed databases, job-training videos, \n     medical and scientific research, and many other essential \n     services. It is crucial that the Internet remains a ``network \n     neutral'' environment so that libraries and higher education \n     institutions have the freedom to create and provide \n     innovative information services that are central to the \n     growth and development of our democratic culture.\n       The following data points illustrate why open, non-\n     prioritized Internet access is so critically important to the \n     public that we serve:\n       a. 80% of college students live off-campus. Net neutrality \n     is vitally important so that these students receive the same \n     quality of access to web-based information as on-campus \n     students;\n       b. 97% of public two-year colleges have online distance \n     education programs;\n       c. 99% of public libraries provide patrons with access to \n     the Internet at no charge; in 65% of communities, public \n     libraries are the only provider of such access.\n       The attachment to this letter provides several specific \n     examples of critical Internet-based applications that our \n     communities have developed to serve students, teachers, the \n     elderly, the disabled and other members of the public. As \n     these examples demonstrate, libraries and higher education \n     increasingly depend on the open Internet to fulfill our \n     missions to serve the general public. Without an open and \n     neutral Internet, there is great risk that prioritized \n     delivery to end users will be available only to content, \n     application and service providers who pay extra fees, which \n     would be an enormous disadvantage to libraries, education, \n     and other non-profit institutions. In short, Internet Service \n     Providers (ISPs) should allow users the same priority of \n     access to educational content as to entertainment and other \n     commercial offerings.\n       The FCC's Net Neutrality decision last December was an \n     important step forward. The decision includes a non-\n     discrimination standard for wireline Internet services, and \n     it limits the opportunities for paid prioritization. The \n     FCC's decision also explicitly protects the rights of \n     libraries, schools, and other Internet users. While the FCC's \n     decision falls short in some other areas, particularly with \n     regard to mobile wireless services, the decision \n     appropriately requires ISPs to keep the Internet open to \n     educational and library content.\n       For these reasons, ALA, ARL and EDUCAUSE believe that the \n     FCC's decision should be upheld and it should not be \n     overturned by Congressional action. While the FCC's decision \n     can certainly be improved, we strongly believe that the FCC \n     should be able to oversee the broadband marketplace and \n     respond to any efforts by ISPs to skew the Internet in favor \n     of any particular party or user. The Internet functions best \n     when it is open to everyone, without interference by the \n     broadband provider. We urge you to uphold the FCC's authority \n     to preserve the openness of the Internet and to oppose any \n     proposal to overturn or undermine the FCC's Net Neutrality \n     decision.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n     Lynne Bradley,\n       American Library Association (ALA).\n     Gregory A.

A2IM members share the core \n     conviction that the independent music community plays a vital \n     role in the continued advancement of cultural diversity and \n     innovation in music at home and abroad, but we need your \n     help.\n       Of all the technological developments in recent history, \n     the Internet represents the most potent platform for \n     entrepreneurship and expression our community has witnessed. \n     Despite the many unresolved questions surrounding the \n     protection of intellectual property online, we remain \n     optimistic that open Internet structures are our best means \n     through which to do business, reach listeners and innovate in \n     the digital realm.\n       Independent labels would not fare well under any regime \n     that allows Internet traffic to be prioritized based on \n     business arrangements between ISPs and the largest corporate \n     entities, as our sector is not capable of competing \n     economically. This is why we have consistently gone on record \n     in favor of\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\n     clear, enforceable rules of the road for the Internet, \n     whether accessed on personal computers or mobile devices.\n       We are not convinced that the FCC's recent Order goes far \n     enough to preserve the dynamics that make the Internet such a \n     unique and promising marketplace for creative commerce. We \n     are particularly concerned about the lack of clarity in the \n     mobile space, as well as the possibility of our sector being \n     priced out of the most desirable online delivery mechanisms.\n       Nonetheless, it seems shortsighted for Congress to seek to \n     eliminate the FCC's ability to oversee this vital space, as \n     it is an essential part of a free market driven by \n     enterprise, ingenuity and competition. We therefore urge the \n     United States Senate to forego any attempt to stymie the \n     FCC's authority to preserve the underlying dynamic of the \n     Internet.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          The American Association\n     of Independent Music (A2IM).\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Future of Music Coalition,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2011.\n     Hon.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators, Since its inception, the internet has \n     represented a powerful tool for the exchange of information \n     and ideas. In recent years, it has also contributed greatly \n     to the emergence of novel platforms for the dissemination of \n     creative content. It is as members of the arts community who \n     have come to depend on these structures that we write to you \n     today.\n       Creators, in particular, depend on open internet structures \n     to engage in a variety of ways, including direct interaction \n     with audiences, fans and patrons, as well as collaboration \n     with other artists. From musicians to filmmakers to writers \n     to independent labels to arts and service organizations, \n     today's creative community depends on the internet to conduct \n     business and contribute to the rich tapestry that is American \n     culture.\n       Today's creators are taking advantage of technologies \n     fostered by the internet to deliver a diverse array of \n     content to consumers, while creating efficient new ways to \n     ``do for ourselves'' in terms of infrastructure. The access \n     and innovation inspired by the web helps us meet the \n     challenges of the 21st century as we contribute to local \n     economies and help America compete globally.\n       It hasn't always been so. Traditionally, the media \n     landscape relied heavily on hierarchical chains of ownership \n     and distribution, controlled by powerful gatekeepers such as \n     large TV and movie studios, commercial radio conglomerates, \n     major labels and so forth.\n       It would be tremendously disadvantageous to creative \n     entrepreneurship if the internet were to become an \n     environment in which innovation and creativity face \n     tremendous barriers to entry due to business arrangements \n     between a select few industry players.\n       This is why we support clear, enforceable and transparent \n     rules to ensure that competition and free expression can \n     continue to flourish online. Although many of us feel \n     strongly that the recent FCC Order does not go far enough in \n     its protections (particularly with regard to mobile broadband \n     access), we recognize the importance of having a process in \n     place by which concerns can be addressed and transparency \n     pursued.\n       We believe that Congress has a role to play in establishing \n     guidelines that preserve a competitive, accessible internet \n     where free expression and entrepreneurship can continue to \n     flourish. We also believe that stripping the FCC's ability to \n     enforce these core principles as proposed in S.J. Res. 6 runs \n     counter to the values shared by members on both sides of the \n     aisle, as well as prior and current FCC leadership. \n     Therefore, we strongly urge against a broad repudiation of \n     the Commission's Order.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fractured Atlas.\n     Future of Music Coalition.\n     National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller,\n     Chairman, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Rockefeller, and Ranking Member Hutchison: The below \n     signed organizations support an Open Internet and oppose S. \n     J. Res 6, legislation that would repeal the Federal \n     Communication Commission's (FCC) Open Internet rules through \n     the Congressional Review Act. Utilizing the Congressional \n     Review Act would not only eliminate the current FCC rules, it \n     would eliminate the FCC's ability to protect innovation, \n     speech, and commerce on broadband platforms on behalf of the \n     American people.\n       The Internet has been and must remain an open platform. \n     Regardless of political or social values, an Open Internet \n     increases opportunities for all persons and communities, \n     increases diversity of opinions and thought, and ensures that \n     consumers and entrepreneurs alike can engage in and benefit \n     from the opportunities afforded by access to the Internet. An \n     Open Internet is also an engine for economic growth, \n     innovation, and job creation.\n       The FCC has adopted a framework that the agency believes \n     will preserve the Open Internet. We wholeheartedly support \n     preservation of the FCC's authority to implement such rules. \n     This framework was adopted in a proceeding in which broadband \n     service providers, Internet companies, civil rights groups, \n     labor organizations, and public interest groups all \n     participated.\n       We urge Congress not to utilize the Congressional Review \n     Act, given the negative consequences of its enactment. \n     Instead, we hope that Congress will work to preserve openness \n     online and to move forward expeditiously in implementation of \n     the National Broadband Plan. Undertaking such initiatives \n     would improve broadband deployment and adoption opportunities \n     for all Americans, including individuals in typically rural \n     and other underserved populations and in communities of color \n     too often denied a meaningful opportunity to participate in \n     the new economy.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to ensure that all your \n     constituents can continue to benefit from an Open Internet, \n     and we stand ready to work with Congress to preserve an Open \n     Internet.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Access Humboldt; ACLU; AFL-CIO; Alliance for Community \n     Media; Alliance for Retired Americans; Applied Research \n     Center; Arizona Progress Action; Art is Change; Association \n     of Free Community Papers; Association of Research Libraries; \n     Bold Nebraska; Breakthrough.tv; CCTV Center for Media and \n     Democracy; Center for Democracy and Technology; Center for \n     Media Justice; Center for Rural Strategies; Center for Social \n     Inclusion; Coalition of Labor Union Women; Communications \n     Workers of America; Community Media Workshops.\n       Consumer Federation of America; Consumers Union; Democracy \n     for America; Durham Community Media; Esperanza Peace and \n     Justice Center; Evanston Community Media Center; Free Press; \n     Future of Music; Coalition; Global Action Project; Harry \n     Potter Alliance; Highlander Research & Education Project; \n     Houston Interfaith Worker Justice; Institute for Local Self \n     Reliance; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; \n     Keystone Progress; Labor Council for Latin American \n     Advancement; LAMP; Latinos for Internet Freedom; Latino Print \n     Network; League of United Latin American Citizens.\n       Line Break Media; Main Street Project; Media Access \n     Project; Media Mobilizing Project; Mid-Atlantic Community \n     Papers Association; NAACP; National Alliance for Media, Art, \n     and Culture; National Consumers League; National Hispanic \n     Media Coalition; National Latino Farmers and Ranchers Trade \n     Association; National Network for Immigrant and Refugee \n     Rights; Native Public Media; New America Foundation; Ohio \n     Valley Environmental Coalition; One Wisconsin Now; OnShore \n     Networks; Open Access Connections; Open Source Democczracy \n     Fund.\n       Participatory Culture Foundation; Peoples Press Project; \n     Peoples Production House; Philly CAM; Progress Now; Progress \n     Now Nevada; Progress Ohio; Prometheus Radio Project; Public \n     Radio Exchange; Reel Grrls; Southwest Organizing Project; \n     Southwest Workers Union; The Highlander Research & Education \n     Center; The Peoples Channel; The Praxis Project; The Writers \n     Guild of America; West UNITY Journalists of Color; Women In \n     Media & News; Youth Media Project.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, to be sure, there are those who \ndisagree with the FCC's open Internet rules, and there is an avenue for \nthese complaints. It is called the judicial system. Some are using it. \nTwo companies have filed lawsuit claiming that the FCC went too far. \nSeveral public interest groups have filed lawsuits claiming that the \nFCC did not go far enough. It is their legal right to go to the courts, \nand when they choose to do that, they can do so.\n  So let's think for a minute what a world would look like without a \nfree and open Internet.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, consumers and \nentrepreneurs would have no transparency as to how their broadband \nproviders would manage their network--no ability to make informed \ndecisions about their broadband providers.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, there would be nothing \nto prevent their broadband providers from steering them only their to \npreferred Web sites and services, therefore limiting their choices as \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\n  For rural Americans, broadband Internet access has the power to erase \ndistances and allows them to have the same access to shopping, \neducational matters, and employment opportunities as those living in \nurban areas. That is a time-honored principle around here--but not if \nthe Web site they seek to access is blocked by their broadband \nproviders. Consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses need the \ncertainty they can access lawful Web sites of their choice when they \nwant, period.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, there would be nothing \nto stop broadband providers from blocking access to Web sites that \noffer products that compete with those of its affiliates. That happens, \nMr. President.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, companies could pay \nInternet providers to guarantee their Web sites open more quickly than \ntheir competitors.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, companies could pay \nInternet providers to make certain their online sales are processed \nmore quickly than their competitors with lower prices.\n  Well, that is not the American way. This is particularly disturbing \nin tough times like these.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, there would be nothing \nto prevent Internet service providers from charging users a premium in \norder to guarantee operation in the ``fast lane.'' If someone is trying \nto start a small business, struggling to make ends meet and cannot \nafford to pay the toll, they run the risk of being left in the ``slow \nlane''--that is not good--with inferior Internet service--that is not \nright--unable to compete with larger companies. That is very wrong.\n  What if an innovator or a start-up company has the next big idea? \nWith broadband, the next big idea does not have to come from a suburban \ngarage or from Silicon Valley, it can come from rural America or from \nanywhere. A free and open Internet is all that is required to give that \nbig idea a global reach.\n  In a world without a free and open Internet, the ability of the next \nrevolutionary idea to reach others--to make it to the greater \nmarketplace--would be entirely dependent on a handful of entrenched \nbroadband gatekeepers and toll collectors. True.\n  I am not totally opposed to the Congressional Review Act, but I have \nto say it is an extraordinarily blunt instrument. It means all of the \nrules adopted by the FCC must be overturned at once. This would even \nmean tossing out commonsense provisions about transparency. Do our \nopponents know this? It would deny the agency the power to protect \nconsumers. Do our opponents know this? What is the sense in all of \nthat? I don't get it.\n  There is another part: If they just took these rules out--if S. Res. \n6 were to pass--they couldn't come back later and just have the FCC put \nthem in. We would have to go through a whole congressional legislative \nprocess to reinsert them into the Public Law, which means many of them \nwould never end up there.\n  I also want to address the argument of supporters of the joint \nresolution that the FCC's open rules will somehow stifle innovation in \nthe Internet economy. That is just so wrong I don't know what to say.\n  Over the past 15 years, the open Internet has been the greatest \nengine for the U.S. economy. It leaves everything in its dust. It has \ncreated more than 3 million jobs, as the Senator from Texas indicated. \nThe open Internet rules will help sustain this growth. People want to \nknow what the rules of the road are. They want to know what the world \nis bringing to them. If they decide they do not like what is coming, \nthey are going to tell you, and they are not going to invest. Very \nsimple.\n  According to Hamilton Consultants, the open Internet ecosystem has \nled to the creation of 1.8 million jobs related to applications in e-\ncommerce, as well as 1.2 million jobs related to infrastructure. \nMoreover, investment and innovation have continued to increase since \nthe adoption of the FCC's open Internet rules--not decrease, as the \nsupporters of this resolution will tell us.\n  The facts show that investment in broadband networks increased in the \nfirst half of 2011. In fact, investment in networks that support \nbroadband was more than 10 percent higher in the first half of 2011 \nthan in the first half of 2010. More of that investment in Internet \ncompanies surged in 2011, and this is after they had sort of adjusted \nor taken into account what they saw coming in the way of the rules. \nThere was $2.3 billion worth of investment going into 275 companies in \nthe second quarter, and all of them were this Internet type. That is \nthe most investment in Internet companies in a decade.\n  Plus, shortly after the framework was adopted, America's leading \nwireless providers announced they were accelerating their deployment of \ntheir advanced fourth generation, or 4G networks. It seems the open \nInternet rules are giving broadband providers and entrepreneurs and \ninvestors the certainty they need to invest and to create jobs.\n  Certainty is the key. They are not going to invest in what they do \nnot know. We see that in so many other areas. They do not know what is \ngoing to happen, so they do not invest. People have all this cash, but \nthey do not have certainty. Here they have certainty, they understand \nthat certainty, they understand what is coming, they like it, and they \nare investing like never before.\n  The FCC's open Internet rules also protect small businesses. An \nestimated 20,000 small businesses operate on the Internet. More than \n600,000 Americans have part- or full-time businesses on eBay alone. I \nwas not aware of that. The FCC's open Internet rules mean small \nentrepreneurs will not have to seek permission from broadband providers \nto reach new markets and consumers with innovative products and \nservices.\n  This is a very important point. It means small businesses can be \nlocated anywhere in this country, including rural America, and through \nopen broadband have the opportunity for their ideas and products and \nservices to have a global reach. That is the point of all of this.\n  As we all know, small businesses were responsible for nearly 65 \npercent of new jobs over the past 15 years. Far from preventing \ninvestment, the FCC's open Internet rules will foster small businesses \nbecause they trust it. They see it, they see what Moody's is saying \nabout it, they see what the Wall Street investment bankers are saying \nabout it, they see it is encouraging investment, and they like and \ntrust that. So they take risks they might not otherwise take because \nthey trust.\n  It is not the faceless Federal bureaucrat. It is something that is \ndown on paper and they understand it. They have probably seen it and \nprobably commented on it. Maybe some of them didn't like it as much as \nthey should have; maybe some thought it should have been stronger or \nsome thought it should have been weaker, but such is life in America. \nSo, anyway, I think what they conclude is that what is going on is \nsupporting what they are doing.\n  Finally, I want to note when it comes to education and privacy and \nintellectual property, global Internet governance, or network security, \nthe government has long provided--and necessarily so--reasonable rules \nof the road to make possible consumer protection, fair trade, and open \nmarkets. The FCC's open Internet rules are no different. They take, as \nhas been quoted by many, a light-touch approach--I like that phrase--\nand keep the playing field fair. They keep the Internet open and free \nfor consumers, for businesses, and for everyone in this country who \nwants access to broadband Internet.\n  So that is why I support the FCC open Internet rules, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to vote against the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on our side I have Senator Wicker and \nSenator Shelby, who have been here waiting, and I would like to give \nthem 15 minutes from the time on our side. I know there are others \nhere, but these Senators have been waiting for quite a while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that 15 minutes each or 15 minutes \ntogether?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Up to 5 minutes for Senator Wicker and up to 10 \nminutes for Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what would be the order after that?\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order after that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for the time I have--I think it is about 15 minutes--after \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter \nof this resolution of disapproval.\n  Once again, we are witnessing a government regulation we do not need. \nThere is a reason when we talk about today's economy that we talk about \nthe cost of government overreach. Unnecessary regulations put a wet \nblanket on job creation, and they work against getting our economy back \non track. This is a perfect example of the government standing in the \nway of growth and investment.\n  The Internet and its associated applications should be allowed to \ndevelop without excessive FCC redtape. The Internet owes a great deal \nof its rapid success to innovators and entrepreneurs who had the \nfreedom to imagine, to explore, and to create. With the FCC acting as a \ntraffic cop, this freedom will be compromised.\n  The subjective rules of the road, as laid out by the FCC, are a \nprescription for uncertainty within the industry. By handing over more \npower to a government agency, net neutrality rules slam the brakes on \npotential investment and new innovation. The ideas that should make our \nInternet faster, more secure, and better for consumers fall by the \nwayside. At the end of the day, the American consumer would suffer. The \nbroadband marketplace would simply offer fewer services, fewer devices, \nand less content to paying customers.\n  The FCC order reads that Internet providers ``shall not block lawful \ncontent, applications, services or non-harmful devices, subject to \nreasonable network management.'' It goes on to say that providers \n``shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network \ntraffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service.''\n  But the terms ``lawful'' and ``reasonable'' are not easily defined. \nUnder the order, what is lawful and what is reasonable would be \ndetermined by unelected bureaucrats. The FCC would rule as a de facto \npolice of the open and free Internet. The FCC would be the final \narbiter of what broadband service providers can and cannot do. Its \njudgments--not the market or the consumer--would determine how networks \nwould be managed. The FCC is claiming to have an authority that the \nAmerican public did not grant it.\n  The hands of the Internet service providers will be tied when the FCC \nhas this kind of power. Without being able to run their own networks, \nservice providers cannot maximize the online experience for the vast \nmajority of their customers. They are, in essence, prevented from doing \nwhat they were established to do.\n  Equally troubling is that the Commission's order is trying to fix a \nproblem that does not exist. Today's consumers have greater access to \nmore Internet services than ever before. Where is the problem? \nBusinesses have invested tens of billions of dollars in new broadband \ninfrastructure. Internet entrepreneurs continue to offer new services \nto broadband users. There is no economic justification for this \nunprecedented intrusion into the marketplace. Policy should benefit the \npublic, and these FCC rules do not.\n  In conclusion, we have seen this movie before, with regulation where \nregulation is not needed. Again, here we have a regulatory recipe that \nwould produce far-reaching and damaging effects. The current landscape \nhas allowed the Internet to grow exponentially. It is a free market of \ncompetition, productivity, and growth. The FCC's regulatory intrusion \nis completely unwarranted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senators from Texas and Mississippi and to say that I \nthink a lot of people probably mean well but are often misguided when \nthey say we are going to regulate this sector of the economy or we are \ngoing to regulate that.\n  The market, as you well know, is the driving force in our economy--\nnot just in the United States but worldwide. It is going to be the \nmarket that will decide what we do as far as job creation for our \npeople everywhere, and I believe the Internet is an example of, gosh, \nlet's don't overregulate it. Let it grow, let it do its job, and it \nwill.\n  I would also like to speak about some commonsense steps that Congress \ncan take right now to help our struggling economy. At a time when job \ngrowth is stagnant, Congress needs to lift the regulatory burden that \nis stifling capital formation. The Senate has before it several bills \nthat would help private businesses raise the capital they need to grow \nand to create jobs.\n  This is an issue that should enjoy the support of both Republicans \nand Democrats in the Senate. Access to capital, as the Presiding \nOfficer well knows, is what allows entrepreneurs to transfer new ideas \ninto living companies. Novel products, new services, and, most \nimportantly, good jobs can be created.\n  Unfortunately, overregulation has made it progressively harder for \nsmall businesses to access capital in this country. I will give some \nstatistics. They are clear.\n  In the 1990s, an average of 547 initial public offerings took place \neach year, compared with an average of just 192 per year after 1999. \nSmall initial public offerings now make up only 20 percent of the \ntotal. In contrast, they made up 80 percent of the total in the 1990s, \nwhen we were creating so many small jobs.\n  In addition, the number of new businesses being launched each year is \nfalling. In 2010, it was the lowest it has been since the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics started tracking the number in 1994.\n  The SEC has been slow to address these problems, even though it has \nthe authority to do so. The Chairman of the SEC has spoken of the need \nfor action, but we have not seen tangible results yet.\n  One year ago, one SEC Commissioner remarked:\n\n       My hope is that, as an agency, the Commission will move \n     beyond talking about small business capital formation and \n     will take concrete steps that actually foster it.\n\n  I believe we, the Senate and the American people, can no longer wait \nfor the SEC to do its job. The time has come for Congress to take \naction. Our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  The first thing I believe we should do to improve capital formation \nis to bring up for consideration several bipartisan bills that would \nimplement important regulatory reforms. One bill would modernize the \nSEC's regulation A, which was initially designed to make it easy for \nsmall businesses to access our capital markets. Unfortunately, \nregulation A is outdated and rarely used.\n  Another set of bills would raise the thresholds for reporting so \nsmall banks and small companies are not subject to burdensome SEC \nreporting requirements.\n  These bills would still leave investors protected and ensure that \npublic companies provide meaningful disclosure. Most important, \ninvestors would still be protected by the SEC's antifraud rules. These \nbipartisan bills represent a few steps we can take right now, but they \nare not comprehensive by any means.\n  Much more needs to be done to make sure registration requirements are \ntailored to the size and type of businesses. The existing one-size-\nfits-all approach means that small companies have to bear the same \ncosts that large companies do when they go public. These inequities \nneed to be addressed; it stifles job creation.\n  One would think that we could agree in the Senate on removing \nunnecessary restrictions on capital formation. Yet for the past 3 \nyears, the majority party has dramatically increased government \ninvolvement in the economy. They have imposed one costly mandate after \nanother on businesses. They have crowded out the private sector with \nmassive government programs, resulting in persistently high \nunemployment and stagnant economic growth.\n  Basically, I think it is time for a new approach. It is time to \nrevitalize the free markets in America. We can begin this effort by \ntaking these small steps to help entrepreneurs find the capital they \nneed to build their businesses and to create jobs.\n  I hope my Democratic colleagues will now do more than talk about \ncreating\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\njobs and that we can work on a bipartisan basis on these bills that \nhave bipartisan sponsorship to create jobs and join us here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is one of those times when, on the \nfloor of the Senate, we hear a proposal that people characterize as one \nthing, but it is, in fact, anything but what they are characterizing it \nas.\n  What I just heard the good Senator from Mississippi talking about: We \ndon't want to slam the brakes on development, he said. We don't want to \nhave the SEC intrusion.\n  So they are trying to say to the American people that they want to \nliberate the Internet, when, in fact, what they want to do is imprison \nthe Internet within the hands of the most powerful communications \nentities today to act as the gatekeepers who will control the ability \nof the Internet to do the very kind of development that brought us \nhere. What they are talking about, their concept, this CRA challenge is \nthat wolf in sheep's clothing. It is that simple. So I think colleagues \nneed to step back and think about how the Internet got to be what it is \ntoday when it was developed.\n  I know the Senator from West Virginia, the chairman of the committee, \nand I were members of the Commerce Committee back in the 1990s when we \nwrote the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and we thought we were pretty \nclever and we wrote a good act. Within 6 months of writing that act, it \nwas obsolete because all our conversation was about telephony at a \nmoment where, because of the Internet, the entire discussion was about \nto become about data transmission and the movement of information over \nthe Internet. That has never been fully revisited. But the reason we \nhave a Google today, the reason we have had this incredible development \nof Internet retail business, of all these Web sites, of Facebook, and \nso many more is because of the open architecture of access to that \nInternet--which, I would remind everybody in America, was created by \ngovernment money in government research. It came out of an effort to \ndevelop a communications system for our country in the case of nuclear \nwar. So we created, through DARPA, ARPA, research that produced this \ncommunications network. Then the private sector saw the opportunity, \nand a whole bunch of very creative people rushed in and made the \nInternet what it is today.\n  Overturning the rules, as the CRA proposes to do, would put the very \nopen architecture that has created this extraordinary agent of \ncommunication, of commerce, and family communication, and all these \nthings it has done for business, it would put it at risk and discourage \ninvestment in companies at the edge of the Internet that could be the \nnext Google or the next Amazon. Overturning these rules would actually \nhurt our competitiveness and economic growth and they would diffuse the \ncreative energy that has driven the Internet to be what it is today. \nBecause if we overturn what they are doing today, we take the reality \nof the Internet and we put it in the hands of the gatekeepers.\n  Everything that goes over the Internet today goes either through our \ntelephone at home or television or whatever, through cable, out of our \nhouse or the airwaves. But if we are not having an open architecture on \nthe Internet, then the people who control those access points can start \ndiscriminating about who gets access at what speed; and if they control \nwho gets access at what speed and begin to charge more for that, you \nbegin to have a profound impact on the ability of any business to \ndevelop and a profound impact on the access that consumers have come to \nanticipate with respect to the Internet.\n\n  Think about this. We are talking about neutrality. We are standing \nhere trying to defend neutrality. The other side is coming in here \ntrying to create a new structure where the process will be gamed once \nagain in favor of the most powerful. This is part of the whole debate \nthat is going on in America today, about the 99 percent who feel like \neverything is gamed against them and the system is geared by the people \nwho have the money and the people who have the power who get what they \nwant. That is what this debate is about.\n  The network neutrality rules the FCC has promulgated are based on the \nprinciples that everybody should support of promoting transparency of \nbroadband service operations, preventing the blocking of legal content \nand Web sites, and prohibiting discrimination of individuals, \napplications, and other Web sites. That is what we are for. This CRA is \nan effort to undo the FCC's ability to protect those principles.\n  Establishing those principles has actually brought about certainty \nand predictability to the broadband economy. It ensures that anyone can \ncreate a Web site, anyone can deliver an Internet-enabled service with \nthe certainty that is going to be made available to everybody else on \nthe Internet. Innovators now know they are not going to have to go ask \na big telephone company: Hey, Verizon, hey AT, will you guys please \nlet us have access so we can go do this thing? Oh, well, maybe we will \ndo that, but we are going to charge you in order to do that. They \ncompletely destroy the openness that is provided, this ability for \nanybody in America to sit in their home or school or somewhere and come \nup with an idea and innovate. That freedom to innovate, the freedom to \ninnovate is what has made the Internet the platform for economic and \nsocial development it is today, and a vote for the CRA is a vote to \nstifle that.\n  On the side of those favoring the FCC's action are venture \ncapitalists and the companies that have made the Internet what it is \ntoday, civil rights groups, civil liberties advocates, academics, \nscholars who have studied and testified to the virtues of open \nnetworks. Let me quote a few of them.\n  John Doerr is somebody whom many of us have come to know by virtue of \nhis business acumen and the legendary venture capitalist efforts he was \nengaged in. He was an early backer of Amazon, an early backer of \nGoogle, Electronic Arts, Netscape, and a number of other innovators \nwhose creations have driven the growth of the Internet. Here is what he \nsays:\n\n       Maintaining an open Internet is critical to our economy's \n     growth . . . and this effort is a pragmatic balance of \n     innovation, economic growth, and crucial investment in the \n     Internet.\n\n  Ray Ramsey, the president and CEO of TechNet, a national bipartisan \nnetwork of more than 400 technology sector CEOs, said of the vote at \nthe Commission in favor of the network neutrality rules:\n\n       The vote by the FCC is a pragmatic recognition of the need \n     for codifying principles for protecting nondiscrimination and \n     openness for the Internet.\n\n  Charlie Ergen, the president and CEO of Dish Network, said:\n\n       The Commission's order is a solid framework for protecting \n     the open Internet. The new rules give companies, including \n     Dish Network, the framework to invest capital and manpower in \n     Internet-related technologies without fear that our \n     investment will be undermined by carriers' discriminatory \n     practices.\n\n  Others supporting the order include the Communications Workers of \nAmerica, civil rights organizations, consumer advocates. In sum, those \nwho support the rules include those who fund the development of \nInternet companies, those who use the Internet, and advocates who favor \nopen discourse and debate. I think we in the Senate ought to listen to \nthe people who created it, the people who developed it, the people who \nare taking it to the next generation, and the people who use it.\n  The Los Angeles Times editorialized on Sunday in favor of the rules \nof the FCC, saying:\n\n       The agency's net neutrality rules are a reasonable attempt \n     to protect the innovative nature of the Internet and should \n     not be overturned.\n\n  Despite all of what I just said, some have made what I have called \nthe ``wolf in sheep's clothing'' argument, the false argument that \nnetwork neutrality rules regulate the Internet--that they actually \nregulate it--and this is an opportunity to keep it open and impose a \ncondition on innovators.\n  I don't know how asking innovators to get permission from somebody \nelse to be able to go do what they have already done since the 1990s is \ngoing to improve things. The truth is, network neutrality rules govern \nnot the Internet but they govern the behavior of the firms that own and \noperate the gateways to the Internet. That is what is at stake. When \nthe airwaves that carry\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nthe information that connects us to everyone else in the Internet is in \nthe hands of a few and subject to their control, we are in trouble.\n  The rules we are debating today state that those gateways should not \nbe used to favor some voices over others or some firms over others on \nthe Internet. That is what is at stake. That is what this fight is \nabout. The truth is, if the rules are overturned, every innovator on \nthe Internet will be exposed to the risk that, before they innovate, \nbefore they create a new product, they are going to have to go to \nsomebody and say: Mother, may I do this? Then there will be a price \nattached to it.\n  Beyond the false argument that network neutrality constitutes \nregulation of the Internet rather than anticompetitive behavior, \nopponents to the rule predicted the FCC action was going to have \nnegative economic repercussions. Yet even in an economy that has \nstruggled, that prediction has proven to be wrong.\n  In the time since the FCC voted on the rule to preserve the open \nInternet, investment in networks that support wired and wireless \nbroadbrand grew by more than 10 percent compared to the same period the \nyear before. Venture capital investments in Internet-specific companies \nsurged, with $2.3 billion going into 275 companies in the second \nquarter of 2011. It may well be that 2011 is going to be the biggest \nyear for tech IPOs in more than 10 years. That seems to indicate strong \ninvestor confidence in the companies that rely on the open Internet \nalready exists, and we should not disrupt that.\n  Having lost the argument that network neutrality hurts innovation or \nthe economy, they therefore want to create a new argument; that is, the \nFCC acted outside its legal authority in protecting the free flow of \ncommunication on the Internet.\n  A court, the right place for that decision to be made, is going to \nmake that decision. But, again, the argument actually challenges common \nsense. It challenges the basic understanding of reasonableness. To \nargue that the FCC, the agency that Congress created in order to \nregulate communications by wire and radio, somehow has no jurisdiction \nin this very space is to argue that communications over the Internet \nare not, in fact, conducted over a wire or over the airwaves. It is \ncompletely lacking in any foundation in common sense and certainly in \nthe law.\n  The law we created grants the FCC the authority in the \nTelecommunications Act to ``make such rules and regulations, and issue \nsuch orders, not inconsistent with this Act, as may be necessary for \nits functions.''\n  That is the power we gave to them. Under title II, title III, title \nVI of that act, it encourages the FCC to protect the public interest \nand encourage just and reasonable rates through competition. That is \nprecisely what net neutrality achieves. It is precisely what we achieve \nunder the rules of the FCC.\n  Under title VII, the FCC is mandated to take immediate action to \nremove barriers to infrastructure investment and promote competition in \nthe telecommunications market if advanced telecommunications is not \nbeing deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion. That can be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis, and we obviously can continue as we \nhave since the early 1990s to do this. So there is no good reason for \nthis debate to fall along party lines.\n  I hope it will not be just Democrats who vote to preserve this rule. \nI hope we will maintain an open Internet technology and support the \nopen Internet order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I know the Senator from Minnesota \nhas been waiting to speak, and I certainly will yield to him. I would \nlike to be recognized after he speaks to answer some of the concerns \nthat were raised by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from Texas. My understanding is that Senator Murkowski from \nAlaska is on her way down. I am scheduled to sit in the chair at 12, \nand I don't want to step on the opportunity of the Senator from Alaska \nto speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote against the motion to proceed to the joint resolution of \ndisapproval of Senator Hutchison, which would repeal the FCC's net \nneutrality rules.\n  As many of you know, I have repeatedly said net neutrality is the \nfree speech issue of our time. I still believe that is the case, and I \nam here to state why we need to do everything we can to stop this \npartisan resolution in its tracks.\n  But before I get into the reasons we should oppose this resolution, I \nthink it is important to step back and remember what the American \npeople expect of us. I do not need to tell anyone in this body that the \napproval rating of Congress is at an all-time low. Why is that? I think \nit has something to do with the fact that we are using our extremely \nlimited, valuable time to debate partisan proposals like this one \nrather than working together to create jobs, stimulate our economy, and \nget Americans back to work.\n  When this resolution of disapproval passed the House back in April, I \nhoped that would be the end of it. I hoped my colleagues would \nrecognize we should let agencies do their jobs and not employ an arcane \nprocedure to erase a rule the FCC started thinking about in 2004 under \nRepublican chairman Michael Powell, and again in 2005 when a different \nRepublican chairman, this time Kevin Martin, adopted a unanimous policy \nstatement on net neutrality.\n  When the White House issued a statement indicating the President \nwould veto this resolution of disapproval if it came to his desk, I \nthought my colleagues would be sensible and would recognize that this \nwas not only unnecessary and foolhardy, but it was also a pointless \nexercise and would be just a giant waste of everyone's time. Alas, that \nis not the case and here we are spending valuable time on two \nresolutions of disapproval when we should be turning to legislation \nthat will get our economy back up and running again.\n  I hope the votes we take tomorrow will send a strong message that we \nneed to stop these political stunts and work together to create jobs, \njobs, and more jobs.\n  But let's get to the substance of why I am standing here before you \ntoday. I am here today to talk about net neutrality. Net neutrality is \na simple concept. It is the idea that all content and applications on \nthe Internet should be treated the same, regardless of who owns the \ncontent or the Web site. This is not a radical idea. It certainly is \nnot a new one. We may not realize it, but net neutrality is the \nfoundation and core of how the Internet operates every day and how it \nhas always operated.\n  When scientists and engineers were creating the basic architecture of \nthe Internet, they decided they needed to establish some basic rules of \nthe road for Internet traffic. One of the fundamental design principles \nof the Internet was that all data should be treated equally, regardless \nof what was being sent or who was sending it. That is net neutrality. \nIt is the same principle we rely on every day when we use the Internet, \nand it is the same principle our phone companies must adhere to when \nthey connect our phone calls.\n  They did not discriminate based on what we say or whom we call, and \nthe founders of the Internet thought the same should be true about data \ntraveling across networks. Everything and everyone should be treated \nthe same.\n  This principle of nondiscrimination is baked into the DNA of the \nInternet. This is not radical or new. This is about having a platform \nthat is free and open to all, regardless of whether one is a big \ncorporation or a single individual and regardless of whether one pays a \nlot of money to speed up how fast their content gets to their \ncustomers. Net neutrality is what we all experience today when we log \non to our computers, and it is what we have always experienced since \nthe very beginning of the Internet.\n  I think it is important to focus on that point for a minute because \nour opponents are telling us something quite different--and they are \nwrong. Net neutrality is not about a government takeover of the \nInternet, and it is not about changing anything. Net neutrality and the \nrules the FCC passed are about keeping the Internet the way it is today \nand the way it has always been.\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\n  We take for granted that we can access Google's search engine as \neasily as we can access Yahoo or Bing or that Netflix videos download \nas easily as the videos our friends uploaded onto YouTube last night. \nWe expect that e-mails arrive at their destinations at the same speed \nregardless of who is sending them, and we take for granted that the Web \nsite for our local pizzeria loads as fast as the Web site for Dominos \nor Pizza Hut. That is one of the reasons I care so very much about this \nissue.\n  This is not just about freedom of speech, it is also about protecting \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs of all sizes. In my mind, net \nneutrality is and always has been about protecting the next Bill Gates \nand the next Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook and Microsoft do not need our \nhelp today, but the 20-year-old whiz kid working in his parents' garage \nto develop the app or software or Web site to revolutionize our lives \ndoes need net neutrality, and so does the small bookstore or local \nhardware store that wants their Web site to load just as fast as Amazon \nor Home Depot.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate talking about the beginnings \nof YouTube because it is such a powerful example of why we need to \nprotect net neutrality. When YouTube started, it was headquartered in a \ntiny space over a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco, \nCA. At the time, Google had a competing product, Google Video, that was \nwidely seen as inferior.\n  If Google had been able to pay AT or Verizon or Time Warner large \namounts of money to block YouTube or to make Google Video's Web site \nfaster than YouTube's site, guess what would have happened. YouTube \nwould have failed. But, instead, thanks to net neutrality, YouTube \nbecame the gold standard for video on the Internet. YouTube was able to \nsell its business to Google for $1.6 billion just 2 years after its \nstart. I love that story because it is a testament to the power of the \nInternet to turn people with great ideas into overnight successes, and \nit happened because we had net neutrality.\n\n  The story of the Internet is a story about the triumph of the little \nguy over the big, slow-moving corporation. The past 20 years are \nlittered with tales of entrepreneurs starting with next to nothing and \nrevolutionizing the world as we know it. From YouTube's humble \nbeginnings over a pizzeria to Facebook's infamous start in a dorm room \nin Cambridge, the Web-based products we use every day are a great \nresult of a great idea and the drive to make that great idea a reality.\n  Here is what we will not hear from our opponents: Facebook and \nYouTube and countless other Web-based products might not have existed \ntoday if it were not for net neutrality. Without net neutrality, \nMyspace or Friendster--remember them--could have partnered with Comcast \nto gain priority access or to block Facebook altogether. Blockbuster \ncould have paid AT to slow down or completely block streaming of \nNetflix videos. Barnes & Noble could have paid Verizon to block access \nto amazon.com. Imagine a world where the corporation with the biggest \ncheckbook can control what we see and how fast we access content on the \nInternet.\n  Fortunately, that is not the world we live in today and thanks to the \nFCC that is not the world we are headed for. The FCC's rules will \nensure that no matter how much money or power they have, a young kid \nworking in her parents' basement in Duluth can outinnovate the biggest \ncorporation simply because she has the best idea. This is exactly why \ntop Silicon Valley venture capital and angel investment companies \nsupport these rules. These companies are the ones funding the next Mark \nZuckerberg, Larry Page or Sergey Brin so he can get his product off the \nground. They are the ones funneling millions and millions of dollars to \nentrepreneurs, which is why I think we should listen to them. The CEOs \nof eBay, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube have joined in a letter \nsupporting the FCC's rules. They say: ``Common sense baseline rules are \ncritical to ensuring that the Internet remains a key engine of economic \ngrowth, innovation and global competitiveness.''\n  I think we should listen to them and companies such as Microsoft, \nYahoo, Google, IBM, and Qualcomm. These companies also support the \nFCC's rules because they recognize they could not have grown to be the \ntremendously successful companies they are today without a free and \nopen Internet, and that is what we are asking for. That is all we are \nasking for.\n  When our opponents get up and tell us these rules will stifle \ninnovation and halt growth, I want everyone to think about what they \nare saying. I want us to ask ourselves: Why would so many of the \nleading technology companies over the last two decades support what the \nFCC is doing if they think it will hurt innovation? It doesn't make any \nsense because it isn't true. Net neutrality and the FCC rules will \nprotect the innovators and entrepreneurs who have made the Internet \nwhat is it today and what it will be tomorrow.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to the experts from Bank of \nAmerica, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, and \nRaymond James. These companies have all stated they do not believe the \nFCC's current rules will hurt investment. Citibank said the FCC's rules \nwere ``balanced,'' and Goldman Sachs said they were ``a light touch'' \nand created ``a framework with a lot of wiggle room.''\n  What is even more telling is that investment in networks that support \nwired and wireless Internet has jumped since the announcement of the \nFCC's rules. In fact, investment is more than 10 percent higher in the \nfirst half of 2011 than in the same period last year. Venture capital \nfirms poured $2.3 billion into Internet-specific companies in the \nsecond quarter of 2011. I think these numbers speak for themselves. \nThey tell a story of surging investor confidence following the FCC's \nvote on these rules and not the doomsday portrayal we will hear from \nour opponents.\n  Protecting innovation in this country is particularly important given \nthe state of the telecom industry today. I don't need to tell you that \ntelecom corporations have grown larger and fewer. We know, in part, \nbecause we have seen our cable, Internet, and telephone bills rising \nand rising. What else have we seen? Customer service that has gone \nstraight out the window. When we are angry we wasted another day \nwaiting for a Comcast repairman to come and install a cable Internet \nline in our house or we have been put on hold by Verizon for the fifth \ntime in a single call and we finally decide to switch companies, we may \nrealize we don't have another choice.\n  Seventy percent of households in this country have one or two choices \nfor basic broadband Internet service. The majority, 60 percent, of the \nhouseholds only have one choice for high-speed broadband.\n  This is appalling for many reasons. It affects prices, quality of \nservice, and choices for customers, but it is ultimately why we need \nnet neutrality. We need to make sure companies play by the rules. As \ncontrol of the Internet has shifted into the hands of a smaller and \nsmaller number of corporations, we need to make sure those companies \nare able to dictate the speed of traffic based on how much a content \nprovider can pay or prioritize their own content over other companies' \ncontent.\n  Of course, as I said before, there is nothing wrong with maximizing \nshareholder profit since that is what corporations are obligated to do. \nMinnesota is home to many great corporations, including 3M, General \nMills, and Medtronic. These companies create thousands of jobs and \nproduce fantastic products. Other corporations should not be able to \nprevent others from competing. Competition is what net neutrality is \nall about. It is about ensuring that the next breakthrough product has \nthe opportunity to reach consumers through a free and open and equal \nInternet.\n  In addition to protecting innovation and small businesses in this \ncountry, net neutrality is also about speech. The Internet is not just \nwhere we go to shop for local products and services; the Internet is \nwhere we go to find political campaign information and read local news \nstories. The Internet is what helped fuel the Arab Spring, in large \npart because it has become the soapbox of the 21st century. Organizers \nand advocates are no longer stapling posters to bulletin boards to get \ntheir message out there. They are now posting their message on Twitter \nand Facebook. The\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\nInternet is not just responsible for an upheaval in how campaigns and \nadvocacy occur; it is also responsible for an upheaval in the print \nmedia world because the Internet is also the printing press and library \nof the 21st century.\n  This is why it is so important we make sure the corporations \nproviding Internet service play by the rules and are not able to profit \nby speeding up or slowing down our access to certain news Web sites or \nother places we go to access information. We would not want the Libyan \nGovernment to shut down access to Facebook in the middle of protests in \nthat country for the same reasons we do not want a corporation \ncontrolling what information and Web sites we are able to access in \norder to benefit their bottom line.\n  You know I have been a proponent of net neutrality for a long time. \nYou have heard me over and over on how net neutrality is about keeping \nthe Internet the way it is. But the truth is, the FCC rules, while a \nstep in the right direction, are very conservative. I wish the FCC had \ndone more, but the FCC wanted to reach a consensus, and they made a \nconcerted effort to address many concerns of telecommunication \ncompanies, large and small, when they drafted these rules. For my \nopponents to now claim the FCC ignored public opinion or failed to \nconsider the impact these rules would have on businesses is not true.\n  First, I think we could all stand a bit of history on the bipartisan \nnature of this rule. Net neutrality is something that two Republican \nchairmen of the FCC, Michael Powell and Kevin Martin, championed in \n2004 and 2005. Chairman Powell first articulated a set of net \nneutrality principles and Chairman Martin, 1 year later, achieved \nunanimous Commission endorsement of the FCC's open Internet policy \nstatement.\n  In 2006, 11 House Republicans voted in favor of net neutrality on the \nfloor. The Gun Owners of America, the Christian Coalition, and the \nCatholic Bishops joined with the ACLU, moveon.org and leading civil \nrights groups to advocate for the same principles for openness and \nfreedom on the Internet.\n  This debate started 7 years ago, and only after reviewing more than \n100,000 public comments and holding 6 public workshops did the \nCommission finally issue a rule. To claim this was premature, rushed or \nnot carefully considered is just plain wrong. I also think it is \ncompletely inaccurate for my opponents to claim the Commission never \nanalyzed the costs and benefits to this rule.\n  In fact, there is an entire section of the rule entitled ``The \nBenefits of Protecting the Internet's Openness Exceed the Costs.'' I \nurge my colleagues to read this section of the Commission's order. It \ncovers four pages. It contains over 25 lengthy, detailed, analytical \nfootnotes. It is clear the Commission considered the costs and benefits \nof acting, and they concluded that ``there is no evidence that prior \nopen Internet obligations have discouraged investment,'' and that \n``open Internet rules will increase incentives to invest in broadband \ninfrastructure.''\n  I recognize that a couple companies are challenging the FCC's rules \nin court, and they have every right to do so. But this resolution of \ndisapproval amounts to little more than political gamesmanship from \nfringe organizations. I think it is important to know that not a single \nlarge telecommunication company supports this resolution of \ndisapproval. They are not wasting their time with an arcane process, \nand we should not either. That is not to say Congress cannot and should \nnot have a discussion about the merits of net neutrality. We can and we \nshould.\n  Frankly, I have been disappointed by the quantity of misinformation \nthat has been such a large portion of this debate in the past.\n  The rhetoric I heard during the House debate last April was \ndisappointing. It is not the type of debate Americans deserve. I \nencourage a frank and in-depth discussion on net neutrality. I hope one \nday soon we will consider making a statutory change to the FCC's \nauthority that will clarify that we want the FCC to make sure the \nInternet stays open and free. That will put the issue to rest for good. \nIt is, frankly, the process we should be relying on. By forcing an up-\nor-down vote through the Congressional Review Act, we are short-\ncircuiting the normal legislative process and ignoring the FCC's \ntremendous work on this issue.\n  This resolution of disapproval is a procedural stunt that wastes \nlimited time which should be used to address the real problems \nAmericans face every day. At the end of the day, the problems of \nAmericans are why we are here. I love hearing from Minnesotans, and I \ngot a great e-mail the other day. The letter was from a group of five \nself-proclaimed ``highly-credentialed computer geeks,'' including a \nprofessor, a startup founder, an ex ``Google-er'' and a ``non-ex-\nIBMer.'' In their e-mail they wrote:\n\n       The free market will drive innovation in the Internet, but \n     careful regulation is needed to preserve the freedom of the \n     markets from coalitions of companies that will seek to reduce \n     competition.\n\n  They noted:\n\n       History promises that the leading companies will work \n     together to create a monopoly that they can control so they \n     can make more money and . . . disrupt innovation.\n\n  I am glad they and thousands of Minnesotans have taken the time to \nwrite and call to tell me how much preserving net neutrality means to \nthem. These highly credentialed computer geeks are right: The free \nmarket will drive Internet innovation as long as that market is truly \nfree and open--free from corporate control and open to all content \nproviders equally.\n  These constituents and millions of Americans don't want Congress \nengaged in political sparring matches designed to appease a few vocal \ncritics. Americans, entrepreneurs, and small businesses want a world \nwhere the future Twitters, eBays, and Amazons of the world can grow and \nthrive, without interference from big mega conglomerates.\n  If passed, this resolution will hurt consumers, stifle innovation, \nand create uncertainty in one of America's most innovative and \nproductive sectors. We are at a pivotal moment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize this and join me in voting down this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me to speak during this \ntime, and I thank the Presiding Officer for holding the chair while I \nhave been speaking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, there is a lot of discussion, of \ncourse, about jobs in this country--where they are, and what we can do \nto help incent them. I had the opportunity while I was in my State last \nweek to host three different townhalls that focused on the state of our \nNation's economy and what is happening with jobs and job creation. As I \nasked Alaskans for their input, what I heard consistently from \ncommunity to community was: We can allow for job creation that is \nmeaningful. We can allow for opportunities here in our State and across \nthe country. But the first thing you can do is to get the government \nout of the way. That was probably my biggest takeaway out of the \ntownhalls with Alaskans: Get the government out of our way so we can \nmove forward as small business owners and operators, as those who are \nlooking to advance jobs in resource development. Move the government \nback, and we can make some things happen.\n  I think one of the key ways we can create real jobs is by moving the \nFederal Government out of the way of the private sector. Yet this \nadministration is doing exactly the opposite. Our economy struggles to \ngrow and many Americans, of course, are out of work, but what we are \nseeing out of the White House is this effort that essentially buries \njob creators under a mountain of paperwork and regulations. Businesses \nwaste hours and productivity on checking the right boxes and making \nsure they have filled out the right form in the right way, rather than \ncreating new opportunities for employees. Far too often, our small \nbusinesses are being judged by how well they keep their safety records \nrather than the actual safety records themselves: Did you check the \nright box? Did you fill out the right form? If you didn't, we are going \nto fine and penalize you. But is the focus on making sure they have a \nstrong and sound safety record?\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\n  Many of the regulations--and, unfortunately far too many coming from \nthe EPA--unnecessarily raise the cost of energy and other vital goods \nand services. I, as the ranking member on the Energy Committee, have \nspent a lot of time and a lot of focus on what we are doing in this \ncountry to help reduce our energy costs. Unfortunately, far too often \nwe are seeing increased costs to our families and to our businesses \nbecause of the regulations that come at them. While we all support \nresponsible environmental regulation--I want EPA to do its job--we also \nwant to protect other vital national interests such as affordable and \nreliable energy and a strong economy.\n  Remember too that unreliable or unduly expensive energy has broad \nnegative impacts on all aspects--public health--all aspects of our day. \nWhen I hear from Alaska's business owners, they say two things. I told \nmy colleagues what the first one was, which is get government out of \nthe way, and let us get to work. Business owners across the country \nagree--there was a Gallup poll last month--small business owners \nindicated that complying with government regulations is the most \nimportant problem they face today. The No. 1 issue on the minds of \nsmall business owners is the fact that complying with government \nregulations is burying them. What we hear from businesses is that they \nneed the regulatory agencies to follow the rule of law and strike a \nproper balance between the many important national interests our laws \nprotect.\n\n  When it comes to regulation, in my opinion, this administration has \ngone further--they have pushed past that rule of law in striking that \nproper balance. What we are seeing is a level of overreach, which I \nthink is unprecedented, by the agencies reaching out and expanding \ntheir jurisdiction, if you will, and setting policy as opposed to \nimplementing the laws that have been passed.\n  The resolutions of disapproval we will have before us for a vote \ntomorrow--Senator Paul's resolution on the cross-State air pollution \nand Senator Hutchison's resolution of disapproval as it relates to the \nInternet--are both incredibly important for the issues they raise but \neven more so speaking to what we are seeing right now with agency \noverreach. As the Chair may recall, last year I led an effort on this \nfloor to push back against the EPA in an area where the EPA was, for \nall intents and purposes, setting policy when it came to greenhouse gas \nemissions in this country. I strongly and firmly believe the role of \nthe agencies is to implement the laws we have passed, not to set \npolicy. So I share the concerns Senator Hutchison and Senator Paul have \nraised with the two rules that are at issue today. They are utilizing a \ntool under the Congressional Review Act which allows us as a Congress \nto step in when Federal agencies go overboard with trying to make \nbusinesses comply with costly regulations, in effect, that overreach.\n  Let's first discuss very briefly Senator Paul's resolution of \ndisapproval regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's cross-State \nair pollution rule. I have seen it referred to as the acronym CSAPR or \n``zapper,'' but because neither one of those sounds like anything we \ncan relate to, I will refer to it as the cross-State pollution rule. \nThis rule should not go forward at this time for a number of reasons, \nnot the least of which is its potential impact on electric reliability. \nIndependent grid operators and the independent professionals whom we \ncount on to assess electric reliability have expressed concerns about \nsubjecting generators of electricity to the rule, especially on the \ncurrent timetable they are dealing with. The EPA simply needs to take \nanother look at those impacts and what this rule will do to electricity \ncosts.\n  There have been a number of independent studies that have pointed to \nthe impact of EPA's rules generally, including the cross-State \npollution rule and what that impact would be on existing electric \ngeneration capacity. The predictions differ on magnitude but project \nthe retirement of as much as 8 percent of the Nation's installed \nelectric generating capacity. Again, I will grant you, there is a range \nof difference here, but potentially as much as 8 percent of our \ncountry's installed generating capacity could be brought offline. That \nis significant. I have asked for a reliability analysis. We have gone \nback and forth in terms of getting that assessment. There will be a \ntechnical conference at the end of the month that hopefully will lead \nto a better understanding, but the long and the short of it is right \nnow, we know that we don't know exactly how much could be impacted by \nthis rule and others.\n  More specifically, the rules generally and the cross-State pollution \nrule alone could lead to more intense regional impact. Texas, for \nexample, wasn't even included in the proposed rule but, as a \nconsequence of the final rule, could see some very significant \npowerplant retirements and hence potentially significant adverse impact \non reliability. The Midwest, according to the grid operator there, \ncould also see retirements of electric capacity with attendant \nchallenges for keeping the lights on.\n  In addition to the reliability impact, there is also going to be a \ncost impact. The cross-State pollution rule is the first of a number of \npending rules to go final and the EPA has made some major changes \nbetween that proposed rule and the final rule. The agency has even \nproposed significant technical adjustments as recently as last month, \neven though the rule is slated to go final by the beginning of this \nnext year.\n  Putting aside the merits of the corrections--and I understand they \ndon't go far enough--the EPA should be sent back to the drawing board \nto learn more, understand more about the potential reliability impact, \nand then should amend the substantive requirements of the cross-State \npollution rule so that those required to comply can comply. If EPA had \nlooked carefully at that time-reliability issue in the first place, \nthere probably wouldn't be reason for the delay, but they acted in \nhaste, and haste makes waste.\n  I wish to speak quickly to Senator Hutchison's resolution of \ndisapproval regarding the FCC net neutrality rule. The rule put into \nplace by the FCC in 2010 circumvents Congress. It assumes an authority \nthat this body never consented to. We cannot allow the executive branch \nto go down this road. We just should not allow it. No provision of any \nstatute explicitly gives the FCC the authority to impose these sweeping \nrules on the Internet. In fact, section 230 of the Communications Act \nmakes it the policy of the United States ``to preserve the vibrant and \ncompetitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and \nother interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State \nregulation.'' The Internet, we would all agree--I heard the comments of \nthe Senator from Minnesota--has been a huge boon for small businesses \nand jobs throughout our country. We recognize that. We want to ensure \nit continues in that way.\n  To quote FCC Commissioner McDowell from a Wall Street Journal op-ed:\n\n       Net-neutrality sounds nice, but the web is working fine \n     now. The new rules will inhibit investment, deter innovation \n     and create a billable-hours bonanza for lawyers.\n\n  So unless the administration is trying to create jobs for lawyers, I \ndon't find any justification to expand the government's reach to \nregulate the Internet as the FCC proposes. Once again, what we are \nseeing is an agency stepping in to regulate in an area where the laws \nsimply did not contemplate.\n  For all of these reasons, and because the Federal Government needs to \nstop overburdening our country with costly regulations at a time when \nwe can least afford it, I support the resolution of disapproval from \nSenator Hutchison as well as the resolution of disapproval from Senator \nPaul.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on the Hutchison \nresolution that, as the Presiding Officer said very eloquently, would \noverturn the decision of the Federal Communications Commission on what \nhas come to be known as net neutrality. The bottom line for me is \nstraightforward. A vote for the Hutchison resolution will enable a \nhandful of special interests to occupy the Internet. These elites will \nthen have the power to crowd out the voices for change and the ideas of \nthe future. The Internet\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nwould become a glidepath for a relatively small number of people to \ngain enormously rather than an opportunity for all Americans to \nprosper.\n  I think some of the ideas that have been offered up with respect to \nthe Hutchison resolution just defy the facts. For example, we had some \ndiscussion about section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. I wrote \nthat section. It was a key development, in my view, in the growth of \nthe Internet because it gave us a chance to deal with smut and some of \nthe junk families have been so upset with without squelching the \npotential for the net. It enabled content sharers to grow, ever since \nwe struck that thoughtful approach, rather than just go to a censorship \nregime. I have heard that somehow net neutrality would undo that \nparticular provision. Nothing could be further from the truth. Net \nneutrality is exactly about what I sought to do in section 230 of the \nCommunications Decency Act, which was to make sure that all voices \ncould flourish--not just the voices of a few but all voices could \nflourish.\n  If anybody wants to talk a bit more about section 230 in the \nCommunications Decency Act, I am happy to have that discussion, but as \nthe author of that provision, it is something I and a lot of other \npeople who have worked in this field have felt was essential to the \ngrowth of the Internet, and we share that view just as we believe that, \nas the Presiding Officer does, net neutrality is critical to the growth \nof the Internet in the years ahead because the fundamental principles \nthat underlie both section 230 and net neutrality are the same.\n  The debate about the Federal Communication Commission's decision goes \nright to the heart of what the Internet is all about. It has always \nbeen a platform where all the actors are equal, where everybody has \nthat opportunity, as the Presiding Officer suggested, at the American \ndream. It is a place where, whether it is one dissenting voice \nscreaming out for democratic change or one brilliant idea that forever \nchanges the way that people and society organize, everyone has that \nopportunity.\n  I chair the Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade. I \nthink just one example of what we have seen is the Internet is going to \nbe the shipping lane of the 21st century. This is the way societies are \ngoing to organize. This is the way people are going to come together. \nThis is the way business is going to be conducted. Basically, net \nneutrality protects everybody's access to that shipping lane. It is not \njust going to be a place for the old-world business model. You bet the \nold-world business models are threatened by net neutrality. I \nunderstand that. I understand they are threatened by it. They have \nalways been able to count on big, powerful, and well-connected \ninterests and organizations to help them to dominate industry, and the \nInternet overturned that kind of thinking because it is the equalizer, \nit is the democratizer.\n  It just seems to me that when we open our morning newspaper day after \nday and see that the hope of the country is in innovation, in startups, \nin new ideas--it is not just in Silicon Valley, it is all over the \ncountry and all over the world--the last thing we want to do here in \nour country is adopt rules that would retard that development. And my \nview is that the power of the Internet--the network--is best utilized \nwhen content can move freely through it, and that is whether it is free \nfrom taxes, from liability, and certainly free from the kind of \ndiscrimination that would be allowed if the net neutrality rules were \noverturned.\n  Again, I touched on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and \nwhy that was so important to the growth of the net and why I think net \nneutrality is consistent with that. It is the same with respect to some \nother legislation in which I have been heavily involved.\n  I had the privilege of being one of the coauthors of the Internet Tax \nFreedom bill. What that was all about was trying to protect the \nInternet from discrimination--not all taxes altogether but \ndiscrimination. That, too, is a fundamental principle of the net \nneutrality rules, is trying to make sure the net is not going to be \nsingled out by a handful of special interests who could, in effect, \ndevise what amounts to their own lanes on the Internet and force \neverybody else to pay for it.\n  So despite what may even be the interests of some of these powerful \ninterest groups--and I know they are all saying now that they have no \nintent to discriminate against content over their networks. History \nshows that they cave every time when shareholders come and say: Look, \nyou have to take this step to generate a profit. I think the Internet \nis too important to leave those kinds of decisions vulnerable to what \nis inevitably going to be the cry from shareholders and others to \nmaximize profits.\n  One last point, if I might. I see other colleagues waiting to speak. \nI think the Internet and the economy in this country that is driven by \nthe Internet represent perhaps our greatest comparative advantage. I \ntouched on the Internet being the shipping lane of the 21st century. \nYou know, what I want us to do is enhance the American way, enhance \nAmerican values, and use the Internet to promote those values, \nfacilitate speech, and expand the marketplace.\n  The reality is that the American brand is something very special, \nvery special all over the world. The fact is, we have small businesses, \nand we heard from them in hearings. I know the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee is here, Senator Rockefeller, and others. \nHardly a day goes by that I don't wish I was back being a member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee because it is such an important committee, it \ndoes such important work. We saw in some of those first hearings on the \nInternet--we started looking at taxes and regulation and liability and \nthe Communications Decency Act--we saw how small businesses that really \ncould operate only in a relatively small area for years and years \nsuddenly, after they paid their Internet access charges, could go \nwherever they want, when they want, how they want, and they were equal \nto the most powerful groups and voices in the country. That is their \nopportunity. That is their chance to get their brand all over the \nworld.\n\n  We ought to make sure we take no action that is going to make it \nharder for small entrepreneurs to exchange their goods and services far \nbeyond their communities. We ought to be making judgments that allow \nthem to get into every nook and cranny of the world with the American \nbrand.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this resolution. I believe the \nInternet has thrived precisely because of the principles of net \nneutrality. It has contributed to the American economy and to job \ncreation because consumers ultimately get to see and get what they want \nas quickly as they want it.\n  It is going to be an important vote. I heard the Presiding Officer \nsay that this was something of an issue for geeks, and from time to \ntime, people have said I am one of those. But I will tell the Presiding \nOfficer, I think ultimately the net is not about geeks, it is about \ndemocracy. This is the great democratizer. This is the trampoline that \nprovides opportunities to people without power and clout.\n  I want to say to colleagues, particularly those who have mentioned \nsection 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as the author of that \nparticular provision--and Senator Rockefeller remembers this huge \noutcry about smut. We were all concerned about smut at that time. And \nwe said: There is a choice. We can either do, with respect to this \ndebate, what makes sense for the future, and that is empower families \nand parents to get these filters so the Internet can grow and we can \nfight smut in a practical way, or we can do a lot of damage and come up \nwith some sort of censorship regime.\n  As colleagues remember, essentially both approaches were included in \nthe bill, and the approach that mandated censorship was struck down. \nFreedom won. The principles of net neutrality won in that first big \nbattle fighting smut 15 years ago. If we were to undo the decisions of \nthe Federal Communications Commission and move back to the days when \nyou could talk about discriminating, you know, against the Internet, I \nthink it would be a step against all the progress we have made in the \nlast 15 years with respect to oversight and regulation and taxes.\n  This is an important vote, colleagues. When you read the morning \nnewspaper and you see that it is the\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nentrepreneurs and the startups and the innovators who are providing the \npath forward in a very difficult economy, I think you will see that the \npolicies we have laid out for the last 15 years, whether it is the \nCommunications Decency Act, whether it is other legislation--Chairman \nRockefeller remembers when we wrote the digital signatures law in the \nCommerce Committee--these votes, these laws have all become law because \nthey essentially were built on the very same principles of net \nneutrality, and that is freedom for all and a democratic Internet to \nprovide opportunity to all Americans and not just the elites, not just \na handful of special interests.\n  I commend Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Franken for their good \nwork.\n  I often agree with Senator Hutchison. This is not one of those \nopportunities.\n  I hope my colleagues, when we have this vote on the extraordinarily \nimportant resolution involving net neutrality, will vote against the \nHutchison resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 79 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support \nSenator Hutchison and to talk about this role that is being played now \nby the Federal Communications Commission in terms of regulating the \nInternet for the very first time.\n  I oppose having these bureaucrats regulating the Internet. I support \nthe resolution of disapproval that is now on the Senate floor.\n  In the 2008 Presidential campaign, then-Candidate Obama made it very \nclear that he was for empowering Washington's bureaucracy through more \nredtape. The President was not looking to make Washington more \nefficient, in my mind, or more effective, but to make Washington \nbigger, to centralize power in Washington. One of his campaign promises \nwas a new regulation called net neutrality. It appears to me that the \nPresident then appointed one of his school friends and basketball \nbuddies to be Chairman of the FCC, possibly with this in mind.\n  So here we are in 2011, and it seems to me that Congress is now being \nasked to make a decision. I want Congress--I am asking Congress and my \ncolleagues to reverse the course of the bureaucracy.\n  The administration did not even deem this rule to be what they call \nsignificant.\n  A significant rule is one that has an impact on the economy of at \nleast $100 million. I believe this is a significant rule. I support \nSenator Hutchison in her resolution because it will keep the Internet \nfree and open.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree. Earlier this year, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a similar resolution and it had bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Net neutrality is very real. The time to act is now. We will be \nvoting in the next day or so, and the reason we need to act now is that \nthe rules of having more bureaucratic government control go into effect \nin just a few weeks--November 20, 2011.\n  It does seem Congress is being disregarded. Congress has never \ndelegated authority to the FCC to regulate in the past.\n  The Communications Act of 1996 had a goal, which was to ``promote \ncompetition and reduce regulations.'' In 1996, Bill Clinton was \nPresident. This is what it said--the Communications Act of 1996: The \ngoal, to ``promote competition and reduce regulation.''\n  Instead, we have unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, who are \nignoring Congress and voting for regulation of the Internet.\n  Let's look at the overall economy. Right now, we have 14 million \nAmericans who are out of work. The number again this month is 9 percent \nunemployment in this country. The administration is now making it a \npriority--a priority--to regulate another sector of our economy over \njobs.\n  The FCC has opened the door for Washington bureaucrats to take over \none-sixth of our economy. They ought to be focusing on creating jobs, \nmaking it easier and cheaper for the private sector to create jobs. But \nbetween health care, banking, and now technology, this administration \nis taking over our economy sector by sector and making it more \nexpensive and harder for the private sector to create jobs.\n  The FCC's actions threaten innovation and investment in America. \nRegulations are the biggest burden being faced by small businesses in \nthis country today. If you don't believe me, just ask them. The polling \nof small business owners has said it is regulations coming out of \nWashington that are their biggest burden today.\n  Technology pioneer and Apple cofounder Steve Jobs warned President \nObama about Washington redtape. There is a new biography out about him \nby Walter Isaacson. He said this:\n\n       [Jobs] described [to Obama] how easy it was to build a \n     factory in China, and said that it was almost impossible to \n     do these days in America, largely because of regulations and \n     unnecessary costs.\n\n  This rule we are looking at transfers the future of the Internet out \nof the hands of the American people, and it makes government the \ngatekeeper of Internet services.\n  Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker said this:\n\n       The rules will give government, for the first time, a \n     substantive role in how the Internet will be operated and \n     managed.\n\n  This means the future of Internet technology--whether on a \nsmartphone, iPad or computer--will be in the hands of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  Engineers and entrepreneurs will not be able to give us the Internet \nwe want, at a price we want.\n  Former FCC Commissioner Baker also said:\n\n       By replacing market forces and technological solutions with \n     bureaucratic oversight, we may see an Internet future not \n     quite as bright as we need, with less investment, less \n     innovation and more congestion.\n\n  No American wants that, but that is what this government is giving to \nthe American people. To me, this means recent Internet service \ninnovations such as 3G and 4G wireless speeds and new fiber networks \nnow become riskier investments.\n  Less investment means every American's ability to access the Internet \nhe or she wants may be affected. Less investment means fewer jobs.\n  Four months ago, President Obama realized he had a regulation problem \nwith independent agencies such as the FCC. He issued an executive order \nasking independent agencies to review burdensome redtape. Instead of \nreviewing redtape, they have rolled out even more of it. The \nPresidential review has fallen woefully short.\n  The President asked independent agencies to produce a plan to reduce \nregulations within 120 days. Well, 120 days was yesterday. So the 120 \ndays have come and gone, and what we have received once again from this \nPresident is more rhetoric and little by way of results.\n  If there was ever an example of an independent agency rule that needs \nto be put against the President's rhetoric, it is this net neutrality \nrule.\n  Net neutrality picks winners and losers. It threatens smaller and \nrural providers.\n  Brett Glass of LARIAT, a wireless Internet service provider in \nWyoming, warned the FCC about the effects on smaller providers. He said \nthe redtape will hurt his ``ability to deploy new service to currently \nunderserved and unserved areas.''\n  He warns that many broadband providers are small businesses that are \nserving rural communities. Mr. Glass wrote:\n\n       The imposition of regulations that would drive up costs or \n     hamper innovation would further deter future outside \n     investment in our company and others like it.\n\n  So here we are. Americans have made it very clear that they oppose \nWashington worsening the Web. Over 60 percent of voters oppose \nWashington putting its hands on the Internet.\n  This regulation we are debating is a classic example of Washington \ntrying to fix something that is not broken.\n  Ninety-three percent of Americans are satisfied with their broadband \nservice. Ninety-one percent of Americans are satisfied with their \nbroadband speed. The Internet is working remarkably well.\n  There is a fundamental disconnect with those in Washington who seek a\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nmore powerful bureaucracy and those at home in the 50 States of our \nUnion who are seeking a stronger economy.\n  The warnings are real in Wyoming, my State, and all across this \ncountry. Congress must step in where the bureaucrats in Washington have \noverstepped. Senator Hutchison's resolution of disapproval should be \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution to \ndisapprove the FCC's open Internet order.\n  The FCC wants to regulate the Internet. Why? There must be some sort \nof market failure that needs correcting or some Internet issue that \nneeds fixing or out-of-control provider that needs regulating, right?\n  That is not the case at all. We are talking about one of the most \nsuccessful sectors of our economy--one that has flourished with limited \ngovernment regulation and continued to create jobs in the midst of a \nvery deep recession and economic downturn.\n  Since the Internet was privatized in the midnineties, it has \nprospered. The industry's growth and impact on our economy, as well as \nits development of new, life-changing technologies and applications, is \nstaggering.\n  Twenty years ago, the Internet as we know it did not exist. Today \nover 2 billion people use it.\n  Ten years ago, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Skype did not even \nexist, and hundreds of millions of people are now users.\n  Five years ago, mobile applications didn't exist. At the end of last \nyear, there were over half a million apps, applications, and well over \n10 billion will be downloaded this year. Hopefully, they will soon be \ndownloading mine. We came up with one yesterday for our office.\n  Two years ago, the iPad didn't exist. Now, over 25 million have been \nsold.\n  All these advancements expanded broadband access and encouraged \nprivate investment.\n  In 2003, only 15 percent of Americans had access to broadband and now \nover 95 percent do. This growth will only continue.\n  In its annual report on the Internet, Cisco projected that the \nInternet will quadruple over the next 4 years, and the 1-year growth, \nfrom 2014 to 2015, will be equal to all the Internet traffic in the \nworld last year.\n  Clearly, the Internet industry is growing and innovating at \nlightening speed. Why has the industry been able to do this? It is \nbecause the environment for innovation and job creation has been ripe, \nwith government regulation not getting in their way.\n  Imagine that, the government has stayed out, has taken the ``light \ntouch'' approach, and the industry has prospered as a result.\n  The broadband expansion we have seen, the innovation that has \noccurred with computers and tablets and explosion of smartphones and \nmobile devices and the increased job creation have all occurred without \nthe FCC's open Internet order.\n  So why does the government want to start regulating now? Is it \nbecause the Internet endangers public health or environment? Clearly \nnot. Yet the proponents of Internet regulation claim the freedom and \ngrowth of the Internet are in jeopardy. Quite frankly, in my opinion, \nthat is ridiculous.\n  To suggest that some type of regulation is needed flies in the face \nof the growth of the Internet economy. This is one of the problems \nfacing our economy and plaguing our country. We are regulating where \nregulation is not needed. We are regulating based on speculation and in \nsearch of a problem.\n  This is not how we encourage innovation. This is not how we create \ncertainty in the marketplace, and this is definitely not how to \nencourage job creation.\n  Over the past few weeks, all we have talked about is jobs and \nrightfully so because, throughout America, the No. 1 issue facing \nAmericans is jobs--or the lack thereof.\n  Yet here we are debating whether to overturn a regulation on one of \nthe few growth areas of our economy, one of the few sectors that has \ncreated and is creating good, high-paying jobs.\n  This should be common sense. It is no wonder people watching think \nthat in this place, Washington, DC, the Federal political process is \nout of touch and dysfunctional.\n  As the FCC drafted the open Internet order, the Commission heard from \nbroadband providers, including small businesses, about the problems the \norder would create and the negative impact it would have on consumers.\n  One small Internet service provider stated that the imposition of \nnetwork management rules will hinder its ability to obtain investment \ncapital and deploy new services in unserved areas.\n  The regulations would also increase costs and hamper innovation, \nwhich would only further discourage outside investment in the company.\n  In other words, the Internet regulation we are talking about today \nwould lead to lower quality of service and would raise operating costs, \nwhich would result in higher prices on consumers.\n  So we can clearly see the impacts of Internet regulation--less \ninvestment, less innovation, higher prices for consumers, lower quality \nservices, increased business costs and, ultimately, fewer jobs.\n\n  Companies will spend more money on compliance, basically complying \nwith regulations, instead of investing in innovation and driving down \nprices. More money will be spent on lawyers, not on engineers.\n  Let me be clear. The Internet will still exist if Washington \nbureaucrats get their way. But the order's impact will be profound, and \nit is going to disrupt what has become one of America's proudest \nentrepreneurial and industrial achievements in our history.\n  I have heard proponents say this regulation will preserve the open \nInternet as it exists today. But it is my humble opinion this is \nshortsighted.\n  Personally, I don't want to continue using the Internet of today. I \nwant the Internet of tomorrow. I want the devices and applications I \nuse today to soon be obsolete and out of date because the industry has \ncontinued to churn out something newer, something better and faster.\n  I want technologies to continue to develop and industries to continue \nto emerge. We are now using fewer devices for more telecommunications \nservices, and it is not hard to imagine a day when we will use one \ndevice for all of them.\n  The industries are headed in that direction. When we throw the \ngovernment in the middle of it, the pace will slow, uncertainty will \nenter the marketplace, and future innovations may just go unrealized.\n  One of the beautiful aspects of the Internet industry is that we \ndon't know what is around the corner in terms of new technologies and \ninnovations. If a few years ago we had told someone we would Google \nthem, they probably would have been offended. But today that actually \nmeans something.\n  Going forward, we have no idea what the future holds, what the new \ninnovations or ideas or technologies will be. We know technologies we \ncannot even imagine today will very soon be part of our everyday lives. \nThe question is whether we are going to encourage that and particularly \nwhether we are going to encourage that to happen here or whether we are \ngoing to discourage that from happening.\n  Regulating the Internet--and this specific measure we are trying to \nknock down today, if it passes--will discourage that development.\n  The FCC and Federal Government cannot keep pace with the Internet and \ntechnology industries, and the government should not attempt to catch \nup through regulation or legislation. That is important. We are asking \nthis government--this bureaucratic structure, which struggles to keep \npace with issues we have been facing for the last 20 years--to somehow \nkeep pace with the issues and technology and innovations that arrive in \nthe Internet world. Not only do I think it is asking too much, I think \nit is impossible. Therefore, the government should not be looking at \nways to preserve the status quo. Our government should be involved in \nlooking at ways to promote the future of these industries, and this \nInternet regulation does not promote the future.\n\n  I have frequently spoken on this floor about the new American \ncentury, about whether our country will continue to be a leader in this \nnew century. I believe with all my heart--I do, even with all the bad \nnews and the\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nnoise we hear every time we turn on the television--there is no reason \nthis 21st century should not be every bit as much the American century \nas the last century. One of the reasons I believe that is because of \nthe advances our entrepreneurs and innovators are making in this field \nof the Internet.\n  If there is any sector of our economy that will ensure that the next \ncentury is the American century, it is the Internet and the technology \nsector. That is an industry where we are the leader, and it is the one \nwhere we must continue to lead. To do that, we must encourage \ninnovation, incentivize investment, provide certainty in the \nmarketplace, and promote the competitive environment this dynamic \nindustry needs.\n  That will require passage of this resolution of disapproval. So I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 60 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Sixty?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty minutes, yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been looking for a time when the floor was open \nto refute some of the comments and concerns raised earlier on the \nSenate floor. I want to start by taking on a comment that was made by \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken, who said YouTube started above \na pizzeria in 2005 and sold for $1.6 billion 2 years later to Google, \nand that wouldn't have been possible without net neutrality.\n  Well, Mr. President, I must point out that we didn't have net \nneutrality in 2005. We haven't had Federal regulation of the Internet \nin this country such as we have seen during this last year put forward \nby this administration. In fact, YouTube and Google were both created \nin a marketplace without net neutrality regulations. Other online \nsuccesses--Facebook, Hulu, Twitter, and new devices such as the Apple \niPhone and Amazon Kindle--all happened without net neutrality \nregulations. These are innovations that have changed communication \npatterns not only in our country but around the world as well. So we \nhave had these innovations without the heavy hand of government.\n  It is very interesting to hear the debate on the Senate floor because \nwe seem to hear that net neutrality is something that will keep the \nInternet open. The opposite is true. It is beginning to put the clamps \non the successes that we have had by having an open Internet. All these \ncompanies they are talking about needing net neutrality to come forward \nand blossom and grow are the companies that have done exactly that \nwithout net neutrality regulations.\n  What we should do is assure that we don't put a blanket over the \nInternet and start saying to everybody who has a new idea or a new \nproduct or a new service provider: You better go to the FCC before you \ngo forward with that or you could be in jeopardy. You could be \npenalized. You could be thought to have an ``unreasonable'' product on \nthe Internet because we don't know yet what is reasonable. We just know \nyou have to be reasonable because we have a new regulation now that \nsays you must be reasonable, without any definition of what this FCC--\nwhich had no authority to go into this area--is going to determine is a \n``reasonable'' product that would not interfere with anything else.\n  Mr. President, we haven't had net neutrality before. All the \nsuccesses I hear talked about in this debate have happened without the \nheavy or the light hand of government stopping the originality and \ninnovation that has marked the success of our country.\n  Earlier, Mr. Kerry, the Senator from Massachusetts, said the Internet \nmade the 1996 Telecommunications Act obsolete 6 months after it was \nenacted. But if the 1996 act did not sufficiently address the Internet, \nthus making it obsolete, how can that same law be the genesis and basis \nof the FCC's assertion it has the power to regulate the Internet? We \nhave to have one or the other, and it is our assertion the FCC did not \nget specific authority to regulate the Internet that is required for \nCongress to give it in order to make rules in this area. So Senator \nKerry can't have it both ways. He can't say the Telecommunications Act \nwas obsolete but it is also the basis of these new restrictive \nregulations.\n  Senator Kerry sent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to everyone in the \nSenate asking them to vote against this resolution. What I think \nSenator Kerry was saying in that letter is that net neutrality is not a \nregulation of the Internet because it is just a regulation of the \nonramp. In other words, we are not trying to support the FCC regulating \nthe whole Internet; they are just doing the gateway, they are just \ndoing the onramp.\n  Well, that was the position the FCC took when they made this \nregulation. But we can't argue that net neutrality is not regulation of \nthe Internet because the Internet service providers are the only \nonramps to the Internet. It is a misleading statement to say that just \nregulating the onramp isn't regulating the Internet. The Internet is \nthe entire global network of millions of computer networks. It uses the \nInternet protocol standard to interconnect with each other. Internet \nbackbone providers and last-mile Internet service providers serve as \nthe foundation of the Internet. So they are the foundation.\n  Web sites and services such as e-mail and voice-over IP, or VOIP, \nallow users to communicate on top of the foundation. The Internet is \nthe whole online ecosystem put together. We can't have the edge without \nthe core and vice versa. The onramp is as much a part of the \ninformation superhighway as are the cars traveling on it.\n  FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell put it well in his dissent from the \nopen Internet order that we are discussing today. He said:\n\n       To say that today's rules don't regulate the Internet is \n     like saying regulating highway on ramps, off ramps, and \n     pavement don't equate to regulating the highways themselves.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are going to say the FCC can regulate the \nonramp--and that is the first heavy hand of government that is going to \nstart controlling and making decisions about what is reasonable and \nwhat is not--that means businesses are going to have to go to the FCC \nand say: Mother may I. If they have an innovative product, that is \ngoing to cost the consumer more because they will have had to go and \nhire lawyers to go to the FCC to get prior approval or it will delay \nthe product getting out to consumers, possibly letting a European \nservice provider that doesn't have these kinds of barriers get ahead of \nus.\n  Internet technology is the basis of hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nproducts in our country. We are in a crisis right now. We all know we \nhave 9 percent unemployment and that our economy is even dead in the \nwater. So we have to do something to jump-start the economy. The last \nthing we want to do is put a blanket on it to make it harder for it to \ncome back. I don't think anybody in this country with any common sense \nis going to say we have a thriving economy right now. So it does defy \ncommon sense to say we are going to allow regulations Congress has not \napproved and that Congress has not authorized the regulator to make, \nknowing it will have the effect of either freezing or delaying the \ninnovation that has been the hallmark of the success of the Internet \nand technology in our country.\n  There are several organizations that have banded together to ask that \npeople vote for the resolution today. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from, among others, Americans for Tax \nReform, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, Hispanic Leadership Fund, and \nAmericans for Prosperity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 8, 2011.\n\n     Re Rating Senate Joint Resolution 6, Net Neutrality.\n\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator: We write to inform you that each of our \n     organizations, together representing millions of Americans, \n     will consider rating a vote in favor of Senate Joint \n     Resolution 6 to overturn the Federal Communications \n     Commission's (FCC) Net Neutrality Internet regulations in our \n     respective congressional ratings.\n       The FCC enacted these Net Neutrality rules despite a \n     complete lack of Congressional authorization and after being \n     told by\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\n     a court that they lack jurisdiction. The FCC nevertheless \n     insists on government regulation of how data travels across \n     the Internet without any showing of consumer harm or other \n     justification.\n       The FCC's order also runs contrary to the broad and \n     bipartisan conversation in Washington about how best to grow \n     the economy and spur job creation. President Obama and \n     Members in Congress on both sides of the aisle have called to \n     rein in overbearing regulations that harm economic growth.\n       The FCC's Net Neutrality rule is a prime case of \n     unnecessary rules emanating from unelected bureaucrats that \n     will cause economic harm and cost hundreds of thousands of \n     American jobs, as numerous studies have pointed out. But \n     regardless of whether you support Net Neutrality rules, the \n     process by which they were created cannot be allowed to \n     stand.\n       Under the U.S. Constitution, it is your role in the U.S. \n     Senate to craft laws--not the role of federal agencies that \n     are bypassing Congress. Senate Joint Resolution 6, sponsored \n     by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, is a simple, commonsense \n     measure that uses the Congressional Review Act to reject \n     these rules, placing legislating authority back in the hands \n     of Congress where it belongs.\n       We urge you to vote for Senate Joint Resolution 6 and may \n     be rating your vote in our annual Congressional scorecards. A \n     vote against this measure is a vote to abdicate your \n     responsibility and to instead rubber-stamp the job-killing \n     and unwarranted regulatory actions of an unelected and \n     unaccountable federal agency.\n\n           Sincerely,\n     Grover Norquist,\n       President, Americans for Tax Reform (WILL RATE).\n     Phil Kerpen,\n       Vice President for Policy, Americans for Prosperity (WILL \n     RATE).\n     David Williams,\n       President, Taxpayers Protection Alliance (WILL RATE).\n     Thomas Schatz\n       President, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.\n     Mario H. Lopez,\n       President, Hispanic Leadership Fund.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in part, the letter says:\n\n       The FCC enacted these Net Neutrality rules despite a \n     complete lack of Congressional authorization and after being \n     told by a court that they lack jurisdiction.\n\n  Remember, this court, in the Comcast case, basically said to the FCC: \nYou and all the other regulatory agencies that are independent must \nhave specific authority from Congress to regulate in this area.\n  They found in the Comcast case they did not have such jurisdiction. \nOnce again, citing from the letter in support of passing S.J. Res. 6--\nwhich is signed by Grover Norquist, Phil Kerpen, David Williams, Thomas \nSchatz, and Mario Lopez--it says:\n\n       The FCC's order also runs contrary to the broad and \n     bipartisan conversation in Washington about how best to grow \n     the economy and spur job creation. President Obama and \n     Members in Congress on both sides of the aisle have called to \n     rein in overbearing regulations that harm economic growth.\n\n  Here we have yet another regulation on top of the EPA and the NLRB \nand the NMB coming forward to put a damper on our economy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to read from an opinion piece written by \nPhil Kerpen, who is with the Americans for Prosperity, and I thought \nthis was relevant to the debate.\n\n       Network neutrality sounds nice. Originally, it was the idea \n     that all of the traffic . . . that travel over the networks \n     that comprise the Internet should be treated exactly the same \n     way. But engineers cried foul, because the routers that make \n     the Internet work are highly sophisticated with millions of \n     lines of code that necessarily prioritize different types of \n     traffic. Streaming video can't tolerate delays of a few \n     seconds whereas an e-mail could.\n       So network neutrality morphed into something even more \n     dangerous, empowering the FCC bureaucrats to play traffic \n     cops, micromanaging networks, and deciding which traffic can \n     or can't be prioritized. The result would be a precipitous \n     decline in private investment because the companies that \n     spent billions of dollars building networks could no longer \n     be certain how the FCC bureaucrats would allow those networks \n     to be used.\n\n  I am reading from this letter, and I will continue. The letter says:\n\n       A recent study from New York University found that hundreds \n     of thousands of jobs would be lost. The tech sector--the \n     brightest spot in our economy--would be burdened by Federal \n     regulations the way the rest of the economy has been.\n\n  So these are excerpts from Mr. Kerpen's opinion piece that say it is \nnow crunch time to stop the FCC's Internet takeover.\n  I think these outside groups that are weighing in are showing that \njust regular consumers--I heard the list of groups that are supporting \nthis rule that has come out. But the citizens who are for free markets \nand tax reform and for letting our businesses grow and thrive through \nthe American innovation--I like some of the things they have said that \nI think are very important in this debate.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at whether we are exercising our \nresponsibility as Members of Congress when we would vote against \nstopping a Federal agency that has not had a delegation of authority \nfrom Congress to regulate in this area. The House of Representatives \nhas already voted in favor of this resolution. We need to send it to \nthe President and say to the President: Congress did not delegate our \nauthority.\n  It is overstepping its bounds, and furthermore it is going to put a \ndamper on the most thriving part of our economy today, and that is the \ntech sector. It is where we are, hands down, ahead in the world because \nwe have kept the free markets. Why would we give that up to unelected \nFederal agencies that have not been asked by Congress to regulate in \nthis area? And if we did, we should be required--because it is our \nconstitutional responsibility to do so--to say exactly what we would \nask a policy to be in a new regulation. We have not done that, and we \nshould not allow the Federal agencies, which are appointed but not \nelected, to take over this area that is so important for our economy.\n  If we have any guts at all in this Senate, we should stand up for our \none-third of the balance of power in the Federal Government and assert \nourselves to keep control over runaway Federal agencies that do not \nanswer to anyone.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to overturn the \nopen internet order, widely known as net neutrality. This measure that \nwas passed days before the start of the 112th session of Congress by \nthe Federal Communications Commission is a rule that many believe the \nFCC had no legal right to make and will harm job creation in the \ntechnology sector of our economy.\n  Plain and simple, this measure will cost the Nation good-paying jobs. \nThat is why I do not support net neutrality and will vote in favor of \nthe resolution of disapproval to overturn it.\n  Since privatizing the Internet in 1994, the FCC and Congresses led by \nboth Democrats and Republicans have handled the Internet with a light \nregulatory touch by classifying it as an information service. This \nclassification originated from a Democrat-led FCC, and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt supported efforts to classify the Internet as an information \nservice when it upheld the FCC's Cable Modem Order on June 27, 2005.\n  The FCC's policy has been that subjecting providers of enhanced \nservices, even those offered via transmission wires, to title II common \ncarrier regulation was unwise given the fast moving, competitive market \nto which they were offered. In other words, the FCC, led by Democrats \nand Republicans, has been consistent in the belief that regulating the \nInternet the same way we regulate land telephone lines even if those \nlines are used to connect to the Internet was counterproductive to good \npublic policy given the speed of innovation and the competition \npresent. Even the U.S. Supreme Court supported this position.\n  So Congress has never passed a law that gives the FCC the power to \nregulate the Internet, the FCC has gone to great lengths to avoid \nregulating the Internet, and the U.S. Supreme Court has supported \nprevious FCC administration policy toward zero regulation of the \nInternet. Yet here we are voting to overturn a Federal Communications \nCommission order to regulate the Internet.\n  Make no mistake, as FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell said, ``To say \nthe net neutrality rules don't regulate the Internet is like saying \nthat regulating on-ramps, off-ramps, and its pavement doesn't equate to \nregulating the highways themselves.''\n  But why does this matter? Why don't we just say: You know what, these \nunelected bureaucrats at the FCC know so much more than Congress and \nthe Supreme Court. Let these rules go through.\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\n  Because they will cost us jobs. U.S. broadband has seen an investment \nof hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure expansion and \nupgrades over the last 10 years and that has led to hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in this industry.\n  This year alone, broadband providers are estimated to invest over $60 \nbillion in their networks. That is more money than the Federal \nGovernment has spent on highways in previous years.\n  I am well aware that the FCC insists the rules will not have a \nsignificant impact on the industry, but they did little to prove this. \nMinus a market or cost-benefit analysis, there is no way of knowing \nwhat exactly the impact of this regulation will be.\n  That is why I asked the FCC to conduct a market benefit analysis to \nprove the exact impact on jobs and the economy. The FCC stated the \nanalysis was in the Internet order, but I still have not been able to \nfind what they are referring to. I suspect the analysis was not ever \nactually done. If it was completed, the FCC would have seen that the \ncosts of net neutrality would be significant and justifying the rules \nwould not have been possible.\n  The fact is, net neutrality regulation is costly. As explained by the \nFederal Trade Commission in 2007 when they said in part:\n\n       Policy makers should proceed with caution in evaluating \n     calls for network neutrality regulation. . . . No regulation, \n     however well-intentioned, is cost free, and it may be \n     particularly difficult to avoid unintended consequences here.\n       Policy makers should be very wary of network neutrality \n     regulation . . . simply because we do not know what the net \n     effects of potential conduct by broadband providers will be \n     on consumers, including among other things, the prices that \n     consumers may pay for Internet access, the quality of \n     Internet access and other services that will be offered, and \n     the choices of content and applications that may be available \n     to consumers in the marketplace.\n\n  The FTC clearly stated that Congress must proceed with caution \nbecause we cannot fully quantify what the reaction by broadband \nproviders would be if they were not able to manage their networks.\n  Again, let me state, some reports have said that over the next 5 \nyears, there will be hundreds of billions of dollars invested in \nbroadband infrastructure which will result in half a million jobs.\n  If broadband wire line and wireless service providers rolled back \ntheir investment by just 10 percent because of this regulation, the \nbenefits of regulation would never outweigh the costs of job loss.\n  I assure you, these companies will roll back their investments if \nthis rule is allowed to move forward, which will in turn eliminate \njobs.\n  Because of the unpredictable nature of the Internet and evolving \nconsumer demands, broadband providers must have the ability to change \ntheir business models to ensure maximum utilization of their network. \nThese net neutrality rules impose restrictions on how a broadband \nprovider can offer Internet service, which means broadband providers \ncan't adapt to an evolving Internet. If a broadband provider does not \nhave the ability to manage their own network to ensure maximum profits, \nthe incentive to invest diminishes. If you minimize investment, you \nlose jobs. Estimates have put the number of jobs lost because of this \nregulation at 500,000 over the next 10 years. In my home State of \nNevada, the unemployment level is at 13.2 percent, the highest in the \nNation. Any regulation that increases unemployment both nationally and \nin my State is unacceptable.\n  Finally, some people believe we need this regulation to ensure \ncompetition in the industry. I believe this is as ridiculous as saying \nthat this measure will not cost jobs.\n  Fixed and mobile broadband Internet access is growing rapidly. In \n2003, only 15 percent of Americans had access to broadband. In 2010, 95 \npercent of Americans do. Competition, investment, innovation, and job \ncreation are all growing because of the light touch policymakers and \nthe FCC have put on the Internet.\n  We are in this wonderful era of innovation and investment where \npeople can use an I-pad to read their e-mail in the Sierra Nevadas \nbecause the government did not regulate the Internet. Now our friends \non the other side of the aisle and the FCC are saying: Yes, but in \norder to continue this amazing innovation, we must regulate.\n  Competition is robust in this industry, and when weighed against the \nloss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, the need for this regulation is \nsimply not there. Net neutrality should not be enacted. It makes no \nsense for Nevada and will cause unnecessary job loss nationwide.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure and disapprove of the \nFCC's net neutrality order.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nresolution of disapproval offered by the Senator from Texas. I commend \nher for leading this effort, and I was pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the resolution.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was dismayed last December when the \nFederal Communications Commission chose to impose heavyhanded and \nburdensome new regulations on the Internet. There was no market failure \nor consumer harm requiring FCC action, and the FCC Chairman's \ndetermination to deliver on a misguided Presidential campaign promise \nis very disappointing. It is especially troubling in light of the \nunanimous DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Comcast v. FCC, \nauthored by a Clinton appointee and former Carter administration aide, \nstating that the Commission lacked the statutory authority under the \nCommunications Act to regulate the Internet in this manner. \nUnfortunately, this decision, coupled with concerns expressed by \nMembers of Congress, was completely ignored by an outcome-driven \nmajority at the FCC. I doubt the Commission's lawyers will receive a \nwarm welcome from the DC Circuit when they return to defend a policy \nthe court struck down just last year.\n  Shortly after the Federal appellate court ruled in the Comcast case, \nrecognizing that net neutrality rules adopted under the Commission's \ntitle I authority would have difficulty surviving a court challenge, \nChairman Genachowski shockingly announced that he would reclassify \nbroadband as a title II telecommunications service and apply a 19th-\ncentury regulatory framework to an innovative 21st-century technology. \nThis decision ignored the successful history of treating broadband as a \nlightly regulated title I information service, which has been the \npolicy of the FCC and Congress going back to the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Keeping regulators' hands off of the Internet has historically been \nsupported by FCC Commissioners and Members of Congress on both sides of \nthe aisle. For example, on March 20, 1998, a bipartisan group of \nSenators sent a letter to the FCC stating: [[W]e wish to make it clear \nthat nothing in the 1996 Act or its legislative history suggests that \nCongress intended to alter the current classification of Internet and \nother information services or to expand traditional telephone \nregulation to new and advanced services.] They continued: [[W]ere the \nFCC to reverse its prior conclusions and suddenly subject some or all \ninformation service providers to telephone regulation, it seriously \nwould chill the growth and development of advanced services to \ndetriment of our economic and educational well-being.]\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Then Democratic FCC Chairman William Kennard shared their view, \nstating: [Classifying Internet access as telecommunication services \ncould have significant consequences for the global development of the \nInternet. We recognized the unique qualities of the Internet, and do \nnot presume that legacy regulatory frameworks are appropriately applied \nto it.]\n  Had traditional telephone common carrier regulations been applied to \nthe Internet more than a decade ago, it is unlikely we would have the \nbroadband services and speeds of today. The appropriate market \nincentives led to billions of dollars of private sector investment in \nbroadband, created millions of jobs, and now high-speed Internet access \nis available to 95 percent of the population, and that number continues \nto grow. It is amazing what can happen when the Federal Government's \nregulatory policy for a particular industry is hands off.\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\n  Fortunately, after a bipartisan majority of Congress wrote to the \nCommission objecting to the FCC Chairman's proposed radical shift in \npolicy, the FCC did not officially reclassify broadband as a title II \ntelecommunications service. However, as we saw last December, the \nDemocratic majority at the Commission did not abandon their results-\noriented effort to regulate the Internet. Instead, in defiance of the \nFederal court decision in Comcast, the Commission chose to effectively \nplace title II common carrier obligations on broadband service \nproviders using their title I ancillary authority. The policy embraced \nby past Republican and Democratic FCC Chairman and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle has been relegated to the waste bin under the \ncurrent regime at the FCC.\n  In order to justify placing these new regulations on the Internet, \nthe FCC for the first time found that broadband was not being deployed \nto all Americans in a ``reasonable and timely'' manner. This is an \nabsurd claim that quickly falls apart when you look at the facts. \nAccording to the FCC's own broadband plan, 95 percent of Americans have \naccess to broadband. In the early 2000s, that number was less than 20 \npercent. In addition, terrestrial wireless and satellite broadband \nservices continue to improve in terms of speed and availability. We are \nrapidly approaching the point where wireless Internet service becomes a \ntrue substitute for wireline service. This rapid rate of deployment and \ntechnological advances occurred absent the heavyhanded regulation we \nwill be voting to repeal today.\n  For my colleagues who may be unaware, I would like to point out that \nthe FCC determined that the broadband marketplace was competitive and \nshould remain unregulated in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Proponents of \nregulating broadband services have failed to demonstrate what has \nchanged to warrant Federal intervention. Most consumers have a choice \nof multiple broadband providers, and the suite of services and \napplications available on home computers, mobile smartphones and \ntablets, and Internet-connected televisions continues to grow. Even \nthrough tough economic times, broadband providers continues to invest \nand create jobs. I also find it perplexing that despite the FCC \nacknowledging that it may require $350 billion in new investment to \nachieve the goals of the National Broadband Plan, the agency \nnevertheless willfully adopts rules that will have a chilling effect on \nfuture investment.\n  The Commission also makes the novel argument that section 706 of the \n1996 Communications Act, which directs the FCC to ``remove barriers to \ninfrastructure investment,'' authorizes the adoption of new Internet \nregulations. The open Internet order flies directly in the face of the \nplain language of section 706. When the Commission imposed new rules on \nbroadband service providers, they built new barriers to infrastructure \ninvestment.\n  Support for Internet regulation seems to rely on baseless theoretical \nclaims that consumers may be harmed by ``Internet gatekeepers'' at some \npoint in the future. Despite the fact that the FCC Chairman has said he \nwill use fact-based analysis when reviewing proposed rules, the facts \nindicate that consumers are not being harmed and broadband service \nproviders are not blocking access to content. A fact-based analysis \nleads one to conclude that the market is healthy and competitive. I \nhave significantly more faith in a competitive market rather than \nFederal bureaucrats shielding consumers from harmful business \npractices. In addition, current consumer protection laws, such as \nsection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, will effectively address \nreal consumer harms were they to actually ever occur in the broadband \nspace.\n  Lastly, it should be noted that while there have been attempts by \nsome in Congress to impose similar regulations on the Internet, these \nattempts have all been unsuccessful. Unelected bureaucrats have now \nusurped Congress's authority and have taken it upon themselves to \nchange the law. Opponents and supporters of net neutrality in the \nSenate should take offense to that, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe resolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the resolution \nbefore us that would express congressional disapproval of the Federal \nCommunications Commission's move to regulate the Internet. The \nhistorically open architecture and free flow of the Internet should not \nbe subject to onerous federal regulation.\n  As a member and former chairman of the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, I have fought to prevent the FCC from \nunilaterally implementing network neutrality regulations for many \nyears. Last Congress, I introduced the Internet Freedom Act of 2009, \nwhich would have prevented the Commission from regulating the network \nmanagement practices of internet service providers. And this congress, \nI am a proud cosponsor of S.J. Res. 6.\n  Skeptical consumers and American entrepreneurs should rightly view \nthese new rules exactly for what they are--another government power \ngrab over a private service provided by a private company in a \ncompetitive marketplace. Sadly, and to the detriment of consumers and \nour national economy, the FCC is the latest in a growing list of \nFederal agencies under the Obama administration that have chosen \ngovernment intervention and influence over the free market. In a little \nless than 3 years, this administration has moved to control and exert \nmore government influence over the auto industry, the energy sector, \ndoctor-patient relationships, and now, through the FCC, it wishes to \ncontrol high-tech industries by regulating its very core: the Internet.\n  According to a report recently released by the House Government \nOversight and Reform Committee, the Obama administration has imposed 75 \nnew major regulations costing more than $380 billion over 10 years. \nMoreover, the report continues by pointing out that there are 219 more \n``economically significant regulations'' in the works which will cost \nbusinesses $100 million or more each year for a minimum cost of $21 \nbillion over 10 years. These new regulations and added costs come in \nspite of Presidential Executive orders to reduce burdensome regulatory \nredtape.\n  The government's politically motivated decision to regulate the \nInternet, like so many others, will stifle innovation, in turn further \nslowing our economic turnaround and depressing an already anemic job \nmarket. The technology industry is one of our Nation's bright spots and \none of the fastest growing job markets. There is little dispute that \ninnovation and job growth in this sector of our economy is a key \ncomponent to America's future prosperity. Unfortunately, this is not \nthe FCC's first attempt to regulate the Internet. For years, my \ncolleagues and I have introduced legislation and written to the FCC \nasking the Commission to halt attempts to regulate the Internet unless \ngiven clear authority to do so by Congress. The message in our \ncorrespondence to the FCC has been crystal clear: Members of Congress \ndo not believe the Commission has the current legal authority to \nregulate network management practices; therefore, the Commission should \nnot act without express legislative authority. But, like other out-of-\ncontrol Federal agencies, the FCC has chosen to not listen and \ncontinues to act defiantly without legislative authority.\n  Might I remind the bureaucrats at the FCC that as a government \nagency, the FCC is not elected by the people only the House, Senate, \nand the President are duly elected. And, as our Constitution makes \nclear, the authority to legislate is solely vested in the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, not five politically appointed \nFCC Commissioners. As such, the resolution before us today not only \nseeks to undo bad policy, it also seeks to restore the constitutional \nintegrity of the Congress. If we fail to pass this resolution of \ndisapproval, our institutional credibility will be further eroded.\n  Proponents of more Federal regulatory influence over the Internet \nargue that these rules are needed to enhance regulatory certainty. I \nwould argue that the only uncertainty in the marketplace has been \ngenerated by the development of these unauthorized regulations. \nFurther, if there were systemic problems in the Internet marketplace, \nthen why provide arbitrary exemptions to coffee shops, bookstores, and \nairlines? Why not make these regulations universally applicable? The \nfact is there is no systemic problem that warrants a regulatory \noverreach of this\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nmagnitude. After over a decade of practice, the facts are devoid of any \nglobal misconduct. These regulations will do more to entice companies \nto lobby-up, get a lawyer, and seek a regulatory competitive advantage \nthan benefit consumers or our economy.\n  As the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has \nrecognized, Americans have benefited enormously from the Internet's \n``fundamental architecture of openness.'' The light touch regulatory \napproach toward the Internet that was advanced by previous \nadministrations--both Democratic and Republican alike--has brought \nAmericans Twittering, social networking, low-cost long distance \ncalling, texting, telemedicine, and over 500,000 apps for the iPhone. \nIt also brought us YouTube, HBO GO, Kindle, the Blackberry, and the \nPalm. The Internet has changed our lives and our economy--forever.\n  By imposing onerous regulations and discouraging innovation, \nbroadband providers will have less incentive to invest. This \ndisincentive will result in the movement of less capital into the \nmarket, which in turn will directly result in fewer jobs created. We \nshould reject this regulatory power grab and demand the Federal \nGovernment get out of the way and out of the business of picking \nwinners and losers in our economy. It is for these reasons that I \nstrongly support the resolution before us to keep the Internet free \nfrom government control and regulation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some \nthings, but I understand we only have 42 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And both Senator Cantwell and Senator Mark Udall \nwant to speak. I don't want to take their time, so at this point I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 44 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 6, which \nseeks to put an end to the FCC's misguided net neutrality rules. The \nFCC's rules regulating the Internet are yet another in a series of \nunnecessary and economically harmful regulations from President Obama's \nadministration. These rules will stifle innovation, investment, and \nultimately jobs, and they are a continuation of this administration's \nobsession with picking winners and losers in almost every marketplace.\n  We live in a world where we no longer have to wait for the morning \nedition of the paper to read the latest news. We don't have to wait for \na delivery from the postman to get a message from a loved one. We do \nnot have to get in our car and head to the store to watch a movie or to \nshop for clothes, books, and groceries. We have the ability to do these \nfrom the comfort of our homes, thanks to the Internet. It is clear the \nInternet has changed the way we live. This helps promote and encourage \neconomic growth, facilitates innovation, and reshapes the way we do \nbusiness, all the while creating millions of jobs. This was able to \nhappen because of the government's hands-off policy.\n  The Federal Communications Commission admits the ``Internet has \nthrived because of its freedom and openness.'' Then why is this agency \ntaking steps to limit the openness and freedom of the Internet?\n  Last December, the FCC voted to impose net neutrality rules to \nregulate the Internet. This is nothing more than the government \ninterfering and threatening small providers and forcing networks to \noperate services in ways determined by unelected bureaucrats.\n  What is worse is the FCC is working to fix a problem it acknowledges \ndoes not exist. The agency is relying on speculation of future harm. \nThis attack on the Internet is irresponsible and is irresponsible \ngoverning. While our economy struggles, the Internet remains a beacon \nof light that continues to grow, but this rule risks stifling \ninnovation and investment in jobs.\n  A study by a telecom economist with the Brattle Group found that the \nnet neutrality rules could lead to a job loss of 340,000 in the \nbroadband industry within the next 10 years. This is not the type of \npolicy we need to adopt, especially as our country stares at 9 percent \nunemployment. That is why I am supporting S.J. Res. 6, which will put a \nstop to the FCC's misguided net neutrality rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to \nthe joint resolution of disapproval that will reject the open Internet \nor the net neutrality rule that was put forward this year by the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  I am a strong supporter of the principle of network neutrality that \nthe open Internet rule seeks to protect, and I believe we should oppose \nthis effort to reverse the FCC order. The rule this resolution seeks to \neliminate--the open Internet rule--was adopted by the FCC in December \nof 2010, and it will go into effect on November 20 of this year.\n  Simply put, this rule creates commonsense obligations and \nrequirements for broadband Internet service providers, such as \ntelephone and cable networks, in order to keep the Internet free and \nopen. I know the open Internet rule will provide the certainty needed \nto foster job-creating investments and innovations while protecting \nbroadband Internet consumers. Why is this important? Well, net \nneutrality is a way of saying the Internet ought to be free and open. \nIt is a fundamental concept that is underpinned with some marvelous new \ntechnology that we call the Internet. This open Internet rule will make \nsure we hew to the concept that the Internet ought to be free and open.\n  We watched and are still watching as democratic uprisings topple \ntotalitarian regimes all over the Middle East. Social networks such as \nTwitter and technologies such as text messaging are largely thought to \nfacilitate the so-called Arab spring. None of that would have been \npossible without an open and free Internet.\n  I have to ask, what kind of message will we be sending to the \nremaining dictators--but probably even more important, those people who \nquest and thirst for freedom--if the citizens of the United States, \nthrough their Senate, vote to limit Americans free access to the \nInternet? We have to set an example for the rest of the world. The \nInternet must remain free and open.\n  The open Internet rule will achieve this by ensuring that four key \nInternet policies are maintained. Let me list them for my colleagues.\n  No. 1, it will prevent broadband Internet providers from blocking \nlawful Internet content or services.\n  No. 2, it will require transparency about broadband network \nmanagement policies.\n  No. 3, there will be a level playing field for consumers on the \nInternet.\n  No. 4--this is important in these tough economic times we face--it \nwill provide predictability for both broadband providers and Internet \ninnovators.\n  As I have said, what is so important about this debate is that in \nthese economic times, net neutrality is also about jobs and economic \ndevelopment. As I travel in my State of Colorado--and I know the \nPresiding Officer travels his State of New Mexico--the refrain I hear \nfrom businesses and business leaders is that they need predictability \nin order to invest in their companies and create good-paying American \njobs.\n  Thousands of entrepreneurs who have built small Internet businesses \ncan only be successful if they can reach their customers. However, if \nwe don't preserve this net neutrality rule and content blocking is \nprevented, there\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nwill not be any guarantees that the next great online innovation or \npioneering application will even be able to access the Internet. For \nexample, the next Google or Amazon or Twitter will only be able to grow \nand be successful if they can reach their customers without worrying \nabout interference from broadband providers that might want to \npreference another more established competitor.\n  So what we are talking about is the FCC is promulgating a commonsense \nrule that will provide predictability for both the broadband providers \nand the Internet innovators. The certainty of knowing the rules \nbroadband providers have to follow will give the confidence needed for \ninvestors to help the next Groupon breakthrough or many of the other \nnumerous applications we are all familiar with online.\n  Innovation and job creation is what will finally lift our economy out \nof the slump from which we have been desperately trying to recover. We \nneed net neutrality to ensure that innovation thrives and that the next \ngreat product, service, or way of doing business is not inhibited by \nmarket manipulations or restrictive online policies.\n  I came to the floor to urge my colleagues to vote against this \nresolution. It only serves to distract us from the hard work we have to \ndo to foster job growth and get our economy back on track. Let's agree \nto cement fair and reasonable rules of the road, as the FCC rule seeks \nto achieve, in order to provide certainty in a climate of innovation \nfor the next generation of job creators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we don't use the Congressional Review Act \noften. In fact, I think we have only used it once successfully. But the \nregulators are working at a breakneck pace, and I think the overreach \nwe see in this rule and some others that are coming out right now \nreally requires the Congress to pay attention, requires us to revisit \nthe reason the Congress gave itself the ability to look at rules and \nregulations and see if they make sense.\n  Simply put, on this regulation, the Federal Communications Commission \nlacked the legal standing to produce the order we are debating today. \nThe net neutrality order the FCC enacted is not based on the facts or \non the law. In fact, I have yet to hear credible defense of why we \nwould want to have this massive regulatory burden. In fact, we have \ntalked about net neutrality for several years now, and the definition \ncontinues to change because the free marketplace has driven the \ninnovation beyond every debate we have had. The marketplace where \npeople invest and grow the Internet and access to that Internet has \nmeant that as soon as a debate would be engaged on this issue of so-\ncalled net neutrality, it no longer mattered. I think that is what we \nsee here as well. But it will begin to matter if we begin to manage the \nInternet in a way that slows down investment, that slows down \ninnovation.\n  Three years ago, the FCC attempted to reach far beyond any \nlegislative mandate they had to regulate the Internet through a rule. \nLast year, a Federal court struck down that rule, saying the Commission \nhad no authority to do so. Now we find ourselves debating a measure \nwhich in a roundabout way attempts to accomplish the same end with a \nresult that might be disguised in some other way. The Commission is \nusing a provision of the Communications Act, which was enacted to allow \nthe FCC to ``remove barriers to infrastructure investment.'' Why would \nwe want to do that? Why would we want to remove barriers to \ninfrastructure investment? Why would we have passed that law? Because \nwe want to encourage infrastructure investment by removing barriers. \nThe basis the FCC is using was actually deregulatory, not regulatory. \nThey are basing this on a law that said they could do something 180 \ndegrees different from what this rule would do.\n  Repeated government economic analysis has reached the same \nconclusion: There is no concentration; there are no abuses of market \npower in the broadband space. And even if there were, we have a lot of \nlaws to deal with that. We have antitrust laws. We have consumer \nprotection laws. There are plenty of ways to approach that if it \nhappens, but nobody thinks it is happening.\n  The Commission, like many other Federal agencies, has often been put \nin a position where one industry competitor is being asked for a \nregulation that somehow would benefit them in their competition with \nsomebody else. This order would greatly increase the frequency of those \nrequests.\n  This order puts the FCC in a position of constantly having to monitor \nnew innovations on the Internet.\n  One of the FCC Commissioners who didn't agree with this order clearly \nlaid out the dissent when he said this. This is a quote from \nCommissioner McDowell:\n\n       Using these new rules as a weapon, politically favored \n     companies will be able to pressure three political appointees \n     to regulate their rivals to gain competitive advantages. \n     Litigation will subplant innovation. Instead of investing in \n     tomorrow's technologies, precious capital will be diverted to \n     pay lawyers' fees. The era of Internet regulatory arbitrage \n     has dawned, and to say that today's rules don't regulate the \n     Internet is like saying that regulating highway on-ramps, \n     off-ramps, and its pavement doesn't equate to regulating the \n     highways themselves.\n\n  In releasing the net neutrality order, the FCC charted itself on a \ncollision course with the legislative branch as well as with the \nFederal judiciary, which has already struck down a similar attempt to \nregulate this sector by the FCC. They stated unequivocally in that \nattempt that the FCC lacked the standing to do so.\n  This is a solution that is really searching for a problem. Let me \nguarantee that whatever anybody thinks the problem is right now, that \nwill not be the problem 6 months from now unless we figure out how to \nslow down innovation in this area and suddenly we are dealing in a \nstatic environment instead of a dynamic environment.\n  Even if there were a legal basis for this legislation, we still \ncannot get away from the fact that it is a massive and unnecessary \noverreach into the private sector, which has thrived while our overall \neconomy has slowed and stalled.\n  In 2003, only 15 percent of Americans had access to broadband. \nAccording to the Commission's own National Broadband Plan, last year 95 \npercent of Americans had access to broadband. Between 2003 to 2010, 15 \npercent to 95 percent--it sounds to me as if that access is doing what \nyou want it to do and occurring how you want it to occur. Fixed and \nmobile broadband Internet access, expanded and improved upon by the \nprivate sector, is the fastest growing technology in history. In only 7 \nyears, 95 percent of Americans got to where 15 percent were 7 years \nearlier.\n  Competition in this field is robust. Technology advances, network \nbuildout, and infrastructure improvements are happening quickly, to the \ntune of billions of dollars of investment and innovation and an ever-\nexpanding array of applications for consumers. More competition is on \nthe way as providers make use of increased amounts of spectrum coming \nonline and lay new networks of fiber to connect Americans in rural \nareas in the country.\n  The telecommunications sector contributes more than $60 billion \nannually to our economy. Net neutrality would slow that down.\n  With the order that was set forth, the Commission will begin to \nspeculate on what might happen as opposed to what clearly is happening.\n  First, the kind of anticompetitive action the Commission seeks to \nremedy is already illegal.\n  Second, the competition in this space is far too fierce. Their rule \nis far too repressive. Most Americans already have two options for \nwired broadband access at work or at home, and the number of wireless \ncompetitors available is exponentially higher.\n  No government has ever succeeded in mandating investment and \ninnovation, and until this order nothing has held back Internet \ninvestment and innovation in this country, and that is why it has done \nso well.\n  Broadband buildout is a thriving success story on which virtually all \nAmericans now count. We now even take it for granted. It is incumbent \nupon us to look at this rule to understand the negative impact it will \nhave on a thriving way to communicate, to do business, and to talk to \neach other, and to reject this rule and let this system continue to \ndevelop with the same innovation,\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nthe same intensity, and the same incredible success it has had in the \npast 7 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I Thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes of our time to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for the \ntime. This is a critical subject she is dealing with right now, but the \nthing in common is the problem we are having right now with regulation. \nI think we are going to be talking about that this afternoon.\n  I only wanted to get one thing in, and that is about something the \nChair is fully aware of because he was there all morning. Something \nvery significant happened this morning. In our Environment and Public \nWorks Committee we passed out a highway reauthorization bill. We have \nnot done this since 2005, and this morning we did. This is one where we \nsat down--one of the few times that Democrats, Republicans, liberals, \nconservatives, can get in a room and hammer out their differences and \nget things done. I wish the committee would be successful in doing that \nas we were this morning in getting a highway bill. So we are going to \nhave a highway bill at the current spending level which, if my \ncolleagues remember back in 2005, it was $286.4 billion, and that was \nfor a 5-year bill. That spending level right now would be, to sustain \nthat, somewhere between $40 billion and $42 billion a year for 2 years. \nThis is a 2-year bill, and the 2-year bill cannot pass until we locate \nan additional $12 billion to make this happen. I think a lot of us \ndon't want to take what would constitute a 34-percent cut in funding \nfor our roads and highways and bridges throughout America and be able \nto sustain that. This is a life-and-death type of issue.\n  I wanted to say how proud I am of the staff and of every Democrat and \nevery Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee who made \nthis happen this morning. So while we have much more we are concerned \nabout, I think it shouldn't go unnoticed at this time that we have now \nstarted that ball rolling and that is good news.\n  One last thing I wish to say about overregulation. When we talk about \nthe jobs bill--and we always are talking about revenue and jobs and all \nof this--we seem to forget that the overregulation is costing us a lot. \nI can remember fighting the cap-and-trade bills ever since back during \nthe Kyoto convention, and impressing upon people that the bills being \noffered would cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. That \nis every year, not just the first year. Right now, since they have not \nbeen able to pass that here, they are trying to do that with \nregulations through the Environmental Protection Agency. Congressman \nFred Upton over in the House and I had legislation that would take away \nthe jurisdiction of the EPA to get this done. I think this is going to \nbe offered as an amendment this afternoon. I think it is very critical \nthat we pass that.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for giving me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I Ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Hutchison for her \nefforts here in stopping another regulatory nightmare. I am beginning \nto think the FCC stands for Fabricating a Crisis Commission because \nthey are trying to create a new regulation for a problem that does not \nexist. The overriding problem here is, as the government intervenes \nincreasingly into the Internet and the investment in the Internet, that \ninvestment is going to dry up as uncertainty is increased.\n  I have seen in my State where private investors have put together the \nmoney with companies to put down broadband in rural areas only to find \nthat there are some companies operating with a government grant or some \ngovernment money to compete with them.\n  Under President Obama, the FCC has become an activist bureaucracy \nthat is inventing a crisis here in order to take control of the \nInternet.\n  The Internet is one thing in our country that is working vibrantly. \nIt is a showcase of free enterprise. It does not need to be regulated. \nFor years liberals have warned us that, if the government does not take \naction, the Internet will not be competitive or accessible. The \nopposite has happened. More people are using the Internet and have \naccess to cutting-edge technology and devices than ever.\n  This is yet another misguided big-government solution in search of a \nproblem. Last year, the courts ruled in the Comcast decision that the \nFCC does not have the authority to mandate how private companies can \nenter into business agreements and limit the ways they provide Internet \nservices. The FCC did not learn its lesson and instead is at it again \nwith its Open Internet Order, which is vague, baseless, and built on an \neven weaker legal foundation than their activities in Comcast. Congress \ndid not authorize such actions and the courts have ruled against them. \nThe FCC should not try to get around it by redefining clear legislative \nlanguage passed by Congress.\n  There has been no demonstrable harm to which the FCC needs to \nrespond. They cannot give us a case where competition is not growing, \nwhere the expansion of broadband is not growing. In fact, new \ntechnologies are exceeding the pace that the FCC can even keep up with.\n  We do not need to come in and slow down the growth. If the FCC wants \nto take action, it should prove there is legitimate harm in the \nmarketplace. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission \nhave a number of laws and regulations to enforce in the name of \nprotecting consumers who use the Internet and competition among \ncompanies involved in the market. If those laws are lacking, the FCC \nshould show how and ask Congress to provide it with statutory \nauthority.\n  The FCC has not done so. They have not shown us that harm has taken \nplace and that they need to take control, essentially, of the Internet. \nCongress has yet again been cut out of the picture, and many of my \ncolleagues in the majority seem comfortable with abandoning their role. \nThe FCC's bad logic needs to be recognized. They admit these new rules \nwere not imposed due to any previous or existing wrongdoing. That is \nimportant for us to recognize.\n  If a regulatory agency is issuing an order that intervenes into the \nprivate sector, there needs to be some substantial harm being \naddressed. The FCC claims the government must regulate the Internet in \norder to protect consumers from future harms that could occur. That is \nnot the point of the regulatory structure.\n  I heard all of these arguments back in 2006 when the Senate was \ndebating how to update our telecommunications laws. If the regulation \nadvocates had won in 2006, today we would have the Internet of 2006. I \ndo not want the Internet of 2006 in 2011, and I do not want the \nInternet of 2011 in 2016. I want it to grow and improve and evolve just \nas it is doing now. The government cannot possibly manage the \ndevelopment of the Internet, which the FCC is trying to do.\n  The Internet does not need a government stimulus. It is a free market \nindustry that is working. Right now, the technology sector has a 3.3-\npercent unemployment rate, far below the national average. Over the \nyears, communications companies have invested\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nhundreds of billions of dollars in broadband technology and \ndevelopment, and no deficit-expanding stimulus was required!\n  If the government really wants to allow the Internet and related \nbusinesses to prosper and thrive, it should stay out of it. The \nInternet is not broken, but our government is. The private \ntelecommunications sector knows how to create jobs; our government does \nnot. The things that work best in our society--businesses, charities, \nvolunteer organizations--are the things that government does not \ncontrol. Consumers should be in control, not unelected activist \nbureaucrats intent on taking over the most successful parts of our \neconomy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution to undo the \nFCC's power grab. Three unelected bureaucrats should not be permitted \nto simply give themselves the power to regulate the Internet's \ninfrastructure in the face of clear statutory language directing them \nto do just the opposite.\n  The FCC should not be permitted to circumvent Congress and \nessentially enact laws that will impact vital services we all depend \non. To keep the Internet economy thriving, this decision must be \nreversed. I commend Senator Hutchison for bringing this up and using \nthe powers of Congress to take back control of our legislative \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would yield it to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his \nleadership on this important issue. I am glad to be on the Senate floor \nto set the record straight because we are here to talk about Internet \nfreedom and about making sure the Internet does not have undue costs \nand expenses for consumers.\n  If you liked TARP and you liked the bailout of the big banks, well, \nguess what. Then you should vote for this resolution because this \nresolution is about whether you are going to let the communications \ncompanies that want to make the Internet more expensive by various \ntechnologies have their way.\n  If you believe the FCC should establish some rules to protect the \nfreedom of the Internet, then you should oppose the Hutchison \nresolution. I prefer legislation that I have introduced, and some of my \ncolleagues support, called the Freedom of the Internet Act, that goes \nfurther than what the Federal Communications Commission has done to \nimplement true net neutrality. I would prefer that, and maybe in the \nfuture my colleagues will be working on such legislation.\n  But as it is today, the Federal Communications Commission has taken a \nhalf step, if you will, by proposing some rules that will set in place \nsome protections for consumers to make sure they are protected on \nimportant aspects of keeping Internet costs down. The problem with the \nFCC rules is they only apply in some cases to fixed broadband and not \nto mobile broadband.\n  So if you think about it this way, the Internet is moving to a mobile \nbroadband platform; that is, our hand-held devices, whether they are a \nBlackBerry or phone or what have you. So many more Americans are \naccessing the Internet that way. So the FCC has come up with rules on \ntransparency and no blocking; that is, to make sure no content is \nblocked or slowed down for any undue cost or reason, and a \nnondiscrimination rule.\n  Unfortunately, those two last points, no blocking and unreasonable \ndiscrimination, do not apply to the mobile side. So we have work to do \nto make sure the youth of America who are consuming so much content \nonline through their mobile devices are not going to be artificially \ncharged more or slowed down in their access all because the \ntelecommunications industry wants to have its way with the Internet.\n  My colleagues have been out here talking about innovation. I can tell \nyou, the Internet has had a ton of innovation and a ton of content \ncreation, all because there has been an even playing field and net \nneutrality. The fact now is that the telecommunications companies are \ndebating an important issue, and the lines get blurred between \ntelecommunications and the Internet, and it is clear we do not have all \nof the rules in place to make sure consumer interests are protected.\n  But today we have one thing: the FCC rules that are trying to slow \ndown telecommunication companies from artificially either blocking or \nmaking content on the Internet more expensive. Again, when we go to the \nmobile phone model and we are being charged for time and data transfer, \nthe fact that the data transfer and time take longer means we are going \nto have more expensive phone bills. That is why I said it was TARP-\nlike, because the ``cha-ching'' we are going to hear from the phone \ncompanies on the money they are going to make from this is \nunbelievable.\n  So thank God the FCC took a half step and said: Whoa. Slow down. We \nare not going to let you do that. That is why people like Vint Cerf and \nTim Berners-Lee, the architects and inventors pushing the Internet, \nhave said what a bad idea it is to not make sure that net neutrality is \nthe law of the land.\n  I notice my colleague who just spoke said, well, there have not been \nany problems. There have not been any issues. I read the online \npublications. Larry Lessig, someone I trust, was recounting in one of \nhis interviews exactly what happened. Comcast went in and basically \nblocked large data files of peer-to-peer transfer, what is called bit \ntorrent traffic.\n  First, Comcast said: No, no. We do not do that. We did not block \nthat. We do not do it. But when it was basically found out that they \ndid, they said: Oh, no, we did not block it. We just slowed it down. \nThey sent little messages, as Mr. Lessig says in his article, to the \nInternet traffic to confuse the recipient and basically disrupt their \ntraffic. OK? So that is what is happening.\n  These providers think if they can control the pipe, now they can also \ncontrol the flow. It is also, as Mr. Lessig said later in this article, \nas if the entire electricity grid, our refrigerators and our toasters \nand our dryers, all of a sudden would start charging different rates on \ndifferent things because the electricity company would decide it had \nthe ability to charge different rates. Would we put up with that? No, \nwe would not put up with that.\n  So why would we put up with allowing telcos to run at will on the \nInternet charging consumers anything they want based on the fact that \nthey think they have the control of the switch?\n  I am so proud the chairman, Senator Rockefeller, has led this fight \nfor the freedom of the Internet to drive down costs, to keep \ninnovation, and to protect net neutrality. The FCC rules do not go far \nenough. We cannot continue to have this half step and not clearly, on \nthe mobile side, give consumers the protection they need.\n  But for today, if you want to vote with Internet consumers and \nInternet users on driving down the costs of the Internet, then vote \nagainst this resolution and keep the minimal FCC rules in place until \nwe can get stronger legislation passed. Make no mistake about it, the \nother side is talking about, well, they do not want to regulate the \nInternet. That is true. They do not want to regulate telcos that want \nto take advantage of the fact that they own the pipe and can charge a \nlot more.\n  I am glad the FCC at least took this measure. We should make sure it \nstands until we can even get stronger Internet freedom protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nher remarks and actually fully agree with them in that mobile is kind \nof left alone, and it should not be because it is everything that is \nhappening in the future. But it is a step, and it was a wonderful \nspeech.\n  It occurs to me that I do not think we have anybody left to speak on \nthis side. I am not sure about Senator Hutchison, but it may be a good \ntime to yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to just wrap up, and then \nI will yield back the rest of our time and we can close this debate \nbecause our vote is going to come tomorrow.\n  I just want to summarize what we have heard today. I just heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington State say that without net \nneutrality we would have more expense to consumers. I really do view \nthis in a different way because I view the potential delay, the \nregulatory processes, the hurdles that are going to have to be overcome \nfor any kind of preclearance to put a new product on the Internet, \ngatekeeping for innovation--that is what, in my opinion, is going to \nincrease the cost and cause delays if not freeze many of the \ninnovations that have occurred in our open Internet system.\n  We now have, because of the FCC's ruling, the requirement for \nreasonable standards for access to the Internet. There is no definition \nof ``reasonable.'' I heard the Senator from Minnesota say we need net \nneutrality in order for Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to be \nable to grow and prosper. Those entities have grown and prospered--\nwithout net neutrality regulations. They have grown and prospered \nbecause we have had free and open access to the Internet. We and our \ncompetitors and our businesses that compete overseas have had open and \nfree access. That has been the beauty of the success of the Internet.\n  Now we see government coming in and saying: You have to be reasonable \nin what you offer. So if there is a major dump of millions of pages \nonto the Internet and it is going to slow down, for instance, a \nhospital network offering rural health care on an emergency basis or \nsome kind of video-streaming that is going out, we have to be able to \nlet the providers have the judgment and let the marketplace work. If \nthere is a problem it was not pointed out by the FCC when they decided \nto intervene in the Internet among 134 pages of regulations with just 3 \nparagraphs about possible problems, all of which concluded with the \nrules that are in place today.\n  This is clearly a problem that isn't there, which is being \nmanufactured in order to put another government regulation on the \nbooks. When the Senator from Massachusetts said this order doesn't \nregulate the Internet, just the gateways or the on-ramps, that doesn't \nhold water because if we regulate the on-ramp, we are regulating the \nInternet. We are causing companies that are providing broadband to not \nhave control of their networks but instead will now have to go before \nthe FCC to justify a new product or service that will give emergency \naccess or quicker access for users who need to have that kind of \naccess.\n  I hope the Senate will say the FCC has extended beyond any authority \nCongress has given them, and I hope we will stand for our prerogative \nin Congress to make the laws and only have regulations come out when we \ndelegate specifically to an agency to put out rules in a particular \narea, which has not happened in this case.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, before I yield all time back on our \nside, I have listened to the entirety of this debate. It seems to me it \nhas been fairly clear that on one side the government regulates and \nmesses things up, and on the other side things are going swimmingly.\n  I can't help but pay attention to all those people out at TechNet, \nthe AT people, Moody's, Hamilton's, and all these people who take a \nvery dour view of government intervention and a very sensitive view as \nto whether that intervention is in any way going to stop investment. \nThe answer is usually it does. That is why I feel very happy that this \nwas referred to by a number of major players in this field as a very \n``light touch'' of regulation, which gave them a sense of where they \nwere going to be, how far down they could look toward their future and \ntherefore allow them to invest the money they wanted to invest.\n  That is not to say they would not have done it anyway. But there is \nnothing like encouraging capital investment in something as important \nas the Internet. I think the net neutrality legislation does that very \nwell. I hope when we vote on it tomorrow, it will not pass.\n  Having said that, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7263-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7263-S7288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               3% WITHHOLDING REPEAL AND JOB CREATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 928.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 928 to Amendment No. 927.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, November 8, 2011, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nPaul, and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I feel it is very important that we spend \nsome time on this issue. I think all Americans realize we are in almost \nunprecedented difficult economic times, and that despite efforts that \nhave been made over the now nearly 3 years, our economy has not grown \nand it has not provided the kind of job growth and opportunity many of \nus had anticipated.\n  When we look at previous recessions--and this is a near depression by \nsome calculations--the recovery has been amazingly and agonizingly slow \nas compared to recoveries from other recessionary periods.\n  In the view of this Senator, the remedies have, in many respects, \nmade the problem worse rather than better. If we look at some objective \ncriteria, I argue that the situation in America today is worse than it \nwas on January 2009, when this administration came to office. We have \nhad the stimulus package, the Health Care Reform Act, increases in \nspending in numerous areas, and the Dodd-Frank bill, which was going to \nfix the regulatory system in this country to prevent any financial \ninstitution in America from ever again being too big to fail--in other \nwords, no financial institution would ever need taxpayer dollars to the \ndegree that America's economy would be impacted adversely in case that \ninstitution failed.\n  Well, here we are. Here we are, nearly 3 years later, and \nunemployment is at 9 percent, even though after the stimulus package \nwas passed all the predictions were that maximum unemployment would be \n8 percent and headed down. The recovery has been anemic. In my home \nState of Arizona, still nearly half the homes are under water. In other \nwords, they are worth less than the mortgage payments the homeowners \nare required to make.\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\n  Working together with my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, and \nSenator Portman of Ohio, we have put together a series of proposals and \nideas that have been generated both within this body and outside of \nthis body, and we believe--we believe with the utmost sincerity--there \nshould be areas in this proposal that we and our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle could come to agreement on. We wish to see this \nentire package. We think it is important in its entirety. There is no \ndoubt in our minds that when you look at the 9-percent approval rating \nMembers of Congress have with the American people, they certainly want \nto see us do something constructive as well.\n  I guess I would ask my colleague from Kentucky how he thinks we \nshould have put this package together, what we should have included, \nand what haven't we included. What is the situation in his home State \nas far as a need for this kind of legislation?\n  Before going to my friend from Kentucky, let me add that I talk to \nlarge and small businesspeople all over this country, and they all tell \nme the same thing. They all tell me the same thing. They have no \ncertainty as to what the future holds for them, which then causes them \nnot to invest or to create jobs. Overseas, they are sitting on $1 \ntrillion. Here in the United States they are sitting on a $1\\1/2\\ \ntrillion and not investing because they do not know when the next \nregulatory act is going to come down. They do not know when the next \nregulation is going to be issued. They do not know when the next tax \nincrease is going to occur.\n  I saw on television the other day that the owner and founder of Home \nDepot, Kenneth Langone--and he also wrote a piece for the Wall Street \nJournal--said he couldn't start Home Depot today. He couldn't start it \ntoday because of the environment that exists. Intended or not--and I \nknow my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have the most \nhonorable of intentions--the result of all this regulation has been a \nclimate which has restrained investment, which has then restrained and \nkilled job creation and caused this economy to be mired in the \ndoldrums. Obviously, that has had a terrible impact on every-day \nAmericans.\n  Before my colleague comments, I first want to thank the Senator from \nKentucky for the key role he has played in putting this package \ntogether, and I hope this is the beginning of our fight for passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. PAUL. I hope this is the beginning of a conversation with the \nother side and with the President. I told the President personally that \nI want to help with the problems we have in our country. We have 14 \nmillion people out of work, with 2 million additional people out of \nwork since this administration began. So we are serious about our \nRepublican jobs plan, and there can be some areas of some common \ninterest.\n  There currently is a supercommittee talking about some of these tax \nreform ideas. Our side is putting forth a message, we are putting forth \na plan, and we are willing to work with the other side. The problem is, \nit is my understanding the other side has walked away from the table. \nThe other side is unwilling to talk or to engage with us. I have asked \nthe President personally to come to Capitol Hill and talk to us. I have \ntalked with the members of the supercommittee and have indicated we are \nwilling to work with them.\n  We have some good ideas to create jobs, and some of these ideas the \nother side has already agreed to. Lowering the corporate income tax. \nThere are Members of the other party who understand we need to be \ncompetitive with the rest of the world. So lowering the overall rates, \nsimplifying the code, and getting rid of some of these loopholes. These \nare things the President talks about as he campaigns. But if he were \nserious, he would come and talk to us. Instead, what I have heard at \nhis campaign stops is Republicans are too stupid to understand his plan \nso he is going to break it up. Well, that may get laughs at his \ncampaign rallies, but it isn't getting anything done.\n  I think the American people need to know our jobs plan will create \njobs, and we are willing to talk with the President and with the other \nside. I think we are willing to get things done, and I think we have \nimportant things in the bill that will do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe my friend from Kentucky and I can talk about many \nof the various provisions in this legislation. There are a lot of \nprovisions that were based on input from outside and inside this body. \nSome of this, by the way, closely mirrors legislation which has already \npassed the House of Representatives as well.\n  We lead off with a requirement for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I was here many years ago when the balanced budget \namendment failed by one vote. When you ask the American people if \ngovernment, and the Congress, shouldn't live under the same constraints \nthey have, they are in total support of that.\n  I have seen polls--and I wonder if my friend from Kentucky has--that \nshow 80 to 90 percent of the American people support a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution when informed what it is. At the very \nleast we ought to put that up for a vote in this body.\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. Routinely, decade after decade, polls show anywhere \nfrom 75 or 80 percent or more support a balanced budget amendment. We \nneed it, because we have shown ourselves to be fiscally irresponsible. \nThrough the years, we have had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and we have had \nall different types of restraints, but we disobey our own rules. We \nsay, oh, it is an emergency. But then suddenly all the routine spending \nwe do becomes emergencies, and the debt gets bigger and bigger.\n  Those in the debt commission say the most predictable crisis in our \nhistory is the coming debt crisis in this country. They are seeing it \nin Europe. We need to be serious in our country and fix these problems \nbefore we get to a crisis situation. That is what our Republican jobs \nplan does. It addresses it--a balanced budget amendment, tax reform, \nand a regulatory moratorium. We can't keep heaping on new regulations \nthat put us at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to go back a second to the point the Senator from \nKentucky made. Congress cannot bind future Congresses. I was here at \nthe time of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was one of \nthe most strict budgetary requirements ever passed by this body. It \nrequired automatic spending cuts in the event that budgets were \nexceeded and excess spending was, obviously, taking place. But one \nCongress cannot bind future Congresses. So over time--over a very short \nperiod of time--the restraints imposed on spending by Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings went into the mist and we went back to business as usual.\n\n  I will be very candid with my colleague. There are people who have \nlegitimate concerns about a balanced budget amendment and what it would \ntake to get there and the Draconian measures that may be entailed. But \nI ask, what is the alternative? What is the alternative? Mortgaging our \nchildren and our grandchildren's future? I believe currently that \nstands at a $44,000 debt for every man, woman and child in America. So \nwhy don't we in this body have a debate over a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution and find out exactly where people are?\n  At the same time, we have learned over the years that Congresses \ncannot bind future Congresses, and so that is the problem with enacting \nautomatic spending cuts, or whatever spending cuts or other measures we \nachieve here. We cannot bind future Congresses, appropriately. So the \nonly way to address this issue is by amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States, which I know the Senator from Kentucky and I do not view \nas a measure taken lightly. I have been opposed to most changes in the \nConstitution. I think our Founding Fathers got it pretty well right. \nBut this is an issue that I think has to be addressed.\n  Mr. PAUL. Those who say balancing the budget would be extreme, I \nthink what is extreme is a $1.5 trillion deficit. We are en route now, \nat the rate we are spending money, to a decade within which the budget \nwill be consumed by entitlements and interest. There will be nothing \nleft for national defense or for anything else if we keep on the same \nspending pattern. So we do have to do something.\n  What we have shown so far is that fiscal restraint has been an utter \nfailure up here. After Gramm-Rudman-Hollings we had pay as you go. That \nwas broken 700 times in the first 5 years we were supposedly paying as\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\nyou go by simply saying it is an emergency. Every routine expenditure \nbecame an emergency and so we went around it. So that is a good context \nfor the Republican jobs plan--that everything will be in the context of \nbalancing our budget.\n  But then there are other important matters, such as tax reform. \nHistorically, the one thing government can do to create jobs or to \nlessen unemployment is to lower the upper rate. Kennedy did it in the \n1960s and unemployment was cut in half. Reagan lowered the top rate \nfrom 70 to 50 and unemployment was cut in half. Reagan lowered it again \nfrom 50 to 28 and unemployment was cut in half. And interestingly, as \nyou cut the top rate, you didn't cut revenue. Revenue stayed at 18 \npercent of GDP through all the lowering of the top rate.\n  What lowering the top rate does is it unleashes economic growth. The \nother side has this vision they are going to hire people in government \nand somehow fix unemployment. You can hire hundreds of thousands of \npeople and you don't put a dent in it. To cure unemployment, or lessen \nunemployment, you need to have millions of people hired, and that can \nonly be done in the private sector. I think that is the difference in \nthe vision between our side and their side. Our vision is unleashing \nthe private sector, and theirs is to hire a few more people to dig \nditches and fill them in. It is a different vision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it a fact that Americans are not only very unhappy \nbecause of the economic condition we find ourselves in but also because \nthey perceive an inequity and an inequality in our economy today? In \nother words, they see financial institutions on Wall Street making \nrecord profits and paying record bonuses. They see large corporations \nthat pay no income taxes--none--zero. They see that and then see \nthemselves paying their taxes, the least of which may be withholding \ntaxes or sales taxes or whatever taxes they are still paying. It seems \nto me that tax reform would address these inequities.\n  I note that Senator Portman from Ohio is here, and he knows this \nbetter than anybody, having been, in his previous incarnation, the head \nof the Office of Management and Budget. Over the years, we have carved \nout loophole after loophole and have provided some with a better or \nspecial deal. It is a damning indictment of the Congress and the \nadministration that we let it happen, but it is what it is. So we now \nhave major corporations--I would cite General Electric as an example--\nthat paid no taxes last year. An average citizen--who doesn't have a \nlobbyist here in Washington and who can't get a carveout or a special \nloophole for their small business--is paying these taxes.\n  So how do we resolve that inequity? It seems to me that is \naccomplished through tax reform. Give people a simplified Tax Code. The \nSenator from Ohio has some much better ideas about this: three tax \nbrackets, eliminate all but charitable deductions--even put a ceiling \non that--and home mortgage deductions, and then the American people \nwould at least believe they are being treated fairly. Today, they do \nnot believe they are being treated fairly. And I am talking about \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  I think statistics confirm that most Americans believe there is a \nlarge disparity between the wealthiest and the less well off in \nAmerica. I would ask my colleague from Ohio to comment, since he knows \nmore about that than I do.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator from Arizona is absolutely right, and I \nappreciate his passion on this issue. He has the whole Senate focused \non the idea of repatriating profits from overseas back to America to \ninvest in jobs and growth, and he has now focused us on the need to \nreform the Tax Code on the individual side and on the corporate side.\n  On the individual side, as he talked about, we have an incredibly \ncomplex Tax Code--thousands and thousands of pages. By lowering the \nrates and broadening the base--getting rid of some of this underbrush--\nwe will create economic growth. It is a necessary shot in the arm right \nnow with over 9 percent unemployment.\n  On the corporate side, right now we have a corporate rate that is the \nsecond highest in the world among all developed countries. The highest \nis Japan, and they want to lower theirs. This means jobs are going \noverseas instead of staying here. By lowering the rate, getting them \ndown to the average of these other countries, we will bring more \ninvestment back to this country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the response to the suggestion of bringing the \ncorporate tax rate down to 25 percent, let's say, because we say \ncorporations are taxed too much in America, yet at the same time we \nalso find corporations paying no taxes?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. By bringing the rate down to 25 percent on a revenue-\nneutral basis, what we do is get rid of a lot of the preferences, the \nexclusions, the credits, the tax deductions that enable companies right \nnow to pay little or no taxes. We think everybody should be paying \ntaxes. We think everybody should be subject to a fair tax system. We \nalso think we shouldn't have to spend billions a year in complying with \na Tax Code that is so complex. So instead of hiring more tax lawyers, \nwe want people to get out there and hire more Americans to do the \nwork--productive work--to get our economy moving.\n  Tax reform is a way to give this economy a shot in the arm right now. \nIt is one of many structural reforms that is in this legislation that \nthe Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Arizona have put \ntogether with me. It is very consistent with this idea that America's \nbest days are ahead of her, if we restructure some of these basic parts \nof our economy: Tax reform, necessary; lowering health care costs, \nabsolutely critical; allowing us to explore for energy on our shores \nand create jobs and economic opportunity; being sure we are reducing \nthe regulations that are strangling small businesses. These are all \nstructural reforms we can and should do. By the way, there is \nbipartisan support for every single one of those elements.\n  So I commend the Senator from Arizona for raising these issues, for \nhis passion for them, and the Senator from Kentucky. I hope the Senate \nwill give us the opportunity to vote on this, and it should be a \nbipartisan vote because so many of these issues are issues that \ntranscend partisanship, and in each case there are Democrats and \nRepublicans who understand the need to move our economy forward by \nmaking these structural changes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For just a minute, I would like to discuss with the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Ohio that enhanced \nrescission or what used to be known as line item veto.\n  The Senator from Ohio once had the misfortune--his reward will be in \nHeaven, not here on Earth--of being the head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget and saw these appropriations bills come over, and \nmany of them were that thick. Going through line by line, we find these \nspecial interests, special deals we call porkbarrel projects which have \nno justification, which were never debated, which were never discussed, \nwhich were never brought to the light of day except maybe occasionally, \nbut certainly it contributed enormously to our debt and deficit.\n  So he had the option of going to the President of the United States \nand saying: Veto the whole bill and send it back and it may be \noverridden or accept these pork-laden, big, thick appropriations bills.\n  Isn't that a dilemma we should not force the President of the United \nStates to have, that kind of Hobson's choice?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Absolutely. That is one of the elements of this jobs \nbill. It was particularly tough on defense bills because we have our \nnational defense at stake and we have our soldiers and marines and \nsailors out there, and the bill comes to the President of the United \nStates, and is he going to sign it? If he doesn't sign it, there is a \nrisk there will be at least a gap in funding; if not, as you say, be \noverturned. So there is a lot of pressure to sign it.\n  What happened, the President signed these pieces of legislation with \nthe earmarks in them, and we have more spending than we should and \nspending is not going to the priorities. It is not going to the \nnational priorities.\n  So this legislation is simple. It says, back in the late 1990s, 1996, \nClinton signed a line-item veto bill. Constitutionally, it was \nquestionable, and sure enough the Supreme Court overturned it. Now we \nhave come back with another way to do this so-called enhanced\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nrescission, but it is basically a legislative line-item veto where \nCongress would have the right to be able to review what the President \nrescinded. If they didn't act within a short period of time, it would \nbe rescinded. The Congress could act to overturn the President.\n  We believe it is constitutional, meets all the obligations that were \nset out in that Supreme Court case that overturned the first line-item \nveto and yet puts the pressure on the Congress not to put this \nporkbarrel spending in, and if they do, we would have the light of day \nshone on it and Congress would have to individually take up these line \nitems, these porkbarrel projects.\n  We think this is a constructive way forward that is constitutional, \nthat meets all the concerns that have been raised, and would help to \nget the spending down and to prioritize spending at a time when we have \nrecord deficits and debt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the Senator from Kentucky, the President \nprobably would veto some items we wouldn't like vetoed because there \nare some differences in philosophy between ourselves and the President \nof the United States. But I am willing to take not only that risk but \nthat penalty associated with trying to get elimination of the \nporkbarrel spending.\n\n  We have made some progress, I will admit, in the elimination of some \nof the ``earmarks,'' but we have a long, long way to go. Frankly, it is \na disease I have watched recede a bit over time and then it pops back \nup. Again, it is something like the balanced budget amendment--it needs \nto have a permanent fix.\n  Mr. PAUL. The line-item veto, interestingly, that the Senator \nproposed and got to the floor in the form of a bill separate from this \nhas cosponsors from both parties. It does have bipartisan support. Many \non the other side of the aisle see some of the waste. There is no \nreason why we couldn't begin to work together on some of this.\n  But, once again, I get back to if the President is going to go on the \nroad and call us too stupid to understand and his jobs plan has to be \nbroken up, that is not a good way to get to a consensus. The President \nneeds to come to Capitol Hill and needs to talk with the other side and \nwork on these ideas.\n  Do we need a line-item veto and do we need a balanced budget \namendment? Do we need to do something different or just do the same? \nThe problem with just doing the same is we haven't had a budget in 2 or \n3 years around here. The appropriations bills are supposed to agree \nwith the budget, but they can't because there is no budget. There is a \nrumor that the appropriations bill will go to the conference committee \nbetween the two Houses and they will actually airdrop in whole other \nappropriations bills.\n  Do we need more scrutiny? Do we need a balanced budget amendment? Do \nwe need a line-item veto? Absolutely. Because what we are doing around \nhere is not working and is adding up to trillions of dollars of annual \ndeficits.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the scenario takes place as the Senator from Kentucky \njust pointed out, that all of a sudden everything is decided by members \nof the Appropriations Committee, then it does deprive the other members \nof this body of their input into the entire process and takes the \nauthority and responsibility from 100 and puts it in the hands of a \nfew. That seems, to me, a disservice to the people of Arizona whom I \nrepresent.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think the overriding message--and I appreciate the \ncomments from the Senator from Ohio--is that we have a jobs plan and we \nhave our ideas. There is overlap in our ideas with some of the ideas \nfrom the other side.\n  The message is, we are willing to talk to the other side. We are \nwilling to say these are some proposals, and let's try to find areas of \nagreement.\n  We think it is more important than a campaign right now. We think it \nis more important, the joblessness and the economy, that we try to do \nsomething about it. We are willing to come to the table. We are willing \nto bring our ideas, we are willing to have a debate with the other \nside, and we want to get solutions. We are not doing this just to be \npartisan. We want to figure out a way to make our economy better.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Absolutely. Let me give an example of where we could \ncome together on something simple, and again it is something the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky have included in \ntheir legislation.\n  Everybody knows the Federal regulators are putting more and more \npressure on small businesses all around the country. We hear it every \ntime we go home. I can't think of a time I have been home at a plant \ntour where somebody hasn't raised with me a Federal regulation that is \ncausing them difficulty because it is increasing the cost of hiring \nsomebody.\n  At a time of over 9 percent unemployment, we have to do everything we \ncan to get this economy moving, and one is to lessen that regulatory \nburden and make sure it is smart.\n  So one of the pieces of the legislation we are promoting is to say to \nthe Federal agencies: Go through a cost-benefit analysis, including \nlooking at what the impact is going to be on jobs. Who could be against \nthat? That needs to be done not just in the so-called executive branch \nagencies but also in the independent agencies which are not subject to \nthese current cost-benefit rules. It is more cost-benefit rules looking \nat jobs but also making sure everybody has to comply with it.\n  Then, when they come up with an idea for a regulation, make sure it \nis consistent with the policy of the elected representatives because \ntoo often we will see the regulators go off on their own and come up \nwith ideas that they think might be good for the economy. That is one \nreason we have--according to some statistics now--as much of a cost on \nthe economy from regulations as from taxes.\n  Finally, it says when you come up with something, it has to be the \nleast burdensome alternative. If the EPA had done this, for instance, \nin some of the legislation that the Senator is concerned about, the \nSenator from Kentucky, they would not be able to come up with huge new \ncosts on business because they would have to come up with a cost-\neffective way to meet the policies set out by the Congress. They don't \nhave to do that now. Who could be against that?\n  So these are specific items that are within this bigger project of \ngetting America back on track, increasing our jobs, dealing with the \nfact that America's competitiveness is at risk that are commonsense, \nbipartisan ideas everyone should be able to agree with.\n  I again encourage the Senate to allow us to have a vote. Let's \nencourage a full debate on both sides of the aisle. Let's have a \nbipartisan vote on it. Let's show people whom, after all, we are \nelected to represent that we can come together as Republicans and \nDemocrats and deal with the real problems facing our economy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I see the Senator from Washington is here, and I don't \nwant to encroach on her time.\n  I would just like to say we are going to spend a lot more time today \non this issue and this proposal. The American people want change in \nWashington. They want us to address the concerns and problems they \nface, and we believe we have a great blueprint for moving forward in \nthat direction. As my friends from Ohio and Kentucky have said, we are \neager to sit down with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nand discuss at least some of these which we think we can come to \nagreement on. Maybe our approval rating, if we did so, could climb back \nup into double digits.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon \nto discuss the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which is an amendment to help \nput our Nation's veterans back to work that we will be voting on \ntomorrow, on the eve of Veterans Day.\n  The real meaning of Veterans Day is to remind ourselves to take care \nof service-connected veterans and their families. That is what this \namendment does.\n  We all realize, of course, this Chamber has had its share of \ndisagreements and discord lately, and it is no secret that we are \nsharply divided on any number of economic and political issues that are \nfacing average Americans right now. But this is one issue we should \nnever be divided on.\n  I have served on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for over 16 \nyears,\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nand I can tell you that veterans have never been a partisan issue. We \nhave all made a promise to those who signed up to serve, and we all \nneed to keep it. That is why I have been so pleased to work to help put \nthis amendment together in a comprehensive and bipartisan manner.\n  This amendment brings all ideas to the table, Democratic and \nRepublican, Senate and House, those from the President and from Members \nof Congress, and it uses all those ideas to address one of the most \ndaunting and immediate problems facing our Nation's veterans--finding \nwork.\n  On this Veterans Day, after almost 10 years of war, nearly 1 million \nAmerican veterans will be unemployed. It is a crisis that faces nearly \n13 million other Americans. But for our veterans, many of the barriers \nto employment are unique.\n  That is because those who have worn our Nation's uniform, and \nparticularly for those young veterans who spent the last decade being \nshuttled back and forth to war zones half a world away, the road home \nisn't always smooth. The redtape is often long, and the transition from \nthe battlefield to the workplace is never easy.\n  Too often today our veterans are being left behind by their peers who \ndidn't make the same sacrifices for their Nation at a critical time in \ntheir lives. Too often they don't realize the skills they possess and \ntheir value in the workplace is real. Too often our veterans are not \nfinding open doors to new opportunities in their communities.\n  But as those who know the character and experience of our veterans \nunderstand well, that shouldn't be the case. Our veterans have the \nleadership ability, discipline, and technical skills to not only find \nwork but to excel in the economy of the 21st century. That is why, 2 \nyears ago, I began an effort to find out why, despite all the talent \nand drive I know our veterans possess, this problem persists.\n  To get to the crux of this problem, I knew I had to hear firsthand \nfrom those veterans who were struggling to find work. So I crisscrossed \nmy home State of Washington and communities large and small, at worker \nretraining programs, in VA facilities, and in veterans halls. I sat \ndown with veterans themselves to talk about the roadblocks they face. \nWhat I heard was heartbreaking and frustrating.\n  I heard from veterans who said they no longer write that they are a \nveteran on their resume because of the stigma they believe employers \nattach to the invisible wounds of war.\n  I heard from medics who return home from treating battlefield wounds \nand can't get a certification to be an EMT or even to drive an \nambulance. I spoke with veterans who said many employers had trouble \nunderstanding the vernacular they used to describe their experiences in \nan interview or on their resume. I talked to veterans who told me the \nmilitary spent incalculable time getting them the skills to do their \njob in the field but very little time teaching them how to transition \nthe skills they have learned into the workplace when they come home. \nThe problems were sometimes complicated and sometimes simple. Most \nimportantly, though, they were preventable. But the more I relayed the \nconcerns of our States' unemployed veterans to Federal Government \nofficials for answers, the more I realized there were none. It became \nclear that for too long we have invested billions of dollars in \ntraining our young men and women with the skills to protect our Nation \nonly to ignore them once they leave the military. For too long at the \nend of their career we patted our veterans on the back for their \nservice and then pushed them out into the job market--alone.\n\n  That is why in May of this year, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I introduced a bipartisan veterans employment bill \nto ease the transition from the battlefield to the working world. It is \na bill that will allow our men and women in uniform to capitalize on \ntheir service while also making sure the American people capitalize on \nthe investment we have made in them.\n  For the first time it requires broad job skills training for every \nservicemember as they leave the military as part of the military's \nTransition Assistance Program. It allows servicemembers to begin the \nFederal employment process prior to separation in order to facilitate a \ntruly seamless transition from the military to jobs in our government, \nand it requires the Department of Labor to take a hard look at what \nmilitary skills and training should be translatable into the civilian \nsector in order to make it simpler for our veterans to get the licenses \nand certifications they need.\n  All of these are substantial steps to put our veterans to work. Today \nthey are being combined with the other great ideas in this \ncomprehensive amendment that is now before the Senate, including an \nidea championed by my House counterpart, Chairman Miller, that will \nease the employment struggle of our older veterans by providing them \nwith additional education benefits so they can train for today's high-\ndemand jobs, and an idea that has been championed by President Obama, \nSenator Baucus, and many others that provides a tax credit for \nemployers who hire veterans.\n  With this amendment we are taking a huge step forward in rethinking \nthe way we treat our men and women in uniform after they leave the \nmilitary. For many of us, particularly those who grew up with the \nVietnam war, we are also taking steps to avoid the mistakes of the \npast, mistakes that I believe we stand perilously close to repeating.\n  Every day we read about skyrocketing suicide statistics, substantial \nabuse problems, and even rising homelessness among the post-9/11 \ngeneration of veterans. While there are lots of factors that contribute \nto those challenges, failure to give our veterans the self-confidence, \nthe financial security, and dignity that a job provides often plays a \nvery crucial role.\n  On this Veterans Day we need to redouble our efforts to avoid the \nmistakes that have cost our veterans dearly and have weighed on the \ncollective conscience of this Nation. We can do that agreeing to this \namendment, but also by looking back to a time when we stepped up to \nmeet the promises we made to our veterans.\n  I mentioned on the Senate floor many times that my father was a \nveteran of World War II. But what I do not always talk about is the \nfact that when he came home from war, he came home to opportunity--\nfirst at college and then to a job, a job that gave him pride, a job \nthat helped him and my mother raise seven children who have gone on to \nsupport families of their own. This is the legacy of opportunity we \nhave to live up to for our Nation's veterans. The responsibility we \nhave on our shoulders does not end on the battlefield. It does not end \nafter the parades on Friday. In fact, it does not end.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside our differences, to come together \nand meet the challenges of putting our Nation's veterans to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I ask to be recognized for not more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 928\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support \nof the McCain amendment, which is Jobs Through Growth Act. I do not \nthink there is any question that the No. 1 solution to the deep \nfinancial hole in which we find ourselves in this country today is in \neconomic growth. The fact is, we do find ourselves in a very deep \nfinancial hole. Within a day or two, or certainly within the next week, \nwe will surpass the $15 trillion landmark in this country. That would \nbe a problem, $15 trillion worth of debt, if our economy was $100 \ntrillion large, but it is not. It is about $15 trillion large. So our \ndebt-to-equity ratio has now reached 100 percent, which is a very \ndangerous metric.\n  In order to understand how that affects our economy I ask people to \nunderstand or think about how their own personal economy is affected if \nthey are in debt, too deep into personal debt. The fact is, when you \nare in debt over your head you simply cannot increase your consumption \nbecause any extra money you have, just beyond the basics, is spent \nservicing that debt.\n  The exact same dynamic happens with our Nation. We find ourselves in \nway too much debt. Unfortunately, there is no end in sight. The last 3\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\nyears we added $4 trillion to our Nation's debt, and the prospect for \nthis year is that we will add another $1 trillion. During President \nObama's term we will have added $5 trillion to our Nation's debt. This \nscares consumers, and it scares business investors as well. We all \nrecognize when the government gets into this much debt and spends so \nmuch money that it does not have, eventually it will have to take from \nall of us--either in the form of inflation or in the form of taxes.\n  We are simply not coming to grips with the problem. I like to put \nthings into historical perspective as we talk about supposedly cutting \nour budgets. Ten years ago, in 2001, our Nation spent $1.9 trillion. \nThis year we spent $3.6 trillion. We doubled spending in just 10 years. \nThe debate in which we are engaged right now is whether, according to \nPresident Obama's budget, 10 years in the future we will spend $5.7 \ntrillion or, as the House budget calls for, $4.7 trillion.\n\n  Let's take a look at 10-year spending. In the last 10 years we spent \n$28 trillion. Again, the debate is whether in the next 10 years we \nspend $46 trillion, as President Obama budgeted, or whether we would \nspend only $40 trillion.\n  I don't care how we look at it, $40 or $46 trillion is not a cut in \ncomparison to $28 trillion. Unfortunately, the supercommittee that is \ncharged with finding $1.2 trillion worth of savings is at an impasse, \nand it is at an impasse because it looks like my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have walked out. I am afraid they simply do not \nwant a deal because President Obama is already in reelection mode, and \nhe does not want a result so he can run against a do-nothing Congress.\n  I am one Senator who came here willing to work with anybody willing \nto acknowledge the problem and who is willing to work with me, work \nwith our side to seriously address the problem. That is exactly what \nthe six Members, the Republicans on that committee, were trying to do.\n  We all recognize the No. 1 solution to our debt and deficit crisis is \neconomic growth. What is holding back growth? It really is the high \nlevel of uncertainty, the lack of confidence. I say to a great extent \nthat lack of confidence and high level of uncertainty was caused by \nPresident Obama's agenda. There is no doubt about it. He came into \noffice in tough economic circumstances, but his policies have made the \nsituation far worse. They have moved us 180 degrees in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I mentioned the $15 trillion worth of debt. President Obama's budget \nwould have added $12 trillion, but that understates the problem because \nwe underestimate the cost of health care. That will add trillions of \ndollars as more employers drop coverage and people go on the exchanges \nat highly subsidized rates. The fact we are not achieving the projected \ngrowth rates in those budgets will add trillions. If we only average \n2.5 percent growth, that will add $3 trillion to our debt and deficit \nover the next 10 years.\n  What do global investors, what do American investors take a look at \nwhen they look at the U.S. economy? If we are going to be investing in \nbusiness, if we are going to grow our economy. If we look around the \nworld and say where are there economies growing, it is not the United \nStates. It is China, it is India, it is in places like Brazil. Strike \n1.\n  Take a look at the tax environment and look at the United States, \nwith one of the highest tax rates in the world, at 35 percent, and \nstrike 2.\n  Then we look at the regulatory environment and we are going to \nrealize, according to President Obama's own Small Business \nAdministration, that the cost of complying with Federal regulations is \n$1.75 trillion. Think about that. Put that in perspective. That is a \nnumber that is larger than all but eight economies in the world. It is \n12 percent the size of our economy. That is what we burden our job \ncreators with each and every single year. Strike 3.\n  We need a growth agenda. We need to recognize that America needs to \nbe an attractive place for business expansion and job creation. The \nJobs Through Growth Act recognizes that and it utilizes pieces of \nlegislation that are already available to actually address the problem. \nWe need a credible plan to restrain the growth in government.\n  As I pointed out earlier, that is all we are doing. We are not \ncutting government, we are just restraining the growth in government. \nWe absolutely need dramatic, significant tax reform. Our marginal tax \nrates are too high, our Tax Code is 70,000 pages long and costs $200 \nbillion to $300 billion to comply with. We need to utilize our God-\ngiven natural resources in this country. We need an energy utilization \npolicy that will create hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs \nover the next decade or two.\n  We need free trade. It must be fair, but we need to recognize as \nthese billions of people around the world seek to improve their lives \nand develop their economies, it actually offers us a phenomenal market \nopportunity. We cannot be afraid of that. We need to embrace it. We \nneed to understand that we do not have a choice whether we are going to \ncompete in this world. We must compete, and we are certainly capable. \nWe have the finest, most productive workers in the world.\n  Finally, we absolutely need regulatory reform. Part of the Jobs \nThrough Growth Act is a bill I introduced a couple of months ago called \nthe Regulation Moratorium and Jobs Preservation Act of 2011. It is a \npretty simple bill. It basically says until our economy gets back on \nits feet again we will stop issuing new rules and new regulations that \nharm economic growth until the unemployment rate drops below the level \nit was when President Obama took office, which would be 7.8 percent. It \nis a reasonable proposal, one I hope can gain bipartisan support.\n  I have to believe every Member of Congress, like me, is visited daily \nby businesses in their district and in their State. They are coming to \nWashington and calling us on the phone and describing the harm that \nPresident Obama's regulatory agencies are inflicting on their ability \nto create jobs.\n  I urge all of my colleague to support the very sensible legislation, \nthe Jobs Through Growth Act.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this Friday we will celebrate Veterans \nDay, and this year we will also be celebrating Military Families Month. \nIt is time to recommit ourselves to helping every military family, as \nthe First Lady and Dr. Biden are doing with a program called Joining \nForces to address the unique needs of those who serve and the needs of \ntheir families.\n  We as a Congress and as a nation need to do exactly that. We need to \nreach across the aisle. We need to put aside our differences and join \nforces. We need to help businesses help veterans and their spouses \nbuild careers. We need to make sure schools are doing all they can to \nhelp military children. We need to promote community involvement by \nasking all of us to do what we can to help military families in our \nlocal communities. But there is more we can and should do to honor our \nheroes.\n  Honoring our heroes means providing jobs and job training and every \njob opportunity possible to unemployed veterans in my State of New \nJersey, where we have over 450,000 veterans, 12 percent of them \nunemployed. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the VOW to Hire \nHeroes Act.\n  Every year, 160,000 Active-Duty servicemembers and 110,000 National \nGuardsmen and reservists come home. When they transition to civilian \nlife and are looking for options to get back to work at home, they need \nto know that someone will be there to help them, that businesses will \nhelp them to start new careers or continue where they left off. We \nshould be giving businesses a tax credit for hiring a returning veteran \nand giving them more of a tax credit if they hire a wounded veteran.\n  I would like to see American businesses pledge to hire 100,000 \nveterans or their spouses by the end of next year. I\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\ndon't think that is asking too much. I hope my colleagues don't think \nthat is too much either. I don't think it is too much to ask Congress--\nboth parties, without the politics, in a bipartisan effort--to honor \nour veterans by passing a veterans jobs bill the President can sign \ninto law.\n  As we approach Veterans Day, as our last troops come home from Iraq, \nas our military presence around the world enters a post-Iraq era, we \nneed to commit ourselves as a nation to helping every one of our men \nand women in uniform, particularly in these hard economic times. This \nyear, with the unemployment rate for veterans at almost 12 percent \nnationally, as it is in New Jersey, with nearly 1 million unemployed \nveterans nationwide, I would hope we can find bipartisan support for \nsomething we should all be able to agree on; that is, jobs for \nveterans. That is the VOW to Hire Veterans Act. Veterans cannot and \nshould not have to wait for the help they deserve. No delays, no \nfilibusters, no politics--just a bill for the President to sign and \nhelp for our Nation's veterans now. To me, that is about fairness and \nit is about keeping our promise to our veterans.\n  I think we can always do better for our veterans and their families, \nand every veteran deserves better. Our duty to them is not just \nremembering their service. It is not just saying ``thank you'' once or \ntwice a year on Veterans Day or Memorial Day--and we certainly should \nmarch in a Veterans Day parade or go to a Memorial Day observance. We \nshould do those things. This is also about delivering on the promise of \na grateful nation every day. It means providing the health care and \nservices veterans need when they come home and helping them transition \nback into the workforce.\n  Our brave men and women did not wait to sign up to serve their \ncountry, and they should not have to wait to get the benefits they \nearned defending it. They should not have to come home only to stand on \nthe unemployment line after putting themselves on the line serving \ntheir Nation. That is why I am proud to have cosponsored a good, solid, \nbipartisan jobs package to help our military men and women transition \nfrom their work defending our Nation's freedoms to civilian work \nrebuilding our Nation's economy. It would ensure that disabled veterans \nwho have exhausted their unemployment benefits get the training and \nrehabilitation they need, the counseling they need, the vocational \nrehabilitation and employment benefits they need, and job assistance \ntailored to a 21st-century job market.\n  It establishes a competitive grant program for nonprofits that \nprovide mentoring and training programs for veterans. It allows \nemployers to be paid for providing on-the-job training to veterans.\n  It would provide returning heroes and wounded warriors work \nopportunity tax credits for businesses that hire veterans and more for \nbusinesses that hire disabled veterans. The credit for unemployed \nveterans expired at the end of 2010. This provision is essentially a \nwork opportunity tax credit for hiring vets, a credit up to $2,400 for \nshort-term unemployed and up to $5,600 for long-term unemployed and an \nincreased credit of up to $9,600 for hiring unemployed wounded \nveterans.\n  I fully support and believe in this bill. We made a promise to \nveterans, and it is a promise we must keep. So while I believe reducing \nthe deficit is a critical issue, we cannot and should not balance the \nbudget on the backs of those who have served. Veterans are not \nbankrupting America, they are protecting it. It is not veterans \nprograms, health care, or services that should be cut.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again: A grateful nation not only \nhonors its heroes once a year on Veterans Day or Memorial Day, but it \nbetter be able to look every veteran in the eye when he or she comes \nhome from service and say: We meant what we said, and we will keep our \npromise.\n  We must be prepared to deliver on that promise. I certainly am. I \ncome to this Chamber on behalf of every New Jerseyan to say to every \nman and woman who has served in uniform and to the more than 450,000 \nveterans in my home State of New Jersey that we will keep working for \nfairness for every veteran and their family. There will always be \npolitical obstacles in our way, but we will fight the good fight to \nkeep our promise to you, as you have served us. Be assured that you \nhave the respect and thanks of a grateful nation for the sacrifices you \nand your families have made. To me, that thanks is ultimately \ndemonstrated not by what we say but by how we act.\n  May God bless our troops, and may this opportunity be an example of \nour willingness to come together on behalf of those who wear the \nuniform and serve the Nation and have the gratitude of a grateful \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's second-degree amendment is the \npending question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there any unanimous consent on speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will continue to discuss the pending \namendment before the Senate, and I would yield such time, without \nyielding the floor, as the Senator from Tennessee may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                      Residential Mortgage Market\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill we introduced \ncalled the Residential Mortgage Market Privatization and \nStandardization Act. I wish to speak briefly on this bill that deals \nwith the pressing issue that I know the Senator from Arizona probably \nas much as anybody in the Senate has spoken about and has championed \nfor many years.\n  The current dynamic permit conservatorship is not sustainable with \nFannie and Freddie and the GSEs as they are today. There has been \ndiscussion about various things happening with these organizations. The \nFHFA, which actually regulates Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, is begging \nCongress for direction but, in their words, is only getting mixed \nsignals. Today, we introduced a bill to give a very clear direction as \nto what ought to happen to these major GSEs.\n  Together, they sit atop $5 trillion in obligations, plus hundreds of \nthousands of our REO properties--in other words, properties they have \ntaken back and are now overseeing throughout America. With a $5 \ntrillion book, any mistake they make is very expensive, and obviously \nthe taxpayers of this country know full well that billions of dollars \ncontinue to flow in these organizations to keep them afloat. Yet these \norganizations today are lameduck organizations with no clear guidance \non their future. They really have no idea what the future holds. The \norganizations themselves basically are treading water.\n  Over the most recent decade, Fannie and Freddie became corporate \nwelfare schemes for mortgage banks. There is no question that what was \nhappening was the governance balance sheet was helping fund corporate \nwelfare programs or basically mortgage brokers could sell off to Fannie \nand Freddie mortgages they had put in place and have them guaranteed.\n  As they raced to the bottom to lower guarantee fees so they could \ntake a bigger market share for the biggest mortgage originators, they \nactually helped fuel the housing bubble that has led us to where we are \ntoday. There is no question about it.\n  So many people talk about Fannie and Freddie and say that without \nthem, we would not have affordability in housing. Well, at the end of \nthe day, Fannie and Freddie don't make housing more affordable. What \nthey do is simply make interest rates too low. What that actually does \nis push up home prices. That is the exact equation that occurs in this \nprocess. Housing affordability is determined by your monthly mortgage \npayment. Fannie and Freddie make interest rates cheap, but the price of \nhousing ends up being more expensive as a result of that. So, in \neffect, the taxpayer is suddenly on the hook for losses when these \nhousing prices are pushed up, and the fact is we end up having a bubble \nlike we have had.\n  The market can and will take over the functions of mortgage credit \nrisk if we make the transition in an intelligent way, and that is what \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\ndoes. Our plan phases out Fannie and Freddie over 10 years, but it does \nso in a way that allows for feedback from the markets. Gradually \nreducing the guarantee share of new mortgage-backed securities allows \nus to see the market's price credit risk. We also add transparency to \nthe market by making the valuable data at the GSEs publicly available.\n  One of the things that has happened in both Fannie and Freddie \nthrough the years is that they have developed, obviously, more \nexpertise than any entities in the country because they, in essence, \nhave been almost monopolies in this process. So what we would like to \ndo is make that data publicly available to folks who will be doing this \non the private side.\n  Uniform documents managing the servicing process will give investors \nand homeowners alike certainty in how they will be treated by their \nservice. This is part of the plumbing of a system that needs to be \naddressed, and our plan does that.\n  In other words, this plan not only phases down Fannie and Freddie \nover a 10-year period through a process that gives market signals so we \ncan understand what is happening in the marketplace as it is occurring, \nbut it also creates a mechanism for private investors to come back into \nthe market. Ten years from now, under our plan, we will have a housing \nfinance system based more on market fundamentals free of taxpayer risk \nand more able to price credit appropriately.\n  The idea that the private market cannot price credit risk is a total \nred herring. The biggest risk in a 30-year fixed rate mortgage is the \nprepayment risk. This is called convexity in bond market parlance. The \nprivate market has already figured this out. We have homeowners \nthroughout our country who constantly prepay mortgages and the market \nhas figured out a way to price this. So private lenders can and will \nprice credit risk. We have just been very accustomed to the government \nselling this too cheaply, but the market can easily price this. All we \nneed to do is put those mechanisms in place that allow the private \nsector to be able to do that.\n  It is time to move beyond Fannie and Freddie. We cannot pretend this \nproblem away. Our plan is thoughtful, and it will earn back private \ncapital over time.\n  We have offered a piece of legislation that we think is something \nthat can receive bipartisan support. It allows Fannie and Freddie to be \nphased out over time. It allows us to see market signals as they are \noccurring. It allows--and the Presiding Officer and I know because we \nhave worked on this and looked at these things in the Banking Committee \nitself--it allows us to actually put in place those mechanisms that \nwill allow the private sector to come in and backfill as the guarantee \ncontinues to diminish over time.\n  I am offering this bill hopefully to be a marker. If people want to \nchange it and talk with us about things that they think might enhance \nthis bill, we are open to that. But we believe at this time, a year and \na half after Dodd-Frank passed, it is time for us to actually begin \nlooking at a real way to phase down Fannie's and Freddie's involvement \nin the marketplace. I hope Republicans and Democrats will join with us \nand try to make this bill better if they wish to do that, but certainly \nmove us in a direction of doing something that is thoughtful and will \nmove us along toward a private market in residential finance.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. As \nSenator Corker knows, we had an amendment on the Dodd-Frank bill to do \naway with Fannie and Freddie over a 5-year period. I think it is \nobvious that the Senator from Tennessee has done a lot of homework and \nin-depth examination of this issue. But I think the Senator from \nTennessee would agree that what went on with Fannie and Freddie is one \nof the worst crimes inflicted on the American people all during the \n1990s and well into 2000 and which was a major contributor to the \nhousing collapse, which then triggered the financial collapse which we \nstill haven't recovered from. I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee \nwishes to elaborate.\n  Mr. CORKER. Well, I don't think there is any question. I know the \nSenator from Arizona has been a reformer all of his life. What we find \nin this body is we end up having a corporate welfare system built \naround many of the things we do here. As much as I hate to say it, both \nsides of the aisle through time empowered this organization to be what \nit is. We have built an industry in our country around ensuring that \nthe status quo stays in place. It is unfortunate. As the Senator from \nArizona knows, as well or better than anybody in this body, the \ntaxpayers are bearing the brunt of this. To me, it is way past time for \nus to deal with this.\n  I know many people say, Well, in the height of the housing crisis, \nthis is not the time. But the fact is, the way this bill is crafted--\nand it sounds as though the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, \nwhich I remember supporting strongly--generally would have phased out \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac over a period of time. I think we have gone \nto tremendous extremes to phase this out in a way that makes sense and \nallows the private sector to come back. If we think about the type of \nfinance that takes place in this country around all types of \ncomplexities, there is no reason, as long as we create the proper \nstructure for the TBA market for the private market to function, there \nis no reason that the private sector cannot do this on its own.\n  It is amazing, when we think about what has happened with low \ninterest rates. Most homeowners in our country look at the payment they \nare going to make. When you have artificially low rates, what happens? \nThe price of housing actually goes up, so we end up in a situation \nwhere we have this bubble and prices drop tremendously, and then what \nhappens? The taxpayer ends up bearing the brunt of it.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from Arizona, who has always \ntaken on tough issues, and maybe I am responding longer than he wants \nme to. This is one of those issues where I know that many people back \nhome--candidly, there is a whole industry that is built around this, \nand I know a lot of times people don't want to take on something, don't \nwant to change something like that because they know it is tough back \nhome. I am glad the Senator from Arizona has championed this issue the \nway he has. As he mentioned, we have done a lot of work on it also. I \nthink this is a sensible bill that will allow our country to get back \nwhere it needs to be. I know the Americans the Senator from Arizona so \nwell represents and cares so deeply about these transgressions on our \ncitizens--I know they will support this if we will allow this type of \nlegislation to come to the floor and be voted on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the Senator from Tennessee--and I want to get \nback to the jobs bill--but I think the Senator from Tennessee would \nagree, as long as Fannie and Freddie are in existence and have the \nopportunity to behave in a manner that they did in the past, we risk \nanother housing bubble followed by a housing collapse. That is why I \nthink the Senator's proposal is something that deserves our attention \nand that of the country, so we don't have a repetition of the pain that \nthe people in Tennessee and Arizona are experiencing today.\n  Nearly half the homes in my home State of Arizona are under water. \nThey are worth less than their mortgage payments. As long as that is \nthe case, it is going to be very difficult to see a way for a strong \neconomic recovery to take place. I think phasing Fannie and Freddie out \nis probably one of the key elements in bringing about not only \nbeneficial change--and a number of other things have to happen too--but \nto prevent the kind of catastrophe that was visited on us in 2008.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is interesting, when we have a bubble that is taking \nplace, a lot of times the private sector becomes very concerned that a \nbubble is developing and they begin to slow down the process. They \nbegin to see that, wait a minute, there is a lot of risk here, it is \ngetting pretty frothy. The housing prices in Arizona and California and \nother places are getting awfully high. Maybe we should be cutting back. \nBut as long as there is a government entity on the other side of that \nthat is going to take all the risk and they can dump it off to them--\nall it is is a machine, and the more they do, the more money they make. \nThat is what is missing in this current formula.\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\nThere is no gauge there to slow the process when the bubble is becoming \noverheated. That is one of the huge contributing factors that I know \nthe Senator has talked about a great deal to what we saw.\n\n  Candidly, the reason the Senator is offering this jobs bill today is \nbecause we have been through such a financial crisis and it has brought \nour country to its knees. On top of that, we have had a tremendous \namount of regulation that has enhanced the slowdown even more. But the \nfact is, I would say to the Senator from Arizona, he might not be \noffering this piece of legislation that he has done such a great job \nleading on today had it not been for this bubble that was created. He \nmight not even be here today. We might be talking about a totally \ndifferent subject on the Senate floor.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and for his time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and he also has been \none who is more than willing to take on the tough challenges and issues \nwe face, with a commitment to a bipartisanship that I think we all \nneed. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to inform my colleagues that I \nhave a lot to say about this jobs bill. There is no unanimous consent \nagreement. I believe this is of transcendent importance. I see the \nSenator from Minnesota here. I apologize ahead of time, but we only \nhave until tomorrow morning to address this issue. This is a compelling \nissue for this Nation. I intend to talk for a fairly extended period of \ntime.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, this amendment is identical to the \nJobs Through Growth Act which was introduced on October 17. I am \npleased about joining most of my Republican colleagues--and I wish to \nhighlight the hard work done by my colleagues Senators Paul and Portman \nin putting this legislation together. In fact, I wish to thank all of \nthe Senators, and some of them bipartisan, who put this jobs bill \ntogether. It requires a lot of discussion. There are issues of \ntranscendent importance.\n  I don't have to tell any American how difficult our economic times \nare, how slow the recovery has been, if at all, the risk of further \nrecession, and it is time we did something different. I would point out \nto my colleagues that for 2 years the other party had control of this \nbody and had control of the House of Representatives--for 2 years, \nuntil the 2010 election. During that period of time, we passed a \nstimulus bill, we passed health care reform, we passed other big \nspending bills, all on the promise that the American economy would \nrecover. It didn't. In fact, by any measurement, things are far worse \nthan they were in January of 2009.\n  As the President has a jobs bill and the majority leader has put \nforth legislation as part of that jobs bill, we Republicans have a jobs \nbill. I know my friends on the other side of the Capitol also agree \nwholeheartedly with the majority of what we are proposing today. The \ndifference between our plan and theirs is that we want to create jobs \nthrough growth and they want to create jobs through government \nspending, through spending and borrowing and taxing. That doesn't work. \nWhat they have proposed amounts to nothing more than another stimulus \nbill, and we saw that movie before. It added to our debt and our \ndeficit, and we lost jobs.\n  Today, my colleagues and I are putting forth a plan to create jobs \nthrough sound policies. Economic growth is a fundamental part of long-\nterm, sustainable job creation, and that is what our plan offers the \nAmerican people.\n  I wish to quote from an article in Forbes magazine by Peter Ferrara \nentitled ``The GOP Jobs Plan Vs. Obama's.''\n\n       Senate Republicans have taken the lead in proposing a jobs \n     plan alternative to President Obama's in the form of the Jobs \n     Through Growth Act, led by Senators John McCain, Rand Paul of \n     Kentucky, and Rob Portman of Ohio. Republicans are remarkably \n     unified behind these economic and jobs growth ideas, with \n     House Republicans having already long supported or even \n     passed several components of that plan.\n       The 28 components of their program add up to exciting \n     prospects for finally sparking the long overdue economic \n     recovery, based on proven economic logic, and proven \n     experience concerning what works in the real world. Most \n     important are the proposals for both corporate and individual \n     tax reform, closing loopholes in return for reducing the \n     rates.\n       Lower marginal tax rates are the key to providing the \n     necessary incentives for economic growth and prosperity. The \n     marginal tax rate is the rate on the next dollar to be earned \n     from any investment, enterprise, or productive activity. That \n     is the key because it determines how much the producer is \n     allowed to keep out of the next unit of what he or she \n     produces.\n       At a 50-percent marginal tax rate, the producer can keep \n     only half of any increased production. If that rate is \n     reduced to 25 percent, the portion the producer can keep \n     grows by 50 percent, from one half to three fourths. That \n     powerfully increases the incentives for more productive \n     activity, such as savings, investment, starting new \n     businesses, expanding businesses, creating jobs, \n     entrepreneurship, and work.\n       The Republican Jobs Plan involves closing the special \n     interest loopholes that enable Obama corporate cronies such \n     as General Electric to get away with paying no taxes on $14 \n     billion in corporate profits, in return for reducing rates to \n     internationally competitive levels. The U.S. suffers \n     virtually the highest corporate tax rate in the \n     industrialized world, nearly 40 percent, with a 35 percent \n     federal rate, and another nearly 5 percent in state corporate \n     rates on average.\n       Even Communist China enjoys a 25% corporate rate. In the \n     supposedly mostly socialist European Union, the corporate \n     rate on average is even lower than that. In formerly \n     socialist Canada, the federal corporate rate is 16.5%, going \n     down to 15% next year.\n       The GOP Plan would reduce the federal 35% rate to 25%, \n     which is the minimum reduction to restore international \n     competitiveness for American companies. Note that closing \n     loopholes may well raise the average corporate rate, on which \n     Democrats and liberals have focused, but it is the marginal \n     tax rate that drives the economy. . . .\n       The GOP Jobs Plan also includes reducing the top personal, \n     individual income tax rate to 25% as well, in return for \n     closing loopholes. The Ryan budget already passed by the \n     House would apply that rate to family incomes over $100,000, \n     with a 10% rate applying to incomes below. Those rate \n     reductions would powerfully boost incentives as well, as \n     proven by the dramatic response to the Reagan tax rate \n     reductions in the 1980s. . . .\n       Another component of the plan would eliminate the double \n     taxation of U.S. corporate profits earned abroad by the U.S. \n     ``worldwide'' corporate tax code, which adds U.S. taxes on \n     top of the taxes on foreign profits by the host country. The \n     GOP plan calls for adopting the ``territorial'' tax code of \n     most of our international competitors, which allows profits \n     to be taxed in the country where they are earned, and not \n     again when they are brought home. That would unlock for \n     reinvestment in the U.S. the $1.4 trillion in American \n     corporate profits earned overseas that remain parked there to \n     avoid U.S. double taxation.\n       The GOP Jobs Plan also recognizes the enormous problem of \n     excessive, runaway regulation, which increases the cost of \n     production, and so further discourages it. Reducing such \n     costs would consequently increase production, economic \n     growth, and jobs.\n       Step one in the plan to reduce such regulatory burdens is \n     to repeal Obamacare, with its employer mandate adding to the \n     cost of each job by requiring employers to buy more \n     expensive, politically driven health insurance coverage for \n     every employee. That repeal would also reduce future taxes \n     and spending by trillions as well.\n       Further critical relief would result from the GOP Jobs Plan \n     plank to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is threatening to squelch \n     credit for businesses and consumers essential to jobs and \n     recovery. The GOP proposal cites research showing that higher \n     costs for financial services resulting from Dodd-Frank would \n     cost the economy nearly 5 million jobs by 2015.\n       Another critical area of overregulation is energy. The \n     Republican program would require the Interior Department to \n     move forward in order to free up leasing and development of \n     drilling on public lands onshore. It also eliminates EPA foot \n     dragging on air permits necessary for offshore drilling, and \n     removes EPA authority for unnecessary and burdensome \n     greenhouse gas regulation altogether. This deregulation would \n     ensure a steady supply of low cost energy, essential to \n     booming economic growth.\n       Also in the proposal is the REINS (Regulations from the \n     Executive In Need of Scrutiny) Act, which would require \n     Congressional approval of all major federal regulations \n     imposing more than $100 million a year in costs. This will \n     reestablish the original Congressional check on Executive \n     power, and democratic accountability for regulatory burdens, \n     so politicians can no longer hide behind faceless bureaucrats \n     to evade public scrutiny for regulatory drains on our freedom \n     and prosperity. This would provide an important solution to \n     excessive regulatory burdens and costs across the board.\n       The Tea Party will favor the plan's plank for a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which would include \n     necessary tax and spending limitations in the Constitution. \n     Also included is a statutory line item veto, giving the \n     President more power to cut spending. Reduced government \n     spending, deficits and debt will reduce the government drain \n     on resources in the private economy needed to create jobs and \n     growth.\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\n       Finally, the plan even includes a provision for free trade, \n     giving the President renewed fast track authority to \n     negotiate further trade agreements eliminating foreign trade \n     barriers and opening new markets for American goods. For \n     nearly 3 years, President Obama failed to even send to \n     Congress free trade agreements President Bush had negotiated \n     with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But that didn't stop \n     him from political rhetoric blaming Congress for failing to \n     pass them, though Congress did approve them within weeks of \n     Obama finally submitting them. That abusive rhetorical style \n     veers into dishonorable.\n       The GOP program is an exciting, comprehensive strategy for \n     creating another generation-long economic boom. It includes \n     all the components of Reaganomics under Congressional \n     control--lower tax rates, deregulation, and restrained \n     spending. Besides the economic logic of each of these \n     components discussed above, the experience with Reaganomics \n     proves the plan will work within a year or so of adoption to \n     get the economy booming again.\n       After Reaganomics was adopted in 1981, the economy took off \n     on a 25-year economic boom in late 1982, what Art Laffer and \n     Steve Moore have rightly called the greatest period of wealth \n     creation in the history of the planet. Twenty million new \n     jobs were created in the first 7 years alone, even while an \n     historic inflation was tamed. American economic growth during \n     the 80s was the equivalent of adding the third largest \n     economy in the world, West Germany, to the American economy.\n       By contrast, Obama's Jobs Plan is recycled, brain dead, \n     Keynesian economics already tried and failed throughout the \n     Obama Administration, and all around the world for decades \n     before wherever it has been tried. It is about half the size \n     of Obama's nearly one trillion dollar 2009 so-called stimulus \n     plan, but contains otherwise the same policies. That 2009 \n     stimulus didn't stimulate anything except runaway government \n     spending, deficits and debt.\n       Part of the jobs plan is devoted to increased government \n     spending on supposed infrastructure, which only recalls the \n     laughable ``shovel ready'' jobs of Obama's 2009 stimulus \n     (even Obama has joked about it). Another part is increased \n     spending to bail out spendthrift Democrat states, which Obama \n     calls hiring more teachers, firemen and cops (a state and \n     local government function, not a federal function).\n       But economic growth is not based on increased government \n     spending, a fallacy which Wall Street Journal senior \n     economics writer Steve Moore has rightly labeled ``tooth \n     fairy'' economics. That is because the money for \n     such spending needs to come from somewhere, and so drains \n     the private sector to the extent of such increased \n     government spending, leaving no net effect in any event.\n       What drives economic growth and prosperity is incentives \n     for increased production, as Reaganomics proved. Obama's \n     assault on such incentives is why trillions are sitting on \n     corporate and bank balance sheets, and America is suffering a \n     capital strike and capital flight. The Occupy Wall Street \n     protestors in threatening property and profits are just \n     further undermining incentives and contributing to that \n     capital strike and capital flight, which only contributes \n     further to extended and increased unemployment.\n       The other half of the jobs plan includes temporary payroll \n     tax cuts, which are a continuation and expansion of temporary \n     payroll tax cuts Obama convinced the December, 2010 lame duck \n     Congress to adopt for this year. But such temporary tax \n     reductions do not stimulate economic growth and jobs either, \n     as permanent cuts and incentives are necessary for permanent \n     jobs. That was just proved by the failure of this year's \n     temporary payroll tax cut to promote the long overdue \n     recovery.\n       But even worse than the 2009 stimulus is that this current \n     half stimulus echo is accompanied by Obama's proposal for \n     $1.5 trillion in permanent tax increases. That now includes \n     Obama's support for a 5% millionaire's surtax. Those \n     permanent increases only further reduce incentives for \n     production, and only contribute further to economic downturn \n     and stagnation under any economic theory.\n       Those tax increases, moreover, would come on top of all the \n     tax increases Obama has already enacted under current law for \n     2013, which major media institutions as well as most of the \n     public are unaware. In that year, the Obamacare tax increases \n     go into effect, and the Bush tax cuts expire, which Obama has \n     refused to renew for the nation's job creators, investors, \n     and more significant small businesses. Under those tax \n     increases, the top tax rates for every major federal tax, \n     except the corporate income tax, already virtually the \n     highest in the industrialized world, with no relief in sight. \n     . . .\n       In sharp contrast to Reaganomics, such Keynesian \n     Obamanomics has already failed miserably to generate a timely \n     recovery consistent with the history of the American economy. \n     Before this last recession, since the Great Depression, \n     recessions in America have lasted an average of 10 months, \n     with the longest previously lasting 16 months. But here we \n     are 46 months after the last recession started, and still no \n     real economic recovery, with unemployment still [at] 9%, the \n     longest period of unemployment that high since the Great \n     Depression.\n       Moreover, it cannot be said this is because the recession \n     was so bad, as the experience in America has been the deeper \n     the recession the stronger the recovery. Based on these \n     historical precedents, we should be nearing the end of the \n     second year of a booming economy right now. In this crisis, \n     for Obama to now just advocate more of the same, with only \n     new, warmed over rhetoric, is a complete abdication of \n     leadership. Moreover, at this point, outdated economists \n     still peddling hoary Keynesian fallacies should be subject to \n     civil liability for fraud.\n       As I explain in my new publication just out this week from \n     Encounter Books, ``Obama and the Crash of 2013,'' more likely \n     than recovery is a renewed double dip recession in 2013, with \n     all the tax rate increases, regulatory burdens building to a \n     crescendo, rising interest rates by then, etc. resulting from \n     Obamanomics. Congressional Republicans should just tell Obama \n     thanks, but no thanks, on his Jobs Plan, and pass their own \n     plan proven to work. Then they can insist he explain to the \n     public why he stands in the way.\n\n  It is a very interesting article there in Forbes, and it is a fairly \nlong one, but I think it puts in adequately the argument for adoption \nof this legislation, but it also points out one of the results.\n  I would point out, in Investors Business Daily, an editorial entitled \n``Better in Rwanda.'' It says:\n\n       The U.S. has slipped again in world rankings that assess \n     the ease of starting a new business. If we're to bring down \n     our stubbornly high unemployment rate, this trend has to be \n     reversed.\n       According to the World Bank's ``Doing Business 2012'' \n     report, America is 13th among 183 countries ranked in the \n     ``Starting a Business'' category. In the 2011 report, the \n     U.S. ranked 11th. The year before, it was No. 8.\n       In 2009, the U.S. was ranked No. 6. It was fourth in 2008 \n     and third in 2007.\n\n  These are not Republican documents. This is not a Republican \nassessment. This is the assessment according to the World Bank: that \ndoing business in the United States of America has gone from the third \nbest country to do business in, in 2007, to 13th in 2012.\n  This is ample and adequate proof that we have borrowed too much, we \nhave taxed too much, we have issued so many regulations that we have \npeople such as Mr. Langone, the founder of Home Depot--who I will quote \nfrom in a minute--who says that today he could not start Home Depot all \nover again, one of the great success stories, by the way, in recent \nyears.\n\n       In the 2012 ranking, the U.S. trailed such job creators as \n     Macedonia, Georgia, Rwanda, Belarus, Saudi Arabia, Armenia \n     and Puerto Rico, which are ranked No. 6 through No. 12.\n       Big companies aren't usually founded as multinational \n     corporations. Most begin as small businesses. And it's small \n     businesses--which employ more than half of the domestic \n     nongovernment workforce--that generate the bulk of new \n     employment opportunities.\n\n  From this article:\n\n       Our own research shows that small businesses create more \n     than 80% of the new jobs in this country. This isn't some \n     fantasy we've cooked up. It's been confirmed in the New York \n     Times by reporter Steve Lohr, who wrote in September that \n     it's an ``irrefutable conclusion that small businesses are \n     this country's jobs creators. Two-thirds of net new jobs are \n     created by companies with fewer than 500 employees,'' Lohr \n     wrote, ``which is the government's definition of a small \n     business.''\n       But job creation is more than a function of size. Lohr \n     cites a National Bureau of Economic Research report that says \n     the age of a business is the biggest factor. ``Start-ups,'' \n     says John C. Haltiwanger, a coauthor of the study and an \n     economist at the University of Maryland, ``are where the job \n     creation really actually occurs.''\n       Yet it's the small and new businesses that are being choked \n     by government policy. The capital gains tax rate on \n     investments held more than a year, Lohr wrote, directly \n     impacts angel investors' role in providing seed capital for \n     startups. This is a rate that the administration wants to \n     hike from 15% to 20% on households earning more than $250,000 \n     a year.\n       That's just a single instance of poor public policy. There \n     are many more in the 160,000 pages of federal regulations and \n     in the web of state and local rules that squeeze small \n     businesses and start-ups so tightly that they simply cannot \n     hire. Until this burden is lifted, America's jobs problem is \n     not going to get any better.\n\n  Quite an indictment that the United States of America, the beacon of \nliberty and hope and freedom, an example to all the world, has gone \nfrom the third best place to do business, to start a business in the \nworld, now to No. 13 in just 5 short years.\n  So what is the result? I would point out to my colleagues that a \nperson such as Mr. Langone, whom I have watched on television on \nseveral occasions, certainly an outspoken individual to say the least, \nsays he could not start his business again under the present \nenvironment.\n  I quote from a Wall Street Journal article, October 15, 2010, \nentitled, ``Stop\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nBashing Business, Mr. President,'' by Ken Langone.\n  The subtitle is, ``If we tried to start The Home Depot today, it's a \nstone cold certainty that it would never have gotten off the ground.''\n  I quote from his article.\n\n       If we tried to start Home Depot today, under the kind of \n     onerous regulatory controls that you have advocated--\n\n  Mr. Langone is writing to the President in this--\n\n       If we tried to start Home Depot today, under the kind of \n     onerous regulatory controls that you have advocated, it's a \n     stone cold certainty that our business would never get off \n     the ground, much less thrive.\n\n  It is quite an indictment. He goes on to say:\n\n       Rules against providing stock options would have prevented \n     us from incentivizing worthy employees in the start-up \n     phase--never mind the incredibly high cost of regulatory \n     compliance overall and mandatory health insurance. Still \n     worse are the ever-\n     rapacious trial lawyers.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I stand behind no one in my enthusiasm and dedication to \n     improving our society and especially our health care. It is \n     worth adding that it makes little sense to send Treasury \n     checks to high net-worth people in the form of Social \n     Security. That includes you, me and scores of members of \n     Congress. Why not cut through that red tape, apply a basic \n     means test to that program to make sure that money actually \n     reduces federal national spending and isn't simply shifted \n     elsewhere.\n\n  So it is a very interesting article. He says:\n\n       A little more than 30 years ago, Bernie Marcus, Arthur \n     Blank, Pat Farrah and I got together and founded The Home \n     Depot. Our dream was to create a new kind of home-\n     improvement center catering to do-it-yourselfers. The concept \n     was to have a wide assortment, a high level of service, and \n     the lowest pricing possible. We opened the front door in \n     1979, also a time of severe economic slowdown. Yet today, \n     Home Depot is staffed by more than 325,000 dedicated, well-\n     trained and highly motivated people offering outstanding \n     service and knowledge to millions of consumers.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       If we tried to start Home Depot today, under the kind of \n     onerous regulatory controls that you have advocated, it's a \n     stone cold certainty that our business would never get off \n     the ground, much less thrive.\n\n  A man by the name of Jim McNerney is the CEO of Boeing Company. He \nwrites: ``What Business Wants From Washington.'' Again, I quote from \nOctober 31, 2011. Mr. McNerney says:\n\n       America works best when American business and government \n     complement one another: Business plays the vital role in \n     economic expansion and job creation, while government \n     oversees the environment in which businesses can innovate \n     and compete. This approach fueled prosperity for \n     generations and produced the world's largest and most \n     powerful economy. We seem far adrift of that ideal today. \n     The regulatory climate is a perfect example. A tsunami of \n     new rules and regulations from an alphabet soup of federal \n     agencies is paralyzing investment and increasing by tens \n     of billions of dollars the compliance costs for small and \n     large businesses.\n       No one wants to discard truly meaningful public safety or \n     environmental regulations. But what we face is a jobs crisis \n     and regulators charged with protecting the interests of the \n     people are making worse the problem that is hurting them \n     most. Regulatory relief in the energy sector alone could \n     create up to two million new jobs and we won't have to borrow \n     a penny to pay for it.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the supercommittee. He says the White House \nand Congress should build on that momentum and ``enact comprehensive \npro-growth tax reform that benefits everyone; proceed with regulatory \nreform; and reform and restructure existing entitlement programs.''\n\n       If Washington can once again find the ability to mix \n     democracy and effective governing, American business will \n     once again unleash America's economic potential.\n\n  So Mr. McNerney, in his article, reflects the views of everybody I \ntalk to, small businesses and large. They want tax relief. They want \nregulatory relief. In fact, what they want more than anything else is \nsome kind of certainty about the economic future and the playing field \nin which they will have to compete. Will there be increasing regulatory \nburden? Will there be a raise in taxes, as is facing us in 2013? Can we \nhave a tax code they can understand and comprehend that is fair to one \nand all? Can they unleash their savings accounts and the money they \nhave kept in reserve and invest and hire with some confidence that \nthere will be a return on that investment, that they will succeed for \nthemselves and their children?\n  That is what this jobs bill is all about. That is what we are trying \nto get done. This is an attempt to look at the problems America faces \ntoday, which, by the way, do spill over onto our national security \nproblems, as the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff pointed \nout.\n  So it affects all of America. It hurts us in so many ways. Yet we sit \nhere, and apparently the select committee, the supercommittee as it is \ncalled, is at some kind of gridlock. We sit here today with one \namendment here, one amendment here, back and forth, and then run right \nout to the media and attack each other for being uncooperative and why \nare we not more congenial and why are we not willing to compromise.\n  Well, I will plead guilty for perhaps not being willing to compromise \non some issues because some issues are a matter of principle. We do not \ncompromise principle, I have found out. But we do come forth with \nproposals and try to find those on which we can agree. I do not know \nwhy we do not agree on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nEvery State, every mayor, every city councilman, every county \nsupervisor, every one of them is faced with the first problem of a \nbalanced budget.\n  Why should we exempt ourselves? Why can't we together work out the \ndetails concerning a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? The \noverwhelming majority of Americans would heave a sigh of relief if we \never did that because then they would know we would be more careful \nstewards of their tax dollars. It seems to me we could move forward \nwith that.\n  Enhanced rescission authority. I believe the President of the United \nStates should have enhanced rescission authority, what we used to know \nof as the old line-item veto, taking those lines in appropriations \nbills he objects to and vetoing them--and I will not go through the \ncomplications of how it is done--but have them taken out, with certain \nrestrictions as to how many times he could do it. Then, like every \nGovernor--not every Governor but most Governors in America have--to \nline item out, without having to veto the entire appropriations bill, \nsometimes maybe even causing damage to our ability to govern.\n  I am well aware if we voted for an enhanced rescission by the \nCongress of the United States, signed by the President, the President \nwould probably line-item veto some programs that I would object to him \ndoing so. I am willing--more than willing--to take that pain as opposed \nto today where we continue to have appropriations bills which in many \ncases people have not read or truly understand.\n  Tax reform. Every place I go people talk to me about the need for tax \nreform. I have yet to meet an American who understands completely the \nTax Code. I have yet to meet an American who believes our Tax Code is \nfair. I have yet to meet an American who says: If you would just give \nme three tax brackets, a very small number of deductions, and then I \ncould fill out my tax return on a post card or in the case of some of \nthe countries--the Baltic countries that used to be under the Soviet \nUnion--on my computer. Then you would see greater compliance, you would \nsee less of a need for the IRS, and you would see Americans more than \nwilling to pay their fair share if they believed the system was fair.\n  It is not fair when major corporations and individuals pay no taxes \nbecause they have bright lawyers, and they take advantage of all of the \nloopholes and deductions they have been able to get put into the Tax \nCode over the years with the help of very powerful lobbyists in this \ntown.\n  Repatriation and territorial reform. The Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from North Carolina, and I have proposed a pretty simple \nproposal; that is, the $1.4 trillion that is now sitting overseas \nbecause they will not bring it back because of the tax situation; that \nwe could bring that money home, and we could provide a permanent \nincentive with that for repatriating these foreign earnings.\n  I say to my friend from North Carolina, I have been kind of \nastonished at some of the resistance to this where people say it would \nnot do any good. Help me out. It would not do any good to bring $1.4 \ntrillion back to the United States of America? Do we really believe \nthat would just go in peoples' wallets and purses? Of course not.\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n  The Senator from North Carolina and I have talked to too many people, \ncorporation executives, who have said: Yes, I will not only create jobs \nand invest that money, but I will give you a plan. I will give a plan \nthat we will implement with that money--that IBM or Boeing or other \nmajor corporations that have this money parked overseas.\n  They are enthusiastic about it. Yet, unbelievably, there are people \nwho argue that it would have no effect whatsoever on our economy. It is \nhard to understand.\n  Now we obviously get into ObamaCare. I noticed that the latest \npolling showed, I believe, that some 54 percent of the American people \nwant the health care law repealed. Thirty-some percent still support \nit. The fact is that over time, as Americans learn more and more about \nthe health care law we passed, they have become more and more opposed \nto it. They are angry because the whole purpose of the health care act \nwas to provide all Americans with health care that is affordable but \nalso to bend the curve of the inflation of health care in America \nbecause we all know the present inflation of health care is \nunsustainable. It is unsustainable. Yet what has been the result since \nthe passage? Inflation of health care continues to go up; the cost of \nhealth care, whether it be to the men and women serving or average \ncitizens, continues to go up, and it has to stop. We need to look at \nthat and look at medical malpractice reform. In Texas today, they \npassed medical malpractice reform, and it seems to work, and most \npeople are happy with it.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill--it still is stunning to me that we passed this \nregulatory reform bill; they called it a financial takeover that the \nDodd-Frank bill is commonly known as--the whole purpose of it was that \nwe would have legislation that would ensure that never again would any \ninstitution be too big to fail because the taxpayers never again should \nhave to bail out any financial institution. Is there anybody who \nbelieves that these huge institutions on Wall Street haven't grown \nbigger, that they are not bigger to fail than they used to be? The fact \nis that they are. What did we get? We got a whole bunch of regulations \nand different bureaucracies, some of them less accountable than others, \nand obviously a damper on some of the financial activities.\n  We need to make sure no financial institution is too big to fail. We \nneed to assure the American people that never again will they suffer \nthe way they have during this period of time because of the malfeasance \nof others. Unfortunately, the Dodd-Frank bill did not achieve that \ngoal.\n  We need to have a moratorium on regulations. Senator Johnson of \nWisconsin has a bill that prohibits any Federal agency from issuing new \nregulations until the unemployment rate is equal to or less than 7.7 \npercent. Senators Snowe and Coburn have introduced legislation that is \npart of this Freedom from Restrictive Excessive Executive Demands and \nOnerous Mandates Act, which strengthens and streamlines the regulatory \nact by requiring regulators to include ``indirect economic impacts'' in \nsmall business analyses, requiring periodic review and sunset of \nexisting rules, and expanding business review panels as a requirement \nfor all Federal agencies instead of just the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n  I notice my colleague, Dr. Barrasso, from Wyoming on the floor, who \nknows more about programs in the health care reform act. I will try to \nbe polite and refer to it today as the health care reform act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does Senator Barrasso believe or could he tell us, \nperhaps, the effects on the cost of health care since passage of this \nlegislation and perhaps what we need to do to really fix health care in \nAmerica, which we all agree needs to be fixed?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with my colleague from Arizona. I thank him for \nhis leadership and congratulate him for the piece of legislation that \nis currently on the floor. I am here to speak in support of it because \nI want to get small businesses hiring again and get people back to \nwork.\n  We need to find ways to make it easier and cheaper for the private \nsector to create jobs. This health care law my colleague has asked me \nabout is one thing the President promised, saying: If you pass it, \nhealth insurance for families will go down--he said about $2,500 per \nfamily per year. Instead, we have seen--in response to the Senator--\nhealth insurance rates go up. Across the board, people agree they have \ngone higher and faster than if the law had never been signed.\n  I think it was interesting and telling yesterday that the voters of \nOhio went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly--almost 2 to 1--to say \nthey don't want to be forced to participate in the President's so-\ncalled health care law. What people in Ohio and people in my State and \nin all of the States around the country are asking for--and this is my \ngoal--is to provide people with the care they want from the doctor they \nwant--the care they need from the doctor they want at a cost they can \nafford.\n  There are things we need to do, but to put these additional expenses \nand mandates on the small businesses of this country, the job creators, \njust makes it harder and more expensive for those small businesses to \nhire more people. At a time in this Nation when we have 14 million \nAmericans out of work, over 9 percent unemployment, we need to take \npositive steps to help them get back to work. I view this health care \nlaw and the expenses as a heavy, wet blanket on small businesses that \nare trying to hire people. We know of small businesses around the \ncountry that know that the penalties are significant when they hire \nthat 50th employee. We have businesses that could grow, but they are \nnot going to hire that extra person because of the significant expenses \nto the business. They need some certainty. They are getting so much \nuncertainty out of Washington with rules, regulations, redtape, the \nexpense of the health care law, and the threats that keep coming of \nincreased taxes. Small businesses and businesses are just not hiring.\n  That is why I am here to commend and compliment my colleague from \nArizona for bringing forth to the American people a positive proposal \nto put people back to work.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator this on two other issues. One issue was \nnot included in the health care reform act, which is the issue of \nmedical malpractice, which the Senator, Dr. Barrasso, has had a lot of \npersonal experience with. The other is this--which I think is \nsymptomatic of really the way we cobbled this whole thing together, \nwhich is that we have now found a provision in the bill that cannot be \nand will not be enforced, the so-called CLASS Act.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Both of those are areas where there can be significant \nsavings.\n  Folks have said that if they do this sort of legislative approach to \nremove this lawsuit abuse, the savings to the Federal budget would be \nabout $50 billion over the budgeting timeframe--$50 billion. Any \nphysician, nurse, practitioner, or physician assistant would say the \nsavings would even be greater because of the additional tests and so-\ncalled defensive medicine that is practiced in an effort to protect \nhospitals, physicians, health care providers from the possibility of a \nlawsuit. They do a lot of extra diagnostic studies--x rays, CAT scans, \nMRIs, and blood tests--to try to not miss something, which is very \nunlikely, but they want to protect themselves from a suit. I think the \nsavings would be even greater, but even the government accountants say \nit would save $50 billion.\n\n  The other is the so-called CLASS Act--something one of my Democratic \ncolleagues said was comparable to a Ponzi scheme that even Bernie \nMadoff would be proud of. It was an accounting gimmick, a bookkeeping \ntrick used during debate and passage of the so-called health care law. \nIt was aimed at trying to bring money in in the first 5 years of an \naccounting scheme where they would then not have to pay for any \nservices and to start paying for services about the sixth year, and \nthen the expenses would go up and up. What they have now realized and \nwhat we realized on this side of the aisle initially, right away, and \npointed out on the floor before the vote, is that this could not work \nlong term.\n  In an effort to try to use this scheme to say the health care law \nwould pay\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nfor itself, they forced this through, crammed it through, as they did \nwith the rest of the health care law. Now we find out that even the \nadministration says this cannot work, it is not going to work. OK, just \nrepeal that part of the law. Oh, they sure don't want to do that \nbecause that would admit it was a scheme from the beginning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would it not also disturb the predictions as far as the \nfiscal impact of the CLASS Act as well?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It would. It would undermine the argument of the \nPresident, who says this is going to pay for itself, when, in fact, it \nis not.\n  It is interesting, if you ask people watching at home or when you go \nto townhall meetings, do you think under this health care law your \nhealth care will be better or worse, they will say worse. Very few \nthink it will be improved under this law the President forced through. \nAnd then if you ask the same group of people, a cross-section of people \nin our States, if they think the cost of their care will go down, as \nthe President promised, or go up, they all say it is going to go up. So \nthey are going to have to pay more, get less, and be unhappy with it, \nwhich is why I think yesterday in Ohio two-thirds of the voters who \nturned out--and the margin was over a 1 million voters difference \nbetween those for and against. They overwhelmingly voted to say: We \ndon't want to have to live under the Obama health care law; we want to \nbe able to opt out of that, which is all small businesses want to do. \nThey don't want to have to deal with these expensive bandaids. Let's \nwork together and within our States and work with other small \nbusinesses, but we don't want to live under these very expensive \nWashington mandates, which makes it that much harder for us to hire \npeople.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can we return just for a minute to medical malpractice \nreform because many people, when you talk about that, believe there has \nto be appropriate compensation when malpractice occurs. We all know \nmalpractice occurs, so we don't want the innocent victims of medical \nmalpractice--however it occurs in the health care scenario--to not be \nable to get just compensation in the case of malpractice on the part of \nthe caregiver.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is exactly right. I agree. Studies have shown that \nin the system we live under today, less than one-third of the money \nactually goes to people who are deserving and ought to be receiving \nthat money, and the other two-thirds goes to the system--lawyers, \ncourts, and expert witnesses. So very little of the money paid in \npremiums actually gets to the injured party.\n  There are ways to do a better job of that with significant savings in \nthe process--making sure people are appropriately compensated if an \ninjury occurs but at the same time getting savings out of a system \nwhich is overwrought with money going to the wrong place and which also \nresults in so many unnecessary tests being done in efforts of doctors \nand nurses and hospitals to protect themselves.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his unique expertise in \nthe health care issues that are still transcendent in this country. I \nthank him for his enormous contributions.\n  I want to continue with some of this legislation.\n  The Unfunded Mandates Accountability Act, which was originally an act \nof Senator Portman's, requires agencies specifically to address the \npotential effect of new regulations on job creation and to consider \nmarket-based and nongovernmental alternatives to regulation, broadens \nthe scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to include rules issued \nby independent agencies and rules that impose direct or indirect \neconomic costs of $100 million or more, requires agencies to adopt the \nleast burdensome regulatory options and achieves the goal of the \nstatute authorizing the rule and creates a meaningful right to judicial \nreview of an agency's compliance with the law. If there is anything \nthat has grown out of control, in the view of this Member, it is \ngovernment regulations. First, we had a trickle, but now it is a flood, \nof government regulations, which then impose additional costs, which \nthen take money away from job creation and, in particular, small \nbusiness people. This is where accountability of the unfunded mandates \nis, at the very least, called for.\n\n  Senator Barrasso may want to discuss this next provision. The \nGovernment Litigation Savings Act reforms the Equal Access to Justice \nAct by disallowing the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and costs to \nwell-funded special interest groups that repeatedly sue the Federal \nGovernment. The bill retains Federal reimbursements for individuals, \nsmall businesses, veterans, and others who must fight in court against \nwrongful government action by eliminating taxpayer-funded reimbursement \nof attorneys' fees for wealthy special interest groups. The legislation \nhelps eliminate repeated procedural lawsuits that delay permitting \nexploration and land management.\n  If the Senator would like to comment.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to comment. Section 8 of \nthis Jobs Through Growth Act is the Government Litigation Savings Act. \nThis was something introduced in the House by Cynthia Lummis, a Member \nof Congress from Wyoming, and myself in the Senate. This legislation \nwill return the Equal Access to Justice Act--or what I refer to as \nEAJA--back to its original purpose.\n  The small business entity or individual citizen should not have their \nindividual liberties overrun by Washington. EAJA was meant to provide \npeople with limited financial resources--veterans, Social Security \nclaimants, small business owners--the ability to defend themselves \nagainst harmful government actions. That is how it was intended to be \nused. It allows individuals to sue the Federal Government, to recover \npart of their attorneys' fees and the costs.\n  This was a well-intended law, but it has been exploited--exploited by \nlarge environmental groups with large legal departments--and it is \nbeing used now as a profit center for these large organizations through \nlitigation against our government, and they are all getting paid to do \nit. The total amount that has been paid is unknown, and the reason it \nis unknown is that since 1995 something called the Paperwork Reduction \nAct defunded all the reporting requirements.\n  There is an attorney in Wyoming, Karen Budd-Falen, who has conducted \nresearch to see how much money a lot of these environmental groups have \nmade. She found 14 different environmental groups have brought over \n1,200--14 groups have brought over 1,200--Federal cases in 19 States \nand the District of Columbia. They have collected over $37 million in \ntaxpayer dollars through this Equal Access to Justice Act and similar \nlaws, and this doesn't even include settlements and fees that were \nsealed from public view. This is what we can find in public documents.\n  Lowell Baier, who is the president emeritus of the Boone and Crockett \nClub, tracked through the IRS 990 forms and found that of the most \nlitigious so-called nonprofit groups, they average over $9 million a \nyear of taxpayer money, which of course hinders economic growth, limits \ncreation of jobs by individuals and by small businesses and by energy \nproducers, farmers, and ranchers.\n  So I am very happy to see my colleague included our efforts in this \noverall jobs package because I think these are the sorts of things we \nare trying to overcome and that make it harder and more expensive for \nthe private sector to create jobs. I want to find ways to make it \neasier and cheaper for the private sector to create jobs.\n  If I could, we have been talking about the private sector. The \nmajority leader has said: Oh, the problem isn't the private sector. He \nsaid it was the public sector--the government. Government is doing just \nfine. It is the private sector that has lost over 1\\1/2\\ million jobs \nfrom February of 2009 to September of 2011.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Included in this package is the Employment Protection Act, introduced \nby Senator Toomey. It requires the EPA to analyze the impact on \nunemployment levels and economic activity before issuing any \nregulation, policy statement, guidance document, endangerment finding \nor denying any permit. Each analysis is required to include a \ndescription of estimated job losses and decreased economic activity due \nto the denial of a permit, including\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\nany permit denied under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n  Senator Johanns has contributed the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention \nAct, which prevents the EPA from regulating dust in rural America while \nstill maintaining protections to public health under the Clean Air Act.\n  The National Labor Relations Board reform was introduced by Senator \nGraham of South Carolina. From backdoor card check, to threatened jobs \nin South Carolina, the out-of-control National Labor Relations Board is \npaying back union officials at the expense of worker rights and jobs. \nTo create more jobs, legislation prohibiting the NLRB from stopping new \nplants and legislation to prevent coercive, quick-snap union elections \nshould be passed.\n  I am sure my colleagues are very well aware of the unprecedented and \nincredible action by the NLRB that basically prohibited a major \naircraft manufacturing company from locating in the State of South \nCarolina, where it is a right-to-work State--an unbelievable overreach \nby a Federal bureaucracy--which still staggers the imagination, but it \nalso shows that elections have consequences.\n  There is also the Government Neutrality and Contracting Act. It \nrepeals the President's order requiring government-funded construction \nprojects to only use union labor. This would reduce costs of Federal \njobs projects by as much as 18 percent. That was Senator Vitter's \ncontribution.\n  Senator Shelby has introduced the Financial Regulatory Responsibility \nAct, which requires financial regulators to conduct consistent economic \nanalysis on every new rule they propose, provide clear justification \nfor the rules, and determine the economic impacts of proposed \nrulemakings, including their effects on job growth and net job \ncreation.\n  With so many of these pieces of legislation I am talking about, a lot \nof Americans might say: Don't we do that already? Unfortunately, we \ndon't.\n  Senator Roberts has the Regulatory Responsibility for our Economy \nAct, which codifies and strengthens President Obama's January 18 \nExecutive order that directs agencies within to review, modify, \nstreamline, expand or repeal those significant regulatory actions that \nare duplicative, unnecessary, overly burdensome or would have \nsignificant economic impacts on Americans.\n\n  Congressman Gibbs, over on the House side, has the Reducing \nRegulatory Burdens Act, which eliminates a new duplicate EPA regulation \nthat will cost millions of dollars to implement without providing \nadditional environmental protection.\n  On domestic job energy promotion we have, from Senator Vitter, the \nDomestic Jobs, Domestic Energy, and Deficit Reduction Act that would \nrequire the Department of the Interior to move forward with offshore \nenergy exploration and create a timeframe for environmental and \njudicial review.\n  Senator Murkowski has included the Jobs and Energy Permitting Act, \nwhich eliminates the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the EPA's \ndecisionmaking process for air permits, which is delaying energy \nexploration in the Alaska and outercontinental shelf. It will create \nover 50,000 jobs and produce 1 million barrels of oil a day.\n  There is no one in this body who knows as much about these issues as \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Senator Barrasso again has brought forward the American Energy and \nWestern Jobs Act. The bill streamlines the preleasing, leasing, and \ndevelopmental process for drilling on public land and requires the \nadministration to create goals for American oil and gas production.\n  The Mining Jobs Protection Act by Senators McConnell, Inhofe, and \nPaul requires the EPA to use or lose their 404 permitting review \nauthority. Under this bill, the EPA will have 60 days to voice concerns \nabout a permit application or the permit moves forward. Any concerns \nvoiced by the EPA would need to be published in the Federal Register \nwithin 30 days.\n  Senator Inhofe has contributed the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which \nprohibits the EPA from using the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse \ngases.\n  The Repeal Restrictions on Government Use of Domestic Alternative \nFuels Act would repeal section 526 of the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007, which prohibits Federal agencies from contracting \nfor alternative fuels such as coal-to-liquid fuel.\n  The Public Lands Job Creation Act of Senator Heller eliminates the \nburdensome and unnecessary delay in approval of projects on Federal \nlands by allowing the permitting process to move forward unless the \nDepartment of the Interior objects within 45 days. This will streamline \nthe permitting process for domestic energy and mineral production on \nBLM lands without compromising environmental analysis.\n  Senator McConnell has introduced the renew trade promotion authority, \nwhich would provide the President with fast-track authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements that will eliminate foreign trade barriers \nand open new markets for American goods.\n  We all know trade promotion authority is vital to the eventual \nenactment of free-trade agreements. I am incredibly depressed that we \nwould not have renewed this trade promotion authority along with the \npassage of the long overdue free-trade agreements we just passed \nthrough this body.\n  The President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nbecome fond of saying Republicans have no plan for creating jobs and \nputting America back on a path to fiscal prosperity. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. As I have just laid out in the plan before us \ntoday, we have compiled many job-creating measures offered by our \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  Furthermore, since January, our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives have passed at least 22 job-creating bills. Guess how \nmany of the bills that were passed by the House of Representatives have \ngotten consideration in the Senate. Five.\n  Similar to our plan, our colleagues in the House have focused a great \ndeal of attention on empowering small businesses and reducing \ngovernment barriers to job creation. Here are just a few of the \ncommonsense, job-creating measures passed by the House, none of which \nhave been considered by the Senate: review of Federal regulations, \nreducing regulatory burdens, the Energy Tax Prevention Act, the Clean \nWater Cooperative Federalism Act, Consumer Financial Protection and \nSoundness Improvement Act, Protecting Jobs From Government Interference \nAct, Transparency and Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation Act, \nCement Sector Regulatory Relief Act, and the EPA Regulatory Relief Act.\n  So the next time we hear the President of the United States say \nRepublicans are blocking or have failed to take up or failed to bring \nforward a proposal, we have proposals, and we have measures that have \nbeen passed by the House. The proposals in this jobs plan bill deserve \nthe consideration of this body.\n  We need to prove to the American people that we will do everything we \ncan to eliminate the waste of their hard-earned dollars. Enacting an \nenhanced rescission authority to give the President statutory line-item \nveto authority to reduce wasteful spending is an issue we have been \nlooking at for years.\n  Why do we need to grant the President enhanced rescission line-item \nveto authority? According to a database created by Taxpayers Against \nEarmarks, washingtonwatch.com, and Taxpayers for Common Sense, for \nfiscal year 2011, Members requested over 39,000 earmarks totaling over \n$130 billion. Just last December, we were forced to consider, at the \nvery last minute, an Omnibus appropriations bill that was 1,924 pages \nlong and contained the funding for all 12 of the annual appropriations \nbills for a grand total of $1.1 trillion. In the short time I had to \nreview that massive piece of legislation before it was brought to the \nfloor, I identified approximately 6,488 earmarks, totaling nearly $8.3 \nbillion.\n  We need an enhanced rescission act.\n  Thankfully, the massive omnibus was not enacted. But these earmarks, \nand the process by which they make their way into spending bills, are \nevidence that the system is badly broken and in need of reforms.\n  I have more to say, and I have taken too much time in the eyes of \nmany of my colleagues, perhaps, and I want to apologize to any of my \ncolleagues who had planned to speak on the floor and have been \npreempted by my long remarks. But I feel that we have an obligation to \nthe American people to address the issues that are of greatest concern \nand the greatest amount of\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\npain to them today, and that is jobs and the economy--jobs and the \neconomy.\n  I care a lot about our national security challenges and I care a lot \nabout what is going in the world. But when I go home and a woman stands \nup at a townhall meeting with her two children and says, I don't have a \njob and I am being kicked out of my home next week; when we have people \nwho are being thrown out of their houses, and over half of the homes in \nmy home State of Arizona are under water--in other words, worth less \nthan the mortgage payments they are required to make--when we have \nchronic unemployment that in some cases, such as down in Yuma, AZ, is \nwell into double digits, then we have to get going on getting some jobs \nand the economy back on the right track.\n  I want to repeat--and I don't mean to be confrontational with my \ncolleagues, but we tried for 2 years, when the other side had the \nmajority in the House and the Senate and they had passed major pieces \nof legislation that were advertised to get our economy back on track--\nthey didn't--can't we try something different? Can't we try the kinds \nof things that have brought us out of other recessions? Can't we ask \nour colleagues in the Senate to create a simplified tax system that the \nHeritage Foundation says, by lowering the corporate rate to 25 percent, \nthe number of jobs in the United States would grow on an average of \n581,000 annually from 2011 to 2020? Can't we look at this regulatory \nsystem, which has put such a damper on small businesses and large? \nCan't we give American people a break from the flood of new regulations \nthat continues to come down and is a major factor in this environment \nof uncertainty amongst businesses small and large?\n  The approval rating of the American people of Congress is now, the \nlatest poll I saw, 9 percent. That is something that I joke about, but \nit is also something that grieves me a great deal because I believe the \noverwhelming majority of the Members of Congress are here and are \ndedicated to serving their constituents in the most honorable fashion \nand in the best possible way they can, according to their values and \ntheir principles.\n  But it is a fact that the American people are very angry and they are \nvery upset. One of the major reasons is, of course, they have not seen \nprogress in the economy. And that is very understandable. We are now \nseeing these Occupy Wall Street people. The tea partiers will probably \nbe rejuvenated. We are seeing expressions of anger and frustration all \nover the country, and it is unfortunate. But I believe that a couple of \nthings are going to happen unless we act in a more efficient fashion \nthat addresses the concerns of the American people, and that is I \nbelieve you will see the rise of a third party in this country, and I \nthink also you will see greater and greater manifestations of \nopposition to business as usual here in Washington.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am more than eager to sit \ndown with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and come \ntogether particularly on some of the issues that clearly we have stated \non both sides we are in favor of.\n  Again, my apologies to my colleagues whose time I may have preempted \non the floor. But I think this issue of jobs, which we will be voting \non tomorrow, is one that deserved more than passing attention.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his remarks, and \ncertainly for me, at least, he owes no apology for having spoken his \nmind. I always welcome the opportunity to listen, and I have done so, \nand am honored to follow him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n  Today I speak as we approach Veterans Day, and I believe this \nVeterans Day may be particularly significant for our Nation in part \nbecause we have the opportunity in this Chamber to honor some very \nspecial veterans, the Montford Point marines, who graced us with their \npresence yesterday as we celebrated the 236th birthday of the U.S. \nMarine Corps. They were present then. They were present in 1942, when \nthey stepped forward to serve and fight for this Nation. They are \nAfrican Americans who fought and served for this Nation at a time when \nthey anticipated no recognition and certainly no honor, and we have the \nopportunity between now and Veterans Day to approve a measure that \nwould grant them the Congressional Gold Medal, which they richly \ndeserve and they have earned through their service. They are the \nepitome of the Marines--they happen to be marines--and of the service \nmen and women whom we honor on this Veterans Day. They happen to be men \nof the ``greatest generation,'' the World War II generation. They are \namong the greatest of that generation.\n  I had the great honor to be with them yesterday, in fact to be the \nhonored guest in the Russell Building when the commandant and I had the \nprivilege to honor them. Their presence yesterday reminds us of our \ncontinuing obligation to all veterans and of the need to make the well-\nbeing of our veterans a priority, as I have sought to do.\n\n  Indeed, my first bill, entitled Honoring All Veterans, has as its \nobjective to leave no veteran behind. It offers a comprehensive set of \nmeasures to assure that we keep faith with every veteran, every veteran \nwho needs a job, every veteran who needs better health care or \ncounseling or training or education. These commitments we have made as \na nation to all of our veterans and now we have the opportunity to keep \nthose promises and keep faith with them, as we have a solemn obligation \nto do every day, every year, not just Veterans Day.\n  I want to thank Senator Harkin of Iowa for cosponsoring the \nlegislation I have offered, and also to thank Senator Tester, Chairman \nMurray of the Veterans Committee, and Ranking Member Burr of that \ncommittee for their work to address these challenges recognized by the \nHonoring All Veterans Act and this comprehensive measure, VOW to Hire \nHeroes amendment. Truly, we should vow to hire our heroes, and we \nshould do so not just in words but in deed, not just in rhetoric but in \naction, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the important tax credit \nprovision in the Tester veterans jobs amendment for businesses that \nhire veterans.\n  Helping veterans is a challenge that will require the engagement of \neveryone in the community, from Congress to veterans service \norganizations and business leaders across the board, across the \ncountry, across the State of Connecticut.\n  At a recent veterans hiring forum I hosted in Connecticut, I heard \nfirsthand the challenges in veterans recruitment, and what innovative \ncompanies such as United Reynolds were doing to hire skilled and \ntalented veterans in this symposium in that setting. They provided an \nexample of what we can and should do.\n  I see my cosponsorship of this amendment as honoring a commitment to \npush for legislation to provide incentives to firms to hire unemployed \nveterans, and to make it easier for companies to connect with veterans \nso they can fill some of the jobs that are now available. There are \njobs available, and we should give our veterans the skills they need, \nskills they may have acquired in part during their service that need to \nbe honed and expanded, and we have that opportunity. I want to thank \nall of those Senators for championing this measure.\n  My own legislation, Honoring All Veterans Act, allows a veteran to \ntake the Transition Assistance Program, known as TAP, an interagency \nworkshop coordinated by the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans \nAffairs for up to 1 year after separation at any military facility. The \nbill before us makes participation in the program mandatory. Low \nparticipation rates in this program are especially concerning, as \njunior members tend to be those most in need of the services provided \nby TAP, and the benefits available through the VA for many skills such \nas simple skills, writing resumes or interviewing have never been \nneeded or learned before. Not having such skills, not knowing how to \ninterview or write a resume puts them at a severe disadvantage when \nthey are attempting to enter and succeed in the workplace after they \nexchange their military uniform for civilian clothes.\n  Section 222 of the VOW to Hire Heroes Act authorizes an assessment of\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nthe equivalence between skills developed in military occupational \nspecialties and qualifications required for civilian employment with \nthe private sector.\n  I like to say that when you call out the National Guard, you call out \nthe best in America. When you call out the Connecticut National Guard, \nyou call out truly the very best in America. The military recruits the \nmost talented men and women in America to serve, and then invests \nheavily in those skills and their professional development. Yet when \nthey enter the civilian world, very often those skills are simply \nunrecognized by laws requiring separate training or licensure, and we \nought to do more to recognize the expertise and experience the military \ngives to these brave men and women. That is why I authored a similar \nprovision in the Honoring All Veterans Act to ensure that civilian \nemployers and educational institutions recognize a veteran's military \ntraining.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America reported--and I am \nquoting--61 percent of employers do not believe they have a complete \nunderstanding of the qualifications ex-servicemembers offer. And, \nrecently separated servicemembers with college degrees earn on average \nalmost $10,000 less than their nonveteran counterparts.\n  I applaud my colleagues for including section 222 in the VOW to Hire \nHeroes Act. It is a vital step toward helping employers find the \nemployees they need and toward closing the income gap that exists now.\n  The legislation before us also expands education and training \nopportunities for older veterans by providing 100,000 unemployed \nveterans of past eras and wars with up to 1 year of additional GI \nbenefits to go toward education and training programs at community \ncolleges and technical schools. I am proud of the bipartisan compromise \nto extend this period for 1 year. I hoped it would be even further \nbroadened and extended, but this measure is a great first start toward \nproviding skills for job opportunities that now exist and can be filled \nby men and women coming out of our military to civilian life.\n  Let me say, to come back to the Montford Point marines, I want to \nthank Senator Pat Roberts who was with me yesterday at the 236th \nbirthday celebration, and most especially I thank the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Kay Hagan, who is with us today, for her leadership on \nthis issue. Truly, we can make this Veterans Day special for all of us \nin this Nation if we approve this Congressional Gold Medal to men who \nstepped forward to serve and fight when this Nation failed to \nappreciate their service and valor. Now we have the opportunity to make \ngood on our commitments to them as veterans--to all of our veterans--in \nthis measure. I am proud to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nin nearing now the number that is necessary to approve that measure, \nand I hope we can reach that kind of bipartisan consensus on that \nlegislation, but also on the broader VOW to Hire Heroes Act, that can \nlead us back to the kind of bipartisan approach on so many issues that \nwe need to emulate in this body.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this measure, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I stand today, just 2 days away from \nVeterans Day, to urge my colleagues to support our courageous service \nmen and women, our veterans and their families, by voting for the VOW \nto Hire Heroes Act of 2011. This legislation would have a tremendous \nimpact on every part of our country, but it would be especially \nsignificant in my home State of North Carolina, the most military-\nfriendly State in the Nation.\n  In North Carolina we are blessed to be home to so many of our \ncountry's heroes. I don't think most people understand that nationwide \nmilitary servicemembers account for only 1 percent of our country's \npopulation. But in North Carolina, more than one-third of our \npopulation is either in the military, is a veteran, or has an immediate \nfamily member who is in the military or is a veteran. Over 700,000 \nveterans call North Carolina home.\n  I know that makes our State stronger. I know because, like so many \nNorth Carolinians, I too come from a strong military family that \ninstilled in me a sense of responsibility to my community and to my \ncountry. My husband, my father, my brother are all Navy veterans. My \nfather-in-law was a two-star general in the Marine Corps, and my two \nnephews have both served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I know because I have traveled my State's eight military bases from \nFort Bragg to Cherry Point to Camp Lejeune to bases in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Kuwait. I have seen up close the incredible demands \nplaced on our military and the remarkable bravery and patriotism they \nexhibit each and every day.\n  I know because whether I am meeting a general, a young private, a \nwounded warrior, or a 90-year-old veteran traveling on one of the \nFlights of Honor that bring our World War II veterans to DC to see \ntheir monuments, there are certain qualities that I always recognize in \nthose who serve in the Armed Forces. These are selflessness, personal \nintegrity, and an unmatched work ethic and unwavering courage.\n  I take it personally as a Senator from North Carolina, as well as a \nproud daughter, wife, and sister of a veteran when our military members \nand their families are hurting. I take it personally when this country \nof ours does not live up to the promises we make to our service men and \nwomen. Right now our military families are unquestionably hurting. \nRight now we have lapsed in our commitment to our heroes.\n  As has been said many times on this floor, the unemployment rate \namong Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans is an unconscionably high 12.1 \npercent. That is more than 3 percentage points higher than the national \naverage unemployment. That is about a quarter of a million men and \nwomen, all of whom have put their lives on the line to protect our \ncountry, who are now struggling just to earn a paycheck--240,000 heroes \nwith irreplaceable skill sets and experience who cannot find a job.\n  We cannot forget that every unemployed veteran has a family, a family \nwho has likely spent untold sleepless nights worrying if their loved \none is safe. Now, after years of selfless service, these families are \nforced to worry if they can pay their monthly bills, if they can even \nafford to keep their homes.\n  According to HUD's 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, more than \n1,000 North Carolina veterans are homeless and spend every night \nwithout a roof over their head. That is simply 1,000 too many. This is \nnot a fate that we can accept for our veterans. This is not the country \nwe strive to be. We need to support our veterans when they make the \ntransition from the military to the civilian workforce. We need to \nprovide them with the training and resources they need to transfer \nthose skills to the private sector. We need to encourage our business \nowners to employ some of our country's most highly trained, highly \nambitious, and highly motivated individuals.\n  The VOW to Hire Heroes Act does just that. It provides a tax credit \nof up to $5,600 for hiring veterans. For our wounded warriors it \nincludes a tax credit of up to $9,600--for hiring veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities. It requires our service men and women \ntransitioning to the civilian workforce to participate in the \nTransition Assistance Program, which provides services such as resume \nwriting workshops and career counseling to help these individuals land \nthe jobs that are available. It expands education and training \nopportunities at our community colleges and technical schools for \n100,000 unemployed veterans who served prior to September 11.\n  I am pleased to say that some provisions of this legislation are very \nsimilar to a bipartisan bill that Senator Scott Brown and I introduced \nearlier this year. The priorities this legislation focuses on are not \nDemocratic priorities. They are not Republican priorities. Supporting \nour veterans is and has always been an American priority. We owe it to \nthem, but we also owe it to our future.\n  I hope many saw the August cover story in Time magazine that \ndescribed our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as ``the \nnext greatest generation.'' If you have not read it, I highly encourage \nyou to do so. The author, Joe Klein, whom I met on a military transport \nplane in Afghanistan, spent the past 5 years visiting with\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nIraq and Afghanistan veterans across the country, including two best \nfriends he met from North Carolina. These friends, Dale Beatty and John \nGallina, whom I met last year in Charlotte, joined the North Carolina \nNational Guard together, deployed to Iraq together, and nearly died \ntogether when their humvee was blown up by an antitank mine. Dale lost \nboth his legs and John suffered a traumatic brain injury.\n\n  When a local homebuilders association offered to build Dale a home, \nDale and John were both inspired to assist other handicapped veterans. \nToday their nonprofit Purple Heart Homes, headquartered in Statesville, \nNC, helps build and adapt homes for service-disabled veterans.\n  Dale and John represent, as ADM Mike Mullen said, ``part of a \ngeneration who is flat out wired to contribute, flat out wired to \nserve.'' As GEN David Petraeus told Time magazine, our veterans ``have \nhad to show incredible flexibility, never knowing whether they're going \nto be greeted with a handshake or hand grenade. They've been exposed to \nexperiences that are totally unique. . . . I believe they are our next \ngreat generation of leaders.''\n  There are many more Dale Beattys and John Gallinas out there, but we \ncannot leave our next great generation of leaders standing in an \nunemployment line. We must come together and fight for our veterans and \ntheir families just as hard as they have fought for our freedoms. We \nmust pass the VOW to Hire Heroes Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the VOW to Hire Heroes Act. Very simply, it is a bill that will \nhelp our returning heroes get good jobs as they transition back into \ncivilian life.\n  The bill is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. I look \nforward to the passage of this bill tomorrow--perfect timing as our \ncountry prepares to honor the bravery, sacrifice, and commitment of our \nAmerican veterans.\n  Since I first walked into this Chamber nearly 3 years ago, it has \nbeen a great privilege to serve on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. \nI am also proudly serving on the Armed Services Committee. From these \npositions I have worked on behalf of the 74,000 veterans who call \nAlaska home and the more than 28,000 Active-Duty and Reserve component \nmen and women serving our great country.\n  My State of Alaska, for all its unique geography and demographics, \nhas the distinction of being the home of the largest proportion of \nveterans per capita of any other State in our country.\n  Alaska has a proud history of defending our country. This poster \nshows our troops preparing for battle on Alaska's soil during World War \nII. Although many Americans are still not aware, there was fierce \nfighting in the Aleutians as the Japanese launched a diversionary \nattack in preparation for the Battle of Midway. One of my most \nrewarding moments so far as a Member of this body was making sure that \ntwo dozen brave members of the Alaska Territory Guard, all \ndistinguished Alaskan Native Elders, finally got the recognition they \nearned for their courageous service to this Nation more than a half \ncentury ago. We can see by this poster, a few of them here long before \nAlaska was a State and our country was engaged in World War II, these \nAlaskan heroes answered their Nation's call on America's most remote \nfrontlines.\n\n  In 2009, the Senate approved an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act that I sponsored with my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski, that President Obama signed into law. Twenty-five surviving \nterritorial Guardsmen finally received their retirement pay and \nrecognition they earned so many years ago. I have done my level best to \nsupport our troops in other ways, including expanding services and \nprograms for homeless veterans, including more support for women \nveterans and expanding telehealth services for our rural veterans.\n  Supporting the post-GI bill. This provides tuition assistance for \nveterans and takes into consideration living expenses so students can \nbetter focus on their education. It allows for servicemembers to pass \nthis entitlement to their immediate families.\n  Every time I meet a veteran, I thank him or her for their service to \nour country. I know they appreciate that. All Americans should go out \nof their way to thank our veterans, not just on Veterans Day but every \nday. But thank you only goes so far. It doesn't pay the mortgage or buy \ngroceries. Our veterans really need good jobs. The statistics are \nshameful. More than one in four veterans under the age of 24 is without \na job. A quarter million post-9/11 veterans are unemployed.\n  As you can see by this chart, that is a 12-percent unemployment rate, \nand it simply is unacceptable. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act will create \nnew direct Federal hiring authority so jobs will be waiting for our \nveterans the day they leave the military. It will provide tax credits \nfor employers who hire veterans and wounded veterans who have been \nlooking for work. It will improve the transition process as \nservicemembers leave the battlefield and enter the workforce. This \nlegislation also expands training opportunities at community colleges \nand technical schools for 100,000 unemployed veterans who served before \nSeptember 11. It expands additional Montgomery GI benefits for older \nveterans for up to 1 year.\n  Let me take a few moments to talk about an additional challenge faced \nby veterans in my home State. Many of Alaska's returning warriors come \nhome to the most remote areas of America. Alaska boasts unsurpassed \nbeauty. It can also be a challenging and dangerous place to live.\n  Right now, as I speak on this floor, the northwest coast of Alaska is \nbeing struck by winds approaching 100 miles per hour and storm surges \nof 8 feet or more. With waves up to 30 feet, coastal erosion and \nflooding is truly and certainly going to happen. If this were happening \ntoday on the east coast of America, this storm would have some name to \nit, and we would not be hearing or reading about anything else but that \nstorm. To give you a concept of how far reaching this storm is, imagine \na storm reaching from Mexico, along the west coast, up to Washington \nState. That is the size of the storm that is occurring right now.\n  So if you think veterans in other parts of the United States face \nchallenges in employment, job training, access to health care, and \nthere is no doubt they do, you should see some of our circumstances in \nAlaska.\n  Here are two stories about real Alaskans. The first story is about a \ndisabled Army veteran living in Kipnuk, a small Yupik Eskimo village on \nthe far western coast of Alaska. This vet suffered a spinal cord injury \nin 2006 that requires yearly evaluation. He must travel to a VA \nhospital in Seattle to receive his care. That is a trip of thousands of \nmiles and thousands of dollars.\n  Additionally, for more routine illnesses, such as the flu, he is \nforced to travel to Anchorage, to a VA clinic there, still a jet flight \naway from his home, and, again, close to $1,000.\n  There is the retired Air Force veteran who needed to have hardware \nremoved from his wrist and shoulder following a failed surgery. The VA \nsent him to the hospital in Seattle despite the fact that several \nhospitals in Anchorage--closer and less costly to get to--could have \nperformed the procedure.\n  There are many stories similar to this that I hear every single day \nwhen I travel my State. It doesn't matter where I go; one veteran or \nveteran's family member will tell me a very similar story. That is why \nwe continue to push for a piece of legislation that I have introduced, \nthe Alaska Hero's Card. It is so simple when you look at what we are \ntrying to do.\n  If health care services are available closer to home, then any \nAlaskan veteran would simply present the card at the federally \nqualified health clinic and get the services. It limits their time \ntraveling away from their families, it lowers the costs of the VA, and \nit gives services where they need them and can get them. It is truly a \nwin-win. More importantly, it allows, as I said, veterans to be with \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, you have been an incredible advocate on health care \nissues. When you try to do health care rehabilitation and services and \ntake someone from a rural community and take\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\nthem to a large community, the odds are the rehabilitation will go \nslower or the service will not be as effective. We have to do what we \ncan to ensure that they have the service closer to their homes and \ntheir families and at a lower cost.\n  As we approach Veterans Day, I would like to recognize the Arctic \nwarriors serving our country. The members of the 4th Stryker Brigade \nCombat Team from Fort Wainwright, AK, have been serving with \ndistinction in Afghanistan since May of this year. The 4th Airborne \nBrigade Combat Team will deploy to Afghanistan at the end of this month \nfor a total of more than 9,000 Alaskan-based troops on the ground \nthere.\n  In addition, there are 550 airmen and soldiers still in Iraq today \nbut will be coming home by the end of the year. Our Alaska National \nGuard units and members are in both countries, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  To our Arctic warriors, thank you. Thank you for your service and \nsacrifice to our country, and thank you to the families who are \nsupporting our Arctic warriors as they serve this great country. So to \nhonor them and all the brave men and women who have served and are \ncurrently serving, let's come together on the floor of this Chamber. \nLet's put our differences aside. Let's pass the VOW to Hire Heroes Act \nand help put America's veterans back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Air Quality\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with all of the important issues we \nconstantly face in life, none compares to our concern for the health of \nour children. But the health of our children depends not only on us but \nwhat others might be doing--such as poisoning our air with secondhand \nsmoke or deliberately fouling the air our kids breathe.\n  Few would stand by while a smoker puffs away where your child is \ninhaling. That is why we worked so hard to prohibit smoking on \nairplanes--to keep someone else's smoke out of our children's lungs. \nYet when emissions from a powerplant in one State threaten people in a \nneighboring State, too often nothing is done about it. Make no mistake, \npollution doesn't recognize State boundaries. Communities across our \ncountry are being forced to bear the consequence of another community's \npolluters, and this is happening in my State of New Jersey, where \npeople are suffering because dirty air is blowing into our communities \nfrom out-of-State smokestacks.\n  Look at this horrible picture. Anything more threatening would be \nhard to imagine. The toxins coming out of smokestacks like these don't \ndisappear. They typically wind up polluting playgrounds and school \nyards in New Jersey, and other eastern States. In fact, a single \npowerplant in eastern Pennsylvania is responsible for more sulfur \npollution in New Jersey than all our State powerplants combined.\n  This year the Environmental Protection Agency took a major step \ntoward protecting children from out-of-State emissions when it adopted \nthe cross-State air pollution rule. This commonsense safeguard requires \npolluters to reduce the levels of dangerous soot and smog that they \nrelease into the air. The rule sends a clear message to powerplants in \nupwind States that they can no longer dump their dirty air on States \nthat lie downwind.\n  Unfortunately, one of our Republican colleagues has proposed a \nresolution to block the EPA's efforts. This misguided message would put \npolluters' profits before the health of our families and children, and \nthe consequences would be devastating.\n  Air pollution can cause asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and \ncancer. Long-term exposure can also damage the immune, neurological, \nand reproductive systems. Nationally, almost 1 in 10 children now \nsuffer from asthma. That is according to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. In some parts of New Jersey, one out of every \nfour residents has asthma. We should be working to make skies cleaner \nfor these children--not dirtier.\n  Some on the other side say we cannot afford to worry about the health \nof our children and our communities right now. They claim the new rule \nwill kill jobs. This is not about killing jobs, it is about saving \nlives, and we should not allow ourselves to be misled. According to \nEPA, the new rule will prevent 34,000 premature deaths and 15,000 heart \nattacks from taking place.\n  The new standard would also prevent as many as 400,000 asthma \nattacks, improving life for children such as my own grandson who \nsuffers from asthma. My daughter makes sure she finds an emergency \nclinic before my grandson plays ball or indulges in a sport because if \nhe starts to wheeze, he has problems.\n  My sister, who was on the board of education in a city in New York \nState, was at a board of education meeting when she began to start to \nwheeze. In her car she kept a small device, a little respirator, and \nshe ran for the parking lot. She didn't make it. She collapsed in the \nparking lot and died 3 days later.\n  For those who insist we cannot have both clean air and a strong \neconomy, I say we cannot have a strong economy without clean air. \nSimply put, if you cannot breathe, you cannot work.\n  The fact is, many powerplants, factories, and other companies are \nready to work with the EPA to reduce their impact on the environment. \nTake the example of Public Service Electric and Gas, which is New \nJersey's largest utility. PSEG has already invested resources to reduce \nsoot, smog, and mercury pollution by more than 90 percent. In the \nprocess the company has created over 1,600 construction jobs. That is \nwhy PSEG supports the EPA rule.\n  Ralph Izzo, the president of the company, said:\n\n       Our experience shows that it is possible to clean the air, \n     create jobs, and power the economy at the same time.\n\n  The bottom line is, this rule will protect the health of our economy, \nour workers, and our children. I urge my colleagues to reject this \ndangerous amendment and protect every American's right to breathe clean \nair.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier today in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--the Presiding Officer was at that meeting--\nsomething unusual happened. We had a major bill that will extend the \nHighway Surface Transportation Act for 2 years, passed by a unanimous \nvote, all the Democrats and Republicans joining together in order to \nmove forward a bill that will help create jobs. I hope we will find the \nsame spirit of cooperation on the legislation that is now before us. It \nhelps create jobs for our community and, with the Tester amendment, we \nhave a win-win situation.\n  This, first and foremost, is about creating jobs. The Tester \namendment allows us to create more jobs that will help American \nfamilies, help our economy, and even help our budget deficit, because \nwhen more Americans are working, more are paying taxes, and less \ngovernment services are needed.\n  All agree we need to help our returning veterans, those who have \nserved so well in Iraq and Afghanistan, defending the principles of our \ncountry and defending our basic freedom. On Friday, we will celebrate \nVeterans Day, and I know all of us will be speaking about how much we \nappreciate the service of our veterans. We need to show our \nappreciation not only by words but also by deeds. Yes, we fight to make \nsure our veterans have the health services they need, and we want to \nmake sure all of our military have the support they need. We want to \nmake sure our military families are properly taken care of. But one \nthing we can do with this legislation is help veterans get jobs when \nthey return home.\n  The unemployment rate among our returning veterans is higher than the \nunemployment rates in our general community. We need to help our \nveterans find employment. That is one way we can show our appreciation \nfor the men and women who have served our Nation.\n  The bill before us, with the Tester amendment, will give incentives \nto employers to hire returning warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nwill expand the education and training services so they have the skills \nnecessary for civilian employment. It will help us deal\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nwith a chronic problem we have of returning veterans, under the age of \n24, where the unemployment rate is 21 percent. This bill, with the \nTester amendment, will allow us to do something to help our returning \nveterans and help our economy.\n  But the underlying bill also goes further. It helps small businesses. \nSmall businesses are the growth engine of America. That is where job \ncreation takes place. That is where innovation takes place. We \ncurrently have a requirement that has not yet gone into effect that \nwould require small businesses that have contracts with the government \nover $10,000 to withhold 3 percent of those funds in order to make sure \ntaxes are paid. We need to repeal that provision, and this bill will \nrepeal that provision. We should go after those who are delinquent in \ntaxes, and we have a provision to make sure we do that, but for small \nbusiness to tie up that type of capital affects their ability to \ncompete. It affects their ability to expand job opportunity. Repealing \nthat provision is important to help small business help our economy.\n  It also would eliminate an administrative burden for a lot of our \nlocal governments. It also will make it more competitive for small \nbusinesses. The 3-percent withholding would affect actually the cost of \nproduction. All that means a stronger economy and more jobs.\n  This bill is a win-win bill. It helps our veterans. With the Tester \namendment, it helps small businesses by repealing a provision that is \nextremely burdensome. It is fully paid for so it does not add anything \nat all to the deficit, and it will help us grow our economy. By passing \nthis bill, not only will we help our veterans, we will help our small \nbusinesses and we will help our economy.\n  I urge our colleagues to show the same type of cooperation we did on \nthe surface transportation bill today in our committee. Let's use that \nsame spirit of cooperation to get this bill moving, with the Tester \namendment. Let us pass it and send it back to the House and, hopefully, \nwe can get it to the President shortly for signature and help our \nveterans and help our economy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           The Global Economy\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am going to replace the Presiding \nOfficer in the chair in a few moments, but before that, I wished to \ncome to the floor and talk about our economy and some work this \nCongress needs to be engaged in if we are going to get things moving on \nthe right track again.\n  Today, the stock market plunged 400 points because of concerns that \nare going on in Europe, especially with Italy. It is a debt crisis that \nhas been on the front page of every newspaper around the globe for \nweeks and in some cases months.\n  I am reminded of the discussion we had over the summer that consumed \nthe Congress for an entire summer, about the lifting of the debt \nceiling. Article after article after article said that if the Congress \ncouldn't figure out how to work this out in a bipartisan way and make a \nmaterial difference in the trajectory of our deficit and our debt that, \nfor the first time, our credit rating would be downgraded. For the \nfirst time in the history of the United States of America, the full \nfaith and credit of the United States would be called into question.\n  That was on the front page of every newspaper for weeks. In the end, \nwe stumbled across that finish line, and in the end our debt was \ndowngraded. I would argue we are about to face the same thing again and \nhave the chance again to do the right thing--to act in a bipartisan \nway, to create a thoughtful approach to our debt and our deficit that \nallows us to continue to invest in our economy.\n  Families in Colorado, much as the families in Rhode Island, are \nstruggling in an economy that is the worst since the Great Depression. \nWe are coming out of it now, but there are significant structural \nissues in that economy. I have shown this chart before. There are four \nsimple lines. The blue one is the productivity index, which shows our \neconomy has actually gotten substantially more productive since the \nearly 1990s, substantially more productive during this recession for a \nvariety of reasons. One reason is that our companies have had to learn \nto compete with the rest of the world in a way they have not before, so \nthey became more efficient. The benefits technology has brought has \ndriven up this curve. Unfortunately for our workers but understandably \nfor our businesses, they have had to figure out how to get through this \nrecession with fewer people so they can get through to the other side.\n  The second curve is our gross domestic product, the size of our \ndomestic economy, and it is not where it was before the recession, but \nit is headed back there.\n  The other two lines are the unemployment level, which this chart says \nis 14 million people, but I think the number is closer to 25 million, \nwhen we consider who has stopped looking for work and when we consider \nwho is underemployed in this economy. Then this line is a tragedy for \nour families, which is falling median family income.\n  This chart--it is a little hard to read--is a pretty good depiction \nof what is happening. This red line represents the bottom 90 percent of \nincome earners in this country. Think about that. We are talking about \nthe bottom 90 percent. That is everyone, except for 10 percent. It \nshows the share of the income in the United States that they are \nearning. It starts out here in the 1920s and goes to today, where the \nbottom 90 percent are earning roughly 47 percent of the income. The \nlast time that was true, by the way, was 1928, the year before the \nGreat Depression and the market crash. The top .1 percent earns 10 \npercent of the economy--.1, not 1 percent--.1. The last time that was \ntrue was 1928. All through the productive times in the 20th century, \nthe 1950s and the 1960s and the 1970s, there wasn't that kind of \nimbalance in our economy. This group earned roughly--90 percent earned \nroughly 70 percent of the economy and everybody else earned a fair \nshare of the economy, and the economy grew and we were able to build \nfor the future.\n  Those are structural issues in the economy we can help with, we can \nwork together to fix, but what we have to do right now is avert \npredictable crises that are within our control so we don't make matters \nworse.\n  Sometimes when I travel, people don't know why we need to worry about \nwhat is going on in Europe. This afternoon I wanted to bring a chart \nthat shows the soaring debt of all these European economies and the \nUnited States. We are the blue line here. This is Greece up here. \nEverybody is in tough shape. Everybody has made promises they can't \nkeep. Everybody has levered up in a way that isn't sustainable. But \nwhat is also true is that we are all interrelated. If something bad \nhappens in Europe, something very bad is going to happen here, just as \nwhen the capital markets fell apart at the beginning of the last \nrecession.\n  This chart shows how dependent our economy is on exports to Europe. \nBetween one-fifth and one-sixth of the total value of our exports goes \nto Europe. If the European banks fail, if the governments can't pay \nback their debt and the economy comes to a screeching halt in Europe, \nthey are not going to buy our exports. Those are American jobs we need \nto worry about. Those are American jobs we need to defend and protect \nand we need to understand this relationship.\n\n  Look at the exposure of our U.S. banks to Europe. This red part is \nthe euro area. It is 29 percent of the total international exposure of \nour banks, with 23 percent to the U.K. More than half of the foreign \nexposure of our banks is European debt.\n  We were unable to come to a rational conclusion on the debt ceiling. \nSo the Congress punted this decision to a supercommittee and asked them \nto please help us make the decision. My own hope is that the \nsupercommittee takes a page out of the bipartisan proposals that were \nreached--the one that was led by Bowles and Simpson, the one by Rivlin \nand Domenici. I think the details are less important, frankly, than the \nsize, but that takes $4 trillion out over the next 10 years, a balance \nof cuts to revenue of roughly 3 to 1, that sends a message to the world \nthat the United States is serious about dealing with its fiscal \nmatters. If we don't do that in advance of this European crisis that is \non the front page of every newspaper in the country, I can assure my\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\ncolleagues that the choices we have in front of us will be even tougher \nthan they would have otherwise been.\n  Sometimes I get the feeling that people around here actually don't \nthink the American people are watching this screaming match, are \nwatching the disagreements, are watching the political games, but they \nare. They know exactly what is going on here, and they understand the \nseriousness of these issues because they are living through that \neconomy I spoke of earlier. That is what they are worrying about. They \nare making less today than they were 10 years ago. They are making the \nsame amount they were making 20 years ago. They can't afford to send \ntheir kid to college. They can't afford their health care, and they \nwould like us to help straighten that out, but at a minimum they would \nlike us to prevent matters from getting worse. They would like to see \nus work together.\n  Some people here think Congress has always been unpopular, that it is \njust as an institution an unpopular place. Not so. Look at this. Here \nis Congress's approval rating today: 9 percent. That is a pretty \ncatastrophic fall-off in the last 10 years, and I would argue it has an \nawful lot to do with our inability to address problems the way people \nin their local communities are doing. There is not a mayor in Colorado \nwho would threaten the credit rating of their community for politics--\nnot one. Not a Republican mayor, not a Democratic mayor, not a tea \nparty mayor, not one would imagine doing it for a second because people \nin our communities would know that all that would do would be to drive \nup our interest rates, make us spend more money on interest and less on \ninfrastructure, more on interest and less on education, more on \ninterest and less on the health and welfare of our citizens.\n\n  We know that at the local level, but somehow here we get to color \noutside the lines. We are now at 9 percent, which is almost at the \nmargin of error for zero. We did some research to find out what else is \nat 9 percent. We could not find virtually anything in public polls \ntaken all across this country. My goodness, the Internal Revenue \nService has a 40-percent approval rating compared the our 9 percent. BP \nhad a 16-percent approval rating at the height of the oilspill, and we \nare at 9 percent. There is an actress who is at 15 percent. More people \nsupport the United States becoming communist--I do not, for the \nrecord--at 11 percent than approve of the job we are doing. I guess we \ncan take some comfort that Fidel Castro is at 5 percent.\n  Look, we are suffering--and when I say ``we,'' I mean families across \nthis country--through the worst recession since the Great Depression. \nWe can see on the front page of every single newspaper what the stakes \nare here if we do not act in a comprehensive way on our debt and our \ndeficit. We know that both parties have different approaches to the \nchallenges we face. But at the end of the day, these challenges are the \nchallenges of the American people, not the challenges of a bunch of \npoliticians in Washington who are worrying about the next election.\n  My hope is the supercommittee shows leadership here, that it gives \nthe opportunity for every Member of this body to express their \nleadership here, and that all of us are able to go home to red parts of \nour State and blue parts of our State and say to the people: We saw the \nproblem coming, and we led the world. We materially addressed the \nproblem we faced. We acted in a bipartisan way. We came up with a plan \nthat said: Do you know what. We are all in this together for the \nbenefit of our kids and our grandkids, for the people who are suffering \nthrough this economy.\n  There is $2.3 trillion of cash sitting on companies' balance sheets \nin the United States of America tonight that is not being invested \nbecause no one knows what interest rate environment they are going to \nbe in because they do not know what Washington is going to do. We \nshattered confidence in this economy this summer. We should not do it \nagain.\n  This is a popular number, this 9 percent, these days, you may have \nnoticed, on the Presidential campaign trail. It is not a popular number \nfor the American people: 9-percent approval. Let's do something right \nhere, and let's drive these numbers back up, and let's restore \nconfidence in the American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your patience and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Net Neutrality Order\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 6, a \nresolution of disapproval of the FCC's net neutrality order.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Federal Communications Commission put \nforward a variety of what are considered net neutrality policies. On \nSeptember 23 of this year, the FCC published a final rule in the \nFederal Register which is set to go into effect on November 20 to \nimpose harmful net neutrality regulations on our Nation's \ntelecommunications companies.\n  The digital world in which we now live has changed dramatically the \nway we retrieve information, communicate with one another, and engage \nin commerce. Technological advances, even in the last few years, have \npushed our economy forward. These advancements in technology and their \nadoption often depend heavily on access to broadband technologies.\n  While the telecommunications industry has flourished, boosted our \neconomy, and made critical investments in broadband deployment across \nthe country, this administration believes that imposing additional \nregulations is a step in the right direction.\n  In places across the country, such as my home State of South Dakota, \nthere is still work to be done when it comes to unfettered and \naffordable access to high speed broadband. With the FCC voting recently \nto reform the Universal Service Fund to shift to a focus on broadband \ndeployment, it seems to me that simultaneously moving forward with net \nneutrality regulations will have a chilling effect on this now thriving \nindustry.\n  We learned last week from the Department of Labor that the \nunemployment rate still hovers around 9 percent. The American people \nwant to see Federal policies that encourage innovation and spur job \ngrowth, not yet another regulatory overreach by an overzealous agency. \nUnfortunately, the FCC net neutrality policy will give considerable \nauthority to unelected bureaucrats to decide what a company's network \nmanagement should look like.\n  The Federal courts have ruled that the FCC lacks the authority under \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 to move forward with net neutrality \nregulations. Still, the Democratic appointees of the FCC have \npersisted, without regard to the courts, to settle the political debt \nowed by the Obama administration to special interest groups in favor of \nregulating the Internet. The FCC and this administration must be \nbrought into line and abide by the separation of powers. The FCC must \nonly execute the responsibilities given to it by Congress and not \noverreach its regulatory authority.\n  Freedom of the Internet belongs in the marketplace, not in the hands \nof Federal regulators. The FCC has moved forward to fix a problem that \ndoes not exist. This is a solution in search of a problem. Industry-\nimposed standards and transparency have the capability to increase \ncompetition, while more unnecessary government regulations will almost \ncertainly have the opposite effect.\n\n  Under a light regulatory structure, the Internet has become vital to \ncommerce and our Nation's economy over the past 15 years. The Internet \nhas helped digitally shrink the distance that otherwise would inhibit \nthe free flow of ideas, information, and business transactions from one \npart of the world to another. The Internet's adaptability and \ndecentralized characteristics are central to that success.\n  This Federal regulatory action represents unnecessary government \noverreach and has the potential to seriously damage an increasingly \nimportant sector of our economy. I do not believe the Federal \nGovernment can successfully regulate network access and development \nwithout negative effects on the consumer or the industry.\n  Allowing this unnecessary regulation to move forward has the \npotential to stifle broadband deployment and competition, which could \nultimately lead to fewer choices for consumers, higher prices, and \ndiscourage innovation.\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\n  I believe the net neutrality regulations, if allowed to move forward, \nwill have negative effects on this industry and our economy, and I \nwould encourage my colleagues, tomorrow, to support this resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  The economy does not need this. Our job creators do not need this. \nAnd the millions of Americans who are benefiting from the information \nrevolution that has been brought about by the Internet do not need this \neither.\n  This is an opportunity for us to send a little bit of a message to \nindustry that we understand, we get what they are saying about \noverregulation, we get that these piles of regulations continue to \ndrive up the cost of doing business in this country.\n  My colleague, the Presiding Officer, noted in his remarks the need \nfor economic certainty--businesses need to know what the rules are \ngoing to be. It seems to me, at least, that creating a whole set of new \nrules and piling new regulations on this very important medium--on a \nway in which we have grown commerce in this country, opened markets \nacross the world, created opportunities for consumers in this country \nto become more productive with their lives--is an absolute wrong \napproach at this particular point in time, particularly with the \nunemployment rate being what it is.\n  We want to make it less expensive, less costly, easier for our job \ncreators to create jobs in this country, not put up unnecessary \nbarriers and more obstacles and drive up the cost and make it more \ndifficult for people in this country to create jobs.\n  Businesses are looking for economic certainty. They are looking to \nWashington, DC for policies that will lessen the impediments and the \nnumber of obstacles to job creation in this country.\n\n\n                 Access To Capital For Job Creators Act\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention in that vein that earlier today \nI introduced a piece of legislation called the Access to Capital for \nJob Creators Act. This bill will make it easier for small businesses to \nbetter access capital in order to expand and create jobs.\n  If you think about the things the job creators around the country \nwant and need in order for them to get that capital off the sidelines, \nto get out of cash and to get invested again and get that money back \ninto our economy and back into creating jobs, they want to see a \ngovernment that lives within its means. They want to see a government \nthat does not spend money it does not have.\n  We have to be serious about cutting spending here at the Federal \nlevel and getting back to more of a historic norm when it comes to the \ncost of our government as a percentage of our entire economy. \nHistorically, for the past 40 years, that has run in the 20- to 21-\npercent range. That is what we spend on the Federal Government as a \npercentage of our entire GDP. Now it is up in the 24- to 25-percent \nrange. That means the Federal Government, as a percentage of our entire \neconomy, is growing relative to our private economy. We want to see the \nprivate economy grow and expand and the Federal economy get smaller.\n  Our job creators also want to see our Tax Code reformed in a way that \nis simple, clear, and fair, and that provides the right types of \nincentives for them to create jobs and does not drive investment \noverseas and create jobs there as opposed to creating those jobs right \nhere at home.\n  If we can get tax reform that lowers rates on individuals and \nbusinesses and broadens the tax base in this country, I think you will \nsee an explosion of economic growth, which is ultimately the best \nsolution we could possibly have to all the fiscal, economic challenges \nour country faces.\n  Our job creators want smart, commonsense regulations, not more and \nmore regulation for regulation's sake, which I think is what we see a \nlot today. We have seen bill after bill that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives that is designed to sort of roll back the \noverregulation, the regulatory overreach we have seen from this \nadministration. Many of those bills have come over here to the Senate, \nwhere they have died, unfortunately.\n\n  But we need to be looking at these things in a way that will again \nlower the impediments, lower the barriers, lower the hurdles to job \ncreation in this country. That is why I think smart, commonsense \nregulation is the way to go, and to get away from the regulatory \noverreach we are seeing all too much of today.\n  We need affordable energy policies, opening access to the vast \nresources we have in this country. We need to open markets around the \nworld and look at ways we can make our small businesses create more \nopportunities for them to export their products to other places around \nthe world.\n  But the legislation I have introduced today addresses yet another \nissue which I think small businesses have talked about; that is, access \nto capital. We need to better address the need for capital in order to \ncreate jobs and expand our economy.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives passed this very bill. It was \nintroduced by Representative Kevin McCarthy. On a near unanimous vote \nin the House of Representatives of 413 to 11 they passed this \nlegislation and sent it this direction. This bill would allow small \nbusinesses to better attract capital from accredited investors \nnationwide under rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 \nby removing the general solicitation provision.\n  That sounds like a lot of Washington speak, and it is. But the very \nsimple translation of that is this will make it easier for small \nbusinesses to access the much needed capital they need to expand and \ngrow their businesses.\n  This provision is a roadblock in its current form for small \nbusinesses that are looking to obtain needed capital because it \nrequires investors to have a preexisting relationship with an issuer or \nintermediary before the potential investor can be notified that \nunregistered securities are available for sale.\n  So if a small business is looking for investors, unless they have a \npreexisting relationship with that investor, there is no way for them \nto get the message out that they are looking for capital to those with \nwhom they do not have that kind of relationship already in place.\n  The provision as it currently exists severely hampers the ability of \nsmall businesses to obtain needed capital from investors, and as a \nresult, many businesses are limited to only the universe of investors \nwith which they clearly have these preexisting relationships.\n  This legislation would remove that solicitation prohibition and allow \nbusinesses to attract capital from accredited investors nationwide.\n  With unemployment at 9 percent, we need to pass legislation that will \nenable our job creators to expand and to create jobs.\n  As I said, this bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in \nthe House of Representatives. I would hope we can do the same in the \nSenate and address this very fundamental need among our businesses, our \nsmall businesses, to get access to much needed capital to expand their \nbusinesses; that, along with using a commonsense approach to \nregulation, an approach that gets away from this massive 61,000 pages \nof new regulations that we have seen issued since this administration \ntook office, to tax reform that is simple, that is clear, that is fair, \nthat provides incentives to keep jobs here at home as opposed to \nshipping them overseas, affordable energy policies, reducing government \nspending, improving export opportunities for our small businesses. \nThose are the types of policies our job creators have said they need.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to vote on the rollback of this \nnet neutrality regulation and some other regulations tomorrow that are \nmaking it more difficult, more costly for our small businesses to \ncreate jobs. I hope we will see strong bipartisan support both with the \ndisapproval resolution that we are going to be voting on net \nneutrality, as well as the one on cross-State air permitting. Those are \nboth things that I think will do a lot to make it less expensive for \nsmall businesses in this country to create jobs.\n  I hope as well that we will look at other opportunities in the form \nof the legislation introduced by Senator McCain, Senator Portman, and \nothers, that has a whole series of the things I mentioned, all of which \nwill create jobs and grow our economy, make this country more \nprosperous and stronger, and put us on a more sound and economic and \nfiscal footing as we head into the days ahead.\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this evening to express my \nunwavering support for the men and women who have answered the call of \nduty in our military services, our Guard and Reserve, and for their \nfamily members whose love and steady support for them have carried our \nservicemembers through challenging times and difficult missions.\n  In honor of Veterans Day, coming up the day after tomorrow, and \nMilitary Family Month, which we observe all month long this November, \nwe need to reflect on the enormous contributions military families have \nmade on behalf of all of us.\n  Since September 11, the spouses, children and parents of our service \nmen and women have been faced with huge demands. They have endured \nrepeated deployments, and spent many holidays and birthdays and \nanniversaries apart from each other. We should do everything we can in \nour communities to help military families cope with the difficulties \nand stresses of these multiple deployments.\n  I commend First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden for their \ncommitment to our troops' families and for their work on initiatives to \naddress the unique challenges military families face in this \nenvironment. I especially appreciate the First Lady's recent visit to \nRhode Island. It provided a warm and welcome boost to military family \nmembers in my State, which has the second highest per capita National \nGuard deployment rate of all the States, as well as a significant \nactive-duty presence at Naval Station Newport.\n  With so many men and women leaving home to serve on multiple \ndeployments, the strain on the family can be particularly difficult. \nLast month I had the privilege of meeting two extraordinary Rhode \nIsland students, Kathleen Callahan, who goes by Katie, and Kaitlyn \nHawley, who presented a powerful and compelling message to school \nsuperintendents and educators from across Rhode Island who came \ntogether to learn about how they can better respond to the needs of \nmilitary families.\n  These two impressive young ladies shared their personal stories and \ndescribed the challenges their families faced while their parents were \ndeployed. The event was part of a collaborative initiative to help \nmilitary-connected children thrive in school through deployments. I was \nproud to share in this joint effort with the Rhode Island National \nGuard, with Governor Chaffee, with our Commissioner of Education, the \nCommanding Officer of Naval Station Newport, our Military Child \nEducation Coalition, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed.\n  Katie is the daughter of a National Guard member. She described how \nher father's deployment affected the roles in her family. Like most \nchildren of deployed servicemembers, Katie assumed additional \nresponsibilities in caring for her younger sibling and helping her \nmother, whom she referred to as a superwoman. Together, they shouldered \nthe burden of her father's absence and kept the family intact and \nsound.\n  Katie described the feeling of--to use her words--silent suffering \nthat can occur when military families feel isolated in civilian \ncommunities that may not completely understand what it is like when a \nloved one is deployed.\n  Kaitlyn is the daughter of an active-duty member. She talked about \nher experience living in eight different States and attending seven \ndifferent schools. Kaitlyn is a highly motivated student and she \nexplained how she threw herself into her schoolwork during her father's \ndeployment. However, she cautioned that for other students, the \nopposite can also occur. Some students may have a lot of difficulty \nfocusing on their schoolwork when a parent is deployed half a world \naway. As Kaitlyn so well put it, there is no one-size-fits-all approach \nto coping with the stress of deployment.\n  I am proud of Katie and Kaitlyn for their courage, their resilience, \nand their powerful articulation of a message that I hope everyone \nhears. We owe our military families an enduring debt of gratitude for \neverything they have done. We should do everything we can to ensure \nthat no family feels isolated or left out or endures the silent \nsuffering Katie described. I hope every American, as we approach \nVeterans Day, will actively support our military families, and do what \nwe can to make our communities more welcoming and supportive in \naccommodating their needs.\n  As Veterans Day approaches, let's celebrate our military families and \nrecognize their extraordinary contributions. Let us thank not only our \nservice men and women but also the spouses, children, and other family \nmembers who have shared in the sacrifice of military service. We should \nalso remember the families of our civilian and intelligence \nservicemembers deployed in danger and away from their families around \nthe world.\n  In concluding, I wish to also express my strong support for the \nbipartisan legislation the Senate is considering to boost employment \nopportunities for veterans. Unemployment has been disproportionally \nhigh among veterans and we must act now. The last thing our returning \nservice men and women need is to have to face an unemployment line. I \nurge my colleagues to swiftly pass this much needed legislation, which \nI am very proud to cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nVOW to Hire Heroes Act 2011, which has been offered as an amendment by \nmy friend from Montana, Senator Jon Tester. This Friday is Veterans \nDay. On this day every year, Americans join together to honor the men \nand women in uniform who have served and sacrificed for our country. \nThink of the work we do for our veterans. Some of it is very small. \nSmall to us, but not small to them. We have people call our office all \nthe time when their benefits are messed up, when redtape gets in the \nway. I will never forget one last year where one of the Patriot guards, \nwho stands on the side and holds the flag during funerals for our \nservicemembers, came to me in tears and said her son had been badly \nhurt serving our country. In fact, he had lost his leg. When he came \nback, he was at Walter Reed. He was fitted with a prosthetic leg, and \nthen he came home. When he was trying to get his benefits, he was told \nhe could not get his benefits for losing his leg--this is a true \nstory--because the records had been lost that showed that he lost his \nleg.\n  He had no leg. We worked on it. And within a week we got his \nbenefits. Those stories are told all across the country. There is \nredtape. We must all help them. But it just goes to show, when you see \nthose stories what our young soldiers are doing every single day.\n  This also means fighting for legislation that fulfills American's \npromise that we will care for our soldiers when they return. When our \nsoldiers signed up to fight for our country, there was no waiting line. \nAnd when they come home to the United States of America and they need a \njob or they need a home or they need medical care or they need an \neducation, there should not be a waiting line. Yet, sadly, when you \nlook at the past decades, too often there is. When I came into the \nSenate, as my friend from Rhode Island came in in 2006, we all remember \nthe horror stories with our veterans' health care. We remember what had \nhappened at our medical hospitals. We remember the stories of soldiers \ngetting lost in the cracks. That is why we worked so hard to make sure \nthey got the health care they deserve.\n  We provided for historic funding increases to ensure top-quality \nhealth care for American servicemembers and military retirees. We also \npassed a post-9/11 GI bill to expand educational benefits for veterans \nwho have served in the past decade. But there is more work to be done \nto support our veterans.\n  Consider two shocking facts. The unemployment rate for Minnesota \nveterans who have served since 9/11 is nearly 23 percent, the third \nhighest in the Nation. Yet our unemployment rate is one of the lower \nones in the Nation. Our unemployment rate is two points better than the \nnational average. Yet it is almost double the national average for \nveterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and more than three times our \nState's overall unemployment rate.\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\n  Second fact. An estimated 700 Minnesota veterans are homeless on any \ngiven night. During the course of the year, an estimated 4,000 \nMinnesota veterans will experience an episode of homelessness or a \ncrisis that could lead to homelessness. This is not right. That is why \nI am calling on my colleagues today to vote to support the VOW to Hire \nHeroes Act. This important bill goes a long way in providing our \nreturning veterans the leg up they need in transitioning into the \nworkforce.\n  I will list just a few important provisions of this bill. It \nencourages companies to hire unemployed veterans by offering them tax \ncredits to do so. The bill provides employers a tax credit of up to \n$5,600 for hiring veterans who have been looking for a job for more \nthan 6 months, as well as a $2,400 credit for veterans who are \nunemployed for more than 4 weeks. The bill also provides employers a \ntax credit of up to $9,600 for hiring veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities who have been looking for a job for more than 6 months.\n  Second, the VOW Act increases training for returning veterans so that \nby the time they step out of their uniforms they have the skills and \nthe tools they need to get out there and market themselves to find a \njob. The bill does this by making it a requirement for returning troops \nto participate in the Transition Assistance Program, a job-training \nboot camp coordinated by the Departments of Defense, Labor, and \nVeterans Affairs, that teaches veterans how to get those jobs, write \nthose resumes, apply their military skills to civilian jobs.\n  Third, the VOW Act expands education benefits for older veterans, \npeople who are not eligible for the post-9/11 GI bill.\n  The bill provides 100,000 unemployed veterans of past eras and wars \nwith up to 1 year of additional Montgomery GI benefits to go toward \neducation or training programs at community colleges or technical \nschools.\n  Fourth, the VOW Act ensures that disabled veterans receive up to 1 \nyear of additional vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits.\n  Last, the VOW Act allows servicemembers to begin the Federal \nemployment process prior to separation, to help them transition \nseamlessly into jobs at the VA, the Department of Homeland Security, or \nthe many other Federal agencies that could use their skills and \ndedication.\n  The fact is our returning veterans have battle-tested skills that are \nvaluable to employers in all kinds of fields. Helping our veterans turn \nthe skills they learned in the military into good-paying jobs not only \nhonors our promise to support those who have sacrificed for our Nation, \nit also helps strengthen our Nation.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to cut through the \nredtape and streamline credentialing for servicemembers who have \nachieved certain skill sets through their military training. I am \noffering an amendment to the VOW Act that will streamline credentialing \nfor returning military paramedics. I learned about this one time when I \nwas driving around our State and I met a number of those who served in \nIraq and Afghanistan. They served as paramedics on the front lines, and \nthey learned incredible skills and how to save lives. Those skills \nweren't all transferable into becoming paramedics once they returned to \nthe United States. At the same time, we have an incredible shortage of \nparamedics in our rural areas.\n  So I am going to introduce this as an amendment that would fix this \nproblem by encouraging States to give paramedics credit for the \nmilitary medical training they have received. Not only does it help \nveterans, but it relieves the shortage of emergency medical personnel \nin rural areas.\n  With commonsense solutions like these and those contained in the VOW \nAct, I believe we can help returning veterans transition into the \nworkforce, not only fulfilling our commitment to them but also helping \nto lift our economy. Having traveled to the western part of our State \nin the last few weeks, I cannot tell you the number of job openings \nright now for welders and tool and die. I have been at companies that \nliterally have dozens of openings--not only starting jobs but for \nengineers. They want military personnel and they need to connect with \nthem and we need to encourage our employers to hire veterans when they \ncome back.\n  Our State has always been a State that understands the debt we owe to \nthe men and women who have served and sacrificed for us. We literally \nwrap our arms around them. I want to end with a story from last \nVeterans Day.\n  After doing our statewide event, I headed up to Wadena, MN, which is \nan area that was torn apart by a tornado, literally ripped up. Their \nhigh school was destroyed. The high school bleachers were three blocks \nfrom where they had been. On Veterans Day, they held the annual event, \nbut they could no longer have it at the high school, which was \ndestroyed. They could no longer have it at some of the other places \nthey used to, so they were all in an elementary school the entire \ntime--all the high school kids and all the veterans sitting on old \nbleachers in that elementary school. I spoke there.\n  What I will never forget is the elementary school kids singing a song \nthat I had never heard before, but I had heard the melody. I remember \nthe Ken Burns movie on World War II. These are the lyrics:\n\n       All we've been given by those who come before,\n       The dream of a nation where freedom would endure,\n       The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this \n     day,\n       What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?\n       Let them say of me I was one who believed\n       In sharing the blessings that I received.\n       Let me know in my heart when my days are through\n       America, America, I gave my best to you.\n\n  That is what those elementary school kids sang after the whole school \nhad been torn apart--with veterans at their side: ``America, America, I \ngave my best to you.''\n  I think that is what we have to remember as we approach this vote on \nthis VOW Act. This vote, to me, is so simple--that we simply give a tax \ncredit so more employers will hire those who have sacrificed for our \ncountry, those who gave their best for our country. That is what this \nvote is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                     Cross-state Air Pollution Rule\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it was fairly recently that this \nsummer I came to the Senate floor to commend the Environmental \nProtection Agency for finalizing what we called the cross-State air \npollution rule, which limits the out-of-State pollution that one State \ncan dump into the wind currents that drop on other States.\n  To my State, Rhode Island, this is particularly important. Nearly a \ndecade after the EPA began working to address this problem of \ninterstate air pollution, we finally had a path forward that is \nsensible and protective of public health. That was then, this is now.\n  Today, Senator Paul of Kentucky proposes to halt this progress, to \nundo that rule through a Congressional Review Act resolution. That \nresolution would, one, void the cross-State air pollution rule and, \ntwo, bar EPA permanently from ever writing a ``substantially similar'' \nrule. This means that EPA could never use the Clean Air Act to create a \ncost-effective pollution trading program to address upwind pollution.\n  Mr. President, this hits home in my State of Rhode Island. Rhode \nIsland has the sixth highest rate of asthma in the country. More than \n11 percent of the people in my State suffer from this chronic disease, \nand many of them are children.\n  In 2009 there were 1,750 hospital discharges in Rhode Island for \nasthma cases. Those hospital stays cost about $8 million in direct \nmedical costs, not to mention the costs of the medication or missed \ndays of work and school.\n  On a clear summer day in Rhode Island, driving along the sparkling \nNarragansett Bay, commuting into work, you will often hear the warning \non drive-time radio:\n\n       Today is a bad air day in Rhode Island. Infants, seniors, \n     people with breathing difficulties should stay indoors today.\n\n  On those days, people in those categories are forced to stay at home, \nmissing work, school, and other important activities. Others even in \ngood health are urged to avoid strenuous activities on these bad air \ndays. These are real costs--costs paid in lives and reduced quality of \nlife, in medical bills,\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\npublic services strained responding to health risks, and in missed days \nof work and school--all from pollution in our air.\n  We don't know everything about the causes and cures of asthma, but we \ndo know one thing: air pollution triggers asthma attacks. We know air \npollution is a preventable problem.\n  Rhode Island has worked hard and made great strides to reduce air \npollution. We passed laws to prohibit cars and buses from idling their \nengines and to retrofit all State schoolbuses with diesel pollution \ncontrols. We require heavy-duty vehicles used in federally funded \nconstruction projects to install diesel pollution controls, adhere to \nthe anti-idling law, and use only low-sulfur diesel. Our transit agency \nvoluntarily retrofitted half of its bus fleet with diesel pollution \ncontrol equipment.\n  But Rhode Island cannot solve its air pollution problem on its own. \nIn fact, Doug McVay, who is acting as chief of Rhode Island's Office of \nAir Resources, told me all of Rhode Island's major sources of air \npollution--not just powerplants but any source that holds a major title \n5 permit--emit less than 3,000 tons a year of nitrogen oxide, also \ncalled NOX, and sulfur dioxide, also called SO2.\n  Let me repeat that. All major sources in Rhode Island taken together \nemit annually less than 3,000 tons of these two pollutants. Polluters \nthat will be subject to the cross-State air pollution rule in other \nStates have single units that emit more than that. Some of the larger \ncoal-fired boilers may emit 10,000 to 12,000 tons of these pollutants \nevery year, nearly four times the pollution emitted by all Rhode Island \nmajor sources combined.\n  In Rhode Island, we are willing to pull our weight in achieving air \npollution reductions. Indeed, we have done more than pull our own \nweight; we are pulling above our weight. But we need all States to be \npulling their weight, too, to make the air safe to breathe in America \nfrom coast to coast.\n  This year at my request the GAO completed a report about tall \nsmokestacks at coal powerplants. The report found that in 1970, the \nyear the Clean Air Act was enacted, there were two what they call tall \nstacks--smokestacks over 500 feet in the United States--two.\n  By 1985 there were more than 180 tall stacks. As of 2010, 284 tall \nsmokestacks were operating at 172 coal powerplants, representing 64 \npercent of the coal-generating capacity in our country. The industry \nliterally smokestacked its way into compliance with the Clean Air Act.\n  What do I mean by that? In the early days of the Clean Air Act, some \nStates allowed sources of pollution to build tall smokestacks instead \nof installing pollution controls. The concept back then was that \npollution sent high enough into the atmosphere would be sent far away \nfrom the source and would not contribute to air pollution problems--at \nleast in that State. Well, it turns out this air pollution causes \nproblems downwind in other States.\n  As the GAO report put it, tall stacks generally disburse pollutants \nover greater distances than shorter stacks and provide pollutants \ngreater time to react in the atmosphere to form ozone and particulate \nmatter.\n  For this antiquated practice, Rhode Island pays the price. \nSmokestacking, instead of scrubbing, is what is behind a lot of the \nozone in Rhode Island that gives rise to those bad air days. The GAO \nfound that more than half of the boilers attached to tall stacks at \ncoal powerplants do not have a scrubber to control sulfur dioxide \nemissions--more than half, no scrubber, just a tall smokestack to pump \nit out to the downwind States. Nearly two-thirds of boilers connected \nto tall stacks do not have postcombustion controls for nitrogen oxide.\n  So how does it get to Rhode Island? As GAO concluded, in the Mid-\nAtlantic U.S. the wind generally blows from west to east. Ozone can \ntravel hundreds of miles with the help of high-speed winds known as the \nlow-level jet. This phenomenon particularly occurs at night due to the \nground cooling quicker than the upper atmosphere, which can allow the \nlow-level jet to form and transport ozone and particulate matter with \nits high winds.\n  This wind map shows that condition. These are all the midwestern \npowerplants, and this is the wind that carries them down here to, among \nother States, Rhode Island.\n  Five States on this map--Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois, \nand North Carolina--have been identified by EPA as contributing \nsignificantly to Rhode Island pollution.\n  This electricity that comes from uncontrolled powerplants tied to \nthese tall smokestacks might seem cheaper to consumers than a well-\ncontrolled powerplant, a powerplant that is scrubbed instead of \nsmokestacking its pollution, but that is really not so. There are \ncosts. The costs just got shifted. The lungs of children and seniors in \nRhode Island and other downwind States pay for that cheap electricity, \nand, truth be told, the lungs of children and seniors in many of the \nupwind States are paying as well. The States upwind of Rhode Island are \ndownwind of someone else. Ohio and Pennsylvania are upwind of Rhode \nIsland, but they are downwind of other States. That is why EPA's \nregulatory impact analysis determined that instate and upwind pollution \nreductions from this rule will save approximately 3,209 lives in Ohio \nand 2,911 lives in Pennsylvania every year by 2014 and prevent hundreds \nof heart attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in those \nStates. This rule opposed by Senator Paul will even save an estimated \n1,705 lives in his home State of Kentucky every year by 2014.\n  It is not just lives saved. EPA estimates that by 2014, the benefits \nfrom this rule will range between $110 billion and $280 billion. At the \nsame time, EPA estimates that the rule will cost utilities $4.1 billion \nto comply in 2012 and another $.8 billion through 2014--a grand total \nof $4.9 billion against $110 billion to $280 billion in quantifiable \nbenefits.\n  At the lower end of the range, this rule generates a 22-to-1 ratio of \nbenefits over costs. For every $1 in cost to the polluters who are \ncreating this pollution, to clean it up, there is $22 in benefit to the \nrest of the country. That is a pretty good investment, and that is at \nthe low end.\n  At the high end, if it is $280 billion, we are talking about a 56-to-\n1 ratio of benefits over costs. We have people from polluting States \nwho, to save a buck for their polluters who are running it up \nsmokestacks instead of scrubbing their pollution, to save the buck in \nputting the scrubber and quit smokestacking their pollution and dumping \nit on Rhode Island and other States, are willing to blow $56 in \nbenefits to Americans across the country, even in their States. It \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  The cross-State air rule is good for public health. It is fair. There \nis no other way Rhode Island can affect these States. We have done \neverything we can to clean our air. We could stop everything, and we \nwould still be a nonattainment clean air quality State because of what \ngets bombed in on us from other States. If we don't have EPA defending \nus, we have no defense at all from States that choose to export their \npollution rather than clean it up. And it is very cost effective, \nbetter than 51 by the highest estimates. So that is why I will be \nvoting against Senator Paul's resolution to void this rule. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island and those who have come to the floor throughout the \nday today, to join them in strong opposition to the efforts by Senator \nPaul to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's cross-State air \npollution rule.\n  As we have heard on the floor, his resolution would strip the EPA of \nits authority to protect our air from certain kinds of air pollution \nemitted by powerplants. That rule was put in place specifically to \nprotect downwind States, such as New Hampshire and those of us in the \nNortheast and on the east coast, from air pollution that originates \nfrom outside our borders. I am particularly concerned by the attempts \nto stop these protections because in New Hampshire we have been \nfighting for them for over a decade, and they are long overdue.\n  Clean air is a bipartisan matter for us in New Hampshire. As my \nfriend and colleague Senator Ayotte noted on the floor last night:\n\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n\n       In New Hampshire, we have a long, bipartisan tradition of \n     working to advance commonsense, balanced environmental \n     protections.\n\n  I couldn't agree with her more. She and I know that even if we \neliminated all local sources of air pollution from within New \nHampshire's borders, we would still have counties in the State with \nunacceptably high levels of pollution. That is because of the \noverwhelming pollution that comes into New Hampshire and the Northeast \non air currents from the Midwest.\n  In the Northeast, we are considered the tailpipe for the rest of the \ncountry. That is why, in 1997, when I was Governor, New Hampshire \njoined with seven other Northeast States to demand that the EPA begin \ncracking down on this transported air pollution. When New Hampshire \njoined that effort in 1997, this is what I said about it:\n\n       When you climb Mount Washington in New Hampshire and see \n     smog that is blown in from the Midwest, it's clearly time for \n     a national crackdown on air pollution . . . it's time to \n     address the major sources of a pollution that is fouling our \n     air and affecting the health of our people. We've done our \n     part in New Hampshire to cut down on emissions, and it's time \n     for the EPA to get tough on major polluters upwind.\n\n  I have here a picture of the White Mountains, which is where Mount \nWashington is. That is the highest point in New Hampshire and, \nactually, in the whole Northeast. What this picture shows very clearly \nis the impact of this air pollution that is coming in from upwind.\n  We can see these are the White Mountains. On a clear day, you can see \na beautiful blue sky, green trees, beautiful landscape. On a hazy day, \nthis is the impact of that smog. It looks as if somebody took a gray \npaintbrush and painted over the White Mountains in New Hampshire.\n  It is really unbelievable to me that we are here, 14 years after this \naction was brought in 1997, still debating transported air pollution. \nThe time for debate is over. The air quality improvements from this \nrule will benefit over 289,000 children who are at risk for asthma in \nNew Hampshire. New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of childhood \nasthma in the country. In my State alone, air pollution is estimated to \ncost businesses more than 17,000 lost days of work annually due to \nhealth problems. Yet we are still hearing the same old arguments that \nforcing polluters to clean up will hurt the economy, will hurt our \nbusinesses. No. In fact, we have lots of research that shows that is \nnot true.\n\n  Talking points about job-killing regulations ignore the fact that a \nrecent economic analysis by the Political Economy Research Institute \nfound that the EPA's cross-State air pollution rule and the proposed \nmercury rule will create 290,000 jobs per year over the next 5 years in \nimportant sectors of our economy such as construction, craft labor, and \nindustrial manufacturing. Companies such as ThermoFischer Scientific, \nwhich has a plant in Newington, NH, is a leading manufacturer of \nenvironmental monitoring equipment and a great example that good policy \ncreates jobs right here in the United States.\n  By reducing air pollution, these protections are estimated to provide \nabout $640 million in benefits to the New Hampshire economy alone. \nNationwide, the health and environmental benefits are estimated at $120 \nbillion to $280 billion each year. That is because when air pollution \ncomes across our State borders, it is our New Hampshire companies that \nare forced to make up the difference. Without these rules, we have an \nunfair system where the burden of keeping our air clean falls \ndisproportionately on downwind States such as New Hampshire.\n  Higher air pollution costs our businesses through the loss of worker \nproductivity and greater medical expenses, and it also affects our \ncritical tourism industry in New Hampshire which depends on the clean \nair of the White Mountains and the health of our beautiful lakes and \nforests and streams. In New Hampshire, this tourism industry and the \noutdoor recreation economy, much like in Colorado where the Presiding \nOfficer is from, supports 53,000 jobs, generates $260 million per year \nin sales taxes, and accounts for 8 percent of our State's gross \ndomestic product. Transported air pollution has a direct impact on this \nindustry, as we can see so clearly in this photograph, and on the \nquality of life of New Hampshire's 1.3 million citizens. It is time for \nthe EPA to move forward with their cross-State air pollution rules.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to reject this resolution \nby Senator Paul and to protect the health and welfare of all of the \ncitizens in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to talk \nabout Veterans Day and important work already going on in Colorado to \nsupport our returning servicemembers and their families.\n  This Friday, Veterans Day holds special significance. America's part \nin the war in Iraq is coming to a close this year, and we have started \ndrawing down combat troops in Afghanistan. In Colorado, that is going \nto mean about 400 Fort Carson soldiers will come home from Iraq in \nDecember alone.\n  Many of the bravest 1 percent of Americans who shoulder 100 percent \nof the responsibility of keeping our country safe will be coming home \nall across the country. As these servicemembers return to their \nfamilies and many transition to civilian life, we need to make sure we \nare ready to make good on the promises we have made.\n  I asked leaders from the Colorado veterans community to make \nrecommendations for how to make Colorado the best State for veterans \nand military families to live and work. After months of thoughtful \nconversation, they produced a comprehensive report called ``Better \nServing Those Who Have Served'' that offers solutions on how to address \nthe challenges facing America's veterans. A key part of this report is \na new proposal to create a National Veterans Foundation, modeled after \nwork being done in Colorado Springs that enabled public and private \nagencies to better collaborate to support veterans and military \nfamilies. This week, I will introduce a bill to bring that Colorado-\nbased innovation to the rest of the country. The bill would create a \ncongressionally chartered National Veterans Foundation to support \ncommunities attempting to work on a blueprint model like Colorado \nSprings. The foundation would help fill gaps in services to veterans by \nhelping communities align and leverage their resources.\n  I have also joined Senator Tester and the Presiding Officer and \ncosponsored the VOW to Hire Heroes Act. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act does \nmuch to help veterans find good-paying jobs, including providing \nsignificant tax incentives to businesses that hire veterans. The Senate \nwill likely be voting on this important legislation tomorrow, and I \nurge colleagues to support its passage.\n  Before I sit down, I wanted to mention that 2 weeks, maybe 3 weeks \nago, I was down in Colorado Springs visiting Fort Carson, and I went to \nsee an elementary school on the post. As a former school \nsuperintendent, I have spent a lot of time over the years in schools \nand tend to want to be there when the children are there so that you \ncan actually get a sense of whether there is any learning going \non. This meeting was different because it was a meeting after school, \nafter the children had gone home. Ninety percent of them live on the \npost. Their entire lives have been defined by these two wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Their entire lives have been defined by the deployment \nof one parent--in some cases two parents--who have served two or three \nor four tours of duty on behalf of this country in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n\n  Thousands of our troops are going to be coming home over the next \nyear. I think we need to be asking ourselves whether we really are \nready to honor the commitments and promises we have made.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n  As others have said tonight, when we are coming out of what is the \nworst economic calamity we have faced since the Great Depression, we \nneed to make sure we are doing absolutely everything we can for these \nveterans but also for the people who are the moms and dads, the \nchildren at elementary schools just like the one I visited, all across \nthe country.\n  The children in this school, according to the teachers with whom I \nmet, have faced extraordinary challenges at home as a result of all \nthis. It is another example of the work we should be doing together \nhere in a bipartisan way as we ask people to serve their country in \nthese foreign wars.\n  I continue to hope at some point there is going to be a breakthrough \nhere and we are going to get past the partisan cartoon we have \nconfronted for the entire time I have been in the Senate and get back \nto the work of the American people and get back to the work that will \nsupport the children in that elementary school at Fort Carson. I want \nto say on this floor and for this record how grateful I am to their \nteachers for teaching but also for giving their Senator an insight into \nthe lives of the young people they are serving.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I would like to celebrate the \nremarkable commitment demonstrated over nearly 18 years in Senate \nservice by one of my most loyal and longest serving aides, Chris Wyman, \nwho retired October 31.\n  Chris Wyman eschews the limelight of politics and the media. But I \nknow him as a close friend and a humble, self-effacing, earnest public \nservant, who ``walked point'' for me in Massachusetts on every issue \nand every case affecting military personnel, veterans, and their \nfamilies.\n  For Chris, the work was always personal. He understands the demands \non the military and their families better than most, having enlisted \nand served on Active Duty in the Navy before he came to work for me \nshortly after I began my second term representing Massachusetts.\n  The work that Chris began on my staff starting in 1993 was difficult, \nparticularly for someone who found such common cause with anyone who \nhad worn the uniform of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or \nCoast Guard. Their cause became Chris's concern day in and day out. The \nissues changed with time, from veterans' benefits and Agent Orange, to \nPTSD and traumatic brain injuries, but what always remained was Chris's \nspecial determination to help those who had served their country and \nensure that they were always treated with dignity and respect by the \ngovernment that had sent them into harm's way.\n  In all those years, Chris was my eyes and ears on the ground in \nMassachusetts 7 days a week--the person who listened to veterans and \ntheir families about the many challenges affecting their lives. His \ncompassion and his presence helped me to take concerns heard in \nconversations and transform them into legislation to tackle human \nproblems on a more national scale.\n  Among the efforts I worked on in the Senate, you can see the imprint \nof Chris's visits to veterans across Massachusetts, including the \nHelping Heroes Keep Their Home Act, which provides protection for \nservicemembers and military families against foreclosure and increased \ninterest rates; a measure that made service life insurance available to \nreservists called to Active-Duty and National Guard members; the Corey \nShea Act, which allows eligible parents of a fallen servicemember to be \nburied with their child in any of the 131 cemeteries run by the VA's \nNational Cemetery Administration, if that child has no living spouse or \nchildren; a $20 million supplemental appropriation in 2007 for VA \ncenters; seven Vet Centers in Massachusetts benefited from the measure; \nand millions of dollars more in Federal grants from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs for homeless vets shelters located throughout \nMassachusetts.\n  For Chris, each of those legislative efforts began with a human face: \nveterans who were living on the streets in a country that at times had \nforgotten their sacrifices when they came home, grieving mothers and \nfathers who had lost children on the battlefield, veterans struggling \nduring an economic collapse that threatened them and their families \nwith foreclosure, and particularly families who had lost sons and \ndaughters to PTSD and the hidden wounds of war and who had dedicated \nthemselves, with Chris's help, to transforming their mourning into \nmission to help others.\n  It is no understatement that Chris had one of the toughest and most \ndemanding job in my Boston office, certainly the most intense. He met \nso many at their most vulnerable and others still who were overcome by \nthe deepest and most indescribable grief--and even anger. But it was \nChris Wyman who remembered always that if Americans were sent somewhere \nin the world dodging bullets and bombs to protect our freedom, then \nthere should be no limit to the government's commitment to do its part \nback home to support them and their families.\n  For Chris, each day was measured not in minutes or hours but in phone \ncalls--as many as 50 calls a day. Some were routine--soldiers or \nveterans needing absentee ballots, forms, or help applying for \nbenefits. For Chris, those cases were the easiest the ones in which a \nhighly placed phone call or a well-timed letter could be the lubricant \nto make the State and Federal bureacracy run more smoothly. But some of \nthose calls were far from routine. Take just one that resulted in a \nspecial moment just about this time last year in Newton, MA, when \nChris's intervention helped right a wrong inadvertently committed years \nbefore by the Federal Government. Thanks to Chris's hard work, I was \nable to present a Congressional Gold Medal to the family of 2LT James \nCalhoun, a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, who was killed in World \nWar II. The Tuskegee Airmen had been awarded the medal collectively in \n2007, but Lieutenant Calhoun's daughter, Jean Calhoun Royster, was \nexcluded from that ceremony. When Jean reached out to Chris and to my \noffice, we intervened to help secure the medal in honor of her father. \nIt was touching to see the pride Jean felt for her father when she held \nhis medal in her very own hands, but more than that, it was inspiring \nto know that behind the scenes it was Chris's diligence that helped to \nmake it happen.\n  I also remember another special day Chris helped make possible--the \nday I pinned a Purple Heart on 22-year-old Sean Bannon of Winthrop, who \nwas wounded in both legs in Iraq and spent 6 weeks recovering at Walter \nReed. We held the ceremony at Fenway Park on Patriots Day in 2008. And \nthe Red Sox surprised Sean by allowing him to throw out the first \npitch, with No. 38, Curt Schilling, standing in as Sean's catcher. He \nwasn't on the field let alone on the mound that day, but Chris Wyman \nwas the MVP of our team that day the unsung hero of a proper welcome \nhome for a real military hero, Sean Bannon. That was a joyful day for \nthe Bannon family and for all of us, but for Chris it was just one of \nthe many ways he made a contribution. It was every day that Chris \nreceived calls from wives, husbands, and children worried about loved \nones on Active Duty somewhere in the world or from veterans enduring \nlife-threatening health conditions. They, too, needed real action, not \njust a promise to get back to them later. And whenever he got one of \nthose calls, Chris would spring into action and stay at it until he got \nthe answers and results that these brave Americans and their families \ndeserved.\n  Among these solemn duties were some that Chris rarely spoke about but \nwhich are seared into him forever.\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nAgain and again, he made personal visits to the homes of Gold Star \nfamilies. He would simply show up to visit, to comfort, and to help out \nafter families received the phone call that every military parent \ndreads the most. Chris formed deep friendships with many of the \nfamilies, friendships that will last a lifetime. While many quote \nAbraham Lincoln's words, Chris lived them--through his actions, not his \nwords, he held sacred Lincoln's pledge at Gettysburg that our country \nwill care for ``him who has borne the battle, and his widow and his \norphan.'' And so Chris did--at wakes, at funerals, in military \nhospitals and veterans homes, in all these difficult circumstances and \nthe difficult days and months and years that followed, Chris Wyman kept \nthe faith.\n  Chris did this for all veterans--in their spirit and many times in \ntheir memory. But he also joined a special fraternity the tight knit \n``Band of Brothers'' who served with me during Swiftboat duty in \nVietnam. He came to them in the 1990s and never lost touch with any of \nthem, extending to them, as he did for so many Massachusetts veterans, \ntotal dedication and commitment through hospital visits, weddings, and \nfunerals. It was no surprise, then, that several years ago they made \nhim an honorary member of their ``brotherhood,'' presenting him with a \nblue crew member shirt, exactly the same as the ones they wore so \nproudly whenever they were together.\n  It seems fitting that Chris is retiring so close to Veterans Day--a \nday to honor America's veterans for their patriotism, their love of \ncountry, and their willingness to serve and to sacrifice because for \nthese past nearly 18 years, for Chris Wyman, every day was Veterans \nDay. He is a shining example of service to those who have served.\n  Mr. President, both Chris and I are proud to be Navy men, and in the \nNavy, we have a special term--``Bravo Zulu'' which means ``Well Done.'' \nSo, as one old sailor to another, with a thank you for many years of \nloyalty and friendship, to Chris Wyman I say ``Bravo Zulu'' for a job \nwell done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7289-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7289-S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe Congress should reexamine the \nfederally mandated medical loss ratios in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. Today I will outline four reasons I believe \nconsumers will face increased costs, decreased choice, and reduced \ncompetition.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PPACA, included a \nprovision that requires all health plans to adhere to a medical loss \nratio, MLR, established in law. The MLR refers to the percentage of \npremium revenues for health insurance plans spent on medical claims. \nThus, if a plan received $100 of premiums and spent $85 on medical \nclaims its MLR would be 85 percent.\n  Beginning no later than January 1, 2011, PPACA requires a health \ninsurance issuer to provide an annual rebate to each enrollee if the \nratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the issuer on \nclinical claims and health quality costs, after accounting for several \nfactors such as certain taxes and reinsurance, is less than 85 percent \nin the large group market and 80 percent in the small group and \nindividual markets.\n  Supporters of PPACA tend to herald the newly created, higher MLR \nrequirement as providing ``better value'' for policyholders compared to \na lower MLR. To the untrained ear, perhaps higher MLRs sound better \nsince they force health insurance plans are required to spend a larger \npercentage of each dollar on medical claims.\n  Jamie Robinson, a professor in the School of Public Health at the \nUniversity of California at Berkley, noted that numerous organizations \n``have assailed low medical loss ratios as indicators of reduction in \nthe quality of care provided to enrollees and sponsored legislation \nmandating minimum ratios.'' However, he rightly concludes that while \n``this is politically the most volatile and analytically the least \nvalid use of the statistic.''\n  In fact, a close examination of the data suggests there are several \nreasons to be concerned with the one-size-fits-all federally mandated \nMLRs in PPACA. Here are four key reasons why PPACA's MLRs will likely \nnegatively impact American consumers and patients.\n  First, insurance markets across the country threaten to destabilize. \nDuring the health reform debate, opponents of the Federal takeover of \nhealth care warned that the federally mandated MLR could endanger the \nhigh-quality health coverage many Americans enjoy because it could lead \nto market destabilization in some States. Under PPACA, States are \npermitted to adjust the percentage for the individual market only if \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services grants them a waiver because \nthe Secretary determines that the health insurance market would \notherwise be destabilized. Unsurprisingly, a total of 15 States have \napplied for a waiver from the MLR. This means that nearly one in three \nStates has found that the MLR could destabilize their market and \nthreaten consumers' coverage.\n  A review of the data shows why States are concerned. According to a \nstudy published in The American Journal of Managed Care, the specific \nimpactof the new medical loss rules on the individual health insurance \nmarket ``has the potential to significantly affect the functioning of \nthe individual market for health insurance.'' Using data from the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, the study's authors \n``provided state-level estimates of the size and structure of the U.S. \nindividual market from 2002 to 2009'' and then ``estimated the number \nof insurers expected to have MLRs below the legislated minimum and \ntheir corresponding enrollment.'' They found that in 2009, ``29 percent \nof insurer-state observations in the individual market would have [had] \nMLRs below the 80 percent minimum, corresponding to 32 percent of total \nenrollment. Nine states would have atleast one-half of their health \ninsurers below the threshold.''\n  The study explained the impact in ``member years,'' which requires \nsome explanation. Most health insurance policies typically have a 12-\nmonth duration, but individuals can enroll or disenroll on a monthly \nbasis. As a result, much of the accounting and actuarial calculations \nthat a health insurance plan makes are in member month or year terms. A \nmember year is 12 member months and could be one individual or multiple \npersons. For example, if an individual is enrolled for 12 months, that \nis one member year, or if two people are enrolled for just 6 months \neach, that is one member year. The study found that ``if insurers below \nthe MLR threshold exit the market, major coverage disruption could \noccur for those in poor health,'' and they ``estimated the range to be \nbetween 104,624 and 158,736 member-years.'' This empirical analysis \nhighlights the huge disruption American consumers may face. As health \ninsurers consolidate, stop offering some insurance products, or exit \nthe market place altogether, Americans who like the high-quality \nprivate health plan they have will lose it. This effect would undermine \nthe President's promise to Americans that if they like the health care \nplan they have, they could keep it.\n  There is a second concern: Instead of consumers receiving ``better \nvalue,'' consumers face increased costs. Despite often-repeated \narguments that federally mandated MLRs will result in ``better value'' \nfor consumers, there is little substance to back up this claim. The \nassumption behind this claim is that spending more cents of a health \ncare dollar directly on care is inherently better. But this may not \nnecessarily be the case. University of California, Berkley, professor \nJamie Robinson has studied the issue of MLRs closely, and he noted in \nHealth Affairs that the connection between the MLR and good value is \nnot as clear as some would claim. ``The medical loss ratio never was \nand never will be an indicator of clinical quality,'' he said. In fact, \nProfessor Robinson explained that ``neither premiums nor expenditures \nby themselves indicate quality of care. More direct measures of quality \nare available, including patient satisfaction surveys, preventive \nservices use, and severity-adjusted clinical outcomes. Although each of \nthese is limited in scope, they at least shed light on quality of care. \nThe medical loss ratio does not.''\n  While the MLR cannot guarantee better value for consumers, it can \nlead to higher premium costs. As the Congressional Research Services \nexplained,\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nthe MLR provision in PPACA requires health insurance plans ``to pay \nrebates to their members if a certain percentage of their premiums are \nnot spent on medical costs. This provision may provide an incentive for \nhealth insurance companies to reduce their compensation to and/or \nutilization of producers as they seek to reduce their administrative \ncosts in relation to their medical costs.''\n  In this scenario, unintended consequences are important to consider. \nFor example, an insurer may increase premiums in another product to \nmake up for lost revenues in one where a rebate is issued. Also \ninsurers may be incentivized to scale back utilization management \ntechniques as a result of the MLR requirement. Accordingly the \nunderlying medical trend which drives premium costs would increase for \neveryone in the risk pool, therefore leading to higher premiums for all \nconsumers who have a health plan with that company.\n  Costs for consumers may also increase because of increased fraud in \nthe system. Because insurance plans are economically discouraged from \nactivities not directly connected to medical care, there is a perverse \nincentive to reduce efforts to police fraud such as conducting \nutilization reviews and data analysis to root out individuals who \ndefraud the system. This is such a significant problem that it was \nhighlighted in congressional testimony before a House subcommittee \nearlier this year. ``Given the role that health plan fraud prevention \nand detection programs have played in establishing effective models for \npublic programs, improved data for law enforcement, and successful \nprevention efforts, we believe the MLR regulation's treatment of such \nprograms should be reevaluated,'' said the witness. According to the \ntestifying witness, the specific concern is `` the MLR regulation only \nprovides a credit for fraud `recoveries'-- i.e., funds that were paid \nout to providers and then recovered under pay and chase' initiatives.'' \nThis effectively discourages preventative measures:\n\n       The MLR regulation's treatment of fraud prevention expenses \n     works at cross purposes with new government efforts to \n     emulate successful private sector programs, and it is at odds \n     with the broad recognition by leaders in the private and \n     public sectors that there is a direct link between fraud \n     prevention activities and improved health care quality and \n     outcomes.\n\n  Ironically, this myopic focus on MLRs obscures the best tool to \nevaluate the value of a health insurance product: consumer choice. As \nProfessor Robinson explained:\n\n       The best indicator of current and expected future value in \n     a market economy is the willingness of the consumer to \n     purchase and retain the product. In health care, this \n     translates into measures of growth in enrollment and \n     revenues, adjusted for disenrollments and changes in prices. \n     Plans that are growing are offering something for which \n     purchasers are willing to vote with their dollars and \n     consumers are willing to vote with their feet.\n\n  Let me turn to my third concern. Consumers face fewer choices, less \ncompetition in the marketplace. As noted previously, the MLR threatens \nto destabilize several markets by pushing some health insurance plans \nto stop offering some insurance products, or exit the market place \naltogether. The Congressional Research Service explained this more in \ndetail in a memo to Congress. CRS said the MLR ``requirements of PPACA \nwill place downward pressures on administrative expenses, including the \nuse of insurance producers. Thus, there will be an incentive for \ninsurance companies to cut back on the use of producers or reduce their \ncommissions in order to rein in their administrative expenses. Some \nobservers, including associations of producers, have suggested that the \nregulatory and market changes resulting from PPACA could put producers \nout of business.''\n  The very allowance in PPACA for waivers from the MLR provision is a \ntacit admission the one-size-fits-all MLR approach mandated under PPACA \nis neither in the best interest of consumer choice nor competition \namong health plans in many insurance markets across the country. \nPresident Obama once publicly pushed for a government-run health plan \nunder the auspices of more ``choice and competition,'' Unfortunately, \nthe controversial health care law he signed is set to reduce choice and \ncompetition for millions of American consumers.\n  Mr. President, finally, the new mlr mandates further the government \ntakeover of health care. Much ink has been spilled about the claim that \nPPACA represents a government takeover of health care. In my view, \nthere is no disputing this claim. Even before the passage of PPACA, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report showing that \n60 percent of health care spending in the United States is controlled \nby State, local, and Federal governments. Now, after passage of the \ncontroversial health care law, the Federal Government will effectively \nregulate health insurance markets and dictate what types of health \ncoverage Americans can buy--even penalizing employers and consumers who \ndo not offer or purchase coverage. The law also massively expands the \nMedicaid Program--a program that began as a Federal-State partnership \nbut that has evolved into a gimmick-ridden program threatening State \nbudgets and too often promising patients coverage while denying them \naccess to care. The law also includes hundreds of new powers for the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services and creates dozens of new \nprograms that will further interfere in the practice of medicine. Yes, \nthe law is a government takeover of health care.\n  Interestingly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned \nthat if the MLRs in PPACA were only slightly higher, PPACA would result \nin a complete government takeover of all health insurance. In a \nDecember 2009 analysis, CBO warned that if the MLRS were 5 percentage \npoints higher, all private insurance would become ``an essentially \ngovernmental program.'' In fact, this CBO analysis--publicized before \nthe health care bills became law-- may be one key reason the Democrats \nrefrained from pushing for a 90-percent MLR. CBO warned that if a 90-\npercent MLR were adopted, ``taken together with the significant \nincrease in the Federal government's role in the insurance market under \nthe PPACA, such a substantial loss in flexibility would lead CBO to \nconclude that the affected segments of the health insurance market \nshould be considered part of the federal budget.'' If the bills' \nauthors had, in fact, included a 90-percent MLR, they would have faced \ncritics waving a CBO analysis affirming the government takeover of the \nhealth insurance industry was complete. However, even with this \ndetermination, CBO appeared to admit that determining at what point a \nhigh MLR triggers a complete government takeover of the insurance \nindustry was not entirely cut and dry. CBO said, ``Setting a precise \nminimum MLR that would trigger such a determination under the PPACA is \ndifficult, because MLRs fall along a continuum.''\n  Mr. President, in the end though, CBO settled on 90 percent as the \ntipping point, though, as they noted, any ``further expansion of the \nFederal Government's role in the health insurance market would make \nsuch insurance an essentially governmental program, so that all \npayments related to health insurance policies should be recorded as \ncash flows in the federal budget.'' In other words, this was just about \nas close as the Democrats could get without even CBO admitting it was a \ncomplete government takeover of the health insurance markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7290-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7290-S7291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STEVE ARMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Steve Arms, a technology inventor, innovator, and successful \nentrepreneur from Vermont.\n  Steve founded and developed a high tech firm, MicroStrain, which \ncreates sophisticated micro sensors that were originally designed for \narthroscopic implantation on human knee ligaments. Their sensors have \nsince evolved and are now used by NASA, on car engines, for advanced \nmanufacturing, on civil structures, and by the U.S. military.\n  When Philadelphia's Liberty Bell needed to be moved in 2003, the \nNational Park Service used MicroStrain to detect whether the 250-year-\nold bell's famous crack was worsening, even by a hundredth of a hair's \nwidth. Fortunately, and thanks to MicroStrain's sensors, the Liberty \nBell was moved without damage.\n  A product of Vermont's public education system and flagship state \nuniversity, Steve grew a one-man business\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nbased out of his Burlington apartment into a more than $12 million a \nyear company. Based in Williston, VT, and now employing 55 people, \nMicroStrain's constant innovation and product improvement has earned \nthe company numerous top awards in the industry.\n  I am proud to see to see Vermonters working on cutting-edge \ntechnology that will benefit both Vermont's and the country's economy. \nI thank Steve and all of the employees at MicroStrain for their hard \nwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent Burlington Free \nPress article entitled Vt.

He'd grown up reading non-stop \n     and often sneaked books and a flashlight under the covers \n     when he was supposed to be asleep.\n       He changed direction shortly before graduating from \n     Burlington High School in 1977. During his junior and senior \n     years, a math teacher and a physics teacher ignited a fuse \n     that prompted Arms to become an engineer, inventor and \n     successful tech entrepreneur who runs a Vermont company with \n     55 employees and gross sales of $12.8 million in 2010.\n       ``I have a dream job. I can't believe I get paid to do \n     this,'' Arms said during an interview at MicroStrain, the \n     sensor company he founded and leads in Williston.\n       The company designs and sells tiny, highly sophisticated \n     sensors used in U.S. military drones, NASA rocket tests, \n     tracking devices and a range of industrial and medical \n     products. Arms founded the company when he was a Ph.D. \n     candidate at the University of Vermont, where he studied \n     engineering and biomechanics. His first product was a mini-\n     sensor used in arthroscopic knee surgeries that he began \n     selling after writing the federal grant to help fund the \n     development himself.\n       In the early days at his company, Arms typed up the \n     invoices, answered the phone and hustled sales in addition to \n     designing products. He slowly grew the company and says a \n     careful, conservative approach to expansion--no outside \n     investors and a pay-as-you go approach as much as possible--\n     allowed the business to thrive and continue developing \n     cutting-edge products as requested by various customers. \n     Because there were no outside money people demanding quick \n     growth, Arms and his staff had the time to try, fail and \n     retry new product design--in other words, innovate.\n       Now much of the work is solving problems for clients and \n     continuously pushing for new designs--and that's what science \n     education should teach as well, Arms said. Schools that help \n     young people use science and math to find solutions--whether \n     it's flood prevention or saving the rain forest--are on the \n     right track. ``Kids are amazingly creative and they really \n     want to make the world a better place,'' Arms said.\n       It can take MicroStrain up to a year to find certain \n     employees and the company regularly recruits out of state. \n     But many employees are Vermonters or returning Vermonters. \n     And Arms has had great success with summer internship \n     programs for college students, many of whom are studying \n     electrical engineering at local colleges and out-of-state \n     schools such as Clarkson, Stanford and MIT. Some interns \n     spend three summers at the company before they graduate. \n     MicroStrain regularly hires from the intern pool because the \n     interns are up to speed on the work and because they've \n     basically succeeded during an extended job interview.\n       As a student, Arms responded to teachers who were well \n     organized, animated and happy to let a curious student run \n     with questions. His foray into bioengineering happened \n     largely because his UVM work study job put him in a \n     department full of doctors and medical researchers. He loved \n     talking to them and soon was writing grants as part of his \n     job--a skill that came in handy when it was time for Arms to \n     found MicroStrain.\n       His advice for students is similar to what he gives his \n     three children, including a son at Reed College and twin \n     daughters at Champlain Valley Union High School. Arms was \n     never a grind who obsessed over getting As in everything and \n     he left some homework undone. He worked, but not obsessively. \n     One thing he did learn was to follow his interests and be \n     efficient--by paying attention in class, for example. ``Be in \n     the moment. . . . Make the most of your time when you are \n     there.''\n       Schools could help inspire a love of science by making it \n     real, he added. Simple props--chalk and a two-by-four, a \n     bicycle wheel--are great ways to teach calculus, physics and \n     other STEM topics. Computers are can be useful tools but they \n     do not guarantee engagement in class, he said.\n       Bringing speakers from STEM employers is another way to \n     reach students, as is career mentoring. Arms still remembers \n     the conversation he had with Sir John Charnley, who pioneered \n     modern hip replacement, after Charnley visited UVM to give a \n     lecture in which he detailed the series of failures he \n     experienced before his big medical breakthrough.\n       ``For me, that was just all I needed,'' Arms said. The talk \n     left him with the sense of: ``I'm not giving up either.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7291-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7291-S7292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           FLATHEAD VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SCHOLARS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the work \nof a group of students enrolled in the Scholars Program at Flathead \nValley Community College in Kalispell, MT.\n  As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction \ncharged with coming up with a plan to tackle the deficit, I asked my \nbosses--the people of the great State of Montana--to send me their \nideas on how to reduce the deficit.\n  Montana was built upon hard work, sacrifice, and values born on the \nfrontier that remind us: we are all in this together. It is the same \nspirit that the Joint Select Committee must tap into in order to \nsucceed.\n  So far, I have received over 1,200 letters, calls, and e-mails from \nMontanans with thoughts on deficit reduction and ideas that implicate \nall aspects of the Federal budget.\n  Montanans sent their suggestions on programs to trim or eliminate, \nwhere we could find additional sources of revenue, and where Congress \nshould tread carefully, to not lose sight of those investments critical \nto the future of Montana and the entire United States.\n  The challenge facing the Joint Select Committee also poses an \nimportant opportunity for us to learn as a nation and as students of \nhistory.\n  That is why I invited Montana's colleges and universities to involve \nstudents in the discussions. Flathead Valley Community College took on \nthis challenge with vigor.\n  FVCC decided to incorporate this project into its Scholars Program, \nan honors program for the college's top students. The students spent \nalmost a month on the project.\n  As we have done in the Joint Select Committee, students started by \nreviewing reports issued by the Congressional Budget Office and the \nvarious bipartisan deficit-reduction plans. The students then met over \na 2-week period to discuss their own ideas and debate the merits of \neach proposal. They all agreed that the group would come up with one \nplan to put forth to my office and to Congress.\n  Now, before I talk about what the students have produced, it is \nimportant to say a word about Flathead Valley Community College and the \ncommunity it serves. Kalispell, MT, is located in the upper \nnorthwestern corner of the State of Montana. Glacier National Park sits \nto the east, and the tip of Flathead Lake is to the south.\n  There are few places in the world privileged to such natural beauty. \nBut this area has not been immune to the tough economic climate. Far \nfrom it.\n  The Flathead area, once dominated by the wood products industry, has \nwitnessed the closure of some of its largest employers.\n  While Montana's overall unemployment rate has remained below the \nnational average, Flathead County is well above it, right now at almost \n10 percent. Surrounding Lincoln, Sanders, and Lake Counties currently \nsit at 13, 13.3, and 10 percent unemployment rates, respectively.\n  Flathead Valley Community College has come to be viewed as the model \nfor 2-year education, both in Montana and nationally.\n  And like many 2-year colleges across the country, FVCC has \nexperienced a significant increase in enrollment as a result of the \neconomic downturn. Both young and old are returning to school to \nenhance their skills.\n  Over the past 2 years, FVCC's enrollment increased by 43 percent. \nLast year, FVCC added 239 sections of classes and hired 89 new adjunct \nfaculty members to meet increased demand.\n  This past spring, FVCC graduated the largest class in its history, \nwith 388 students receiving 438 degrees. One-fourth of those students \nwere eligible for assistance through trade adjustment assistance or the \nWorkforce Investment Act.\n  I raise this because it is important to note that these students \nparticipating\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nin this project are living this economic recession. I asked them to \ndiscuss and come up with deficit-reduction ideas. But they have done so \nwith a keen eye on how these ideas could affect their community and the \nlong-term impact on good-paying jobs.\n  After all the discussions, debates, and, undoubtedly, some \ndisagreements, the students came together and submitted a full summary \nof their proposal to reduce the deficit. The ideas are wide-ranging and \nspan virtually all aspects of the Federal budget.\n  For example, the students recognized that health care costs in this \ncountry pose a threat to the fiscal stability of the Nation. The \nstudents identified a series of ideas that could help in reducing \nhealth care costs, including incentivizing healthier lifestyles. The \ngroup also agreed that Congress should consider ideas for revenue. They \nhighlighted areas such as corporate tax loopholes to find new sources \nof revenue. The students said Congress should look at reducing fraud \nand abuse in current programs.\n  While the students devoted most of their time to finding ways to \nreduce the deficit, they also highlighted the importance of investment. \nThe group agreed investment in education and scientific research is an \nimportant role for the Federal Government to play. As their report \nstates, ``many of the fiscal problems facing the country could be \nameliorated by improving citizens' chances for a quality education.'' I \ncould not agree more.\n  My hat goes off to the students and faculty for joining this \nimportant conversation for our families and for our country. It is \nclear from this report that they took this challenge seriously and \nunderstand the balance needed to address the deficit.\n  I would like to recognize the great work of those involved, including \nPresident Jane Karas, Ph.D., Scholars Program Director Ivan Lorentzen; \nOutreach Coordinator for Career Pathways Jeremy Fritz; and Executive \nDirector for Institutional Research Brad Eldredge, Ph.D. And, most \nimportantly, I would like to commend the students who took on this \nproject: Ursula DeStefano, Tracy Lost-Bear, Lisa Steelye, and Heather \nFrayle.\n  It is my goal to make sure these students and their peers nationwide \nwill be able to find good-paying jobs when they graduate. I am doing \neverything I can to address both our jobs deficit and our fiscal \ndeficit so that we can leave our Nation in better shape than we found \nit for these students and their children.\n  I thank Flathead Valley Community College, the instructors, and \nstudents for their thoughtful ideas. I hope the experience inspired \nthem to stay involved. They took this project seriously and worked hard \nto find agreement. We in Congress must do the same. The future for \nthese students and this country is at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7292-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING GILBERT ``GIL'' CATES\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, earlier this year members of the \nMaine Legislature proposed a bill to name the whoopie pie the official \nState dessert of Maine, later settling on naming it the ``State treat \nof Maine.'' The whoopie pie, a baked good normally consisting of two \nchocolate cakes with creamy frosting in between, has been a New England \ntradition for nearly a century. Anyone who has tasted a whoopie pie \nknows exactly how special and delectable one really is. With Maine's \nofficial ``treat'' in mind, today I recognize and commend Isamax \nSnacks, a small business in Maine that has perfected the art of \nhomemade whoopie pies.\n  Amy Bouchard always loved baking, and in 1994, she started a small \nbusiness making whoopie pies, out of her home kitchen in the small town \nof Gardiner. Amy's whoopie pies were famous among her friends as \n``wicked,'' and therefore she thought it was only proper to name them \n``Wicked Whoopies.'' As any Mainer knows, ``wicked'' is a synonym for \n``great'' and is commonly used to refer to any extraordinary item, \nwhich Amy's desserts most certainly are.\n  Originally, Isamax was started as a way to supplement her husband's \nincome to assist in raising their two young children, Isabella and \nMaxx, from which the name of her company is derived. But as more people \ndiscovered her Wicked Whoopies, Amy's business\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\ngrew rapidly and the small kitchen could no longer keep up with the \ndemand. In 1996, Amy moved to a commercial bakery and purchased two \ndistribution trucks. These investments tripled her business size and \ndistribution territory. Amy now also has two stores in Farmingdale and \nFreeport, where she sells her mouth-watering treats.\n  Today, Amy's small company sells 24 different varieties of whoopie \npies, including many seasonal favorites like pumpkin and peppermint, \nand produces nearly one million Wicked Whoopies each year! Amy also \nrecently added the decadent and innovative ``Whoop-de-Doo'' to her line \nup; a smaller version of a classic Wicked Whoopie dipped in chocolate. \nHer business has received countless reviews and awards for its \nproducts, and has been featured on several nationally televised shows, \nsuch as ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in 2003, ``Good Morning America'' in \n2005, and Food Network's ``Unwrapped'' in 2007. Wicked Whoopies have \nalso been promoted in the New York Times, the Associated Press, and are \neven available for purchase on the Home Shopping Network's Web site for \nthe 2011 holiday season. Additionally, the city of Gardiner Board of \nTrade awarded Isamax Snacks with its President's Award in 2004 and \nInterface Tech News awarded Wicked Whoopies ``Maine's Best of the Web'' \nin the e-commerce category in 2005.\n  Over the last 15 years, Isamax Snacks has established itself as one \nof the country's premier and most heralded whoopie pie and dessert \ncompanies. This national notoriety is richly deserved as Amy Bouchard's \nsmall dream to help her family blossomed into a vibrant small business. \nI am proud to congratulate Amy and everyone at Isamax Snacks on their \noutstanding work, and wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/09/senate-section/article/S7293-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SIX-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT RELATIVE TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \nDECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938 WITH RESPECT TO THE PROLIFERATION OF \n                   WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--PM 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Such authority shall commence beginning no \n     earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at \n     least 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Alternative.--\n       (1) In general.--A State that is not a Member State under \n     the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized to \n     require all sellers not qualifying for the small seller \n     exception to collect and remit sales and use taxes with \n     respect to remote sales sourced to that State, but only if \n     the State adopts and implements minimum simplification \n     requirements. Such authority shall commence beginning no \n     earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at \n     least 6 months after the date that the State enacts \n     legislation to implement each of the following minimum \n     simplification requirements:\n       (A) Provide--\n       (i) a single State-level agency to administer all sales and \n     use tax laws, including the collection and administration of \n     all State and applicable locality sales and use taxes for all \n     sales sourced to the State made by remote sellers,\n       (ii) a single audit for all State and local taxing \n     jurisdictions within that State, and\n       (iii) a single sales and use tax return to be used by \n     remote sellers and single and consolidated providers and to \n     be filed with the State-level agency.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State.\n       (C) Require remote sellers and single and consolidated \n     providers to collect sales and use taxes pursuant to the \n     applicable destination rate, which is the sum of the \n     applicable State rate and any applicable rate for the local \n     jurisdiction into which the sale is made.\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) adequate software and services to remote sellers and \n     single and consolidated providers that identifies the \n     applicable destination rate, including the State and local \n     sales tax rate (if any), to be applied on sales sourced to \n     the State, and\n       (ii) certification procedures for both single providers and \n     consolidated providers to make software and services \n     available to remote sellers, and hold such providers harmless \n     for any errors or omissions as a result of relying on \n     information provided by the State.\n       (E) Hold remote sellers using a single or consolidated \n     provider harmless for any errors and omissions by that \n     provider.\n       (F) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for collection of the incorrect amount of sales or \n     use tax, including any penalties or interest, if collection \n     of the improper amount is the result of relying on \n     information provided by the State.\n       (G) Provide remote sellers and single and consolidated \n     providers with 30 days notice of a rate change by any \n     locality in the State.\n       (2) Treatment of local rate changes.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, local rate changes may only be effective on the \n     first day of a calendar quarter.

For purposes of \n     determining whether the threshold in this subsection is met, \n     the sales of all persons related within the meaning of \n     subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or section 707(b)(1) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be aggregated.\n\n     SEC. 4.

REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF COVERED BOND PROGRAMS \n                   ESTABLISHED.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act,\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\n     the Secretary shall, by rule and in consultation with the \n     covered bond regulators, establish a covered bond regulatory \n     oversight program that provides for--\n       (A) covered bond programs to be evaluated according to \n     reasonable and objective standards in order to be approved \n     under paragraph (2), including any additional eligibility \n     standards for eligible assets and any other criteria \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary to further the \n     purposes of this Act;\n       (B) covered bond programs to be maintained in a manner that \n     is consistent with this Act and safe and sound asset-\n     liability management and other financial practices; and\n       (C) any estate created under section 4 to be administered \n     in a manner that is consistent with maximizing the value and \n     the proceeds of the related cover pool in a resolution under \n     this Act.\n       (2) Approval of each covered bond program.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered bond shall be subject to this \n     Act only if the covered bond is issued by an eligible issuer \n     under a covered bond program that is approved by the \n     applicable covered bond regulator.\n       (B) Approval process.--Each covered bond regulator shall \n     apply the standards established by the Secretary under the \n     oversight program to evaluate a covered bond program that has \n     been submitted by an eligible issuer for approval. Each \n     covered bond regulator also shall take into account relevant \n     supervisory factors, including safety and soundness \n     considerations, in evaluating a covered bond program that has \n     been submitted for approval. Each covered bond regulator, \n     promptly after approving a covered bond program, shall \n     provide the Secretary with the name of the covered bond \n     program, the name of the eligible issuer, and all other \n     information reasonably requested by the Secretary in order to \n     update the registry under paragraph (3)(A). Each eligible \n     issuer, promptly after issuing a covered bond under an \n     approved covered bond program, shall provide the Secretary \n     with all information reasonably requested by the Secretary in \n     order to update the registry under paragraph (3)(B).\n       (C) Existing covered bond programs.--A covered bond \n     regulator may approve a covered bond program that is in \n     existence on the date of the enactment of this Act. Upon such \n     approval, each covered bond under the covered bond program \n     shall be subject to this Act, regardless of when the covered \n     bond was issued.\n       (D) Multiple covered bond programs permitted.--An eligible \n     issuer may have more than 1 covered bond program.\n       (E) Cease and desist authority.--The applicable covered \n     bond regulator may direct an eligible issuer to cease issuing \n     covered bonds under an approved covered bond program if the \n     covered bond program is not maintained in a manner that is \n     consistent with this Act and the oversight program and if, \n     after notice that is reasonable under the circumstances, the \n     issuer does not remedy all deficiencies identified by the \n     applicable covered bond regulator.\n       (F) Cap on the amount of outstanding covered bonds.--\n       (i) In general.--With respect to each eligible issuer that \n     submits a covered bond program for approval, the applicable \n     covered bond regulator shall set, consistent with safety and \n     soundness considerations and the financial condition of the \n     eligible issuer, the maximum amount, as a percentage of the \n     eligible issuer's total assets, of outstanding covered bonds \n     that the eligible issuer may issue.\n       (ii) Review of cap.--The applicable covered bond regulator \n     may, not more frequently than quarterly, review the \n     percentage set under clause (i) and, if safety and soundness \n     considerations or the financial condition of the eligible \n     issuer has changed, increase or decrease such percentage. Any \n     decrease made pursuant to this clause shall have no effect on \n     existing covered bonds issued by the eligible issuer.\n       (3) Registry.--Under the oversight program, the Secretary \n     shall maintain a registry that is published on a Web site \n     available to the public and that, for each covered bond \n     program approved by a covered bond regulator, contains--\n       (A) the name of the covered bond program, the name of the \n     eligible issuer, and all other information that the Secretary \n     considers necessary to adequately identify the covered bond \n     program and the eligible issuer; and\n       (B) all information that the Secretary considers necessary \n     to adequately identify all outstanding covered bonds issued \n     under the covered bond program (including the reports \n     described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b)).\n       (4) Fees.--Each covered bond regulator may levy, on the \n     issuers of covered bonds under the primary supervision of \n     such covered bond regulator, reasonably apportioned fees that \n     such covered bond regulator considers necessary, in the \n     aggregate, to defray the costs of such covered bond regulator \n     carrying out the provisions of this Act. Such funds shall not \n     be construed to be Government funds or appropriated monies \n     and shall not be subject to apportionment for purposes of \n     chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code, or any other \n     provision of law.\n       (b) Minimum Over-Collateralization Requirements.--\n       (1) Requirements established.--The Secretary, by rule and \n     in consultation with the covered bond regulators, shall \n     establish minimum over-collateralization requirements for \n     covered bonds backed by each of the eligible asset classes. \n     The minimum over-collateralization requirements shall be \n     designed to ensure that sufficient eligible assets and \n     substitute assets are maintained in the cover pool to satisfy \n     all principal and interest payments on the covered bonds when \n     due through maturity and shall be based on the credit, \n     collection, and interest rate risks (excluding the liquidity \n     risks) associated with the eligible asset class.\n       (2) Asset coverage test.--The eligible assets and the \n     substitute assets in any cover pool shall be required, in the \n     aggregate, to meet at all times the applicable minimum over-\n     collateralization requirements.\n       (3) Monthly reporting.--On a monthly basis, each issuer of \n     covered bonds shall submit a report on whether the cover pool \n     that secures the covered bonds meets the applicable minimum \n     over-collateralization requirements to--\n       (A) the Secretary;\n       (B) the applicable covered bond regulator;\n       (C) the applicable indenture trustee;\n       (D) the applicable covered bondholders; and\n       (E) the applicable independent asset monitor.\n       (4) Independent asset monitor.--\n       (A) Appointment.--Each issuer of covered bonds shall \n     appoint the indenture trustee for the covered bonds, or \n     another unaffiliated entity, as an independent asset monitor \n     for the applicable cover pool.\n       (B) Duties.--An independent asset monitor appointed under \n     subparagraph (A) shall, on an annual or other more frequent \n     periodic basis determined by the Secretary under the \n     oversight program--\n       (i) verify whether the cover pool meets the applicable \n     minimum over-collateralization requirements; and\n       (ii) report to the Secretary, the applicable covered bond \n     regulator, the applicable indenture trustee, and the \n     applicable covered bondholders on whether the cover pool \n     meets the applicable minimum over-collateralization \n     requirements.\n       (C) Removal and replacement.--The independent asset monitor \n     appointed under subparagraph (A) may be removed and \n     replaced--\n       (i) by a covered bond regulator in any case in which such \n     action is in the best interest of the covered bond investors; \n     and\n       (ii) by covered bond holders who own a majority of the \n     outstanding principal amount of the covered bonds secured by \n     the applicable cover pool, at any time.\n       (5) No loss of status.--Covered bonds shall remain subject \n     to this Act regardless of whether the applicable cover pool \n     ceases to meet the applicable minimum over-collateralization \n     requirements.\n       (6) Failure to meet requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--If a cover pool fails to meet the \n     applicable minimum over-collateralization requirements, and \n     if the failure is not cured within the time specified in the \n     related transaction documents, the failure shall be an \n     uncured default for purposes of section 4(a).\n       (B) Notice required.--An issuer of covered bonds shall \n     promptly give the Secretary and the applicable covered bond \n     regulator written notice if the cover pool securing the \n     covered bonds fails to meet the applicable minimum over-\n     collateralization requirements, if the failure is cured \n     within the time specified in the related transaction \n     documents, or if the failure is not so cured.\n       (c) Requirements for Eligible Assets.--\n       (1) Requirements.--\n       (A) Loans.--A loan shall not qualify as an eligible asset \n     for so long as the loan is delinquent for more than 60 \n     consecutive days.\n       (B) Securities.--A security shall not qualify as an \n     eligible asset for so long as the security does not meet any \n     credit-quality requirement under this Act.\n       (C) Origination.--An asset shall not qualify as an eligible \n     asset if the asset was not originated in compliance with any \n     rule or supervisory guidance of a Federal agency applicable \n     to the asset at the time of origination.\n       (D) No double pledge.--An asset shall not qualify as an \n     eligible asset for so long as the asset is subject to a prior \n     perfected security interest or other prior perfected lien \n     that has been granted in an unrelated transaction. Nothing in \n     this Act shall affect such a prior perfected security \n     interest or other prior perfected lien, and the rights of \n     such lien holders.\n       (2) Failure to meet requirements.--Subject to paragraph \n     (1)(D), if an asset in a cover pool does not satisfy any \n     applicable requirement described in paragraph (1) or any \n     other applicable standard or criterion described in this Act, \n     the oversight program, or the related transaction documents, \n     the asset shall not qualify as an eligible asset for purposes \n     of the asset coverage test described in subsection (b)(2). A \n     disqualified asset shall remain in the cover pool unless and \n     until removed by the issuer in compliance with the provisions \n     of this Act, the oversight program, and the related \n     transaction documents. No disqualified asset may be removed \n     from the cover pool after an estate has been created for the \n     related covered bond program under section 4(b)(1) or \n     4(c)(2), except in connection with the management of the \n     cover pool under section 4(d)(1)(E).\n       (d) Other Requirements.--\n       (1) Books and records of issuer.--Each issuer of covered \n     bonds shall clearly mark its books and records to identify \n     the assets that\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\n     comprise the cover pool securing the covered bonds.\n       (2) Schedule of eligible assets and substitute assets.--\n     Each issuer of covered bonds shall deliver to the applicable \n     indenture trustee and the applicable independent asset \n     monitor, on at least a monthly basis, a schedule that \n     identifies all eligible assets and substitute assets in the \n     cover pool securing the covered bonds.\n       (3) Single eligible asset class.--No cover pool described \n     in section 2(3)(A) may include eligible assets from more than \n     1 eligible asset class. No cover pool described in section \n     2(3)(B) may include covered bonds backed by more than 1 \n     eligible asset class.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESOLUTION UPON DEFAULT OR INSOLVENCY.\n\n       (a) Uncured Default Defined.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``uncured default'' means a default on a covered \n     bond that has not been cured within the time, if any, \n     specified in the related transaction documents.\n       (b) Default on Covered Bonds Prior to Conservatorship, \n     Receivership, Liquidation, or Bankruptcy.--\n       (1) Creation of separate estate.--If an uncured default \n     occurs on a covered bond before the issuer of the covered \n     bond enters conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or \n     bankruptcy, an estate shall be immediately and automatically \n     created by operation of law and shall exist and be \n     administered separate and apart from the issuer or any \n     subsequent conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, \n     or estate in bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of \n     the issuer. A separate estate shall be created for each \n     affected covered bond program.\n       (2) Assets and liabilities of estate.--Any estate created \n     under paragraph (1) shall be comprised of the cover pool \n     (including over-collateralization in the cover pool) that \n     secures the covered bond. The cover pool shall be immediately \n     and automatically released to and held by the estate free and \n     clear of any right, title, interest, or claim of the issuer \n     or any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee \n     in bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the \n     issuer. The estate shall be fully liable on the covered bond \n     and all other covered bonds and related obligations of the \n     issuer (including obligations under related derivative \n     transactions) that are secured by a perfected security \n     interest in or other perfected lien on the cover pool when \n     the estate is created. The estate shall not be liable on any \n     obligation of the issuer that is not secured by a perfected \n     security interest in or other perfected lien on the cover \n     pool when the estate is created. No conservator, receiver, \n     liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer \n     may charge or assess the estate for any claim of the \n     conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy or the conservatorship, receivership, liquidating \n     agency, or estate in bankruptcy and may not obtain or perfect \n     a security interest in or other lien on the cover pool to \n     secure such a claim.\n       (3) Retention of claims.--Any holder of a covered bond or \n     related obligation for which an estate has become liable \n     under paragraph (2) shall retain a claim against the issuer \n     for any deficiency with respect to the covered bond or \n     related obligation. If the issuer enters conservatorship, \n     receivership, liquidation, or bankruptcy, any contingent \n     claim for such a deficiency shall be allowed as a provable \n     claim in the conservatorship, receivership, liquidating \n     agency, or bankruptcy case. The contingent claim shall be \n     estimated by the conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or \n     bankruptcy court for purposes of allowing the claim as a \n     provable claim if awaiting the fixing of the contingent claim \n     would unduly delay the resolution of the conservatorship, \n     receivership, liquidating agency, or bankruptcy case.\n       (4) Residual interest.--\n       (A) Issuance of residual interest.--Upon the creation of an \n     estate under paragraph (1), a residual interest in the estate \n     shall be immediately and automatically issued by operation of \n     law to the issuer.\n       (B) Nature of residual interest.--The residual interest \n     under subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) be an exempted security as described in section 5;\n       (ii) represent the right to any surplus from the cover pool \n     after the covered bonds and all other liabilities of the \n     estate have been fully and irrevocably paid; and\n       (iii) be evidenced by a certificate executed by the trustee \n     of the estate.\n       (5) Obligations of issuer.--\n       (A) In general.--After the creation of an estate under \n     paragraph (1), the issuer shall--\n       (i) transfer to or at the direction of the trustee for the \n     estate all property of the estate that is in the possession \n     or under the control of the issuer, including all tangible or \n     electronic books, records, files, and other documents or \n     materials relating to the assets and liabilities of the \n     estate; and\n       (ii) at the election of the trustee or a servicer or \n     administrator for the estate, continue servicing the \n     applicable cover pool for 120 days after the creation of the \n     estate in return for a fair-market-value fee, as determined \n     by the trustee in consultation with the applicable covered \n     bond regulator, that shall be payable from the estate as an \n     administrative expense.\n       (B) Obligations absolute.--Neither the issuer, whether \n     acting as debtor in possession or in any other capacity, nor \n     any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the issuer \n     may disaffirm, repudiate, or reject the obligation to turn \n     over property or to continue servicing the cover pool as \n     provided in subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Default on Covered Bonds Upon Conservatorship, \n     Receivership, Liquidation, or Bankruptcy.--\n       (1) Corporation conservatorship or receivership.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Corporation is appointed as \n     conservator or receiver for an issuer of covered bonds before \n     an uncured default results in the creation of an estate under \n     subsection (b), the Corporation as conservator or receiver \n     shall have an exclusive right, during the 1-year period \n     beginning on the date of the appointment, to transfer any \n     cover pool owned by the issuer in its entirety, together with \n     all covered bonds and related obligations that are secured by \n     a perfected security interest in or other perfected lien on \n     the cover pool, to another eligible issuer that meets all \n     conditions and requirements specified in the related \n     transaction documents. The Corporation as conservator or \n     receiver may not remove any asset from the cover pool, except \n     to the extent otherwise agreed by a transferee that has \n     assumed the covered bond program pursuant to subparagraph \n     (C).\n       (B) Obligations during 1-year period.--During the 1-year \n     period described in subparagraph (A), the Corporation as \n     conservator or receiver shall fully and timely satisfy all \n     monetary and nonmonetary obligations of the issuer under all \n     covered bonds and the related transaction documents and shall \n     fully and timely cure all defaults by the issuer (other than \n     its conservatorship or receivership) under the applicable \n     covered bond program, in each case, until the earlier of--\n       (i) the transfer of the applicable covered bond program to \n     another eligible issuer as provided in subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) the delivery to the Secretary, the applicable covered \n     bond regulator, the applicable indenture trustee, and the \n     applicable covered bondholders of a written notice from the \n     Corporation as conservator or receiver electing to cease \n     further performance under the applicable covered bond \n     program.\n       (C) Assumption by transferee.--If the Corporation as \n     conservator or receiver transfers a covered bond program to \n     another eligible issuer within the 1-year period as provided \n     in subparagraph (A), the transferee shall take ownership of \n     the applicable cover pool and shall become fully liable on \n     all covered bonds and related obligations of the issuer that \n     are secured by a perfected security interest in or other \n     perfected lien on the cover pool.\n       (2) Other circumstances.--An estate shall be immediately \n     and automatically created by operation of law and shall exist \n     and be administered separate and apart from an issuer of \n     covered bonds and any conservatorship, receivership, \n     liquidating agency, or estate in bankruptcy for the issuer or \n     any other assets of the issuer, if--\n       (A) a conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee \n     in bankruptcy, other than the Corporation, is appointed for \n     the issuer before an uncured default results in the creation \n     of an estate under subsection (b); or\n       (B) in the case of the appointment of the Corporation as \n     conservator or receiver as described in paragraph (1)(A), the \n     Corporation as conservator or receiver--\n       (i) does not complete the transfer of the applicable \n     covered bond program to another eligible issuer within the 1-\n     year period as provided in paragraph (1)(A);\n       (ii) delivers to the Secretary, the applicable covered bond \n     regulator, the applicable indenture trustee, and the \n     applicable covered bondholders a written notice electing to \n     cease further performance under the applicable covered bond \n     program; or\n       (iii) fails to fully and timely satisfy all monetary and \n     nonmonetary obligations of the issuer under the covered bonds \n     and the related transaction documents or to fully and timely \n     cure all defaults by the issuer (other than its \n     conservatorship or receivership) under the applicable covered \n     bond program.\n\n     A separate estate shall be created for each affected covered \n     bond program.\n       (3) Assets and liabilities of estate.--Any estate created \n     under paragraph (2) shall be comprised of the cover pool \n     (including over-collateralization in the cover pool) that \n     secures the covered bonds. The cover pool shall be \n     immediately and automatically released to and held by the \n     estate free and clear of any right, title, interest, or claim \n     of the issuer or any conservator, receiver, liquidating \n     agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer or any other \n     assets of the issuer. The estate shall be fully liable on the \n     covered bonds and all other covered bonds and related \n     obligations of the issuer (including obligations under \n     related derivative transactions) that are secured by a \n     perfected security interest in or other perfected lien on the \n     cover pool when the estate is created. The estate shall not \n     be liable on any obligation of the issuer that is not secured \n     by a perfected security interest in or other perfected lien \n     on the cover pool when the estate is created. No conservator, \n     receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the \n     issuer may charge or assess the estate for any claim of the \n     conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy or the conservatorship, receivership, liquidating \n     agency, or estate in bankruptcy and may not\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n     obtain or perfect a security interest in or other lien on the \n     cover pool to secure such a claim.\n       (4) Contingent claim.--Any contingent claim against an \n     issuer for a deficiency with respect to a covered bond or \n     related obligation for which an estate has become liable \n     under paragraph (3) shall be allowed as a provable claim in \n     the conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, or \n     bankruptcy case for the issuer. The contingent claim shall be \n     estimated by the conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or \n     bankruptcy court for purposes of allowing the claim as a \n     provable claim if awaiting the fixing of the contingent claim \n     would unduly delay the resolution of the conservatorship, \n     receivership, liquidating agency, or bankruptcy case.\n       (5) Residual interest.--\n       (A) Issuance of residual interest.--Upon the creation of an \n     estate under paragraph (2), and regardless of whether any \n     contingent claim described in paragraph (4) becomes fixed or \n     is estimated, a residual interest in the estate shall be \n     immediately and automatically issued by operation of law to \n     the conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy for the issuer.\n       (B) Nature of residual interest.--The residual interest \n     under subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) be an exempted security as described in section 5;\n       (ii) represent the right to any surplus from the cover pool \n     after the covered bonds and all other liabilities of the \n     estate have been fully and irrevocably paid; and\n       (iii) be evidenced by a certificate executed by the trustee \n     of the estate.\n       (6) Obligations of issuer.--\n       (A) In general.--After the creation of an estate under \n     paragraph (2), the issuer and its conservator, receiver, \n     liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy shall--\n       (i) transfer to or at the direction of the trustee for the \n     estate all property of the estate that is in the possession \n     or under the control of the issuer or its conservator, \n     receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy, \n     including all tangible or electronic books, records, files, \n     and other documents or materials relating to the assets and \n     liabilities of the estate; and\n       (ii) at the election of the trustee or a servicer or \n     administrator for the estate, continue servicing the \n     applicable cover pool for 120 days after the creation of the \n     estate in return for a fair-market-value fee, as determined \n     by the trustee in consultation with the applicable covered \n     bond regulator, that shall be payable from the estate as an \n     administrative expense.\n       (B) Obligations absolute.--Neither the issuer, whether \n     acting as debtor in possession or in any other capacity, nor \n     any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the issuer \n     may disaffirm, repudiate, or reject the obligation to turn \n     over property or to continue servicing the cover pool as \n     provided in subparagraph (A).\n       (d) Administration and Resolution of Estates.--\n       (1) Trustee, servicer, and administrator.--\n       (A) In general.--Upon the creation of any estate under \n     subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2), the applicable covered bond \n     regulator shall--\n       (i) appoint the trustee for the estate;\n       (ii) appoint 1 or more servicers or administrators for the \n     cover pool held by the estate; and\n       (iii) give the Secretary, the applicable indenture trustee, \n     the applicable covered bondholders, and the owner of the \n     residual interest written notice of the creation of the \n     estate.\n       (B) Terms and conditions of appointment.--All terms and \n     conditions of any appointment under paragraph (1), including \n     the terms and conditions relating to compensation, shall \n     conform to the requirements of this Act and the oversight \n     program and otherwise shall be determined by the applicable \n     covered bond regulator.\n       (C) Qualification.--The applicable covered bond regulator \n     may require the trustee or any servicer or administrator for \n     an estate to post in favor of the United States, for the \n     benefit of the estate, a bond that is conditioned on the \n     faithful performance of the duties of the trustee or the \n     servicer or administrator.

No person (including \n     the applicable indenture trustee and any applicable covered \n     bondholder) may commence or continue any judicial, \n     administrative, or other action against the estate, the \n     trustee, or any servicer or administrator or take any other \n     act to affect the estate, the trustee, or any servicer or \n     administrator that is not expressly permitted by this Act, \n     the oversight program, and the related transaction documents, \n     except for a judicial or administrative action to compel the \n     release of funds that--\n       (i) are available to the estate;\n       (ii) are permitted to be distributed under this Act and the \n     oversight program; and\n       (iii) are permitted and required to be distributed under \n     the related transaction documents and any contracts executed \n     by or on behalf of the estate.\n       (L) Sovereign immunity.--Except in connection with a \n     guarantee provided under paragraph (4) or any other contract \n     executed by the applicable covered bond regulator under this \n     section 4, the Secretary and the covered bond regulator shall \n     be entitled to sovereign immunity in carrying out the \n     provisions of this Act.\n       (2) Borrowings and credit.--\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n       (A) In general.--Any servicer or administrator for an \n     estate created under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2) may borrow \n     funds or otherwise obtain credit, on behalf of and for the \n     benefit of the estate, from any person in compliance with \n     this paragraph (2) solely for the purpose of providing \n     liquidity in the case of timing mismatches among the assets \n     and the liabilities of the estate.

The Comptroller General shall submit a report \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the \n     House of Representatives on the results of the study not \n     later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Distributions by estate.--All payments or other \n     distributions by an estate shall be made at the times, in the \n     amounts, and in the manner set forth in the covered bonds, \n     the related transaction documents, and any contracts executed \n     by or on behalf of the estate in compliance with this Act and \n     the oversight program. To the extent that the relative \n     priority of the liabilities of the estate are not specified \n     in or otherwise ascertainable from their terms, distributions \n     shall be made on each distribution date under the covered \n     bonds, the related transaction documents, or any contracts \n     executed by or on behalf of the estate--\n       (A) first, to pay accrued and unpaid superpriority claims \n     under paragraph (2)(B)(ii);\n       (B) second, to pay accrued and unpaid administrative \n     expense claims under paragraph (1)(I), paragraph (2)(B)(ii), \n     section 4(b)(5)(A), or section 4(c)(6)(A);\n       (C) third, to pay--\n       (i) accrued and unpaid claims under the covered bonds and \n     the related transaction documents according to their terms; \n     and\n       (ii) accrued and unpaid pari passu claims under paragraph \n     (2)(B)(ii); and\n       (D) fourth, to pay accrued and unpaid subordinated claims \n     under paragraph (2)(B)(i).\n       (4) Distributions on residual interest.--After all other \n     claims against and interests in an estate have been fully and \n     irrevocably paid or defeased, the trustee shall or shall \n     cause a servicer or administrator to distribute the remainder \n     of the estate to or at the direction of the owner of the \n     residual interest.

To the \n     extent that the Secretary and the Corporation jointly \n     determine that the Deposit Insurance Fund incurred actual \n     losses that are higher because the covered bond program of an \n     insured depository institution was subject to resolution \n     under this Act rather than as part of the receivership of the \n     institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1811 et seq.), the Corporation may exercise the powers \n     available under section 7(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)) to recover an amount equal to those \n     losses after consulting with the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 5.
