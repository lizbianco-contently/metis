Madam President, as we learned today from articles around \nthe country--I will refer briefly to one in USA Today:\n\n       As gas prices hover near $4 a gallon, nearly seven in 10 \n     Americans say the high cost of fuel is causing financial \n     hardship for their families, a new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll \n     finds.\n       More than half say they have made major changes to \n     compensate for the higher prices, ranging from shorter trips \n     to cutting back on vacation travel.\n       For 21 percent, the impact is so dramatic they say their \n     standard of living is jeopardized.\n\n  It goes on to indicate that the situation involving gas prices is \nvery focused and, in the lives of some, drastic.\n  The other issue the American people face--and they should--is we have \nto do something about raising the debt ceiling. We can only do that--\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents agree--by doing something about \nbringing down the deficit, and it has to be something that is \nmeaningful. A place to start in that regard would be to focus on these \ngas prices, how concerned people are and, in addition to that, the \ndeficit.\n  We have a bill we will vote on this evening that says these subsidies \ngiven to oil companies, the five big oil companies, which in the last \nquarter made $36 billion; that is net profit--we are saying those \nsubsidies are no longer necessary.\n  We have had over the years a number of executives from these \ncompanies say they are not necessary. They are now trying to justify \nthese: Well, if we don't do this, it is going to cause gas prices to go \nup.\n  We had a report by the Congressional Reference Service, an \nindependent body, which said in three different places in that report \nthat it will not affect gas prices at all. They said it in different \nways, but they said it.\n  No. 1, of course, we have to do something about the exorbitant gas \nprices, and the best way to start with that is to do something about \nthe five big oil companies getting subsidies they do not need. The \nother thing we have to be concerned about is the huge deficits we have \nhad. We can accomplish both of those to some degree today by doing \nsomething this evening when we vote on taking away those huge subsidies \nthat the oil companies no longer need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3004-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week, as gas prices continued to \nclimb, squeezing family budgets and putting more pressure on already \nstruggling businesses, Democrats here in Congress sprang into action. \nInstead of actually doing something about high gas prices, our \nDemocratic friends staged what one of my Republican colleagues \naccurately described as a dog and pony show. They rounded up what they \nbelieved were a few unsympathetic villains whom they could blame for \nhigh gas prices, hoping nobody would notice they do not have a plan of \ntheir own to deal with those high gas prices.\n  That has been the Democratic strategy from the beginning: Blame this \ncrisis on somebody else, and see if they can't raise taxes while they \nare at it. They have been so shameless about it, in fact, that they \nhave not even pretended they are doing anything to lower gas prices, \nreadily admitting the bill we will vote on today will not lower gas \nprices by a penny. As the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee \nput it last week: ``That's not the issue.''\n  Well, I would submit that for most Americans, high gas prices are in \nfact, the issue. This week, Democrats will show once again how little \nthey care about it when we take up an energy plan that several more of \nthem have admitted will do absolutely nothing to lower the price of gas \nat the pump. One Democratic Senator, a member of their own leadership \nteam, called the bill a ``gimmick.'' Another Democratic Senator called \nit ``laughable.''\n  I would also argue that with Americans looking for real relief, \nsymbolic votes such as this that aim to do nothing but pit people \nagainst each other will only frustrate the public even more. Americans \nare not interested in scapegoats. They just want to pay less to fill up \ntheir cars.\n  That is why this Democratic bill to tax American energy is an affront \nto the American people, and so is the President's announcement over the \nweekend that he now plans to let these same energy producers lease \nlands throughout the United States that his administration had \npreviously blocked off.\n  The administration knows perfectly well that leasing--the act of \nleasing--is just the start of the development process, which is why its \nonly hope is that the American people do not pay close attention to the \ndetails of the plan.\n  Permits, Madam President--permits--are what matter, and by refusing \nto issue permits in any meaningful way, the administration is showing \nits true colors in this debate. If the administration were serious \nabout increasing domestic energy production, it would increase leases \nand, most importantly, it would increase permits.\n  In the end, the only thing Democrats will actually achieve this week \nis to make Republican arguments for comprehensive energy legislation \nseem even stronger than they already are. By pretending to want an \nincrease in domestic energy production, the President is not only \nacknowledging that the United States has vast energy resources of its \nown waiting to be tapped, he is also acknowledging that tapping these \nresources would at some point help drive down the price of gas at the \npump.\n  That is what Republicans have been saying all along. Now the \nPresident is acknowledging that: Supply matters. And American supply \nmatters even more.\n  So the only thing that seems to be standing between Republicans and \nDemocrats at this point is the Democrats do not seem to have the \npolitical will to follow through on their conclusions. And in this, \ntoday's Democrats are no different from their predecessors. Literally \nfor decades, Democrats from Jimmy Carter to President Obama have sought \nto deflect attention from their own complicity in our Nation's \noverdependence on foreign oil. Every time gas prices go up, they pay \nlip service to the need for domestic exploration while quietly \nsupporting efforts to suppress it.\n  But President Obama's energy policy puts the current administration \nin a whole new category. Over the past 2 years, the President has \nmounted nothing short of a war on American energy, canceling dozens of \nleases, imposing a moratorium off the gulf coast, arbitrarily extending \npublic comment periods, and increasing permit fees. On the crucial \nissue of permits, the administration has held them up in Alaska, the \nRocky Mountain West, and particularly offshore. Every one of those \ndecisions has had a major impact on future production--and on future \njobs, since every permit the administration denies is another job \ncreation opportunity denied.\n  So the truth of the matter is, the Obama administration has done just \nabout everything it can to keep our domestic energy sector down and to \nstifle the jobs that come along with it.\n  Until now, the President has stuck to attacking Republicans for being \nstuck in the present without preparing for the future. But this has \nalways been a disingenuous argument. It ignores history, since we have \nrepeatedly supported alternative fuels and renewable energy, as well as \ncomprehensive energy legislation that commits us to the development of \ncleaner technologies. It ignores science, since even if a million \nelectric vehicles are sold here by 2015, they would still only account \nfor less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. \nHowever much we desire it, the transition from oil will take decades, \nand serious energy policy must account for that.\n  With this latest gambit, the President may have acknowledged the \nwisdom of our approach. But his plan to allow a few lease sales without \ncorresponding permits falls short. Energy producers might end up with a \nlot of expensive land, but the rest of us would have nothing to show \nfor it. A better\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\napproach to this crisis is the Republican alternative that we will get \na vote on tomorrow.\n  Our bill would return American offshore production to where it was \nbefore this administration locked it up, require Federal bureaucrats to \nprocess permits--to make a decision one way or the other: process the \npermit, make a decision one way or the other--rather than sitting on \nthe permits. And it would improve offshore safety. Our plan not only \nacknowledges the importance of increasing domestic production, it does \nsomething about it, while ensuring environmental safety.\n  If President Obama and his party are serious about lowering gas \nprices, making us less dependent on foreign oil, and creating the \nthousands of jobs that American exploration is proven to produce, they \nwould embrace our plan and stop pretending to care about a crisis they \nhave done so much to create and, their latest public relations efforts \nnotwithstanding, continue to ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3005-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 2011\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this week we commemorate National \nPolice Week 2011, and honor the service and sacrifice of the many men \nand women in Federal, State, and local law enforcement across America.\n  Washington welcomes thousands of police officers who come to \ncelebrate National Police Week. They will honor their fallen fellow \nofficers and rededicate themselves to their mission of serving and \nprotecting their neighbors and their communities.\n  Among the visitors are hundreds of officers from my home State of \nKentucky. I wish to personally welcome them to the Nation's Capital and \nexpress my gratitude to them for bravely laying their lives on the line \nto protect towns small and large all across the Commonwealth.\n  Approximately 900,000 peace officers are serving today across our \ncountry. Every year, between 140 and 160 of them are tragically killed \nin the line of duty, and 2011 is already proving to be a difficult year \nas 69 law enforcement officers nationwide have been lost in the line of \nduty so far, compared with 59 at this point a year ago. To recognize \nthose peace officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty, and \ntheir loved ones, I was pleased to cosponsor a resolution designating \nMay 14, 2011, as National Police Survivors Day. This resolution, which \npassed the Senate unanimously, calls on the Nation to honor the \nfamilies of fallen law enforcement officers and to pay respect to the \ncourageous men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice while \nserving to keep our communities safe.\n  In my State, in the town of Richmond, the Kentucky Law Enforcement \nMemorial Monument stands as a permanent reminder of the high cost of \nprotecting the peace. At a solemn ceremony last week, 24 names were \nadded to its rolls, bringing the total to 485.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in saying the Senate has the \ndeepest admiration and respect for police officers in every community \nacross America. We recognize theirs is both an honorable job and a \ndangerous one. They bravely risk their lives for ours. America \nappreciates everything they do, and America is grateful to them and to \ntheir families.\n  I have here a list of 24 names that were added to the Kentucky Law \nEnforcement Memorial Monument this year. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe names of those heroes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  2011 Historical Additions to the Kentucky Law Enforcement Memorial \n                                Monument\n\n     Officer Bryan J.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled between the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, or their designees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Susan Carney to serve as an appeals court \njudge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, one of our most \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nappeals court panels among the Federal circuits. I hope the Senate will \nmove swiftly to confirm her to fill one of the open seats on this \ncritically important court.\n  Ms. Carney has truly impressive credentials for appointment to the \nFederal bench. She graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1973 and \nmagna cum laude from the Harvard Law School in 1977. She then went on \nto clerk for Judge Levin Campbell on the Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit.\n  She currently serves as deputy general counsel for Yale University, \none of the country's great institutions of higher learning, and \npreviously served as an associate general counsel for Yale. In her \ncapacity at Yale, she advises the university on a wide range of legal \nissues, some of them complex and challenging, relating to intellectual \nproperty, international transactions, and commercial matters.\n  Ms. Carney's time at Yale has exposed her to a broad array, a diverse \nswath of Federal law, giving her a breadth of experience that truly \nqualifies her to serve on the Second Circuit, which handles Federal \nappeals on legal issues arising within New York, Vermont, and \nConnecticut. In various matters, Ms. Carney has advised Yale in \nreaching very successful results, and that experience will serve her \nwell on the bench. Her experience as an advocate has given her a \nperspective that will give her the kinds of qualities--a respect for \nother advocates who come before the court, a respect for the legal \nprinciples at stake, for the factual findings of courts below--and of \nall the considerations that are so critically important to ability and \nintegrity on the Federal court of appeals.\n  She spent 17 years working as a private practice attorney in \nWashington, DC, and Boston, and there, too, she represented a wide \narray of clients on major issues, including, for example, the Major \nLeague Baseball Players Association and a Tennessee union that stopped \nwork due to its employees' exposure to uranium. In the Tennessee court, \nthe NLRB determined that striking employees could not be replaced, and \nthe DC Circuit issued a similarly posited verdict.\n  As impressive as her commercial and private litigation is is her \ncommitment to pro bono public service work. She engaged in such work \nthroughout her time as a lawyer, offering free legal counsel to pro \nbono clients and even volunteering as a tutor. Her commitment to the \ncommunity as well as appropriate legal representation for all clients \ndemonstrates a real respect for the legal system and the fairness, the \nfundamental fairness of the legal system that I believe should be and \nis broadly shared by members of the Federal bench.\n  Her nomination comes at a particularly pressing and challenging time \nfor the Second Circuit. The vacancy she is slated to fill has been \ndesignated as a ``judicial emergency.'' The vacancy has existed since \nOctober 10, 2009. There are two open seats from Connecticut on this \ncourt, which is currently more than 15 percent understaffed. So the \narrival of Susan Carney to the Second Circuit will have immediate \nimpacts. It will help immediately to address the understaffing problem \nand the work burden that has accumulated as a result of it. It will \nensure that this caseload can be addressed quickly and efficiently.\n  We hear in this body the famous saying that ``justice delayed is \njustice denied.'' Truly, it is often justice denied if it is delayed. \nIn practical circumstances, people have a right to their day in court, \nwhich includes a day in the court of appeals. In the Federal courts, \nthat appeal is generally one of right, it is not discretionary, and to \ndeprive people of that right is truly a denial of justice.\n  I have been impressed since I came to the Senate by the good faith \nthat has been shown by both sides in working to address this growing \njudicial vacancy issue. Some have thought it an epidemic. In many \ncircuits, it has been characterized as a ``judicial emergency,'' and it \nhas been spurred by respected figures from across the spectrum, from \nChief Justice Roberts to Attorney General Holder. The Senate has been \nmoving very responsively and responsibly to address this issue.\n  I am hopeful that this nomination of Susan Carney and others that \nwill follow, as some have preceded it, will lead to a new era in \naddressing the judicial vacancy problem throughout our Federal courts. \nThe American people expect us to work together, just as they expect the \ncourts to give them justice. So far, I have been encouraged to see \nMembers of both parties working in the Senate to act expeditiously on \nthese nominations, some of them very long delayed. I hope the Senate \nwill continue this trend with the swift confirmation of Susan Carney to \nthe Second Circuit.\n\n\n                            Big Oil Profits\n\n  On the issue of emergencies, I would like to address a second topic.\n  Over the last decade, what we have seen is a pattern of rising \nprofits on the part of oil companies. The emergency for consumers is \none of rising prices now.\n  I believe we have an obligation to ensure fundamental fairness in our \nTax Code by eliminating, in effect, the tax subsidies and loopholes and \ngiveaways that are such an offense to the justice and fairness of our \nsystem.\n  In spite of the big five oil companies earning more than $1 trillion \nin profits, they have enjoyed tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer \nsubsidies, which are unconscionable, they are unacceptable, and they \nmust end.\n  That is the purpose of the legislation we are going to consider later \ntoday. I strongly support it in the interest of consumers, but, more \nimportantly, in the interest of taxpayers and to repair a part of our \ndeficit.\n  While families and businesses in Connecticut are paying more than \n$4.25 a gallon, putting a strain on all of our family budgets, the big \noil companies continue to rake in record profits and continue to enjoy \nsubsidies that put a dent in our fiscal situation. The companies made \nover $30 billion in profits in the first quarter of this year alone, \nrepresenting a 50-percent increase in profits from last year.\n  The long and short of this debate is, big oil doesn't need these \nsubsidies. They don't need the help of American taxpayers to do \nexploration or any of the other activities that are involved in \nproducing the profits they enjoy so abundantly.\n  Ending these subsidies, despite claims to the contrary, will not \nincrease prices at the pump and, instead, will provide for basic \nfairness so Americans no longer have to pay for these giveaways and tax \nbreaks to some of the most profitable companies in the world.\n  People in my home State of Connecticut and across the country remain \nconcerned about reducing our debt and deficit. We cannot do it if we \nhave this plethora of subsidies and giveaways and breaks going to \nspecial interests and corporations, such as Big Oil, which simply don't \nneed it.\n  Ordinary Americans, in Connecticut and elsewhere, are struggling to \nstay in their homes, find jobs, keep their families together and they \nregard these subsidies as offensive to fundamental fairness and they \nare right.\n  I urge this body to act later today in eliminating those loopholes \nand subsidies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes as in morning business. I ask unanimous consent to use that \ntime now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we are going to be voting on a bill this \nafternoon to dramatically increase taxes on America's oil and gas \ncompanies. I only suggest that it is not going to pass. I can recall \nwhen the Senator from Vermont, just a few months ago, had a bill that \nwould have done essentially the same thing--pass tax increases on these \noil and gas companies. I remember coming to the floor at that time and \ngiving my argument against it. It ended up that we voted on it, and we \nhad 61 votes against it, so it worked out that about 30 were for it.\n  Afterward--and I have to say this about Senator Sanders--Senator \nSanders said that was probably one of the healthiest and honest debates \nhe had seen during the years he has been in the Senate. I agreed with \nthat. The idea that we can somehow tax these people and accomplish \nsomething--let me just say that the Congressional Research Service--and \nwhen I talk about\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nCRS, it is nonpartisan and nobody argues with them.\n  We in the United States have the largest recoverable reserves of oil, \ngas, and coal of any country in the world. There is no reason we cannot \nbe completely independent of the Middle East. All we have to do is \nexplore our own resources--oil, gas, and coal.\n  This same Congressional Research Service has looked at the issues and \ntold us that raising taxes on energy companies will do two things--\ndecrease supply and increase our dependence on foreign countries. In \nother words, this vote we are going to have this afternoon, if it were \nsuccessful, would decrease the supply and increase our dependence upon \nthe Middle East.\n  In addition to the CRS, let's go back to the 1970s, under the Carter \nadministration, when we had the windfall profits tax. The same exact \nthing happened. It decreased supply and increased our dependence on \nforeign competition. The interesting point is--and my wife is not the \nonly one complaining about the price of gas, but she is certainly loud \nand clear in that position--nobody is saying that by increasing the \ntaxes, with the vote we are going to have on oil and gas companies this \nafternoon, somehow that will have the effect of lowering prices at the \npump. It will raise them. In fact, I think several Members have come \ndown--Senator Menendez, the sponsor of the legislation, said:\n\n       Nobody has made the claim that this bill is about reducing \n     gas prices.\n\n  If it is not about reducing gas prices, then what is it for? The \nanswer to that is, they say--as the Senator from Connecticut just \nstated, this is going to be something that is going to be reducing the \ndeficit. Our problem is, President Obama and his Democratic support in \nthe House and Senate--in the first 2 years, they had a large majority \nin the House and the Senate--in his 3 years of the budget, they have \nincreased the deficit and budget by over $5 trillion. I can remember \ncoming to the floor of the Senate during the Clinton years, in 1995, \nsaying this is outrageous. This was a $1.5 trillion budget. That was to \nrun the entire United States. This last budget by President Obama was \nan increase of $1.65 trillion--just the deficit. Let's do our math. \nThat is 365 days a year, and it works out to be $4 billion a day.\n  We have a President and his majority giving us a $4 billion-a-day \ndeficit, and this says it is going to cut the deficit by $2 billion. So \nwe can tax all these oil companies to come up with enough money to \nreduce the deficit just by $2 billion. That is worth one-half day's \ndeficit of this administration. I know the majority of people \nunderstand that, and they will not be duped into doing that.\n  By the way, I have to say that fortifying me was this morning's \neditorial in USA Today. They talk about how ludicrous this idea is that \nwe can increase taxes on oil and gas companies. They say it is an \nexample of the sort of political gamesmanship that substitutes for \nserious deficit reduction. It says:\n\n       But the initiative is also government at its arbitrary \n     worst, further complicating the tax code by singling out five \n     companies--ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and \n     BP--for special taxes not paid by smaller energy concerns. . \n     . .\n\n  So we have a little class warfare going along with it. Only \nyesterday, the same USA Today was criticizing me in their editorial \npolicy because I don't want to pass a cap and trade--a tax increase. \nThe same paper that yesterday was critical of a position I have taken \nis now strongly in favor of the position I have taken in avoiding any \nadditional taxes on the energy companies or anybody else.\n  The last thing I will say--because I will stay within my timeframe is \nthat people say if we want to do something about the deficit--and that \nis what they are saying they are doing--this is one-half day's deficit \nif they pass these tax increases, which they will not--they say there \nare only two ways to handle the debt; one is to decrease spending and \nanother is to increase taxes.\n  I suggest there is a third way. That way is to go after all these \nregulations we currently are operating under as a result of this \nadministration. We are talking about cap-and-trade regulations, \ngreenhouse gas regulations, boiler MACT regulations, ozone, which could \ncreate over 600 nonattainment areas, and the cost of that is $90 \nbillion. If we add all the costs of all these different regulations--\ngreenhouse gas, $300 billion to $400 billion; ozone, $60 billion to $90 \nbillion; boiler MACT, $1 billion; and utility MACT, $184 billion--when \nwe add that, it is $1 trillion. If we take the $1 trillion, that is 7 \npercent of the $14 trillion that we would say the GDP would amount to.\n  CRS says that for every 1 percent increase in economic activity or \nincrease in GDP, that translates into revenue of $50 billion. This is 7 \npercent, so that would be $350 billion. If we want to go after the \ndeficit, deficit spending, and the debt, go after the regulations too. \nBut to think we can tax oil and gas companies and somehow come up with \n$2 billion to reduce the deficit, that is just one day's deficit under \nthe Obama administration. This body is not going to pass that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nOklahoma for making an obvious and compelling point, which is that the \nproblem is high gasoline prices. Why is the Democratic solution to \nraise them more? That is all their tax would do.\n  The Republican plan for dealing with high gasoline prices is to find \nmore American energy and use less. The Democratic plan seems to be to \nfind less and tax more. That is not going to solve the problem. We need \nto use less. We agree with that.\n  There are a variety of ways to do that: through conservation and \nelectric cars, which I favor, and finding research for crops--for \nalternative fuels from crops we don't need. More important, we need to \nfind more American energy and natural gas offshore, on Federal lands, \nand in Alaska. That will not completely solve the problem of high \ngasoline prices, but it will help. If less oil from Libya is a factor \nin raising gasoline prices, more oil from the United States would be a \nfactor in lowering gasoline prices. We are, after all, the third \nlargest producer of oil in the world.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for an excellent point. The \nDemocratic proposal is to find less American energy and to tax more.\n\n\n                            nlrb and boeing\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak about the events of the last few \nweeks that have followed the decision by the National Labor Relations \nBoard general counsel to file a complaint against the Boeing Company, \nalleging basically that the fact that they are expanding their \nproduction of airliners at a new plant in South Carolina, which is a \nright-to-work State, is prima facie evidence of an unfair labor \npractice. This would, in effect, establish for the first time since the \nTaft-Hartley Act was passed in 1947, the idea that it is against the \nFederal law for a company that is producing in a union State to move or \nexpand its facilities in a right-to-work State, of which there are 22.\n  We are talking about the first new plant in 40 years to build large \nairplanes. The Boeing Company builds most of its planes in Washington \nState. It is the Nation's largest exporter. It has 170,000 employees \naround the world, and 155,000 of them are employees in the United \nStates. These are good jobs.\n  But at the Senate Health, Education, and Labor Committee hearing on \nThursday, the general counsel of Boeing said the company expects to \nlose their appeal of the general counsel's complaint when it is heard \nbefore an administrative judge on June 14. Then they expect to lose the \nappeal of that decision to the National Labor Relations Board because \nthe company assumes that the general counsel is following the same view \nof the law that the President's appointees on the NLRB are following. \nHowever, then Boeing expects to win the case when it goes to the U.S. \ncourt of appeals or, perhaps, even to the Supreme Court. But it will \ntake 2 to 5 years for all that to happen.\n  I ask, what happens to American jobs in the meantime? Well, first, \nthis complaint against Boeing will slow the number of good, new jobs \ninto my State of Tennessee, which has a 9-percent unemployment rate, \nand it has had that for 2 years. I have watched our State grow over the \nlast 30 years,\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nfrom the time I was Governor. We had a hearing last week that Senator \nHarkin called, chairman of the Health, Education, and Labor Committee, \nabout middle-class incomes. What I said at the hearing was that the \neffect on middle-class income in Tennessee--the State I know the most \nabout--is that 30 years ago we were the third poorest State. Because \nthe auto industry chose to come to our State, partly because it was a \ncentral location in the population market and because it is a right-to-\nwork State with a different sort of labor environment in it than other \nStates--because the auto industry came to Tennessee, middle incomes \nhave gone up.\n  One-third of the manufacturing jobs in our State are now auto jobs. \nNissan is there. General Motors is there. Volkswagen just came there. \nHundreds of suppliers have come to Tennessee. They like the \nenvironment. They like the road system. They like the central location. \nBut they like the right-to-work law.\n  Suddenly any supplier or any manufacturer who wants to create a new \nfacility in 1 of the 22 right-to-work States, including Tennessee, \naccording to the National Labor Relations Board counsel, is going to \nhave to think twice because that company, which could be a small \ncompany, may not want to spend 2 to 5 years before the National Labor \nRelations Board. I think this counsel knew exactly what he was doing. \nHe was trying to freeze job expansion in the United States at a time \nwhen we need job expansion the most.\n  There is an unintended consequence to this. If jobs cannot move into \nTennessee and other right-to-work States because of the Boeing \ncomplaint, they may not move into the States that do not have a right-\nto-work law. Why is that? According to Jim McNerney, the CEO of Boeing:\n\n       An unintended consequence of the Boeing complaint [is that] \n     forward thinking CEOs also would be reluctant to place new \n     plants in unionized States--lest they be forever restricted \n     from placing future plants across the country.\n\n  If you want to put a plant in, say, Michigan, which is a unionized \nState, you might not do that because under the general counsel of the \nNLRB's rule of law, you then could not move to South Carolina or \nTennessee or Arkansas or any other State with a right-to-work law.\n  If you cannot go to a unionized State, and if you cannot go to a \nright-to-work State, then where do you go if you want to make things? \nYou go overseas. This action by the NLRB general counsel is the single \nmost important action I can imagine that would make it more difficult \nto create good, new jobs in Tennessee and would make it more likely \nthat manufacturing jobs would go overseas.\n  The President of the United States asked the chief executive of \nBoeing, Mr. McNerney, to chair the President's Export Council. I \npresume what President Obama would like for Mr. McNerney to do is to \nexport airplanes, not export jobs. But what the NLRB ruling will do is \ncause the export of jobs, not the export of airplanes.\n  Boeing has 170,000 employees. About 90 percent of them are in the \nUnited States. But Boeing sells its airplanes everywhere in the world, \nand Boeing can make its airplanes anywhere in the world. There may be \nother countries that come to Boeing and to other manufacturers in the \nUnited States and say: We want you to make in our country what you sell \nin our country. After this NLRB decision, they may be more tempted to \ndo that.\n  Fortunately, there are other trends suggesting that manufacturing \ncompanies around the world may be more likely in the next few years to \nmake here what they sell in the United States. That is what President \nCarter said to the Governors 30 years ago: Governors, go to Japan. \nPersuade them to make in the United States what they sell in the United \nStates. Off I went to Tokyo. I asked Nissan to come to Tennessee, as \nmost States. They chose us because of our central location and right-\nto-work law, just as other auto jobs have done that. Nissan tells me \nsoon 85 percent of what they sell in the United States will be made in \nthe United States. Thirty years ago they were making almost none of \nwhat they sold in the United States in the United States. They were \nmaking it in Japan. We were worried then Japan was going to take us \nover. That has changed. Now they are making here what they sell here.\n  The Economist article this week says there may be a manufacturing \nrenaissance coming. What is happening in China where they are making \nthings today is a lot like what happened in Japan 30 years ago. As \nChina becomes more prosperous, wages will go up. As Japan became more \nprosperous 30 years ago, wages went up. In the auto industry, where \nwages only constitute maybe 20 percent of the total cost of what a \nsupplier may have to spend to make a part for a Volkswagen assembly \nplant, wages get to be less important.\n  People look at other things. Manufacturing would look at a variety of \nactions by a government before the manufacturer decides where to make \nthe airplane or where to make the car or where to make the appliance \nthat might be sold in a country.\n  They are going to have plenty of incentives naturally to make a lot \nof products in the United States because the country that produces 25 \npercent of all the money in the world, which we do, is going to be \nbuying a lot of stuff unless we do our best to throw a big wet blanket \non making here what we sell here, which is precisely what this \nadministration has been doing.\n  We have a high corporate income tax. Give the President the credit. \nHe said maybe we want to change that. We should because it makes it \nbetter for manufacturers to make products overseas.\n  The health care law takes profits away from companies that they might \nuse to create new jobs here. I have had heads of restaurant companies \ntell me they are not going to invest anymore in the United States \nbecause the health care taxes take away all of their profits. \nRegulations make credit harder to get, and regulations drive up energy \nand gasoline prices. All of this makes it harder to make here what \nmanufacturers sell here.\n  Now we have a regulation from the National Labor Relations Board that \nmay have the effect of law for 2 to 5 years that says it is prima facie \nevidence of an unfair labor practice if a company that is producing in \na union State expands or moves to a right-to-work State. This is an \nassault on every middle-income Tennessean and on millions of middle-\nincome Americans who have manufacturing jobs--certainly, everyone in \nthe 22 right-to-work States. But as the Boeing chief executive said, it \ncould be just as much of a disincentive to a State such as Michigan or \nIllinois or some other State that does not have a right-to-work law \nbecause why would you put a plant in Michigan if later you would not be \nallowed to put it in Tennessee?\n  If General Motors has plants in both right-to-work and non-right-to-\nwork States, we are going to make it more difficult for General Motors \nto expand in America. Where are they going to expand? They can expand \noverseas. They can be making there what they sell there instead of \nmaking it here.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk about \noutsourcing jobs. This is the mother of all outsourcing jobs plan--the \nidea that it is prima facie evidence for a company that expands in a \nright-to-work State, that is an unfair labor practice.\n  For the next 2 to 5 years, we have the unhealthy situation for jobs \nthat any manufacturer who wants to expand will have to think twice \nabout expanding in a right-to-work State and then think at least once \nabout coming in the first place to a State that does not have a right-\nto-work law. The only other option I can see for those jobs is to make \nthem overseas. That will not only slow job growth in the United States \nwhere we desperately need it, but it will be speeding up the sending of \nAmerican jobs overseas.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord two articles--one by George Will this week on the South Carolina \nBoeing plant and the action of the National Labor Relations Board \ncomplaint, and the second, an article from the Economist magazine.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\n                   [From The Economist, May 12, 2011]\n\n          Multinational Manufacturers--Moving Back to America\n\n\n          the dwindling allure of building factories offshore\n\n       ``When clients are considering opening another \n     manufacturing plant in China, I've started to urge them to \n     consider alternative locations,'' says Hal Sirkin of the \n     Boston Consulting Group (BCG). ``Have they thought about \n     Vietnam, say? Or maybe [they could] even try Made in USA?'' \n     When clients are American firms looking to build factories to \n     serve American customers, Mr. Sirkin is increasingly likely \n     to suggest they stay at home, not for patriotic reasons but \n     because the economics of globalisation are changing fast.\n       Labour arbitrage--taking advantage of lower wages abroad, \n     especially in poor countries--has never been the only force \n     pushing multinationals to locate offshore, but it has \n     certainly played a big part. Now, however, as emerging \n     economies boom, wages there are rising. Pay for factory \n     workers in China, for example, soared by 69% between 2005 and \n     2010. So the gains from labour arbitrage are starting to \n     shrink, in some cases to the point of irrelevance, according \n     to a new study by BCG.\n       ``Sometime around 2015, manufacturers will be indifferent \n     between locating in America or China for production for \n     consumption in America,'' says Mr. Sirkin. That calculation \n     assumes that wage growth will continue at around 17% a year \n     in China but remain relatively slow in America, and that \n     productivity growth will continue on current trends in both \n     countries. It also assumes a modest appreciation of the yuan \n     against the dollar.\n       The year 2015 is not far off. Factories take time to build, \n     and can carry on cranking out widgets for years. So firms \n     planning today for production tomorrow are increasingly \n     looking close to home. BCG lists several examples of \n     companies that have already brought plants and jobs back to \n     America. Caterpillar, a maker of vehicles that dig, pull or \n     plough, is shifting some of its excavator production from \n     abroad to Texas. Sauder, an American furniture-maker, is \n     moving production back home from low-wage countries. NCR has \n     returned production of cash machines to Georgia (the American \n     state, not the country that is occasionally invaded by \n     Russia). Wham-O last year restored half of its Frisbee and \n     Hula Hoop production to America from China and Mexico.\n       BCG predicts a ``manufacturing renaissance'' in America. \n     There are reasons to be sceptical. The surge of manufacturing \n     output in the past year or so has largely been about \n     recovering ground lost during the downturn. Moreover, some of \n     the new factories in America have been wooed by subsidies \n     that may soon dry up. But still, the new economics of labour \n     arbitrage will make a difference.\n       Rather than a stampede of plants coming home, ``higher \n     wages in China may cause some firms that were going to scale \n     back in the U.S. to keep their options open by continuing to \n     operate a plant in America,'' says Gary Pisano of Harvard \n     Business School. The announcement on May 10th by General \n     Motors (GM) that it will invest $2 billion to add up to 4,000 \n     jobs at 17 American plants supports Mr. Pisano's point. GM is \n     probably not creating many new jobs but keeping in America \n     jobs that it might otherwise have exported.\n       Even if wages in China explode, some multinationals will \n     find it hard to bring many jobs back to America, argues Mr. \n     Pisano. In some areas, such as consumer electronics, America \n     no longer has the necessary supplier base or infrastructure. \n     Firms did not realise when they shifted operations to low-\n     wage countries that some moves ``would be almost \n     irreversible'', says Mr Pisano.\n       Many multinationals will continue to build most of their \n     new factories in emerging markets, not to export stuff back \n     home but because that is where demand is growing fastest. And \n     companies from other rich countries will probably continue to \n     enjoy the opportunity for labour arbitrage for longer than \n     American ones, says Mr. Sirkin. Their labour costs are higher \n     than America's and will remain so unless the euro falls \n     sharply against the yuan.\n\n\n                       there's no place like home\n\n       The opportunity for labour arbitrage is disappearing \n     fastest in basic manufacturing and in China. Other sectors \n     and countries are less affected. As Pankaj Ghemawat, the \n     author of ``World 3.0'', points out, despite rapidly rising \n     wages in India, its software and back-office offshoring \n     industry is likely to retain its cost advantage for the \n     foreseeable future, not least because of its rapid \n     productivity growth.\n       Nonetheless, a growing number of multinationals, especially \n     from rich countries, are starting to see the benefits of \n     keeping more of their operations close to home. For many \n     products, labour is a small and diminishing fraction of total \n     costs. And long, complex supply chains turn out to be riskier \n     than many firms realised. When oil prices soar, transport \n     grows dearer. When an epidemic such as SARS hits Asia or when \n     an earthquake hits Japan, supply chains are disrupted. \n     ``There has been a definite shortening of supply chains, \n     especially of those that had 30 or 40 processing steps,'' \n     says Mr. Ghemawat.\n       Firms are also trying to reduce their inventory costs. \n     Importing from China to the United States may require a \n     company to hold 100 days of inventory. That burden can be \n     handily reduced if the goods are made nearer home (though \n     that could be in Mexico rather than in America).\n       Companies are thinking in more sophisticated ways about \n     their supply chains. Bosses no longer assume that they should \n     always make things in the country with the lowest wages. \n     Increasingly, it makes sense to make things in a variety of \n     places, including America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             [May 13, 2011]\n\n                        The Dreamliner Nightmare\n\n                            (By George Will)\n\n       North Charleston, S.C.--This summer, the huge Boeing \n     assembly plant here will begin producing 787 Dreamliners--up \n     to three a month, priced at $185 million apiece. It will, \n     unless the National Labor Relations Board, controlled by \n     Democrats and encouraged by Barack Obama's reverberating \n     silence, gets its way.\n       Last month--17 months after Boeing announced plans to build \n     here and with the $2 billion plant nearing completion--the \n     NLRB, collaborating with the International Association of \n     Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), charged that Boeing's \n     decision violated the rights of its unionized workers in \n     Washington state, where some Dreamliners are assembled and \n     still will be even after the plant here is operational. The \n     NLRB has read a 76-year-old statute (the 1935 Wagner Act) \n     perversely, disregarded almost half a century of NLRB and \n     Supreme Court rulings, and patently misrepresented statements \n     by Boeing officials.\n       South Carolina is one of 22--so far--right-to-work states, \n     where workers cannot be compelled to join a union. When in \n     September 2009, Boeing's South Carolina workers--fuselage \n     sections of 787s already are built here--voted to end their \n     representation by IAM, the union did not accuse Boeing of \n     pre-vote misbehavior. Now, however, the NLRB seeks to \n     establish the principle that moving businesses to such states \n     from non-right-to-work states constitutes prima facie \n     evidence of ``unfair labor practices,'' including \n     intimidation and coercion of labor. This principle would be a \n     powerful incentive for new companies to locate only in right-\n     to-work states.\n       The NLRB complaint fictitiously says Boeing has decided to \n     ``remove'' or ``transfer'' work from Washington. Actually, \n     Boeing has so far added more than 2,000 workers in \n     Washington, where planned production--seven 787s a month, \n     full capacity for that facility--will not be reduced. \n     Besides, how can locating a new plant here violate the rights \n     of IAM members whose collective bargaining agreement with \n     Boeing gives the company the right to locate new production \n     facilities where it deems best?\n       The NLRB says that Boeing has come here ``because'' IAM \n     strikes have disrupted production and ``to discourage'' \n     future strikes.\n       Since 1995, IAM has stopped Boeing's production in three of \n     five labor negotiations, including a 58-day walkout in 2008 \n     that cost the company $1.8 billion and a diminished \n     reputation with customers.\n       The NLRB uses meretricious editing of Boeing officials' \n     remarks to falsely suggest that anti-union animus motivated \n     the company to locate some production in a right-to-work \n     state. Anyway, it is settled law that companies can consider \n     past strikes when making business decisions to diminish the \n     risk of future disruptions.\n       The economy is mired in a sluggish recovery. But the \n     destructive--and self-destructive--Obama administration is \n     trying to debilitate the world's largest aerospace \n     corporation and the nation's leading exporter, which has \n     155,000 U.S. employees and whose 738 million shares are held \n     by individual and institutional investors, mutual funds and \n     retirement accounts. Why? Organized labor, primarily and \n     increasingly confined to government workers, cannot convince \n     private-sector workers that it adds more value to their lives \n     than it subtracts with dues and work rules that damage \n     productivity. Hence unions' reliance on government coercion \n     where persuasion has failed.\n       The NLRB's complaint is not a conscientious administration \n     of the law; it is intimidation of business leaders who \n     contemplate locating operations in right-to-work states. \n     Labor loathes Section 14(b) of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, \n     which allows states to pass right-to-work laws that forbid \n     compulsory unionization. But 11 Democratic senators represent \n     10 of the right-to-work states: Mark Pryor (Arkansas), Bill \n     Nelson (Florida), Tom Harkin (Iowa), Mary Landrieu \n     (Louisiana), Ben Nelson (Nebraska), Harry Reid (Nevada), Kay \n     Hagan (North Carolina), Kent Conrad (North Dakota), Tim \n     Johnson (South Dakota), and Jim Webb and Mark Warner \n     (Virginia). Do they support the Obama administration's \n     attempt to cripple their states' economic attractiveness?\n       The NLRB's attack on Boeing illustrates the Obama \n     administration's penchant for lawlessness displayed when, \n     disregarding bankruptcy law, it traduced the rights of \n     Chrysler's secured creditors. Now the NLRB is suing Arizona \n     and South Dakota because they recently, and by large \n     majorities, passed constitutional amendments guaranteeing the \n     right to secret ballots in unionization elections--ballots \n     that complicate coercion by union organizers.\n       Just as uncompetitive companies try to become wards of the \n     government (beneficiaries\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\n     of subsidies, tariffs, import quotas), unions unable to \n     compete for workers' allegiance solicit government compulsion \n     to fill their ranks. The NLRB's reckless attempt to break a \n     great corporation, and by extension all businesses, to \n     government's saddle--never mind the collateral damage to the \n     economy--is emblematic of the Obama administration's \n     willingness to sacrifice the economy on the altar of \n     politics.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2011]\n\n                  Boeing Is Pro-Growth, Not Anti-Union\n\n                           (By Jim McNerney)\n\n       Deep into the recent recession, Boeing decided to invest \n     more than $1 billion in a new factory in South Carolina. \n     Surging global demand for our innovative, new 787 Dreamliner \n     exceeded what we could build on one production line and we \n     needed to open another.\n       This was good news for Boeing and for the economy. The new \n     jetliner assembly plant would be the first one built in the \n     U.S. in 40 years. It would create new American jobs at a time \n     when most employers are hunkered down. It would expand the \n     domestic footprint of the nation's leading exporter and make \n     it more competitive against emerging plane makers from China, \n     Russia and elsewhere. And it would bring hope to a state \n     burdened by double-digit unemployment--with the construction \n     phase alone estimated to create more than 9,000 total jobs.\n       Eighteen months later, a North Charleston swamp has been \n     transformed into a state-of-the-art, green-energy powered, \n     1.2 million square-foot airplane assembly plant. One thousand \n     new workers are hired and being trained to start building \n     planes in July.\n       It is an American industrial success story by every \n     measure. With 9% unemployment nationwide, we need more of \n     them--and soon.\n       Yet the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) believes it \n     was a mistake and that our actions were unlawful. It claims \n     we improperly transferred existing work, and that our \n     decision reflected ``animus'' and constituted ``retaliation'' \n     against union-represented employees in Washington state. Its \n     remedy: Reverse course, Boeing, and build the assembly line \n     where we tell you to build it.\n       The NLRB is wrong and has far overreached its authority. \n     Its action is a fundamental assault on the capitalist \n     principles that have sustained America's competitiveness \n     since it became the world's largest economy nearly 140 years \n     ago. We've made a rational, legal business decision about the \n     allocation of our capital and the placement of new work \n     within the U.S. We're confident the federal courts will \n     reject the claim, but only after a significant and \n     unnecessary expense to taxpayers.\n       More worrisome, though, are the potential implications of \n     such brazen regulatory activism on the U.S. manufacturing \n     base and long-term job creation. The NLRB's overreach could \n     accelerate the overseas flight of good, middle-class American \n     jobs.\n       Contrary to the NLRB's claim, our decision to expand in \n     South Carolina resulted from an objective analysis of the \n     same factors we use in every site selection. We considered \n     locations in several states but narrowed the choice to either \n     North Charleston (where sections of the 787 are built \n     already) or Everett, Wash., which won the initial 787 \n     assembly line in 2003.\n       Our union contracts expressly permit us to locate new work \n     at our discretion. However, we viewed Everett as an \n     attractive option and engaged voluntarily in talks with union \n     officials to see if we could make the business case work. \n     Among the considerations we sought were a long-term ``no-\n     strike clause'' that would ensure production stability for \n     our customers, and a wage and benefit growth trajectory that \n     would help in our cost battle against Airbus and other state-\n     sponsored competitors.\n       Despite months of effort, no agreement was reached. Union \n     leaders couldn't meet expectations on our key issues, and we \n     couldn't accept their demands that we remain neutral in all \n     union-organizing campaigns and essentially guarantee to build \n     every future Boeing airplane in the Puget Sound area. In \n     October 2009, we made the Charleston selection.\n       Important to our case is the basic fact that no existing \n     work is being transferred to South Carolina, and not a single \n     union member in Washington has been adversely affected by \n     this decision. In fact, we've since added more than 2,000 \n     union jobs there, and the hiring continues. The 787 \n     production line in Everett has a planned capacity of seven \n     airplanes per month. The line in Charleston will build three \n     additional airplanes to reach our 10-per-month capacity plan. \n     Production of the new U.S. Air Force aerial refueling tanker \n     will sustain and grow union jobs in Everett, too.\n       Before and after the selection, we spoke openly to \n     employees and investors about our competitive realities and \n     the business considerations of the decision. The NLRB now is \n     selectively quoting and mischaracterizing those comments in \n     an attempt to bolster its case. This is a distressing signal \n     from one arm of the government when others are pushing for \n     greater openness and transparency in corporate decision \n     making.\n       It is no secret that over the years Boeing and union \n     leaders have struggled to find the right way to work \n     together. I don't blame that all on the union, or all on the \n     company. Both sides are working to improve that dynamic, \n     which is also a top concern for customers. Virgin Atlantic \n     founder Richard Branson put it this way following the 2008 \n     machinists' strike that shut down assembly for eight weeks: \n     ``If union leaders and management can't get their act \n     together to avoid strikes, we're not going to come back here \n     again. We're already thinking, `Would we ever risk putting \n     another order with Boeing?' It's that serious.''\n       Despite the ups-and-downs, we hold no animus toward union \n     members, and we have never sought to threaten or punish them \n     for exercising their rights, as the NLRB claims. To the \n     contrary, union members are part of our company's fabric and \n     key to our success. About 40% of our 155,000 U.S. employees \n     are represented by unions--a ratio unchanged since 2003.\n       Nor are we making a mass exodus to right-to-work states \n     that forbid compulsory union membership. We have a sizable \n     presence in 34 states; half are unionized and half are right-\n     to-work. We make decisions on work placement based on \n     business principles--not out of emotion or spite. For \n     example, last year we added new manufacturing facilities in \n     Illinois and Montana. One work force is union-represented, \n     the other is not. Both decisions made business sense.\n       The world the NLRB wants to create with its complaint would \n     effectively prevent all companies from placing new plants in \n     right-to-work states if they have existing plants in \n     unionized states. But as an unintended consequence, forward-\n     thinking CEOs also would be reluctant to place new plants in \n     unionized states--lest they be forever restricted from \n     placing future plants elsewhere across the country.\n       U.S. tax and regulatory policies already make it more \n     attractive for many companies to build new manufacturing \n     capacity overseas. That's something the administration has \n     said it wants to change and is taking steps to address. It \n     appears that message hasn't made it to the front offices of \n     the NLRB.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to offer my full support for \nSusan Carney of my State of Connecticut, who is the President's \nnominee, now approved by the Judiciary Committee, to serve on a very \nimportant circuit court--the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit.\n  Susan Carney's legal education and long career of public service will \nmake her a valuable addition to the Federal bench. I thank President \nObama for his decision to nominate Ms. Carney, and I urge my colleagues \nacross party lines to confirm her nomination when it comes to a vote in \na short while today.\n  Ms. Carney, as a matter of record, was quickly reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 3 on February 17 of \nthis year. This, in fact, was the second time her nomination had been \nreported out of the committee with broad bipartisan support. If \nconfirmed, Susan Carney will fill one of two judicial vacancies on the \nsecond circuit--vacancies which the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts has declared to be emergency vacancies. As I have said, she has \nbeen thoroughly vetted twice by the Judiciary Committee and earned \nbipartisan support both times.\n  I would like to take a moment to provide some background on the \nnominee's credentials. Susan Carney has a very diverse background, both \nin private practice, working for the Peace Corps, and most recently \nserving as the deputy general counsel at Yale University. For the past \n12 years, she has served in that position. As Yale's President Richard \nLevin put it:\n\n       Susan Carney has served the University with insight, \n     intelligence, and superb legal skills.\n\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\n\n  He added that she has never failed to be guided by what he referred \nto as her ``firm ethical compass.''\n  In her capacity as general counsel, Ms. Carney was the second highest \nlegal officer at Yale--which is of course not just a great educational \nand research institution but has an operating budget of more than $2 \nbillion annually, more than 12,000 employees, and more than 11,000 \nstudents. So there was a lot of legal work to do there.\n  Ms. Carney's portfolio included a lot of complicated areas covered by \nFederal law, including scientific research, intellectual property, and \nhealth care. She also managed other legal elements of Yale's \ntransactions with institutions throughout this country and the world.\n  Ms. Carney served as a law clerk to Judge Levin Hicks Campbell on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit before entering private \npractice. She has been admitted to practice in seven courts, including \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She is a \nmember of three different bars: the Massachusetts bar, the District of \nColumbia bar, and the Connecticut bar, and has also served on the board \nof directors of the National Association of College & University \nAttorneys.\n  This is a superbly qualified individual with a broad background in a \nhost of different legal fields which she will bring to the bench. I \nthink most significant of all--and she obviously impressed both parties \non the Judiciary Committee--she is balanced, she is openminded, and she \nwill adjudicate according to what President Levin called ``her firm \nethical and moral compass.'' Therefore I hope there will be a strong \nvote of support to send Susan Carney to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals where she will serve the cause of justice in America very well \nindeed.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address my \ncolleagues and the public on the nomination of Susan Carney, nominated \nto the Second Circuit, and which we will soon vote. Today's vote marks \nthe 24th judicial confirmation this year and the 16th for a seat \ndesignated as a judicial emergency. This also marks the fourth vacancy \nto the Second Circuit that has been filled by an Obama nominee.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, nominations-related work has taken up the vast \nmajority of the Senate's time. In fact, after today, we will have \nconfirmed seven judges in just 9 days. Last week alone, we had a \ncloture vote on the nominee to be Deputy Attorney General, debate and \nvotes on three district court nominees, and two Judiciary Committee \nmarkups. This year, the committee has reported 51 percent of President \nObama's nominees. Yet it seems the more we work with the majority on \nfilling vacancies, the more complaints we hear. Furthermore, as we work \ntogether to confirm consensus nominees, we are met with the majority's \ninsistence that we turn to controversial nominees. So I wish to address \nsome of the complaints we have heard.\n  I think about the American Constitution Society blog and some of my \ncolleagues in the Senate who say we are not moving fast enough on \nPresident Obama's nominees. I wish to point out to them that is \nintellectually dishonest. They may be ignorant about some of the \nstatistics that involve the nominees we have approved so far versus \nwhat has been done in other administrations, but I wish to show that it \nis an outright, flat lie that we are not processing nominees fast \nenough. Given the pace of activity in our committee and on the floor, \nthere is no credibility to the arguments that we are not moving fast \nenough.\n  Last week, it was stated that the Senate is well behind on President \nObama's nominations, so I would like to provide perspective on that \nassertion. For comparable time periods, we have processed and confirmed \na greater percentage of President Obama's nominees. When we complete \nthe vote we are going to have in about 30 minutes, we will have \nconfirmed 33 percent of President Obama's nominees nominated this year. \nThat compares to only 28 percent of President Bush's nominees confirmed \nin a comparable time period.\n  Furthermore, President Obama's nominees are moving much faster \nthrough the committee process. President Obama's circuit court nominees \nhave waited only, on average, 72 days from nomination to hearing. \nPresident Bush's had to wait, on average, 275 days during his first \nterm. For his entire Presidency, that average was almost 247 days. \nPresident Obama's district court nominees are also faring better, \nwaiting, on average, only 70 days for their hearings. President Bush's \ndistrict court nominees had an average wait of closer to 100 days \nduring his first term, and an average of 120 days throughout his entire \nPresidency.\n  These statistics, and our continued action to move on consensus \nnominees, refutes the argument made by those who continue to falsely \nclaim there is a systematic delay and partisan obstruction of judicial \nnominees by Republicans in the Senate. I hope those who continue to \nmake dishonest comments take note of the statistics I just gave.\n  Today, we are going to vote on the nomination of Susan Carney, and \nthis will be for a U.S. circuit judge for the Second Circuit. Ms. \nCarney received her A.B., cum laude, from Harvard University in 1973 \nand her juris doctorate, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School in \n1977. Upon graduation from law school, she clerked for Judge Campbell \non the First Circuit and then entered private practice. After 8 years \nof private practice, Ms. Carney was self-employed for the next 6 years, \nengaged in contract legal work and consulting. In 1994, the nominee \nreturned to legal practice as a counsel to Bredhoff & Kaiser here in \nWashington, DC. In 1996, she moved to the Peace Corps, where she served \nas Associate General Counsel for 2 years. In 1998, she joined the \ngeneral counsel's office at Yale University, where she has been the \ndeputy general counsel for the past 9 years.\n  My concern with Ms. Carney's nomination is her lack of experience. \nShe has no judicial experience and has limited litigation experience. \nShe has never authored any scholarly legal works of note, and much of \nher work product provided to the committee consists of presentations \nabout various legal issues faced by research universities.\n  Her qualifications for the court of appeals and, indeed, the reason \nfor the President's decision to nominate her to the Second Circuit \nremains somewhat of a mystery. According to her questionnaire, Ms. \nCarney appeared in court occasionally over the course of her career, \nand the word ``occasionally'' is her own. She has never tried a case to \nverdict, judgment, or final decision--an absence she explains by saying \nthat she ``spent [her] law career as an appellate lawyer and in-house \ncounsel.'' Her questionnaire suggests she has never argued a case in \nany appellate court.\n  During her most recent legal job, Ms. Carney has focused largely on \ncontractual issues such as scientific research partnerships between \nacademic researchers and for-profit industry, international \npartnerships involving Yale, and intellectual property ownership \nissues. Her questionnaire reveals no litigation experience in the last \n15 years of her career, and it is unclear how her position with Yale \nUniversity might have prepared her for the Federal judicial \nappointment, much less one on the court of appeals.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave her the rating ``substantial majority qualified, \nminority not qualified.'' Even though the reasons behind the ratings \nare not released, I suspect the ``not qualified'' rating stems from her \nlack of litigation experience.\n  This nominee does not have the concrete judicial experience I favor. \nI know others share this view. The Judiciary Committee reported this \nnominee by a vote of 15 to 3, with three Republicans in opposition, not \nincluding this Senator. I take their views seriously and fully \nunderstand why Senators would not support this nomination.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nNevertheless, with little enthusiasm for her nomination, I will give \nher the benefit of the doubt and support the nominee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate finally considers the \nnomination of Susan Carney of Connecticut to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ms. Carney has \ntwice been considered by the Judiciary Committee and has twice been \nreported with strong bipartisan support, first last year and again in \nFebruary. The majority of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \nhave twice joined in supporting this nomination. I expect that she will \nbe confirmed with significant bipartisan support.\n  This is one of several judicial nominations that the minority refused \nto consider, despite being favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year. Hers will be the 16th nomination confirmed this \nyear that could and, in my view, should have been considered last year. \nThat is right: Of the 24 judicial nominations the Senate will have \nconsidered and confirmed this year, including Ms. Carney, almost 70 \npercent were delayed from last year. We have only been able to confirm \neight judicial nominees who had hearings and were reported for the \nfirst time this year. So when some say we are taking ``positive \naction'' on large percentages of nominees, what this shows is how many \nunobjectionable nominees were stalled last year by objections from the \nminority.\n  This is only the third circuit court nomination the Senate has been \nallowed to consider all year. There are several others awaiting final \nSenate action. Caitlin Halligan is an outstanding nominee to the DC \nCircuit. Bernice Donald of Tennessee has the support of her home State \nRepublican Senators, and should be confirmed promptly to the Sixth \nCircuit. Henry Floyd of South Carolina has the support of his home \nState Republican Senators and should not be delayed from serving on the \nFourth Circuit. The circuit nominee stalled the longest is Professor \nGoodwin Liu of California. He is nominated to the Ninth Circuit and is \nstrongly supported by his home State Senators. He is qualified and will \nmake an outstanding judge. He is brilliant and understands the role of \na judge. He has been reported three times by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. The stalling on his nomination should end. The Senate should \nvote and confirm Goodwin Liu.\n  Susan Carney, currently the deputy general counsel of Yale \nUniversity, has a career of distinguished service. After graduating \nwith honors from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Ms. Carney \nclerked for Judge Levin H. Campbell of the Court of Appeals for the \nFirst Circuit. She then spent 17 years in private practice, obtaining \nsignificant appellate litigation experience, before becoming the \nassociate general counsel of the Peace Corps. Ms. Carney has spent the \nlast 13 years in the Office of the General Counsel at Yale University, \nand is now Yale's second highest ranking legal officer.\n  Ms. Carney's nomination has the strong support of both of her home \nState Senators, Senator Lieberman and Senator Blumenthal, along with \nthe Federal Judiciary Committee of the Connecticut Bar Association and \nthe New York City Bar Association's Committee on the Judiciary. Ms. \nCarney's nomination also had the strong support of Mr. Dodd, the \ndistinguished former Senator from Connecticut. Before he retired from \nthe Senate, Senator Dodd introduced Ms. Carney to the Judiciary \nCommittee at her nomination hearing. He said of Ms. Carney:\n\n       Throughout her career, Susan Carney has developed a \n     professional versatility and breadth of legal knowledge well \n     suited to serve on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. And \n     perhaps even more important, I believe she has exhibited the \n     kind of temperament and unflinching respect for the rule of \n     law that are absolutely critical components, in my view, of \n     serving on the Federal courts.\n\n  It is no surprise that Ms. Carney's nomination has received such \nstrong bipartisan support on the Judiciary Committee. The Senate should \nhave been able to debate and vote on her nomination before Senator Dodd \nleft the Senate. I am pleased we are finally going to vote on it today.\n  I am sorry that another outstanding nominee from Connecticut, Judge \nRobert Chatigny, was also prevented by the minority from receiving \nconsideration and a vote by the Senate. After he was favorably reported \nlast year, Senate Republicans refused to agree to a debate and vote on \nhis nomination, and insisted on returning it to the President without \nSenate consideration. He is a fine judge whose record was distorted in \ntheir opposition to him. That was a shame.\n  I thank the majority and Republican leaders for agreeing to schedule \nthe vote on Ms. Carney's nomination today. The Senate's agreement to \ndebate and vote on long-delayed nominations like that of Ms. Carney and \nof Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California last week \nshow that the delays that have slowed our progress on nominations are \nunnecessary. With the breakthrough earlier this month when 11 \nRepublicans joined in ending the filibuster against another long-\nstalled nomination, that of Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island, we \nhave begun to make progress and, in fact, take ``positive action'' or \njudicial nominations held up for months by the minority. With vacancies \nstill totaling almost 90 on Federal courts throughout the country, with \nanother dozen future vacancies on the horizon, we need to do more to \nensure that the Federal judiciary has the resources it needs to fulfill \nits constitutional role.\n  Including Ms. Carney's nomination, there are 15 judicial nominations \non the Senate Executive Calendar, more than half of which have been \nready for final Senate action for weeks and, in some cases, many \nmonths. I thank the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator \nGrassley, for working with me to consider nominations in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have a fair but thorough process, including reviewing \nextensive background material on each nominee, and giving all Senators \non the committee, Democratic and Republican, the opportunity to ask the \nnominees questions at a live hearing and following the hearing in \nwriting. All of these nominees which the committee reported to the \nSenate have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated \nfaithfulness to the Constitution. All have the support of their home \nState Senators, both Republican and Democratic. They should not be \ndelayed for weeks and months needlessly after being so thoroughly and \nfairly considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Our ability to make progress regarding nominations has been hampered \nby the creation of what I consider to be misplaced controversies about \nmany nominees' records. I hope no Senator cites one such invented \ncontroversy as a basis for opposing Ms. Carney's nomination. In the \ntime that the Senate has been prevented from voting on Ms. Carney's \nnomination, some on the far right have made baseless allegations about \nMs. Carney. Their false claim is that Ms. Carney engaged in a coverup \nafter another Yale administrator had erroneously confirmed to a Korean \ninstitution that a prospective hire earned a Ph.D. from Yale. In fact, \nthe opposite is true. It was Ms. Carney who informed the Korean \ninstitution that Yale had erred. I hope no Senator is taken in by this \nsmear campaign against a good nominee.\n  Concerns that Ms. Carney lacks sufficient experience to be an \nappellate judge are also misplaced. She has been a lawyer for 30 years \nand has a wealth of experience, including, as I mentioned, 17 years in \nprivate practice with experience in appellate litigation. I have, \nnonetheless, heard this purported concern raised by the handful of \nRepublican Senators who oppose Ms. Carney's confirmation. I believe \nthat Ms. Carney's wide range of experience as a lawyer in private \npractice and as deputy general counsel of one of the world's leading \neducational and research institutions--one with an annual budget that \nexceeds $2 billion--have prepared her well to serve on the Second \nCircuit. Along with Connecticut and New York, it is Vermont that is \nserved by the circuit court to which Ms. Carney has been nominated.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nAll Senators from States within the Second Circuit support her \nconfirmation. I also note that I did not hear Republican Senators raise \nany concerns about lack of judicial experience when President Bush \nnominated, and the Senate confirmed, 24 nominees to circuit courts with \nno prior judicial experience, and a number with little trial litigation \nexperience.\n  Even as some Republicans have opposed this nominee by saying that she \ndoes not have sufficient litigation experience, Republican Senators \nhave recently tried to twist nominees' litigation experience against \nthem. Their partisan attacks are not consistent. When a nominee has \nextensive experience and is a successful trial lawyer, they complain \nthat the nominee has too much experience and will be biased by it.\n  Republicans opposed Judge McConnell of Rhode Island because he was an \nexcellent trial lawyer. They opposed Judge Chen of California despite \nhis 10 years as a fair and impartial Federal judge magistrate and \ndisregarded his judicial record. The Republican opposition to President \nObama's judicial nominees has been anything but consistent. Now some \nwill turn around and oppose Ms. Carney, a nominee with more than 30 \nyears of legal experience, by saying she has not had sufficient \nexperience as a trial advocate.\n  This reminds me of the story of the mother who sent her son two \nneckties as gifts. When she visited, the son picked her up at the \nairport dutifully wearing one of the ties, only to hear his mother \ncomplain: ``What's the matter? Don't you like the other tie?''\n  Let us turn away from such double standards and return to the \nlongstanding Senate practice of judging nominees on their merits, not \nbased on caricatures. Our ability to finally reach a time agreement and \nhave a vote on the nomination of Susan Carney is a welcome sign of \nprogress. We still have a long way to go to do as well as we did during \nPresident Bush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial \nnominations. We confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the \n17 months I was chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in \noffice. So far, well into President Obama's third year in office, the \nSenate has only been allowed to consider 84 of President Obama's \nFederal circuit and district court nominees, well short of 205. We need \nto work together to ensure that the Federal judiciary has the judges it \nneeds to provide justice to Americans in courts throughout the country.\n  I congratulate Ms. Carney and her family on her confirmation today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nhours of debate equally divided prior to the vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 940.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to follow on the majority \nleader's bringing this legislation to the floor, which I am privileged \nto sponsor with a whole host of my colleagues, and really to speak out \nfor taxpayers and against continuing to provide subsidies to \nmultibillion-dollar big oil companies. We are talking about the big \nfive. We are not talking about any other entity, just the big five.\n  A positive vote on my bill presents a simple choice for everyone in \nthis Chamber: Are you on the side of working class families or are you \non the side of Big Oil? There are lots of ways to cut the deficit. Many \nof our colleagues, particularly in the other body, want to end Medicare \nand cut student loan programs. What I and my cosponsors want to do is \nend wasteful oil tax breaks for a wealthy industry that does not need \nthem.\n  Clearly, we all need to tighten our belts to help address the \ndeficit--all of us--even the oil companies. We all know oil companies \nare among the largest, most profitable companies in the world, but \nsometimes it is hard to understand the true scale of their wealth. So \nthis chart is a simple attempt to give some perspective.\n  The median income in the United States is about $50,000. ExxonMobil, \njust one of these big five, is projected to earn in profits $42.6 \nbillion this year--$42.6 billion. Now, it is impossible to show this \ndisparity on a chart,\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\nbut if this chart were to scale and each bundle of money equaled \n$50,000, then we would need more than 850,000 stacks of bills to equal \nExxonMobil's profits over the next year. So 850,000 stacks of bills on \nthis poster would be about 170,000 feet high or about 32.2 miles \nstraight up, through the ceiling of this Chamber, and beyond the \nstratosphere.\n  Now, the printing and graphics department is very good at the Senate, \nbut 32 miles of posters was probably a bit much. So I decided not to do \nthat. I appreciate the Parliamentarian acknowledging that I shouldn't \nhave done that.\n  My bill would close several loopholes for Big Oil--loopholes that, \ngiven the current budget climate, would let Big Oil get away without \nmaking any sacrifices at the very time we are asking middle-class \nfamilies, the disabled, and the elderly to tighten their belts and help \nreduce the deficit. There simply is no commonsense explanation for \nbalancing the budget on the backs of working families and letting \nmultibillion-dollar oil companies keep billions in taxpayer dollars.\n  At the same time the median income is $50,000 for Americans, here is \nwhat it is if you are a CEO of one of the big oil companies. In the \nlast year alone, the CEO of ExxonMobil got paid $29 million. The \nConocoPhillips CEO last year was paid about $18 million and Chevron \nabout $16 million. Most Americans will never see that in their lifetime \nof work. So to have these executives come last week before the Finance \nCommittee and say, as one of the companies put out, the suggestion \nabout taking away some--not all, some--of their tax subsidies was un-\nAmerican is pretty outrageous.\n  Let me explain the provisions of my proposal. The first provision has \nto do with foreign tax credits. U.S. taxpayers are taxed on their \nincome worldwide, but they are entitled to a dollar-for-dollar tax \ncredit for any income taxes that are paid to a foreign government. They \nget that taken off. It makes sense because we don't want to tax the \nsame activity twice, but U.S. oil and gas companies have pretty smart \nlawyers and clever accountants. They have figured out if they can \nconvince a foreign government, such as Indonesia, to charge them taxes \ninstead of a royalty, which is, in essence, a fee they pay for the \npurpose of drawing that oil out of that country, they can get a big \nbreak on their U.S. taxes. But what this amounts to is that the U.S. \ntaxpayer is subsidizing foreign oil production. This bill would close \nthat loophole and return $6.5 billion to the Treasury.\n  Another one. In 2004 Congress created the domestic manufacturing tax \ndeduction. It was designed to help U.S. manufacturers that export a \nproduct to a foreign market; so cars, iPhones, iPads, all of that. \nWell, few would see the extraction of oil from the ground as \nmanufacturing, but, again, Big Oil's lobbyists earned their money. They \nsaw an opportunity, some made phone calls, and, lo and behold, \naccording to the Tax Code, oil companies are in the manufacturing \nbusiness.\n  This legislation closes that loophole and saves taxpayers almost $13 \nbillion. That would be $13 billion more toward deficit reduction.\n  Now, the American people understand this bill. They understand Big \nOil makes enormous profits. There is nothing wrong with making profits, \nby the way, but they don't need to have our tax dollars in order for \nthem to make those profits. The American people understand Big Oil does \nnot need taxpayer subsidies, and they understand if Big Oil wants to \nlower gasoline prices, they could put a lot less money in stock \nbuybacks and a lot more in lowering prices or producing more oil.\n  But in order to combat this straightforward, commonsense bill that \neven the CATO Institute supports, Big Oil and its supporters have come \nup with some pretty straining rhetoric. The strangest by far, as I \nalluded to before, is suggesting that those who support cutting these \nwasteful subsidies are un-American. It seems to me when a company \nstoops so low as to question the patriotism of those who would suggest \nthat maybe they can do without $21 billion in taxpayer subsidies when \nthey are going to make anywhere between $125 billion in profits--not \nproceeds, profits--to $140-some-odd billion, to question the patriotism \nof those who suggest they don't need further taxpayer subsidies is to \nsuggest they don't have very good arguments on their side.\n  The charge of un-American is outrageous, and I think the 74 percent \nof Americans who support ending oil subsidies know they are more \nAmerican than that point of view.\n  Another argument I keep hearing is that oil companies are entitled to \nthese breaks. This argument seems to suggest that the wealthy and \npowerful deserve what they get, and working class families should know \ntheir place and know better than to ask oil companies to do their fair \nshare as well. Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in America, said:\n\n       There's class warfare all right, but it's my class, the \n     rich class, that's making the war and we're winning.\n\n  This bill says even the most rich and powerful among us must do their \nfair share to help us reduce the deficit. Their high-priced lobbyists \ncannot stop us from doing what is fair and what is right.\n  Some in the industry have also claimed that cutting $2 billion in \nannual oil subsidies to the big five oil companies will somehow make \noil and gasoline more expensive. That argument is absolutely false. \nThis bill would save taxpayers $21 billion over 10 years, roughly a \nlittle over $2 billion per year. Compare $2 billion in taxpayer \nsubsidies to the projected--anywhere between $125 billion and $144 \nbillion in profits the big five oil companies are expected to make this \nyear. So if the big five oil companies could just live with $142 \nbillion in profits in 2011, they could pay their fair share in taxes, \nhelp lower the deficit, and not raise the price of gasoline.\n  Let's put it a different way. The Finance Committee recently went \nthrough the corporate filings of the big five oil companies and found \ntheir costs of extracting oil is about $11 per barrel. When oil is \ntrading at nearly $100 per barrel, it is simply absurd to suggest that \nthe costs oil companies are facing is what is determining the price of \noil or that cutting $2 billion per year in subsidies will somehow force \noil companies to raise prices.\n  In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service just came \nout with a definitive report echoing the sentiments of countless \neconomists and other disinterested observers concluding that my \nlegislation would not increase gas prices at all.\n  So it is time for the big five to do what is right for a change and \npay their fair share. This should not be hard since in 2005, the CEOs \nof some of the big five oil companies testified they agreed with former \nPresident Bush that they do not need subsidies to drill for oil when it \nis selling at $55 per barrel. Well, it is selling at nearly $100 per \nbarrel right now, so it is quite strange that anyone thinks they need \ngovernment handouts to drill when the marketplace is driving them that \nway. We simply cannot expect the average working family to shoulder the \nburden of lowering the deficit alone.\n  I hope some of the favorable comments I have been hearing from my \nRepublican colleagues in recent weeks means they are ready to join in \nthis effort and lower the deficit because all of the savings go \ndirectly to deficit reduction under the legislation, and do so in an \nequitable and effective manner.\n  What is fair is fair, but nothing about continuing these subsidies is \nfair. Those on the other side would end Medicare as we know it in the \nname of deficit reduction while continuing to pump billions of dollars \nin corporate welfare into a $100 billion profit industry. That is the \nheight of hypocrisy. It is not fair to working families. It is not a \nwise use of limited Federal resources. If this body does the right \nthing today, it is not going to continue. There is nothing fair about \nthe suggestion of ending Medicare in favor of Big Oil subsidies.\n  Big oil has to do the right thing by America. They can be part, and \nshould be part, of the solution to our deficit challenge, and that is \nthe opportunity we have today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, and that the following list of \nRepublican speakers be recognized for up to 10 minutes each, not \nnecessarily in this order. But the Senators to be recognized will be\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\nMcCain, Chambliss, Cornyn, Barrasso, Paul, Hatch, Hutchison, and \nVitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have also come to the floor today to speak about the proposal to \nraise taxes on the five largest domestic energy producers. I think it \nis important we remember we are speaking about five energy producers, \nfive oil companies. We are not talking about a tax proposal that is \nbroad and wide and encompassing. We are talking about a proposal to \nraise taxes on the five largest domestic energy producers.\n  I have to admit, I had some hesitation about even engaging in this \nfloor debate at all because I think we recognize that the words and the \nstatements we are delivering here are just that; they are just talk, \nthey are just words. This proposal is designed to fail. But in failing, \nit is designed to score some political points, and it seems as if that \nis where we are today. But as a Senator who represents a State--Alaska; \nan oil and gas producing State, a State that would clearly be hurt by \nthis proposal--I am obliged, obligated to outline why I feel this is so \ndeeply flawed.\n  I want to start by stating the obvious here. This legislation will \nnot reduce energy prices, but, if anything, it will increase our energy \nprices. It will not substantially reduce our deficit or our debt, but, \nif anything, it will add to those burdens by shutting off production \nand forcing the government to forgo production revenues.\n  I think it is important we put this in context because people around \nthe country--as they look at the price at the pump go up day after \nday--are saying: What are you doing in Congress to lower the prices? \nWhat are you doing to deal with the higher price of gasoline in this \ncountry?\n  I think it is important we recognize this legislation we have in \nfront of us does nothing to reduce our energy prices. It is not just me \nwho says that. The chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated \nthat. We have heard several Members on both the Republican side of the \naisle and the Democratic side of the aisle say this is not going to \nreduce our prices. So what exactly is it we are seeking to do, other \nthan send a message?\n  This proposal, I think it is important to recognize, will hurt poor \nand working families across our country. We all know what the price of \ngas is in our respective States. I will remind my colleagues that as \nmuch as Alaska benefits from high prices of oil, as we are a producer, \nit is a fact that it kills us in our local communities in our economies \nbecause we are the State with the highest gas prices across the country \nright now.\n  There was a news story last week back home. In Kotzebue, which is the \nnorthwest region up in the State, they are paying $7.55 in Noorvik, \n$8.25 in Kobuk, and $8.95 in Ambler. I was in Fort Yukon a couple weeks \nago. There they are at a $5, $6, $7 gas figure. But the spring barge, \nwhich will be coming in in about 4, 5 weeks now, will be delivering \nfuel at prices that were set some weeks ago, and people have been \nalerted that on the day the barge delivers the fuel, the price will go \nup at the pump one additional dollar. We are not talking cents here; we \nare talking an additional dollar paid by the people in Fort Yukon.\n  So we know very well what high prices mean to us, and our \nconstituents are asking us to do something about it: What can you do to \nlower those prices, to develop a coherent energy policy that starts to \nwork now, and then yields progress over time? Our constituents are not \nasking us to make this problem worse. Yet that is precisely what these \nproposed tax increases will do.\n  I heard my colleague here say that, no, this is not designed to \nincrease the prices that are out there. Well, it might not be designed \nto do that, but that is what we can expect if, in fact, these tax \nincreases do go into play.\n  It has been a few years since I got my degree in economics, but even \nthough it was more than a few years ago, I do remember some of these \nvery early entry level classes I took. I remember learning that raising \ntaxes on something is going to tend to make it more expensive. And I \nremember learning that when you tax something, you tend to wind up with \nless of it. That is just basic economics.\n  I think there is at least some understanding of these concepts around \nhere because I do not see anyone who is proposing to raise taxes on \nsolar panels or raise taxes on wind turbines to bring down their costs.\n  The reality is, this proposal--and I believe the point is conceded by \nits supporters--this proposal will not cause gasoline prices to drop. \nInstead, it could very well cause them to rise. I understand a memo \nfrom the Congressional Research Service suggests that no significant \nimpact on prices will be seen in the short run. But that is the key \nphrase here: in the short run. Because what we need to be doing is \nlooking longer term than next week or next month.\n  Whenever corporations face increased costs, they have a \nresponsibility to their investors to recover those costs wherever \npossible, and usually what happens is, they pass them on to the \nconsumers. To the extent the costs of this proposal cannot be passed \non, and these companies will simply have less to invest in new \nprojects.\n  That is talking about what does not happen with the price of gas. But \nthis proposal is also not about reducing the debt either. I think it is \nimportant to put that in context. At best, it may be a drop in the \nbucket. According to the CBO, the President's budget for fiscal years \n2012 through 2021 would result in nearly $9.5 trillion in new debt. \nThis proposal, assuming it has no negative economic impact, would raise \n$21 billion, or about 0.2 percent of that debt. We would still need \nsomething like 450 times more revenue to break even, never mind the $14 \ntrillion debt we have already incurred. We all know we hit the debt \nceiling yesterday, so it does cause you to wonder: Is this the best we \ncan do when we are talking about balancing the Federal budget?\n  I understand this proposal is not all it will take, and no one is \nproposing that it do so. But I think it is important we be honest with \nthe American people when we talk about what this would mean in terms of \na reduction in the deficit. If we are being honest with each other, we \nare going to see this proposal for what it is. Essentially a ``yes'' \nvote tonight to raise taxes on oil and gas companies is simply a vote \nto try to take a pound of flesh from these five major companies that, \nyes, in fact, are making money, yes, in fact, are making a profit. A \n``no'' vote on this proposal tonight is a vote to try--try--to keep our \nprices under control, and it is a vote to help preserve America's \ncompetitiveness within the global economy.\n  I also want to take a moment to kind of set the record straight on \nsubsidies. There are no payments from the Federal Government to the \nmajor energy producers as some have implied. Past Congresses have \ndecided that those companies--and most other companies in America, I \nmight add--deserve certain tax reductions. This is a critical \ndistinction because we have not decided the Federal Government should \nactually give more to these companies. What we have decided is, the \nFederal Government should take less from them.\n  If that is the same as a subsidy, then new homeowners are direct \nrecipients of subsidies because we deduct mortgage interest payments, \nand that means almost every company in our country--whether it is a \nHollywood studio or the New York Times, whoever it is--almost every \ncompany then is somehow or other subsidized.\n  If we are talking about leveling the playing field by eliminating all \nthe incentives within our Tax Code, especially in the context of \nbroader reform that makes our Tax Code simpler and more fair, I welcome \nthat discussion, and I think many in this Chamber do. It would be a \nmuch different conversation if we were considering a reduction in the \ncorporate tax rate. But, instead, we are here debating whether to give \ndifferent tax treatment to essentially punish a handful of companies in \njust one sector of our economy, and there is no policy justification \nfor it other than they can afford it, they are making money, they can \nafford it.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues, is this the kind of business climate we \nwant for the United States? I have to wonder, then, if the answer to \nthat is yes, who\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nthe next target will be, if making large profits signals to Congress \nyou should be taxed at a higher rate.\n  In reality, domestic energy producers are already amongst the most \nheavily taxed companies in this country. While the effective tax rates \nfor all corporations averaged 26.5 percent last year, the oil and gas \nindustry's tax rate was at a much higher 41 percent. Instead of being \nsubsidized by the Federal Government, the industry is actually a very \nlarge taxpayer.\n  The Federal Government taxes gasoline at a rate of 18.4 cents a \ngallon. It also receives billions of dollars each year in nontax \nrevenues from the industry. Producers must pay the government for the \nrights of each of their leases. They have to pay the annual ``rents'' \nto hang on to those leases. They pay the royalties on any production \nthat ultimately results from them.\n  So in terms of what is paid out, according to one estimate, the oil \nand gas industry's total payments to the government amounted to $86 \nmillion per day--per day--in 2010.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that the President has established \na goal of cutting oil imports by 3 million barrels a day by 2025. If we \nintend to achieve that goal, which is a good goal, raising taxes on \ndomestic oil production defies logic. To reduce imports, we will need \nto increase our domestic production. That will not happen if we impose \na hostile tax environment for the companies that operate here--\ncompanies that are already challenged to produce the oil and gas \nresources we know we have but we have not been allowed to explore.\n  Before I conclude, I want to mention an article that recently \nappeared in the Financial Times. It noted that in 2011--this year--OPEC \nnations stand to take in more than $1 trillion from exporting oil. Our \nNation--the United States--will provide a pretty good share of that \nmoney, likely tens of billions of dollars. And what do we hear about \nit? Nothing from the people who are proposing these tax increases, \nnothing about the tremendous sums of money we send overseas each year \nfor foreign oil--just the far smaller sums that could be collected from \ndomestic companies through higher taxes. That is missing the forest \nhere, to cut down the one tree that happens to be growing in our line \nof sight.\n  So here we are. Instead of doing everything we can to halt the \nhemorrhage of Americans dollars to foreign countries, the Senate is now \nfocused on an effort to raise taxes on five companies that actually \noperate here. The day after we hit the debt ceiling, we are debating a \nmeasure that would hardly make a dent in our debt. We are on pace to \nspend trillions of dollars outside of our economy in the years ahead, \nand we are on pace to incur trillions in Federal debt, but so long as a \nfew companies pay higher taxes, somehow or other it makes us all feel \nbetter. No wonder the American people have lost so much faith in the \nlegislative process. No wonder so much blame for high energy prices is \nplaced on the Federal Government.\n  The proposal before us today is not an answer for high gas prices or \nthe Federal debt. It is more likely to raise our energy prices, reduce \nour Nation's oil production, and deepen our annual deficits. I had \nhoped we would have a good, substantive, reasoned debate and discussion \nabout how we are going to solve all these problems. But instead we are \nleft to debate a measure that is all but certain to fail.\n  I think the Senate can do better. We will have a debate tomorrow \nabout the Republican alternative--a bill that while it is not perfect \nwill increase production, generate revenues for the government, create \nnew jobs, and improve the safety of our offshore operations. If we are \nlooking for good policy, I think that is where we need to start.\n  We have a long way to go. But I think what we have before us today is \nunfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 hours of debate equally divided on \nthe question of proceeding to S. 490.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is there a specific time limit on each individual \nSenator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has 107 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for such time as I may consume, probably less than \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say that the Senator from Alaska does an \nexcellent job of representing the oil companies. She puts forward the \noil companies' arguments magnificently. She is very good at it. She was \nan economics major, and so was I. She said what she learned in her \ntime, and let me tell you what I learned.\n  I learned that corporate welfare is wrong, that corporate welfare to \ncompanies that are on the Fortune 500 list is particularly wrong.\n  ExxonMobil, No. 2 on the Fortune 500--excuse me if I do not cry for \nExxon. Forgive me if I shed no tears for Chevron--they are No. 3--and \nforgive me, ConocoPhillips. You are No. 4, but you are working on it. I \ntell you whom I shed tears for--my people at home who are having to pay \nridiculous prices and who also have to face a Federal deficit and are \nlooking to us for leadership here. And leadership requires us to say: \nHow long do you have to give corporate welfare to oil companies that \nhave been getting it for 100 years? Count them--100 years. And they are \nso huge. They are multinational. They are multibillion. I will get into \nwhat their people earn, what their CEOs earn in a minute.\n  So I learned that corporate welfare is bad. It distorts the market. \nAnd to compare the tax deductions Big Oil has with the home mortgage \ndeduction gets right under my skin because the people who benefit from \nthe home mortgage deduction are primarily the middle class of this \ncountry. So do not come here and compare home mortgage deductions with \ncorporate welfare for the biggest companies in our country.\n  When are the defenders of Big Oil going to decide how much corporate \nwelfare is enough? When are the defenders of Big Oil going to answer \nthis question: How high does the deficit have to go before you are \nwilling to step up to the plate and end corporate welfare for the \nbiggest corporations that are cleaning our clocks all the way to the \nbank? I would hope the time is now.\n  I am going to try to lay out in a series of charts why I believe \nthat. So let's go with the first one.\n  First of all, we see the first quarter profits: ExxonMobil, $10.7 \nbillion; as a percentage increase from last year, 69 percent. I am \nsupposed to cry for them. I don't think so. BP, with all of their \ntroubles, corporate profit, $7.1 billion--this is just in the first \nquarter--up 17 percent; Shell, up 30 percent; ConocoPhillips, up 44 \npercent; and Chevron, up 74 percent. Yet Big Oil has the defenders on \nthis floor saying: Wah wah. We cannot allow them to pay their fair \nshare.\n  Well, I tell you, we have a deficit problem. If we cannot ask the \nwealthy few in this country to do their share, I do not know where we \nare headed.\n  Let's cry for Big Oil--or let's not. Mr. President, $14.5 million is \nthe average compensation for the big five oil company CEOs. That is 307 \ntimes the average salary of a firefighter, it is 273 times the average \nsalary of a teacher, it is 263 times the average salary of a police \nofficer, and it is 218 times the average salary of a nurse. So we \nactually have people in this Senate coming here not only to defend \nthese corporations but the CEOs who are crying to us that their \ncompanies cannot pay a few dollars more to help us solve our deficit \nproblem.\n  Do you know what? We could lose this vote. They are filibustering it. \nWe need 60. Let the American people see who is on their side.\n  Well, who is on the side of these corporations? The effective tax \nrate for Exxon is 18 percent on their $7.7 billion in income. A family \nof two teachers has an effective tax rate of 19 percent. Can you \nbelieve this? We have people coming to this floor crying for the oil \ncompanies when they pay an effective tax rate less than a family of two \nteachers. ExxonMobil, 18 percent on their billions; a family of a \ntruckdriver and a dental hygienist, 19 percent. So the effective tax \nrate of these humongous, multibillion-dollar, multinational \ncorporations is less than our middle-class families, and people are \ncoming here to cry tears for these oil\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\ncompanies, and the companies were whining in front of that committee. I \nmean, they may be very nice people, but they are out of touch. I agree \nwith that. I think it was Senator Rockefeller who made that statement.\n  What we could do with the $21 billion over the next 10 years. We can \ncontinue these handouts, this corporate welfare to Big Oil, or we could \nfund the entire COPS Program for all of those 10 years and we could \nalso provide afterschool care for 2 million kids. So I am asking \npeople, would you rather have a cop on the beat at home and know our \npolice are out there and they are protecting our families, would you \nrather make sure 2 million kids are kept off the street and have \nquality afterschool programs, or would you rather continue corporate \nwelfare for these five corporations in the Fortune 500--three of the \nAmerican companies are in the Fortune 500.\n  We could also provide 10 years of Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration disaster relief. We are looking across this great Nation \nof ours, and we are seeing flooding, evacuations, sand-bagging--all of \nthe problems--typhoons, hurricanes, and in California we know about \nearthquakes. FEMA is running out of money. Would you rather make sure \nthey are ready for the next disaster or would you rather continue \ncorporate welfare for these five corporations? You have to answer that \nquestion, America, because it does not look as though we are going to \nwin this one.\n  These are issues you have to decide when you vote. That is the beauty \nof this country--people make a decision when they vote. If they agree \nwith the Senator from Alaska that these five big oil companies still \nneed corporate welfare, they know whom to vote for.\n  What could we do with $21 billion over the next 10 years? We could \nfund the Ryan White Program, which handles the AIDS epidemic at the \nlevel the President requested, and get rid of that dreadful disease.\n  You heard the sort of veiled threats from my colleague from Alaska, \nan oil State. I fully respect her; I just disagree with her entirely. \nBut she has the absolute right to say what she said and believe what \nshe said. I think it is parroting what the oil companies say. That is \nfine. That is her option. But the Joint Economic Committee said that \nrepealing the oil subsidies would have no effect on consumer energy \nprices in the immediate future. So all of those threats that they are \ngoing to raise prices--I ask you rhetorically, Mr. President, for all \nof the years they have been getting all these subsidies, have they ever \nlowered their prices? No, they have not. The Congressional Research \nService said that a small increase in taxes would be unlikely to reduce \noil output and hence increase petroleum prices. So the experts are \nsaying that nothing in this bill to make them pay their fair share is \ngoing to adversely impact gasoline prices.\n\n  The former CEO of Shell Oil said that with high oil prices, such \nsubsidies are not necessary. He said that in February--their own \npeople. Their own people. Yet, when they come to the committee, they \nare all whining about it.\n  Then you hear from those from the oil-producing States: Well, we do \nnot have enough rigs in operation. This administration is not drilling.\n  Excuse me. There are such things called the facts. Let's look at them \nin this chart. We see more drilling than ever before. This \nadministration is moving forward. The oil companies have over 50 \nmillion acres of leased land and offshore that they can drill on today, \nand all they want is more, more, more. They want to come to California, \ndrill off our pristine coast, and threaten tens of thousands of jobs we \nhave in our fishing industry, our tourism industry. They do not have to \ndo that. They are sitting on these leases. They are drilling many more.\n  So let's just have the facts be part of the debate. That is what I am \ntrying to do today with these charts, is to lay out the facts.\n  Now, how do we reduce gas prices? I had a press conference actually \nin an independent gas station last month. The independent gas station \nowner was wonderful. He said: I agree with you, Senator.\n  There I was, coming out with this plan. Here is how we can reduce gas \nprices:\n  End Big Oil subsidies and take that money--some of it--reduce the \ndeficit, and take the rest and invest in alternatives so we have \nalternative clean fuels and batteries that can run our vehicles so we \ndo not have to have these automobiles that are gas guzzlers.\n  Crack down on fraud and speculation. A lot of this increase is due to \nthat.\n  Use it or lose it, say to the oil companies. You own all of these \nleases; drill on those leases.\n  Release oil from the SPR. We know the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has \na tremendous amount of oil. This is the time to tap it. The last time \nwe did it, prices went down 30 percent.\n  Invest in clean energy and efficiency.\n  Reduce exports. Can you believe that the producers right here in \nAmerica are exporting their oil--some of their oil? Keep it home. We \nneed it here.\n  So that is a plan we can take. But let me conclude my remarks this \nway. In the land of the free and the home of the brave, we need to have \nsome fairness in our lives. It is crucial.\n  All the talk about competition--we want competition. You do not have \ncompetition. When you are looking at these huge companies--and my \ncolleague from Alaska talked about comparing them to these little bitty \nsolar companies that are just getting started. When companies are just \ngetting started with a new technology, that is one set of \ncircumstances, but when you give these tax subsidies to Big Oil, you \ndistort the price of the commodity. You distort the price of the \ncommodity and you bring it down. Therefore, it is anticompetitive with \nother sources of energy.\n  This is the moment. We are looking to cut the deficit. We are looking \nfor ways to bring billions of dollars home so that we can get out of \nthe red. What could be more perfect than this opportunity in the name \nof fairness, in the name of competition, in the name of deficit \nreduction, frankly, in the name of the consumer? Let's have some \nfairness. Let's not come down to the floor and compare these corporate \ngiveaways to the mortgage deduction our middle class so needs.\n  I thank you very much for this opportunity. I hope we will have the \ncourage to vote to end this corporate welfare.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the time \nnot used be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, American families all around the country, \ncertainly including Louisiana, are suffering as the price at the pump \ngoes up and up. It does so just as we are trying to get ready to enjoy \na little vacation time with our families, use more gasoline maybe \ndriving places. That is always tough. But it is not just a typical \nsummer experience. This is worse than ever. I have the sinking feeling \nthis is more permanent. I am afraid this is not a blip, that this is a \nlong-term trend and it is hitting American families in the pocketbook \nhard. It is hitting Louisianans in the pocketbook hard.\n  At the same time we see historic turmoil in the Middle East. We see \nso many signs that we need to get hold of our energy picture. So energy \nand the need for, among other things, increased domestic energy \nproduction is absolutely crucial.\n  That is why it is so darn disappointing what we are going to do or,\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nperhaps more appropriately, not do on this crucial subject in the \nSenate this week.\n  First of all, it is disappointing because we are going to end up \ndoing nothing. We are going to have some votes--we are going to have \nsome debate--that are more or less messaging votes and nothing comes of \nit. That is disappointing because America needs leadership and action, \nnot just posturing.\n  Secondly, it is disappointing, in my opinion, when we look at the two \nproposals before us. Because I am deeply disappointed in them, I am \ngoing to vote against both proposals--the Menendez bill and the \nMcConnell bill--although for very different reasons.\n  The first vote will be later today on the Menendez bill. I am afraid \nthis bill is just pure political demagoguery--attacking Big Oil because \nI suppose the author and some Members think that is an easy target and \nmeanwhile doing nothing substantive about the real problem, providing \nno relief to Americans who are paying more and more at the pump.\n  The bill purports to do away with taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil. Let \nme give the factual translation of that. The factual translation is to \nincrease taxes on certain energy companies by disallowing them from \nclaiming the same sort of deductions and credits that thousands of \nother American businesses and manufacturers can claim, some of which go \nback and are almost as old as the income tax itself. That is the \nfactual translation.\n  Let me also give the translation of what it would do, according to \nnonpartisan sources, such as the Congressional Research Service. It \nwould decrease gasoline supply and increase price at the pump. What a \ngreat result. American families are suffering as it is going into the \nsummer with historically high prices. Measures are being proposed on \nthe floor that would actually decrease supply and increase price, \nexactly the opposite of what we need.\n  I am completely open to doing away with all sorts of deductions and \nexemptions in the Tax Code, but we should do that overall, across all \nindustries, across all groups in America as part of fundamental tax \nreform. We should not just demagog the issue and target one industry \nand a few companies.\n  The President's own deficit commission suggested that brand of \nfundamental tax reform. I agree with that general approach. \nUnfortunately, so far the President has not led on that issue, perhaps \nbecause it would mean not just impacts on big oil but maybe favorite \ncompanies of his, such as GE, that might have to pay some taxes or \nmaybe gold mining companies in Majority Leader Reid's State of Nevada \nwould also have to sacrifice very attractive special tax benefits.\n  Let's get serious about two serious issues: fundamental tax reform \nand let's look at that and lead on that and let's get serious about \nenergy.\n  I also have to say I am deeply disappointed with the McConnell bill. \nIt does some positive things at the margin in terms of opening access. \nBut meanwhile, the very first section of the bill, the very first \nsubstantive section, which is section 2, actually increases the \nregulatory burden in the permitting process.\n  I can tell you, living in the gulf, we have been trying to slog \nthrough that overly burdensome permitting process to let energy \ncompanies get permits to begin with. That process is already too \nburdensome, too cumbersome, too long. It virtually shut down the gulf, \nproduced less energy, and has thrown a lot of Louisianans and Americans \nout of work. We need to streamline that process. We need to accelerate \nthat process, not add any new burdens and any new hurdles in it.\n  Unfortunately, section 2 of the McConnell bill does exactly that. It \nincreases the burdens and requirements and hurdles of even the new \nObama regulations that have been put in place since the BP disaster. \nSpecifically, since the BP disaster, the Obama administration has \nrequired containment plans to be presented and approved by the Interior \nDepartment before exploration plans and drilling permits are issued.\n  This bill would go further than that and add a new layer and a new \nlevel and a new requirement that even before submission to Interior, \nthese containment plans would have to be third-party reviewed. Again, I \nthink this is a completely unnecessary extra burden, extra hurdle, \nextra layer of requirement. We need to make the permitting process \nsmoother, more streamlined, more accelerated, not move in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Secondly, while the McConnell bill opens a little bit more access, it \nis very modest. It does not touch the eastern gulf. It hardly touches \nthe Atlantic. It does not touch the Pacific coast. It does nothing \nonshore, including in our western shale areas, where there are enormous \noil resources trapped in that western shale which we can access because \nof new and safe technology. I am also disappointed that the bill is so \nmodest in terms of increased access.\n  To summarize, this week is pretty darn frustrating for me. It is \nfrustrating because we are not going to do anything. There is going to \nbe a whole bunch of sound and fury, in the end signifying nothing--all \ntoo common an experience in the Senate.\n  When we look at the two specific proposals, they are darn \nfrustrating--the first pure demagoguery; the second moving in the wrong \ndirection in terms of the permitting process and not being big and bold \nenough in terms of opening access.\n  The United States is the single most energy-rich country in the \nworld, bar none. Only Russia even comes close. No Middle Eastern \ncountry--Saudi Arabia, anyone else--comes close to our overall energy \nrichness, our resources. But we are the only country in the world that \nputs 95 percent of all those resources off-limits under law; says, no, \ncan't touch the eastern gulf, can't touch the Atlantic, can't touch the \nPacific, can't touch Alaska offshore, can't touch ANWR, going to make \nit difficult in western shale.\n  Over and over we make it difficult to impossible to produce good, \nreliable American energy right here at home. Most recently we have done \nthat by virtually shutting down the only productive part of the United \nStates in terms of energy--the western Gulf of Mexico. That is what we \nneed to change. We need to change that in a big way.\n  In closing, let me say, I am a proponent of all of the above. It is \nnot either/or. It is not just oil and gas. But it is also not just new, \nundeveloped, advancing forms of technology and energy. We need all of \nthe above in a big way. Let's come together around that commonsense \nwisdom of the American people who favor all of the above, and let's \nstart doing all of the above aggressively. But that surely has to \ninclude much more domestic production of energy, open access to all \nthese vast resources we have. We can do it. We can do it safely. We \nneed to do it to provide some relief to American families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes from the time reserved on the majority side on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is a very important issue we are \ndebating today, and there are very different views about how we should \nproceed. I rise to object to the Menendez bill that is on the floor. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no, and I wish to give at least five reasons \nwhy.\n  I don't think this bill is the right approach. It will not solve the \nproblem of high prices at the pump. I think, in many ways, it is \nactually a waste of time to be taking a whole day on an issue that is \nnot going to result in lower prices at the gas pump or in more domestic \nsupply, which are two things we need to attempt to do sometime in the \nnext short period.\n  I have a great deal of respect for my colleague from New Jersey--as I \ndo my colleague from California, who spoke in favor of this direction--\nbut I want to give a couple of thoughts about why I will be voting no \nand why I am urging my colleagues to do the same.\n  According to economic analysis, the bill Senator Menendez presents to \nus\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\ntoday to remove tax credits and subsidies from the five major oil \ncompanies will do nothing to lower prices at the pump. So as everyone \ngoes to fill up their cars, their trucks, or their minivans today, even \nif this bill passed--which it will not, because it will not get near \nthe 60 votes needed to move it forward--it will not lower prices at the \npump by 1 penny.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document I am going to refer to, which is information from an \nindependent economic analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Written Testimony of James J. Mulva, Chairman and Chief Executive \n                        Officer, ConocoPhillips\n\n       Good morning Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Hatch and \n     members of the Committee. My name is James J. Mulva. I am \n     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ConocoPhillips. I am \n     particularly pleased to be here today to tell our side of the \n     story in this important debate, which I believe will help \n     shape the future of our industry and our country. Naturally, \n     I am very concerned about the misinformation being circulated \n     about our industry and my company in particular--especially \n     the misinformation surrounding our corporate tax liabilities \n     and attempts to use these false impressions to justify \n     further increases in our company's tax burden. I feel that it \n     is imperative to make you aware of the impacts that the tax \n     proposals will have, not only on our company, but on American \n     jobs, energy consumers and national energy security.\n       While there is much discussion about high energy prices and \n     proposals to increase taxes on oil and natural gas companies \n     like ConocoPhillips, there seems to be far less information \n     about the rest of the story--how much we pay already in \n     taxes. As depicted in this chart, our industry already has \n     one of the highest tax rates among all U.S.-based businesses. \n     Of the top 20 Fortune 500 non-financial companies (ranked by \n     market capitalization), the three U.S.-based oil and gas \n     companies represented here today are the top taxpayers on the \n     list. In fact, ConocoPhillips tops the entire list, with a 46 \n     percent effective tax rate. By comparison, the top 20 \n     companies together pay an average effective rate of 27 \n     percent. While there have been some media reports on our \n     industry's actual tax burden, this fact seems to be \n     consistently and unfortunately overlooked in the debate \n     inside the Beltway.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it might make us feel better to beat up \non Big Oil, it might present a scapegoat in some quarters, but it will \nnot lower prices at the pump, and that is what we need to talk about. \nThe economic recovery we are in--slow and spotty in places, but \nunderway--can be stalled out by prices as high as $4.37 a gallon--a \nprice I saw at a station right here in the Washington, DC area. That is \nfrightening to consumers, to families, to small businesses, and to \nlarge industry that are seeing their cost of business go up because of \nthese prices. We should be working on real solutions, and this is not \none of them.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee report on this bill, \npublished last week, repealing these tax incentives ``would have little \nor no impact on consumer energy prices in the immediate future. The \nimpact in the long term will also be negligible.'' So why are we doing \nit? Why would we want to harm five large oil and gas companies that \nwork internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United \nStates directly--good, hard-working Americans working in and for these \ncompanies? Why are we doing this? That is a good question.\n  No. 2. The industry pays its taxes and then some. I think there is \nsome real misunderstanding that these large oil and gas companies pay \neither little or no taxes. Maybe people have been told, and believe, \nthat they have so many tax subsidies they do not pay taxes. I want to \nput that issue to rest. First of all, three companies, ConocoPhillips, \nChevron and ExxonMobil--I am sorry I don't have this chart blown up. I \nwould like to, and I don't know if the camera can pick up this small 8-\nx-11 sheet here--you will see by the red lines here, these three \ncompanies have paid approximately 49 percent, 43 percent and 42 \npercent. This is their tax rate. I think that is pretty high.\n  They are making billions of dollars, that is true, because prices are \nhigh and there is an increase in demand. That is the American way. That \nis the profit incentive. I know people are angry they are making these \nprofits, but they are paying significant amounts in taxes. In fact, \nthese companies pay more than $86 million to the Federal Government in \nincome tax and production fees every day. That is $86 million today, \n$86 million tomorrow, and the next day and every day. So the thought \nthat they are not paying their taxes, that they are hiding behind some \nextraordinary loopholes in the Tax Code doesn't measure up.\n  People might say: Well, Senator, what are those blue lines on your \nsheet? I will tell you what those blue lines are. This is Walmart. \nWalmart is a big company. They make a lot of money and they are in all \nof our States. Their tax rate is 33 percent.\n  One of the most successful investment companies--Berkshire Hathaway--\nmakes tons of money, has profits for shareholders, has made thousands \nof millionaires--and congratulations to them, people who have invested \nin Berkshire Hathaway. They have made millions of dollars. Warren \nBuffet is one of the most respected investors. I personally have a \ngreat deal of respect for him. But you know what their tax rate is? \nThirty-one percent.\n  What is Intel? Intel is one of the largest companies in the world--27 \npercent. Phillip Morris, a tobacco company, 27 percent; IBM, 27 \npercent; all the way down to telecommunications companies--Verizon and \nCoca Cola, 21 percent; all the way down to GE, one of the largest \ncompanies in the world. You know what they paid last year? Nine \npercent.\n  In fact, people were shocked--myself being one of them--that GE paid \nzero taxes to the Federal Government last year when these five big \ncompanies are paying $86 million a day. GE paid nothing any day--all \nyear--zero. Yet these five oil companies are paying $86 million a day \nand we have to have this discussion?\n  Should some of these subsidies be looked at? Absolutely. When should \nthey be looked at? In the Finance Committee, when we look at all the \nsubsidies in the Tax Code for these other industries--both oil and gas \nand non-oil and gas, resource based and not, both retail, \ntelecommunications and software companies, such as Intel, Microsoft, et \ncetera. I will be the first to stand and say that many of these \nsubsidies--or some of them--need to be eliminated, particularly when \nthe taxpayers are looking to close the deficit and reduce our debt.\n  Most certainly we need revenues. Should this be on the table when \nthat serious, thoughtful, deliberate debate happens? Yes. But today, \nthis is entertainment. And it is not funny and it is not laughable. It \nis very serious.\n  I am going to submit this for the Record. These are all the large \ncompanies--these five large oil companies that everybody enjoys beating \nup on. I understand they are making a lot of money today, but that is \nno reason to go after them, singling them out, particularly because of \nthe 9.2 million Americans who are working in and around and for them, \nand the thousands of independent companies and suppliers that work in \npartnership with them.\n  Let me give my third reason for opposing this bill. This approach \nundermines domestic production. According to the EIA study, published \nin 2008, the oil and gas industry received about 13 percent of the U.S. \nsubsidies. If you listen to the debate on this side of the aisle, you \nwould think that they get all the energy subsidies and that they don't \nneed them because prices are high and they can make a lot of money \ndrilling. The facts are that of all the U.S. energy subsidies, the oil \nand gas companies--the big ones--get only 13 percent, but they provide \nover 60 percent of the energy. So for the 13 percent of subsidies, they \nproduce 60 percent of the energy.\n  Unfortunately, while the United States was at an all-time high of oil \nproduction, the EIA, which is the Energy Information Administration, \nnow estimates U.S. Gulf of Mexico production will decline to 1.14 \nmillion barrels a day by the year 2012. The last time the Gulf of \nMexico produced less than 1.2 million barrels of oil was in 1997--more \nthan 10 years ago.\n  Everybody--including the President and the Secretary of the Interior, \nwho was before our committee today--is touting that oil production is \nat an all-time high. They are correct, but that is only half the truth. \nIf you flip the page, or look to the next chapter, what you will see is \nthat production is declining precipitously for two reasons. We have \nalmost shut down drilling in the gulf. There has been virtually no new \nexploration and production because of bureaucracy and delay. And \nattacks like this don't help. We need to be increasing production, not \ndecreasing it.\n  The truth is we are at an all-time high, but we won't be for long. We \nare going in the wrong direction. That is\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nwhy I want to commend the President for saying he wants to step up \ndomestic production. We couldn't step lively enough for me. So I am \nhoping that is what we can do and move on.\n  I see my colleague on the floor, so I will try to finish in 2 \nminutes.\n  The fourth reason for opposing this bill is that it does hurt \nindependent producers. I am happy to see this main attack is not \ndirected at independents. That would be a terrible thing, because it is \npretty bad for the big companies, but it would be devastating if it \nwere aimed at independents. It does affect independent producers, \nbecause many of the independent producers, several of which I \nrepresent--some are in West Virginia, some are in Texas, some in \nOklahoma, some of them are in Pennsylvania, and some in New York--so I \nam not the only Senator here who represents a lot of independents in \noil and gas, and ``wildcatters'' have a very proud tradition where we \ncome from--have partnerships with the big oil and gas companies. The \nmoney and the resources they have go into supporting those partnerships \nwith those independents. So indirectly this does affect independent \nproducers.\n  Finally, this bill gets our energy and job priorities backwards. One \nof the provisions in the bill, which I wish to speak to, says the \neconomy of the United States suffers huge net losses in jobs and \nproductivity from growing annual trade deficits in energy due mainly to \nthe $250 billion or more we pay for foreign oil. I understand that we \nhave a trade deficit for foreign oil. So why are we doing something to \ndiminish domestic production right here at home? That is what this bill \ndoes.\n\n  These are five reasons I am going to vote against the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. This industry contributes a lot to our \neconomy. If this country would make it a priority to increase domestic \nproduction and to reduce our foreign consumption, we would reduce that \nannual trade deficit and do right by our people.\n  There are many other things I would like to say, but we are \nrestricted on time. I will submit the rest for the Record. I can only \nsay we need to produce more at home, produce it safely, and produce it \nequitably.\n  Finally, when we want to review tax subsidies across the board for \nall big companies I will be at the table. Until then, I am going to sit \nat this seat and vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I want to say \nto my seatmate on the Energy Committee, I am looking forward to working \nclosely with her on a host of these issues. I think she is spot-on with \nrespect to her concern about the independents. This morning we talked \nabout natural gas, where there is enormous potential. I want to assure \nmy friend and colleague I will be working very closely with her.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me start by discussing briefly what \nhappened in 2005. Then-President George W. Bush spoke to the American \nSociety of Newspaper Editors. It was at their convention in 2005. Then, \nas now, energy was a very important issue--obviously, central to our \neconomy. President George W. Bush made some very important remarks, in \nmy view, at that convention. I would like to read briefly what \nPresident Bush said to the convention. On energy, he said:\n\n       One of the initiatives I will push, again, is to get an \n     energy bill out. I will tell you with $55 oil we don't need \n     incentives to oil and gas companies to explore. There are \n     plenty of incentives. What we need is to put a strategy in \n     place that will help this country over time become less \n     dependent. It's really important. It's an important part of \n     our economic security, and it's an important part of our \n     national security.\n\n  George W. Bush was right then, and he is just as accurate today. His \ncomments with respect to the importance of an energy bill to our \neconomic security and national security, in my view, is indisputably \naccurate. Because the President, who of course comes from oil country \nand has been an oil man himself, took this position, I thought it \nimportant to look at that in the context of where we were headed in \nterms of our country's energy policy.\n  We had a hearing back then, in 2005. We had all the major oil \ncompanies with us that day, their executives. In fact, one of them who \nwas before the Finance Committee last week, Mr. Mulva, also was there \nin 2005. I asked each of the executives of the five major oil companies \nwhether they agreed with the statement George W. Bush had given to the \nAmerican Newspaper Convention, and all of the major oil companies \ntestified at this joint hearing that they agreed with President George \nW. Bush. They said they did not need any incentives.\n  There were no qualifiers, there were no caveats, there was no this, \nthere was no that. The five major oil companies, through their CEOs, \nsaid they did not need any incentives to explore for oil. Period, end \nof discussion. I thought it important to get that on the record to \ncompare it to their views now.\n  Last week, in the Senate Finance Committee on which I am honored to \nserve, we got a very different story. In effect, the CEOs did an about-\nface. Frankly, they did it with a pretty straight face. Each of them \ndefended the $2 billion a year in tax breaks they specifically get for \nexploration and drilling. These are industry-specific tax breaks. I \nknow there has been a lot of confusion in this discussion. Is this \neffort somehow about ending something that other people get as well? \nWhy don't we move on to tax reform?\n  I don't take a back seat to anybody on this tax reform issue. I have \nbeen involved in the first and only bipartisan tax reform effort in the \nlast quarter century with our former colleague, Senator Gregg, and now \nSenator Coats. So tax reform is certainly crucial. But now we are \ntalking about industry-specific tax breaks, and the five major oil \ncompanies that said they did not need them in 2005--in fact, basically, \nsaid they didn't even get them--now say somehow if they don't continue \nto get them, we are going to have enormous economic problems.\n  These are not just plain old tax breaks. Tax credits such as \n``expensing of intangible drilling costs'' under section 263 of the Tax \nCode and ``amortization of geological and geophysical costs'' under \nsection 167 of the code are, in fact, not available to every American \nbusiness. We are talking, again, about specific sections of the Tax \nCode. I mentioned two, section 263 and section 167. These oil and gas \nprovisions which President Bush, in 2005, said were not needed--the \nexecutives in 2005 said they were not needed--are not like every other \nbusiness tax provision. How many businesses do we know that have \nexpenses for oil drilling that are not in the oil business?\n  At the Finance Committee last week the CEO of Chevron said the \nintangible drilling tax break was like the research and development tax \ncredit that all other American companies get. That is not accurate.\n  First of all, as I reminded that CEO, oil companies also get the R \ntax credit. When they have legitimate R expenses, they can claim the \ncredit. If intangible drilling costs were just like research costs for \nthe oil and gas industry, they would be getting two tax breaks for the \nsame thing. That would be double dipping at taxpayer expense.\n  In reality, as the major oil companies know, building access roads to \nbring in drilling rigs--which is the kind of thing that is covered by \nthe intangible drilling provision--is nothing like the research and \ndevelopment tax incentive. It is a cost of doing business in their \nmajor business, drilling for oil.\n  What is more, the tax breaks for these kinds of expenses are usually \nspread out over a number of years, but with expensing of drilling costs \nthe oil companies get to write off these costs in the first year. They \nnot only get extra tax breaks that other companies do not get, they \nalso get to claim these breaks sooner than would other types of \nbusinesses. It simply defies old-fashioned common sense to claim that \nthe tax incentives oil companies get for exploration and drilling \ncosts, which they did not need when oil was $55 a barrel, somehow today \nbecome essential when oil is at $100 a barrel. Even if we adjust for \ninflation, today's oil price is $30 to $40 a barrel more than it was in \n2005--not a couple of dollars more but substantially more, no matter \nwhich of the inflation indices you use.\n  Just so there was no confusion about what was said in 2005, I thought \nit was important to actually look at that video and, as I indicated, \neach of the CEOs of the major oil companies reversed their position \nfrom 2005 and said those billions of dollars in tax breaks\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nwere essential if they were to continue to drill for oil.\n  In 2005 the price of gasoline at the pump had soared to what was then \na record high. Today the price of gasoline is just below the all-time \nhigh price set in 2008. Then, as now, the oil companies were reporting \nrecord-high profits. So both in 2005 and today the oil companies have \nhigh prices and certainly record profits to incentivise them to drill \nfor oil.\n  Then the question is, What has changed from 2005 until now to \ncontinue justifying providing these major companies with taxpayer \nsubsidies? I want to spend a couple of minutes unpacking a couple of \nthe arguments we heard at the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n  Last week we heard from the CEOs that oil was getting harder and \nharder to find, and they faced increased global competition. If \nanything, U.S. oil supplies and prices are less tied to the global \nmarket now, and new oil supplies are easier to find than they were in \n2005. After declining steadily since the mid-1980s, U.S. oil and \nnatural gas production has begun to climb since 2008 due to new onshore \ndiscoveries in shale formations and development in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, we have great interest \nin this subject of natural gas and discussed it this morning in the \nSenate Energy Committee. The location and technology for getting oil \nand gas, especially from these onshore shale formations, have not only \ndramatically increased U.S. oil and gas reserves, but the technology is \nnow sufficiently well established that U.S. oil and gas production is \nrising, and rising rapidly as a result.\n  According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, oil production from the Barnett Shale formation in \nTexas--literally in the backyards of the headquarters of some of the \ncompanies we heard from last week in the committee--oil production from \nthat Barnett Shale formation in Texas has tripled since 2005. In North \nDakota, oil production from shale has gone from next to zero in 2005 to \n240,000 barrels a day and is expected to continue to grow. In 2010, \nproduction in the Woodford Shale in Oklahoma increased 40 percent \nbetween 2009 and 2010.\n  In one area after another, there was significant increase in \nproduction. In fact, total oil production has increased over 10 percent \nsince hitting its low point in 2008, and the Energy Information \nAdministration predicts that because of the increased production in oil \nshale and other sources in the Gulf of Mexico, it is going to continue \nto grow. U.S. prices are also less tied to global markets and \ncompetition now than they were in 2005 because of the increased U.S. \nproduction and increased Canadian tar sands production that is pouring \ninto the U.S. market. This ought to be of no surprise to the five major \noil companies that testified last week because each of them has also \nmade significant investments in the Canadian tar sands project.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2009, Exxon announced it had \nacquired more reserves than it had produced for the 15th straight year, \nand half of those new reserves, 1.1 billion barrels of crude, were from \na single Canadian tar sands project it was developing--a topic for \nanother day.\n  I see my friend from Oklahoma on the Senate floor. Canadian tar sands \ndevelopers are so concerned about the oversupply of tar sands oil to \nthe North American market that they are pushing to build a new \npipeline, the Keystone Pipeline, to the Gulf of Mexico that would allow \nthem to export crude and refined products to the other markets.\n  The argument that it is just too hard to find new sources of oil \nsimply does not hold water. Further evidence of just how much the U.S. \nand North American markets are being disconnected from global \ncompetition by these developments is the fact that the benchmark U.S. \noil price, West Texas Intermediate, has been selling for $10 and $20 a \nbarrel less than the benchmark for European oil. If supply was as tight \nin the United States as some of the majors told us last week, there \nwould not be such a discrepancy in prices.\n  Last point. The Senate will certainly be hearing arguments that the \nloss of these tax breaks is going to drive up the price at the pump. \nThis is, obviously, very much on the mind of every Senator when our \npeople are struggling to pay the already steep cost of filling their \ntanks.\n  At the 2005 hearing I also asked the CEOs about ending these tax \nbreaks on their companies, and several of them said it would not affect \nthem, or it would only affect them minimally.\n  The CEO of Exxon said: ``As for my company, it doesn't make any \ndifference.''\n  The Chevron CEO said ending these tax breaks would have ``minimal \nimpact on our company.'' The CEO of BP said the same thing: ``It's a \nminimal impact on us.''\n\n  Again, common sense would tell us major oil companies earning \ncombined profits of close to $32 billion in a single fiscal quarter \nwould not suffer a big economic impact from the loss of those industry-\nspecific tax breaks I have been talking about. They are certainly not \ngoing to stop doing business with prices at $100 a barrel.\n  In an important moment last Thursday, our colleague, Senator \nCantwell, asked the head of Exxon what the price of oil actually should \nbe with all other things being equal. Mr. Tillerson, the head of Exxon, \nsaid the price of producing the next marginal barrel of oil was \nprobably between $60 and $70 a barrel. That is $30 to $40 a barrel \nprofit at current prices. It is simply not credible to think these \ncompanies would significantly change their investment decisions if they \nlost these tax breaks, and the Congressional Research Service in a \nreport last week concluded exactly the same thing.\n  I began my remarks this afternoon by quoting George W. Bush at the \nNewspaper Publishers Convention in 2005. He said the major companies \ndid not need incentives to drill for oil at that price. I continue to \nask how in the world, given George W. Bush's comments in 2005 and the \nother considerations I have outlined--that, again, prices are way in \nexcess of inflation; again, profits are at record highs--how in the \nworld can you justify getting industry-specific subsidies when George \nW. Bush said no incentives--no incentives--and he said it without a \nqualifier or a caveat--were warranted if you wanted to drill for oil.\n  As we move to this vote, I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the \nwords of George W. Bush then. In my view, they are even more accurate \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe Republican speakers include myself and Senator Blunt and the order \nfor Senators McCain and Chambliss be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am pretty amused at what the Senate is \ndoing. We sit here with a $1.6 trillion deficit and we are running \nbills based on political philosophy rather than what the real problems \nare in front of our Nation.\n  Do my colleagues know why oil is expensive today? It is because the \ndollar is on its back and oil is priced in dollars. If we want the \nprice of oil to go down, as it has this week and the tail end of last \nweek--if we want the value of the dollar to go up, because the world \ntrades oil in dollars--why is the dollar down? The dollar is down \nbecause an incompetent Congress continues to spend money we don't have \non things we don't absolutely need. If we want the dollar to improve in \nvalue, what we have to do is hold the Congress accountable for doing \nwhat they were elected to do, which is live within our means. We can't \ncome together and solve the very real problems.\n  Do my colleagues realize that if, in fact, our deficit wasn't $1.6 \ntrillion but about $600 billion, the price of the dollar would shoot \nway up and the price of oil would go down? We hear all these stories. I \nget all these letters from my constituents who say: Well, we have to \neliminate the commodity speculation. We can do that in this country. We \ncan say you can't speculate on oil unless you can take delivery. That \nwill do nothing to the speculated price of oil because oil is an \ninternational commodity and people are always going to speculate on \nwhat they think the price of a needed commodity is going to be.\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nSo if we controlled all the economics in the world, we could control \nthat speculation, but we can't. What we do know is price controls don't \nwork. They don't work at all. So if, in fact, we want to fix the price \nof oil, what we have to do is fix our economic mess and strengthen the \ndollar, which will lower the price of oil and lower the price of \ngasoline.\n  The debate we are going through is all about politics, creating \nsomebody who is bad. Do my colleagues realize the five big oil \ncompanies make less than 8 percent return on their sales? They make a \nlot of money, but they are giant companies. But compared to most other \nof the S 500, their return on sales is far less, and they are not \nmaking record profits. They made record profits when oil was at $142. \nThat is when they made record profits. It is this terrible habit we \nhave of saying--and let me throw a corollary. If I am an Iowa farmer or \nfrom Indiana or Illinois or Oklahoma and I have a great corn crop and \nthe price of corn is $4 and I decide not to sell my corn, I decide not \nto sell it, and now all of a sudden corn is $6.80, I am going to sell \nit now at $6.80. What are we going to do? Are we going to penalize that \nfarmer for having a resource he took a risk on and selling at a higher \nprice? Are we going to say we are going to double or triple tax you?\n  The other thing I am amazed at--most people know me as a doctor, but \nI spent 10 years as an accountant and business manager. I have a degree \nin accounting. The lack of knowledge of my colleagues on American \nstandard accounting principles is amazing. Every benefit they are \ntalking about taking away will not go away because they are all \nlegitimate business expenses, and they will all be expensed. Why did \nthe Congress back in 1906 give this advantage to our oil companies? Why \ndid they do that? Because drilling for oil is a capital-intensive \nbusiness, and if we want more oil found, what we have to do is be able \nto generate the internal rate of return to put that capital in. So we \noffered accelerated writeoffs for expenses.\n  It is interesting that we are not going after all the oil companies \nor all the gas exploration; we are only going after the big five. Why \nis that? Because my colleagues know that if we did the same thing to \nthe ones that are actually producing most of the gas in this country, \nall the new technology which the R tax credit and the intangible \ndrilling costs allowed to be developed--that makes this country with \n100 years' worth of natural gas--would go away, and the smaller and \nmedium-sized oil companies will never be able to have the capital to \ncontinue to perform and raise our level of energy resources ourselves.\n  So what we are on the floor for is a charade. The price of oil is \nhigh because the dollar is weak. If we want to punish somebody for \nthat, punish the Congress, punish the Federal Reserve, punish the \nexecutive branch, but don't go after somebody who is going to create \n90,000 new jobs in our country this next year.\n  We always look for the right political moment to make somebody look \nbad. The people who look bad are in the Congress because we don't have \nthe guts to stand and say we need a cogent energy policy that says we \nare going to go after our own resources. We are going to use every \nasset we have to utilize cleanly and in a friendly way the tremendous \nreserves we have in this country.\n  We know we have 160 billion barrels of recoverable oil in this \ncountry. They are not proven, but that is what the estimate is. We are \nthe third largest oil producer in the world. We could become the second \nlargest oil producer in the world if we had a cogent government policy \nand an environmental policy. We have oil out the kazoos. We are going \nto find more oil as we explore for more natural gas. Right now, we are \nonly importing 47 percent--47 percent--of our oil needs. It was 65 \npercent less than 10 years ago. Why is that? A part of it is smaller \ndemand because we have been in a recession, but the vast majority of it \nis the very technology they want to deny the fast writeoff for is what \nhas created gas liquids that have filled the void. It is better than \nthe best crude oil in the world. That is coming out of North Dakota, it \nis coming out of West Virginia, it is coming out of Oklahoma and Texas. \nIt is great stuff, easy to refine, cheap gasoline in terms of the cost \nto get it from a product to a product we can use.\n  I am pretty well disgusted with what I am hearing on both sides of \nthe aisle because the real problem is not the price of oil. The real \nproblem is the price of the dollar, and if we will fix that, we will \nfix tons of things that will help our economy. But we are recalcitrant \nto the point we will not do the things we need to do.\n  Our government is twice the size it was 11 years ago--two times the \nsize. No wonder we are running a $1.6 trillion deficit. No wonder we \ndon't have an effective--we have the largest number of regulations to \never come out of any administration in the history of the country in \nthe first 2 years of this administration. It is killing job formation. \nIt is causing people not to invest. It is causing a lack of economic \ngrowth in our country because we have people making decisions who have \nno idea what they are doing or what are the ramifications of those \ndecisions. They are lawyers whose first creed is don't do what is best \nfor the country, do what is safe for the bureaucracy. That is how we \nare running this government today.\n\n  We have 45 percent more regulations issued in the first 2 years of \nthe Obama administration than anybody else has ever done, and we wonder \nwhy we are not getting job creation. We continue to refuse to debate on \nthe Senate floor the very real issues in front of this country, the \nvery real issues such as what part of government can we do without? How \ndo we get a future for our children? The fact is, we have lived the \nlast 30 years off the next 30 years of our kids, and that bill is due. \nIt is not due 1 year from now; it is due now.\n  We are tied up in knots because we have this false indication that a \ndebt limit means something. If a debt limit meant something, we \nwouldn't be raising the debt limit, we would quit borrowing. But, \ninstead, every time we come up to the debt limit, we are asked to raise \nthe debt limit. We will not make the hard choices of what part of \ngovernment is not valuable in light of the fact that we are cutting the \nlegs off from under our children and our grandchildren.\n  In this debate, we are going to hear a lot of finger-pointing about \nwhat is bad with Big Oil, what is bad with oil, what is bad with the \nprice of gas. What is bad is, Congress isn't doing its job. We are not \naddressing real issues and solving the real problems in front of this \ncountry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, sports teams often have a motto. They want \nto describe how they are going to win the event. The Senate Democrats \nhave a motto and it goes something like this, ``I am from the \ngovernment and I am here to help.''\n  Beware when your government comes to help. They have figured out \nthere is a problem and the problem is gas prices are rising and people \nare being hurt by the rising prices. Actually, if we measure inflation \nthe way we did back in the 1970s, we have inflation of 10 percent.\n  Senator Coburn is exactly right. It has to do with the fact that we \nare losing the value of our dollar. Our dollar is going down in value \nbecause we spend money we don't have and we are running up these \nenormous deficits. But it is a problem nonetheless.\n  But those who believe government is always the answer are rushing to \nrescue us. They are rushing to rescue us from high prices at the gas \npump, but they haven't even diagnosed the problem, so they are going to \ncome up with the wrong solution. Their solution is to raise taxes on \noil companies. Do my colleagues know what taxes are? Taxes are simply a \ncost. If you run a business and I raise your costs, you will raise your \nprices. So let's see. Prices are too high, so we are going to raise the \ncost, which will raise the prices further. It makes absolutely no \nsense.\n  It is because their motto is wrong. Their motto is, ``I am here from \nthe government and I am going to help you.'' Their motto is, ``It is \nthe government that is going to solve your problems.'' But they are \ngoing to solve your problems by compounding your problems.\n  The price of gasoline is a problem. If we include the price of \ngasoline and the\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\nprice of food in the CPI, it would be 10 percent or higher. People are \nstruggling to pay for gas. What are the main things people who are just \ngetting by pay for? Their gas, their food, their rent. So how are we \ngoing to make it better? We are going to make it worse before we make \nit better. We are going to raise costs to the oil companies by raising \ntheir taxes, which means we will pay more at the pump.\n  It is economic illiteracy and it is what is wrong up here in \nWashington. We still have too many people who do not understand the \nbasic economic realities. If you raise costs on a business, if you \nraise taxes on a business, you will raise prices at the pump.\n  The interesting thing is, there are some answers. They say: Well, \nlet's go after those greedy oil companies because they are making a \nprofit. Out of every $1 you spend at the pump, about 7 cents is profit \nto the oil companies. Well, do you know what. If you eliminate profit, \nyou will not have oil companies. Everybody works for a profit. We all \nwork harder because we want to maximize our profit.\n  Who owns the oil companies? Is it a bunch of greedy rich people \nrunning their fingers through piles of gold? Are they Midas in some \nroom full of gold? You own the oil companies. I own the oil companies. \nIf you have a 401(k), if you have an IRA, if you have a mutual fund, \nyou own the oil companies. OK. Corporations are owned by people.\n  Do some people make a lot of money in the corporations? Yes, but if \nwe limit that or try to obscure that or try to get rid of profit, you \nwill get rid of companies. Then where will they go? They will go \noverseas. Oil companies are international. If you make it hard for them \nto do business here, they will flee our country. And they already do. \nWe have high corporate taxes in our country, so they keep their profits \noverseas.\n  Lower corporate taxes--do not raise taxes--lower taxes and people \nwill bring their profits home to the United States.\n  This is their profit, as shown on this chart: The oil companies make \nabout 7 cents on the dollar. How much does the Federal Government take? \nThe Federal Government takes 18 cents of every $1.\n  Do you want to have lower gas prices this summer? Do you want to help \nthe people who are struggling? Let's have a gas tax holiday. It is only \na short-term solution, but let's get rid of the 18 cents for the next 4 \nmonths through the summer season. It will cost the Treasury. There will \nbe less money coming into the Treasury: $10 billion to $12 billion over \n4 months. Let's take it from somewhere else. We are spending $30 \nbillion a year in foreign aid. This is money we give away to other \ncountries so they can build schools, they can build bridges, so they \ncan rebuild their infrastructure. We give this away to foreign \ncountries. A lot of times it winds up in the hands of foreign leaders \nwho simply steal it. Mubarak was said to have gotten $60 billion over \n30 years and accumulated at least $5 billion to $10 billion we can \ncount that he stole. Many of these dictators throughout the African \nnations, as well as throughout the rest of the world, have simply \nstolen our foreign aid money and used it for their own personal \naggrandizement.\n  Let's eliminate the gas tax. Let's take the money from foreign aid \nand let's give it back to the American people who have worked hard to \nearn it. You cannot do this forever, but you can do it for 4 months, \nand pay for it by getting rid of foreign aid. That would help people. \nThat would lower the price of gasoline, and that would be a stimulus to \nthe economy.\n  What I am saying is, let's have a gas tax holiday. Let's eliminate \nFederal taxes for the next 4 months on gas, and let's take the money \nthat would be lost, put it into the highway fund, but let's take it \nfrom money we are giving away to other countries. That would be a \nshort-term answer.\n  There is also a long-term answer. Senator Coburn was right that much \nof the price of gasoline rising is from inflation. Basically we are \ndestroying the value of the dollar. But there is another reason gas \nprices rise: because demand for oil and gas is outstripping the supply.\n  Why don't we have more supply? Because the current administration is \nbasically an enemy to production, an enemy to drilling, an enemy to all \nthings related to energy. We now are going back and looking at permits \nto mine coal that have been approved for 10 years. We are taking away \ndrilling permits to drill for oil in Utah, in Alaska, off our coast. If \nwe want gasoline prices to be less, if we want to send less money to \nMiddle Eastern countries that hate us that we have to buy oil from, \nlet's make more here. Let's drill for oil. Let's produce more here. \nLet's drill in Alaska. Let's open up new places to drill.\n  Can we do it responsibly? Yes. Nobody wants to damage the \nenvironment. Do it responsibly, but let's produce energy here. We have, \nas Senator Coburn says, 160 million barrels of oil waiting to be \nextracted. Let's go for it. But we have to have a government that is \nfriendly to energy. We have a government now, an administration that is \nunfriendly to energy and at every aspect of producing energy places \nroadblocks. They think for some reason we can get electricity to supply \nour country from some windmills that are made in China. What we need \nis, we need oil and gas production in our country. We need nuclear \nenergy in our country. We need coal in our country. We have the \nability, we have the resources, but we need to get government out of \nthe way. Instead, what we are doing is placing new obstacles.\n  There will be a long-term solution that Senator McConnell and our \nparty will introduce. I will support that also. It will encourage \ndomestic production of oil and gas, domestic production of energy. That \nis what we need. But you are not going to get it until we have new \nfaces here in Washington because the current crop of faces is opposing \nproduction at every turn.\n  I wish to conclude by saying, if you want to help people, even for a \nshort period of time, there is a short-term solution. Let's get rid of \nthe gas tax for 4 months. Let's pay for it by not sending the money \noverseas to have other countries either steal it or build their own \ninfrastructure. Let's keep those U.S. tax dollars here at home. Better \nyet, let's keep them in the pockets of the consumers by having a gas \ntax holiday.\n  Thank you very much. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nlegislation that is going to be voted on in a few hours. I have \nlistened to the last couple of speakers, and while I certainly respect \nSenator Coburn's commitment to fiscal responsibility--and he and I have \nworked together on a number of projects in that regard and have the \nsame view of many of the spending habits around here--I have to say, I \nam a little confused by the opposition to this legislation by my \nfriends across the aisle.\n  We have two ways to spend money around here: one, through the \nappropriations process; the other is what I call tax goodies. These \ngoodies are called tax expenditures. What these do is they basically \nsay to whatever group has successfully lobbied for them: You are not \ngoing to have to pay all your taxes. So there are two ways we deny the \nTreasury money. One is by spending money. The other is by telling \npeople: You do not have to pay the money the Tax Code says you owe. And \nwe put into the Tax Code special deals.\n  Many of those special deals are done because the case is made that \nthey spur economic development or they spur some kind of activity in \nour country that we think is desirable. A good example is the interest \ndeduction on people's homes. The notion is that we want to encourage \npeople to buy homes, so we allow them to deduct the interest they pay \non those home loans against their income tax.\n  Charitable deductions are another good example. We want people to \ngive to charities, so we say: Do you know what. You do not have to pay \nas much in taxes if you give to charity.\n  The realty sector is full of tax goodies for the development of real \nestate and the creation of jobs that go with the development of real \nestate.\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\n  One of the big tax expenditures we have in our Tax Code is goodies \nfor Big Oil. That is what this is about. Can we get to where we need to \nbe on our structural debt and our annual deficit without touching the \nTax Code? No way. Are we going to have to look at revenues for \nmultimillionaires? I think we are. Are we, obviously, going to have to \nlook at spending? Of course we are. And aren't we going to have to look \nat the tax goodies? Well, I would surely hope so, because, frankly, as \nsome of my colleagues across the aisle have said--and I thought they \nagreed with us--cleaning out some of those goodies could potentially \nlower taxes for everyone.\n  So where do we start with the goodies that are in the Tax Code? Might \nwe not start with the most profitable companies in the history of the \nplanet? Do they need this extra money we give them by telling them they \ndo not have to pay the taxes other companies have to pay? How many \nquarters will we have where we read the headlines: ``Record-Breaking \nProfits for Big Oil''? How many times are we going to read that before \nwe are willing to take the baby step--just the baby step--of saying: \nMaybe these tax goodies for Big Oil are not a good idea in light of our \ndeficit and our debt. Maybe this is a good place to start. They made \nnorth of $35 billion in the last 3 months.\n  I know there are all kinds of things that are being put out there to \nkind of hide behind as we cast this vote because this is a tough vote \nfor people who vote no. How do you explain to your constituents--who \nare struggling around their kitchen table to figure out how they can \nafford to drive their kids to soccer practice--how do you explain to \nthem that we think that instead of $123 billion of profit Big Oil is \ngoing to make this year, they need to make $125 billion? That is what \nthis is. Instead of making $125 billion--north of $125 billion--of \nprofit this year, Big Oil is going to have to suffer along with only \n$123 billion in profit. And that $2 billion we want to take back from \nthem is going to go toward the deficit. How do you explain that to \npeople around their kitchen table?\n  Oh, this means the cost of fuel is going to go up. Everyone has \ndebunked that. Really? The cost of fuel has gone up just fine and they \nhave all those subsidies. I remember when oil was $55 a barrel and they \nhad all these subsidies. By the way, all these subsidies did not help \nthem go out and do what they needed to do to keep the price of fuel \ndown.\n  By the way, today a letter was sent to the FTC by myself and other \nMembers of the Senate saying: What about this refinery process? Talk \nabout economic illiteracy. Anybody who believes the oil companies today \nare making 7 cents of profit on a gallon of gas has no idea what is \ngoing on with refineries right now. A year ago at this time, refineries \nwere operating at a capacity of close to 90 percent. Today, they are \nonly operating at 80 percent. Why would that be? Their profit per \ngallon of gas--just the refineries--has gone from less than 40 cents a \ngallon to 80 cents a gallon in a matter of a few months: 80 cents a \ngallon of refinery profit. Some of these refineries are independently \nowned. But many of them are owned by the big five, the big five big \noil.\n  So why is that capacity down? Is it because they do not have crude to \ngo through the refining process? No. There is plenty of crude. And how \nabout this. We are giving these big oil companies tax goodies, and what \nare they doing today? They are exporting a record amount of oil and \nfuel from the United States--exporting. They are sending it to South \nAmerica and Mexico.\n  So while my constituents are suffering mightily at the gas pump, week \nafter week, these guys are sending the oil they have produced with our \ntax goodies to another country, instead of putting that additional \nsupply into our supply chain, which, in turn, reduces the price.\n  The more supply, the less the price. So, one, they have cut back \nrefining capacity. Two, they are exporting more. And they want to say \nit is about drilling. Really? We have more rigs drilling right now in \nthis country than we have had in many years. We have production higher \nat this point--domestic production--than it was at the end of the Bush \nadministration. We just issued 12 new deepwater permits in the last few \nmonths. There are all kinds of leases out there that are not being \nexplored. Meanwhile, cha-ching, cha-ching--these big oil companies are \ncontinuing to make profits that make your jaw drop.\n  So, honestly, seriously, you talk about economic illiteracy. I will \ntell you what economic illiteracy is. It is thinking these companies--\nwhat about the free market I always hear about from the other side of \nthe aisle? What about that free market? Why do they need our tax \ngoodies to help them if this is truly a free market?\n  Maybe they are right. Maybe we shouldn't pick on Big Oil. But what a \ngreat place to start. Frankly, if we can't take these things away from \nthe most profitable companies in the history of the planet, how are we \never going to take them away from the mohair industry or how are we \never going to do what we need to do with the Tax Code in the real \nestate sector or any of the other goodies we have larded up our Tax \nCode with to make it so complicated and so long that, frankly, the \npeople who get the most advantages out of it are the families who can \nafford to hire accountants and tax lawyers. Meanwhile, the real tax \nrate for most Americans is much higher than the real tax rate for most \nmultinational corporations.\n  So I think economic illiteracy is to spend a lot of time talking \nabout the debt and deficit and not being willing to take this baby step \nto take back $2 billion a year that these companies get that they do \nnot need and they are not using to hold down the price of gas.\n  I mean, when I realized how cynical this whole process has become is \nwhen today I got a question from a reporter that said: Well, the oil \ncompanies say most of these profits are going to these pension \ncompanies. Give me a break. You know, really? Really? These guys want \nto talk about free market and how this is all about the bottom line, \nand then they want to try to hide behind the fact that some of the \npension funds have stock in their companies, that somehow that \njustifies them feeding at the public trough? Talk about greed. Talk \nabout greed.\n  So I think this legislation is a real litmus test because if we can't \ndo this, then I question what we can do to right this ship that is all \nabout the footprint of the Federal Government, how much money we are \nspending and how many tax expenditures are out there. And anybody who \ntells you this is about raising their taxes--no, this is about saying \nto them: You have to pay the taxes the free market says you should pay, \nnot avoid taxes by these extra goodies. This isn't about raising their \ntaxes; this is about saying: You need to pay your taxes the way average \ncitizens do, as it relates to their businesses. You should not get this \nextra help in the Tax Code that allows you to avoid taxes. It is a tax \nexpenditure. It is real money that will come to our bottom line as it \nrelates to our deficit, and it is important to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to talk for a moment about the \nill-considered proposal we will be voting on at 6:15 tonight and about \nthe administration's chaotic approach when it comes to our national \nenergy policy. I say ``chaotic approach'' because to pay attention to \nwhat the President and this administration have said about fossil fuels \nand energy will give you whiplash if you try to keep up with it because \nthere are so many, apparently, inconsistencies between what is said and \nwhat is actually done, and then when something like high gasoline \nprices becomes very much a concern around kitchen tables in America, \nthen all of a sudden the President again, as he announced the last day \nor two, is all of a sudden open for more domestic product.\n  It is a problem for a number of reasons. One is, who in their right \nmind would invest the kind of money that is necessary in order to \ndevelop our domestic energy reserves when the administration and the \nPresident himself seem to be of two minds about whether\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nwe should punish domestic production or whether we should encourage it.\n  I would suggest to you that the message has primarily been one of how \nto discourage or how to punish domestic production of energy in favor \nof imported energy from abroad. For example, one of the mixed messages \nthe President gave was in March of 2010 when he proposed expanding \noffshore drilling along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of \nMexico, near my home in Texas, and the north coast of Alaska. At that \ntime, he said as follows. He said: The answer is not drilling \neverywhere all the time, but the answer is not also for us to ignore \nthe fact that we are going to need vital energy sources to maintain our \neconomic growth and our security.\n  Well, I agree with that statement, but, as you know, following the \nDeepwater Horizon incident last April, the administration overreacted \nin a way that killed jobs and discouraged energy production here at \nhome. We all agree that when something like this terrible incident \noccurs, we need to find out what happened, fix it, and make sure it \nnever happens again. But every time there is a car accident, we don't \nban driving. Every time there is an airplane crash, we don't ban \nflying. We find out what the problem is, we fix it, and then we move \non.\n  That is not what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. First, there was an \noverbroad moratorium that was issued by the administration, which \nultimately ended up being struck down by a Federal judge. But after \nthat, the administration was not through. While their formal moratorium \nno longer existed, there was, in effect, a permitorium--in other words, \nfoot-dragging when it came to issuing permits for drilling in the Gulf \nof Mexico--and only 12 deepwater permits have been approved in the last \n12 months. There were, in addition, the cancellation of dozens of lease \nsales in Utah and Montana and exclusion of new areas in the eastern \nGulf of Mexico and off the Atlantic coast. That, to me, is completely \ninconsistent with the President's statement just in March 2010. And \nthen we know there are numerous examples where the Environmental \nProtection Agency has thrown up roadblocks and impediments to energy \nproduction right here at home.\n  Well, because the President has not had an adequate response, or at \nleast his actions have been inconsistent with his words, he reversed \nhimself again this Saturday, and he said now he supports more domestic \noil and gas production like he did more than a year ago. But my \nconclusion is that this is not an energy strategy. This is a public \nrelations strategy. This is a ``how do I get reelected?'' strategy. It \ndoes not solve the problem or the pain Americans are feeling at the \npump. And unfortunately this strategy too often ends up being a job-\nkilling strategy as well.\n  But when high gas prices are in the news, when people around kitchen \ntables all around America are complaining about the loss of their \ndiscretionary incomes, the fact they are having to cut corners so they \ncan drive their kids to school or so they can drive to work, finally we \nhave a new speech and a new announcement from the administration but \nvery little when it comes to a coherent energy strategy.\n  Another mixed message is that the administration at times has \nsuggested that we are actually overproducing domestic energy. You may \nask, how could that be possible? How could it be possible that we are \nproducing too much oil and gas here at home when we have to import 60 \npercent of what we use from abroad? Well, the Congressional Research \nService that we depend on--it is an arm of the Library of Congress--has \ndocumented that America's recoverable resources are far larger than \nthose of Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada combined. We have more here at \nhome than Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada. And America's recoverable \noil, natural gas, and coal endowment is the largest on Earth. And we \nhave learned in the last couple of years that America has more shale \ngas from previously unrecoverable reserves--thanks to new technology, \nhorizontal drilling and the like--we have enough natural gas to last us \nfor 100 years here in the United States.\n\n  But compare that--really that gift we have been given of domestic \nenergy at home--with what the administration said in 2010. The Treasury \nDepartment issues an interpretation or explanation of the \nadministration's policies when it talks about energy production, and \nthis is what the Treasury Department said in 2009 or 2010. The Treasury \nDepartment--this is Secretary Geithner, who is appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Senate--the Treasury Department said:\n\n       To the extent the [tax] credit--\n\n  That is the tax credits we are talking about here--\n\n     encourages overproduction of oil and gas, it is detrimental \n     to long-term energy security.\n\n  So the Treasury Department, President Obama's Treasury Department, is \nmaking the extraordinary claim that I have not heard any Senator here \nmake because it is so implausible that these tax provisions encourage \noverproduction of oil and gas right here in the United States. If we \nare overproducing oil and gas in the United States, why is the \nadministration telling the existing leaseholders they have to use or \nlose the leases that we have? It is an ideological fixation that says: \nWe have to discourage production of oil and gas even though about 80 \npercent of our energy needs come from fossil fuels because we prefer \nalternative forms of energy. Well, I do too--solar panels, wind, \nbiodiesel. These alternative sources of energy are important, but we \nsimply don't have enough of them to keep our economy moving and keep \nprices low for our domestic consumers.\n  Well, another part of this mixed message is our dependency on \nimported oil. On March 30, 2011, President Obama called for reducing \nforeign imports by one-third. But then he went to Brazil recently. He \ntold the people of Brazil that he encouraged offshore drilling in \nBrazil, and he said that America wanted to be Brazil's best customer. \nIn other words, rather than producing what we have been given by the \nGood Lord right here in America--American production, American jobs--he \nwants to be Brazil's best customer by importing energy from abroad.\n  Well, part of the vote we will be having at 6:15 or so tonight is \nanother part of the mixed messages we have been getting when it comes \nto energy. This is the so-called Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. Now \nwe know why the Senators who introduced this bill have done so--because \nthey have been getting so much heat back home because of high gas \nprices. Their constituents are demanding that they do something. But \nwhat they are proposing to do has nothing to do with bringing down the \nprice of gas at the pump. In fact, it will likely increase the price of \ngas at the pump.\n  In fact, the chairman of the Finance Committee, on which I sit, said: \nYou know, this is not going to change the price at the gasoline pump. \nThat is not the issue. I do not see that as an issue at all.\n  The senior Senator from New York said: This was never intended to \ntalk about lowering prices.\n  The majority leader himself said: It is not a question of gas prices; \nit is a question of fairness and priorities.\n  Well, if gasoline prices being paid by Americans all across this \ncountry are not the priority and if jobs that are created and sustained \nby producing domestic oil and gas right here in America are not the \npriority, my colleagues who are proposing this legislation have the \nwrong priority.\n  Now we are told they have a new idea--that the money that is \nsupposedly saved from these tax provisions will then be used to pay \ndown the deficit.\n  The truth is, the amount of money that would go to pay down the \ndeficit--even if our friends across the aisle had a conversion and \ndecided that was their priority rather than spending 43 cents on every \ndollar in borrowed money, borrowed from our kids and grandkids and \nbought by the Chinese--it would only be a drop in the bucket in the \n$1.5 trillion deficit we are experiencing this year and the $14 \ntrillion national debt we are going to have to reckon with in the next \ncouple months.\n  If deficit reduction is a priority, I submit the very best way we \ncould do that is to pass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. But that is not the priority of the majority leader or of \nthe majority or of our friends across the aisle. If the rationale for \nthis bill is not to reduce gasoline prices, if the rationale for this\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nbill is not to produce a balanced budget, then what is it? What is it? \nThe majority leader suggested it was fairness--fairness.\n  The Chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls it punitive \ntaxation, picking out five taxpayers in America and saying: We are \ngoing to raise your taxes and leave everybody else's the same. It is \ndiscriminatory and it is punitive. But it is also, in the immortal \nwords of Rahm Emanuel, former White House Chief of Staff, now mayor of \nChicago, a case of never letting a crisis go to waste to advance \nanother ideological agenda.\n  The truth is, we know our Tax Code is already biased against U.S. \ndomestic energy producers. If our goal is to tax people who are making \nmoney in America, this chart demonstrates that the oil and gas industry \nis down the list of industry sectors that are making far more money. \nThe tobacco and beverage industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the \ncomputer equipment industry, the chemical industry, the electrical \nequipment industry, the manufacturing industry, the apparel industry, \nthe machinery sector--all of those come well ahead of the oil and gas \nsector when it comes to making money.\n  I did not think making money was a crime in America. I thought we \nstill believed in the free enterprise system. The very people our \nfriends across the aisle are going to punish are the retirees and the \npension holders, the people who own stock in these oil and gas \ncompanies who are going to be forced to pay higher prices which will \nultimately be passed along to the consumer, I believe, in higher energy \ncosts.\n  The other revealing point about this debate is they want to punish \npeople who produce American energy right here at home, and they are \ngoing to leave OPEC and these other countries to pay lower effective \nrelative rates. If we raise taxes on American producers and we do not \ndo anything to similarly raise taxes on their competition, what is \ngoing to happen? What is going to happen to the Saudi Arabian Oil \nCompany? What is going to happen to the Iraq National Oil Company? What \nis going to happen to the Kuwait Petroleum Company, the state-owned oil \ncompany of Venezuela and the like? These are places where we end up \nbuying oil because we do not produce it at home, and we are going to \nraise taxes on the people who produce it at home and make it, in \neffect, cheaper for foreign energy producers to produce it and sell it \nto us. It makes absolutely no sense. It is punitive, it is \ndiscriminatory, and it is not going to solve the problem that most \nAmericans are complaining about today, which is high gasoline prices. \nIn fact, it will make it worse.\n  If my colleagues want to talk about fairness, let's talk about \nfairness to the 9.2 million people who are employed in the oil and gas \nsector in America. I witnessed the people who work in this sector in my \nState. In March I visited a brandnew drilling rig that is using the \nlatest technology to produce natural gas from the Haynesville Shale in \neast Texas. This is amazing technology that goes down thousands of feet \nand drills horizontally and uses high pressure fluids to fracture this \nshale--in effect, the rock--to get natural gas out of it.\n  Down in the Gulf of Mexico, after the moratorium was issued, I stood \non a deepwater drilling platform that was left idle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I could go on and on about the economic \nimpact on job creation in my State and across America. But if, in fact, \nour colleagues are interested in tax reform, if they really are \nconcerned that the Tax Code is unfair and some people do not pay enough \nand others pay too much, I ask them to consider the fact that according \nto the Congressional Research Service, 77.9 percent of our primary \nenergy production in America is fossil fuel sources, and of the Federal \ntax support targeted to energy in 2009, 12.6 percent went to fossil \nfuels--12.6 percent of those Federal tax supports went to people who \nproduce oil and gas.\n  Conversely, 10.6 percent, the Congressional Research Service tells \nus, of primary source energy was produced using renewable sources. Yet \nthe Federal tax support targeted to renewable sources of energy was \n77.4 percent.\n  Why are we picking on American oil and gas production, forcing us--\nactually hurting job creation at a time when unemployment is \nunacceptably high--forcing us to rely on imported energy and actually \nrewarding our foreign competitors who will not have to pay these higher \nprices, and when, in fact, even as our friends across the aisle \nacknowledge, at the very best this will not bring down the prices at \nthe pump.\n  They say that is not the point. If that is not the point, then the \npoint appears to be a game of gotcha and a sort of finger-pointing and \nclass warfare we have seen that is endemic inside the beltway.\n  I have to tell you, I think the American people are sick and tired of \nthis sort of game playing when, in fact, they send us here to solve \nreal problems. If we could find a way--instead of this game playing, \ninstead of this phony game of gotcha--to try to work together to solve \nreal problems through increased domestic supply, which would, indeed, \nbring down prices at the pump, as the President himself has \nacknowledged when he said we have to look at domestic production, then \nI think they would reward that with their appreciation, and \nappreciation in terms of American jobs being sustained and created here \nbecause we are not creating jobs abroad to buy the very product we need \nto run our cars and trucks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, to me, this argument is, in fact, \nall about fairness. It has nothing to do with class warfare. It has \nnothing to do with gotcha but has to do with abrogation of social \nresponsibility on the basis of levels.\n  Every once in a while we have an exchange in the Senate or in a \nSenate committee that is revealing and stunning all at once. Recently, \nI had one of those moments when I had the opportunity to ask a question \nto--guess what--five executives from the largest oil and gas companies \nin the country.\n  I was not linking price of gas--but in the people's minds it is--with \nthe gas prices up beyond $4 a gallon, with many people spending close \nto $100 a week to gas up their cars. I was cautiously optimistic that \nwe would have in this Senate Finance Committee hearing a real dialog on \nthe idea that everybody has shared responsibility and that you share \nyour responsibility--in this case, the need to balance the budget or \ncome closer to it and then share prosperity. But we have to share \nresponsibility first because that is what leads to the discipline that \nallows prosperity generally in this country to get ahead.\n  I thought the oil executives might at least reveal a bit of unease, a \nbit of discomfort on their part about how gas prices are standing like \na dead weight on our economy, about the fact they make so incredibly \nmuch, inexplicably, unexplainably so much money and loving that, \nespecially when they together earned just about $35.8 billion in \nprofits in the first 3 months of this year.\n  How wrong I was. They were eager only to defend the way Big Oil does \nbusiness, defend the enormous salaries, defend the business model that \nputs control of gas supply in the hands of a few. One would not even \nanswer when asked about his company's claim that trying to reduce \ntaxpayer subsidies--which is what we want to do--given to this industry \nwould be un-American. He said that a number of times in that exchange. \nIt was not very fruitful, but it was insightful.\n\n  As I said then, put simply, these men are all completely out of \ntouch--deeply, profoundly out of touch--with what the rest of the \ncountry is going through. Again, that is what it is about, fairness. Do \nyou know what other people are suffering? Their situation is this: very \nprofitable. Other people are on very hard times. Is there not some way \nthey could give up their tax subsidies--in this case $2 billion a \nyear--instead of making a $125-billion-a-year profit--not just more \nmoney but actually a profit; $125 billion would go down to $123 \nbillion. They would not hear of it. They are so caught up in\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\ntheir profits that they have lost sight of what is happening in \nmainstream New Hampshire and mainstream West Virginia, across our \neconomy, and our schools on Main Street and around the kitchen table.\n  Gentlemen--the five--here is some of what you need to know. For \nstarters, Congress is in the midst of a full-throated debate about how \nto reduce our growing deficit without breaking the backs further of \nworking families or leaving our seniors out in the cold literally or \nreducing our support for the veterans who serve our country and \nchildren who just happen to be our future. We are debating proposals to \ncut back Social Security and the promise that we made to generations \nwho have worked and want to live their final years with dignity. We are \ndebating legislation that forces Medicare to be privatized, how it will \ncost senior citizens about $6,000 more per year. I hope they know that. \nMedicare privatized, chopped up, made an optional grant program run by \nStates, drastically scaled back.\n  The Congress is debating deep cuts to Federal programs ranging from \nhighways and airports to medical research to coal mine safety \ninspections and money for schools--everything.\n  Quite simply, we are talking about making drastic cuts to programs \nthat touch the lives of virtually every single person in the country, \nexcept for them. These slick executives seem blind to the real-world \nconsequences of having made almost $1 trillion in profits during the \npast decade--profits--while collecting $4 billion a year in subsidies, \ncourtesy of the very same U.S. taxpayers about whom I have just been \ntalking, the same taxpayers who are also forced to pay at the pump and \nwhose lives are being changed dramatically because of their position.\n  Why focus on them? Because they are a symbol. They are the top of the \nheap. They always prevail. They always win. They always have the \nlobbyists, the campaign contributions. They always can get what they \nwant. Everybody always caves to them because they are so big, as they \nfly around in their shiny jets. I do not think it is going to be that \nway this time.\n  The same oil executives who blanch if anyone questions their mega \nsalaries--speaking of salaries, it might be interesting to know that \nthe CEO of ExxonMobile is paid $29 million a year. I am just trying to \nthink of the Presiding Officer's State of New Hampshire. I wonder how \nmany people make $29 million a year just in salaries. I do not know if \nthat includes stock options.\n  During my conversations with these executives last week, we talked a \nlittle bit about how the effective tax rate on their profits is \nsignificantly lower than what average workers make in my home State of \nWest Virginia and in the Presiding Officer's home State.\n  Exxon paid a 17-percent effective tax rate over the past 3 years--17 \npercent--while the average individual in my State and the Presiding \nOfficer's State paid an effective rate of 20 percent. Is that class \nwarfare? Is that gotcha? Or is that about fairness, about people doing \nsomething to help their country when their country is almost on its \nknees?\n  The effective rate, to explain, is the amount of tax one is actually \npaying on income earned when factoring in deductions and credits.\n  It is a vast understatement to say West Virginians, like many others \nall across the Nation, are not having an easy time of it during this \nperiod of record oil company profits. And they--those five--understand \nperfectly well that there is no longer any justification for \nmaintaining generous subsidies for this highly profitable industry. The \npublic appears to feel that way. The poll numbers are just stunning--70 \nto 30 that it is not right, that we should take away the subsidies. It \nvaries according to the poll, but it is always high up, including two-\nto-one Republicans across the country who believe they should not be \nable to have those tax subsidies that we are so easily giving them.\n  They know that without a willingness to stare down sacred cows like \ncorporate subsidies--not just with them but with others--we won't ever \nbe able to make progress in eliminating the massive Federal deficit \nwhich is staring us in the face. Why wouldn't they care about that? It \nis so easy for them. It is called sharing, being fair. But no, it \ndoesn't work that way.\n  The average West Virginian, again, makes $32,000 a year. They can't \nafford another 10 years of handouts to Big Oil. The current high gas \nprices are like a dark cloud. The working class in rural States like \nmine commute 25 miles or more each way every day, and high gas prices \ncut heavily into their weekly paycheck. Of course they do. Things are \nmuch worse in the summer, of course, when people travel, if they can \nany longer afford to. I hear often from constituents who are \nexperiencing sticker shock at the pump. Police departments, schools, \nhospitals, and community organizations also feel the pinch of rising \nfuel costs and the pinch of everything else that isn't coming through. \nPhilanthropy is down in this depressed economy. It is bad. Even the \nsmallest increase can have a serious impact on family budgets and a \nbusiness's bottom line.\n  I do not mean to suggest that the oil industry profits and subsidies \nare the sole culprit for rising gas prices because listening to those \nwho are industry experts and economists, too, has convinced me that the \nbig factor in the rising cost of energy is the role of speculators. I \nwon't get into that too much now, but I will say that these speculative \ninvestors make a quick profit in betting on what the cost of a barrel \nof oil might be next Friday. If they turn out to be right, they get a \nwhole lot of money. I mean, it is stupid. It is Wall Street at its \ndumbest, and they have shown us several ways to be that way. They take \nno risk themselves.\n  I am not alone in thinking these speculators are driving up oil \nprices and creating more price volatility. I have joined with other \nSenate colleagues in asking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nlook closely at the role of speculators in the oil futures market and \nin pressing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to get moving on a \npower they already have, which is to set margins on what speculators \ncan make--to crack down, rein this in. I have also written to the \nFederal Trade Commission--to investigate any potential fraud or market \nmanipulation in the oil markets.\n  I also believe what is needed in the big oil industry is a sense of \nfairness. It is not too much to ask when it comes to paying taxes, when \nit comes to paying the price for gas. To me, fairness has always meant \nshared sacrifice in tough times and shared success in good times--a \nsense of giving something for the larger good. I am not suggesting that \nthey stop being competitive or aggressively profitable, but at least \nshow for a minute they see where we are today. If they had expressed \nconcern about average people and then refused to take any decrease in \ntheir tax subsidies--paid for by these people I am talking about--that \nwouldn't have given me much comfort, but at least it would have been \njust a bit of a bend. We got none of that. What we got was, we like our \nbusiness model, we are staying with it, don't punish us for being \nprofitable. We do business the way we do business. We have been doing \nit for 130 years, and that is that.\n  So what is needed here is a reminder that a lifetime of always \nbeating their adversaries and never losing or giving anything of \nthemselves to the greater good does not, in fact, lead to a prosperous \nor morally just society. That is not too much to ask, especially of Big \nOil, and I am not going to stop just because they do not get it yet.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, across this country Americans are \nfeeling the pain at the pump. Gas prices are approaching $4 a gallon. \nFamilies are going to spend, on average, about $800 more on gas this \nyear than they did last year. Unrest in the Middle East and a weak \ndollar are driving oil prices even higher. Now more than ever, we must \nproduce more American energy. We need to do this to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Americans are looking to Washington for leadership. All you have to \ndo is pick up today's USA TODAY to know how much--and I know you hear \nabout it, too, when you are home on the weekends--this $4-a-gallon gas \nis impacting people in our States.\n  Here is one headline. ``Poll: Gas prices hurting many. $4 a gallon \nrequires cutbacks.''\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\n  Let me read to you, Madam President:\n\n       As gas prices hover near $4 a gallon, nearly seven in 10 \n     Americans say the high cost of fuel is causing financial \n     hardship for their families, a new USA TODAY/Gallup poll \n     finds. More than half say they have made major changes to \n     compensate for the higher prices, ranging from shorter trips \n     to cutting back on vacation travel.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       For 21%, the impact is so dramatic they say their standard \n     of living is jeopardized.\n\n  So here we have families all across the country, in your State as \nwell as in mine, who are dealing with kids, bills, mortgages, and this \nsort of increase--$800 out of their ability to pay for other things \nthis year--clearly impacts their quality of life. So Americans want \nanswers and they deserve answers. They are asking: How am I going to \npay my gas bill? When we have American energy, energy right here in \nthis country, they are asking: Why are we so dependent on foreign \ncountries for our energy? They want to know where the leadership is in \nWashington.\n  This very week, the President has finally said he understands the \nneed to produce more American energy. Well, he has used that same line \nmany times.\n  The actions of the Democratic Party today on the floor of the Senate \ndo not track with the lines coming out of the White House. The \nadministration wants Americans to believe the administration has seen \nthe light, but Republican Representative Doc Hastings, a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, has already called their bluff. \nRepresentative Hastings is the sponsor of legislation that would allow \nmore energy production off the coast of Alaska. He said it is ironic \nthat the White House is now supporting this idea because the White \nHouse just recently opposed the idea when he introduced it in the House \nof Representatives.\n  The Associated Press was even more direct. They said that all of the \nadministration's ideas had come from three bills that were passed by \nthe Republican-controlled House down the hall, and the Associated Press \nsaid the White House had opposed every single one of these bills.\n  So despite acting against the production of more American energy just \na week ago, the President now wants us to believe he supports it just \nbecause this week he says so. Well, I hope his change of heart is \nsincere, but I have my doubts because, unlike energy, talk is cheap.\n  The administration is trying to use this sudden change of heart as a \nbargaining chip to pass legislation that was brought up by liberals in \nthe Senate this past week. Unlike increased production, the bill \nbrought to the floor by the Democrats will not help the American \npeople. In fact, the bill is clear evidence that the Democratic Party \nhas no plan to address high gasoline prices. Why do I say that? Well, \nthe solution we hear for high gas prices is a tax increase. Since when \ndid raising taxes lower the price of gasoline? Since when does raising \ntaxes on one thing ever lower the price of that thing? To me, this is \njust another distraction. The nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService has already told us there are some commonsense facts about \nenergy taxes. They have told us that raising energy taxes will not \nlower the price at the pump. In fact, the Congressional Research \nService says increasing energy taxes will increase the price of gas and \nincrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n  This administration has consistently pushed policies that actually \nmake the pain at the pump worse. Instead of supporting the all-of-the-\nabove energy production across our country, they have been more focused \non excuses about why we shouldn't use more American energy. If you look \nback over time, there is a clear pattern. In 2008, when he was a \ncandidate for President, then-Senator Obama said high gas prices \nweren't a problem. He said the only problem is that they went up too \nfast. Interior Secretary Salazar, when he was a Member of this body, \nsaid he would not support more offshore drilling even if gas prices hit \n$10 a gallon. Even Secretary Steven Chu, who is our Energy Secretary, \nwas quoted that same year as saying: We have to figure out how to boost \nthe price of gasoline to the levels of Europe. Gas prices in Europe \nroutinely hit $8 a gallon. With these individuals in charge of our \nenergy policy, it is no wonder prices are way up--up over $1 from where \nthey were a year ago.\n  This administration's shutting down of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico \nwill drive American oil production down by 20 percent in 2012. Even \nformer President Bill Clinton called the continuous shutdown \nridiculous.\n  To make matters worse, President Obama appears to be more \nenthusiastic about importing oil from other countries than he is in \nterms of using our own. Brazil has discovered huge reserves of shale \noil, and the President recently visited Brazil. He said he wants the \nUnited States to be Brazil's best customer for oil.\n  When it comes to oil consumption generally, the President's story \ncontinues to change. A few weeks ago, President Obama tried to make the \ncase that Americans should decrease their consumption of oil. He said \nwe only have about 2 to 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and we \nuse 25 percent of the world's oil. According to the President's \nmeasurements, the United States has about 28 billion barrels of oil, \nbut according to the Congressional Research Service, the United States \nactually has 163 billion barrels of oil. That is over five times as \nmuch as the President says we have, and the United States is currently \nthe third largest oil-producing nation in the world.\n  President Obama has also said he wants to cut imports of foreign oil \nby a third. Well, his new proposal is definitely a step in the right \ndirection, so why would he tie it to this bill that makes American \nproduction harder and more expensive?\n  Another of the President's goals is to make alternative energy the \ncheapest form of energy. He continues to talk about that, and I applaud \nthat goal. But we need to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we \ncan, and do it in ways that don't raise the prices for American \nfamilies. Regrettably, the President's method has been to make \neverything but alternative energy more expensive, and the bill his \nparty is pushing right now is another step in that direction.\n  So the evidence is clear: The liberal energy strategy is not creating \nAmerican jobs. No, it is not creating jobs here in America, it is not \nreducing the cost of gasoline in America, and it is not strengthening \nAmerica's national security. Instead, Americans are paying more at the \npump, they are living with high unemployment, and they are producing \nless American energy.\n  I hope the President will follow up on his promise to help America \nproduce more oil. I also hope he will stop pushing the damaging \nlegislation his party has put forward here this week.\n\n  It is time we have a true bipartisan approach on energy. Senator \nManchin of West Virginia and I have introduced just such a bill. It is \na bipartisan bill called the American Alternative Fuels Act. This bill \ntruly would ease American's pain at the pump. It would repeal barriers \nto alternative fuels so American energy can thrive. It would promote \nthe production of alternative fuels derived from American sources. This \nbill acknowledges the truth about our energy crisis. We need more \nAmerican energy--we need it all.\n  In addition to the green jobs the President keeps talking about, we \nneed red, white, and blue energy and red, white, and blue energy jobs. \nWe must keep focusing on making our energy as clean as we can, as fast \nas we can, and do it in ways that do not increase the costs on American \nfamilies.\n  The only way Americans can take the President's call for more energy \nproduction seriously is if he and the Democratic leadership abandon \ntheir fixation on raising taxes on producing American energy. That is \nthe first step we need to take in helping relieve the pain at the pump.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nMenendez proposal which would raise taxes on a handful of our Nation's \nenergy producers. This bill makes the assumption that raising taxes on \nthe five\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nmajor oil companies will somehow reduce the deficit and lower the price \nat the pump. This is misguided and it will also have the opposite \neffect. Raising taxes on our domestic oil industry will drive up \ngasoline prices and who in America driving a truck or a car doesn't \nrealize that gasoline prices are already very high? Second, it will \nthreaten the jobs, 9 million jobs dependent on drilling, exploration, \nand operating in America. If we drive these companies overseas, it will \nincrease foreign imports and it will stop jobs being created in \nAmerica.\n  Those who threaten to repeal these deductions fail to recognize the \ntremendous costs and risks that go into exploring for the energy needed \nto drive our country forward. Our oil and gas industry is a business or \nindustry that creates jobs like any other business or industry in our \ncountry. Why would we single out one sector of our economy and say you \ncan't deduct your expenses? Every other business in America can deduct \nexpenses. Other manufacturing businesses in America can get the tax \ncredits for manufacturing jobs because we want to keep jobs in America \nand it offsets the very high corporate tax rate that we have in our \ncountry, that the President has recognized as being too high. Because \nwe want to keep manufacturing jobs, there is a credit for \nmanufacturing. But we are going to take that away if the Menendez bill \npasses, and send those jobs overseas.\n  We are making it so hard to create our own natural resources from our \nown people working in this country, instead sending jobs overseas. At a \ntime when we ought to be helping to create jobs, when we ought to give \nevery possible fair break to companies that will hire in America, now \nwe are going to take one sector of our industry and tax it differently \nfrom every other sector.\n  Since business started in our country we have had tax deductions for \nexpenses. Yet here we are trying to say we are going to take one sector \nof our industry--maybe they are doing too well right now--and we are \ngoing to tax them more. Look out, other industries that happen to be \nsuccessful right now; whether you are making Kleenex or computers, you \nare going to be taxed if you earn too much. Is that what America wants \nto change to, as our business policy, which has a foundation of \nfairness and equity?\n  We have a corporate tax rate that is so high it encourages businesses \nto go overseas. Now we are going to single out one industry that wants \nto do work in America, that wants to bring our natural resources out of \nthe ground and bring down the price at the pump. But, no, we are going \nto add taxes so we will not see any lowering of gasoline prices at the \npump. Instead, we are going to increase it. If we increase the cost of \ndoing business and we force these companies to go overseas to get fair \nand stable regulatory environment, then we are going to pay more at the \npump. There is no doubt about it.\n  Senator Landrieu and I introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this \nyear called S. 516, the Lease Extension and Secure Energy Act of 2011, \nknown as LEASE. It restores time lost as a result of the offshore \nmoratoria by extending the impacted leases by 1 year. It is fair and it \nis simple.\n  Over the weekend, the President stated he would be extending leases \nin the Gulf of Mexico that were affected by the moratorium, but he was \nnot clear about which ones. He didn't say I will extend every lease \nthat went through the processes to get the environmental and the safety \nrestrictions in place.\n  They got the lease. Then they had a moratorium. So they are paying \npeople, they are continuing to have all of the expenses of the lease \nbut they do not get to do the exploration. We are saying whether you \nwere in the exploration phase or in the drilling phase it doesn't \nmatter. If you are impacted by a moratorium on a lease that you are \nstill paying for and you are still paying people to try to keep people \non the payroll, your lease will be extended for 1 year. That is all the \nbill Senator Landrieu and I submitted will do.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, at a hearing this morning in the \nSenate, said they were looking into extending Gulf of Mexico ``wells'' \ndirectly impacted by the moratorium--meaning only those leaseholders \nwho have already performed all seismic tests and were conducting \nexploration drilling. This will only cover 33 leases out of thousands \nthat are still affected by the moratorium, because they are in the \nexploratory phase, not the exploratory drilling phase.\n  This year alone, over 350 leases are due to expire. Many of them have \nnot had the opportunity to be developed because of the moratorium. The \ndevelopment of oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico is an extremely \nexpensive and technical process. It takes about 3 years of tests, \nsurveys, and appraisals before even drilling for the exploration well. \nRegardless of which stage all of the exploration leaseholders are in, \nthe administration ordered all leaseholders to halt exploration \nactivities when its moratorium was enacted. Every one of those leases \nis still being paid for but they are not able to be explored. We need \nto restore at least 1 year of the moratorium so they get fairness for \nthe money they have spent and also for the people they have kept hired, \nnot sending them away--which has been a hardship on many companies, \nincluding some having to go bankrupt because they could not afford to \nbe idle while they also were meeting a payroll.\n  The exploration and development of oil and gas must follow a \nmeticulous process, and any delay such as a moratorium can derail an \nexploration plan causing companies to have to give up on their \nleases. The length of deepwater offshore leases is usually about 10 \nyears because that is what it takes to get all the way through the \nexploration and the exploration drilling phase to determine if it is \nworth actually drilling. Many times when you drill, you get a dry well.\n\n  Our commonsense legislation has bipartisan support. Recently, the \nOffice of Management and Budget stated, ``The administration fully \nsupports suspensions for Gulf of Mexico leaseholders directly impacted \nby the drilling moratorium,'' but the administration fails to recognize \nthat all leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico were ``directly impacted by \nthe drilling moratorium.''\n  James Noe, the executive director of the Shallow Water Energy \nSecurity Coalition, wrote me to express his support for the LEASE Act. \nIn the letter, he said:\n\n       Without the LEASE Act, vast quantities of proven, present \n     and producible oil and gas in these expiring leases will be \n     trapped.\n\n  Leaving the resources trapped will hurt our domestic production and \ndelay when these resources can come online.\n  I received another letter from Stephen Heitzman, the president and \nCEO of Phoenix Exploration, a small Houston-based exploration company. \nMr. Heitzman wrote that the LEASE Act is vital to Phoenix Exploration \nand other small offshore companies because they have been prevented by \nthe administration from drilling in the moratorium and have not been \nable to even evaluate many of their Gulf of Mexico leases which have \nbeen fully paid for through the competitive bidding process. He goes on \nto say the time lost from the moratorium makes it very difficult for \nshallow water independent operators to put together the partnerships \nand attract sufficient capital resources needed to develop leases.\n  The LEASE Act is needed to give offshore energy producers the \ncertainty they need to obtain proper financing to produce domestic oil \nand gas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I have read excerpts from be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Phoenix Exploration Company,\n\n                                        Houston, TX, May 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of Phoenix Exploration \n     Company LP and its employees in Texas and elsewhere along the \n     Gulf Coast, we thank you for your leadership efforts in the \n     development and hopeful enactment by the Congress of S.516, \n     the Lease Extension and Energy Security Act (LEASE Act). Your \n     legislation is vital to Phoenix Exploration and other small \n     offshore oil and gas companies that were prevented by the \n     Administration's de facto drilling moratorium from fully \n     evaluating many of its Gulf of Mexico leases acquired and \n     fully paid for through the Federal OCS competitive bidding \n     process. Your reasonable solution of an additional 12 month \n     extension of the offshore leases impacted by that moratorium \n     will help to prevent further adverse business and employment \n     impacts throughout the Gulf Coast Region of the United \n     States.\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n       The loss of time associated with the de facto moratorium \n     and the ensuing new high level of uncertainty associated with \n     the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and \n     Enforcement's permitting process, makes it very difficult for \n     shallow water independent operators to put together the \n     required business partnerships and attract sufficient capital \n     resources to develop leases. Consequently, these permitting \n     and timing uncertainties cause potential business partners \n     for resource development to be reluctant to begin discussions \n     to work on the hundreds of leases that are left with reduced \n     development periods.\n       Your LEASE Act will provide the small companies in the \n     offshore oil and gas industry the additional time to \n     compensate for the actual lost time associated with the de \n     facto moratorium and the newly increased permitting time \n     required to develop the acquired leases. The Administration's \n     unilateral de facto moratorium of oil and gas operations in \n     the Federal OCS has caused significant economic risk in the \n     minds of the investment community. This uncertainty has \n     caused disruption in economic development of Federal OCS \n     leases in the Gulf of Mexico and has negatively affected jobs \n     throughout Texas and the Gulf Coast Region. Your proposed \n     legislation will provide a welcome incentive to Phoenix \n     Exploration and other similarly-situated companies to develop \n     the resource potential of existing offshore leases and in \n     doing so, creates domestic jobs which will bring domestic \n     energy resources to the American public.\n       Thank you for your support of Phoenix Exploration Company \n     and the people of Texas in this vitally important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen E. Heitzman,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Shallow Water Energy\n\n\n                                           Security Coalition,\n\n                                        Houston, TX, May 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the member companies \n     of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition \n     (``Coalition'') and their employees, we are extremely \n     thankful for your leadership in the introduction and efforts \n     to enact S. 516, the Lease Extension and Energy Security Act \n     (LEASE Act). This legislation is urgently needed to avoid \n     further adverse economic and employment impacts resulting \n     from the Administration's de facto moratorium on offshore \n     drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coalition is \n     comprised of the leading exploration and production, drilling \n     and offshore contractors in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       As a result of the de facto moratorium on offshore \n     drilling, all related shallow oil and gas exploration \n     activities on the Outer Continental Shelf of the U.S. came to \n     a grinding halt. However, the expiration period for offshore \n     oil and gas leases was not suspended. As you have so \n     appropriately recognized, it is only fair and reasonable to \n     provide a short-term 12-month extension to return to the \n     affected leaseholders the lengthy period of time in which \n     they were prevented from developing those leases. Your \n     legislation will most certainly help to protect American jobs \n     and increase domestic oil and gas production.\n       Clearly, it is imperative that the LEASE Act be enacted as \n     quickly as possible. In this year alone, over 350 offshore \n     leases are due to expire, many of which have not had the \n     opportunity to be developed because of the de facto \n     moratorium. Without the LEASE Act, vast quantities of proven, \n     present and producible oil and gas in these expiring leases \n     will be trapped. Once these leases expire, they revert to the \n     federal government only to be developed when and if the \n     Administration holds an offshore lease sale. The \n     Administration cancelled the Gulf of Mexico lease sale, which \n     was scheduled in March, 2011, and it now appears that, for \n     the first time in 40 years, the country will not hold a lease \n     sale in 2011. With soaring gasoline prices and the countries \n     growing dependency on foreign sources for the supply of oil \n     and gas, we must reap the fruit of our offshore leases.\n       The economic impact of the Administration's offshore oil \n     and gas policies continues to be direct, severe and long-\n     lasting. Your legislation will provide some welcome relief \n     for the hundreds of thousands of Texas, Louisiana and other \n     Gulf state employees who rely on a strong and vibrant \n     offshore energy industry.\n       Thank you for your support of the Coalition and its members \n     in this vitally important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James W. Noe.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me close by saying I hope we will \nnot do something so wrongheaded and counterintuitive as to take one \nsection of an industry and say you are bigger than all the others, so \nwe are going to tax you differently. We are not going to give you the \nmanufacturing tax credits we give to every other manufacturer in the \nworld, including the big ones that manufacture in the United States, \nand we are also going to tax you differently from the smaller oil and \ngas companies because you are big and they are small. Is that America? \nIs that the country that wrote a Constitution that said we would \nguarantee due process of law, that we wouldn't single out one company \nthat is bigger than the others and tax it differently? That is not what \nour country was founded on.\n  We should have a fair process. We should have fair taxation. We \nshould be encouraging manufacturing in our country because these \ncompanies have a trust with their shareholders. We expect them to do \nwell for their shareholders, and they have millions of shareholders who \ndepend on them to do the right thing with their business and with the \ninvestment these shareholders have made. I might add that many pensions \nare dependent on these kinds of stocks, and it is expected the CEOs \nwill run the companies in a way that will keep our economy going, keep \njobs in America, and keep their stockholders in a position where \nretirees can live on the income. We are singling out an industry and \nsaying: No, you are too big, so you are going to be taxed differently \nfrom other industries, and you don't get the manufacturing incentives \nthat even other big manufacturers get. Why wouldn't they move overseas \nto create jobs overseas where they have a stable regulatory \nenvironment, a lower tax base, a lower tax rate, and where they can \nbring up oil from the ground and import it right back into America, \neven though it will be at a higher price because we are going to have \nto pay for the people to go overseas and haul the oil back.\n  Does that make sense? It doesn't make good business sense, and it \ncertainly doesn't make good economic sense. It is not good for our \ncountry, and it is certainly not good for the job market we are trying \nto build.\n  I hope we will not make the mistake of going forward on the Menendez \nbill. I hope we will realize we are a country that has vast natural \nresources and we should be using those resources so our businesses can \nthrive, so prices stay low, so people will not be strained to put \ngasoline in their trucks to go to work or to do their farming or \nranching to contribute back to the economy. I hope we will defeat the \nMenendez bill, and I hope we will adopt a policy that will come through \nthe McConnell bill tomorrow which will increase exploration, increase \nproduction, and lower the price of gasoline through our own natural \nresources, not by importing our own--the jobs that ought to be in \nAmerica, exporting the jobs and importing the product. That doesn't \nmake sense. Let's keep the jobs in America and let's keep our natural \nresources working for us. That would be the prudent thing to do and \nthat will be the McConnell bill.\n  I hope we can defeat the Menendez bill, and maybe we can come \ntogether in the Senate and give the President a bill that will ask that \nwe have more production and give the level playing field to all the \ncompanies that would hire more people and create jobs in America. They \nwill do it if there is a level and fair and stable regulatory and tax \nenvironment in America.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nenergy-related votes we face this week in the Senate.\n  Coloradans--and all Americans--are feeling the sting of skyrocketing \ngas prices. And ``pain at the pump'' puts a crimp in the budgets of \nhardworking families and small businesses everywhere. I hear this every \ntime I am back in my home State, talking to folks. They think it is \nunfair--and I agree.\n  Runaway gas prices are not acceptable and we must work across the \npartisan divide to bring a stop to it.\n  In fact, I recently called on the State Department and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to do everything they can to crack down on global oil \nmarket manipulation. And I joined my colleagues in urging the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission to ratchet up their efforts at preventing \noverspeculation in oil trading domestically. Taking these steps would \nhelp reduce the chance that market manipulation is hurting American \nconsumers.\n  But from a larger perspective, the challenge is that we simply do not \nhave any quick fixes. And substantial relief today would have required \nus to take steps years ago to reform our energy system. Unfortunately, \nwe let those opportunities pass us by. That is the unvarnished truth \nthe American people\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nneed to hear, not false promises or bumper sticker solutions.\n  The real solutions involve tough choices and strategic investments in \nclean energy that will help wean our Nation off foreign sources of oil. \nIt really is the only way we will be able to dig ourselves out of this \nhole and lower gas prices. And, importantly, it is one of the ways that \nwe will get the United States back on the path to winning the global \neconomic race.\n  Unfortunately, neither of the votes we will take this week will \nreduce gas prices for consumers.\n  As are most Americans, I am frustrated that once again politics is \ngetting in the way of progress I would much rather be debating a \ncomprehensive energy policy this week that includes a renewable \nelectricity standard, promotes energy efficiency, and encourages \nresponsible development of domestic resources such as safe nuclear \npower and natural gas.\n  We need to move beyond partisan fights and blame games. Instead, we \nneed to work toward what we all can agree are key priorities: \ndeveloping energy that brings affordable prices to American families \nand businesses; building a sustainable, long-term energy future; and \ndoing it in a way that protects our clean air and water for future \ngenerations. Put simply, establishing energy security--perhaps above \nany other issue--will assure our Nation's future success.\n  We each often say that our States are the best laboratories to create \ninnovation. But in Colorado, we have a great example of this in action.\n  Back in 2004, Colorado cast aside partisan politics and bumper \nsticker solutions by taking a big, brave step forward and embraced the \nemerging clean energy economy. That year I led a bipartisan ballot \ninitiative with the former Republican Speaker of the Colorado House, \nLola Spradley, in a campaign to convince the voters of Colorado to \napprove a State-based RES that would harness renewable resources like \nthe sun, the wind, and geothermal energy. We barnstormed the State, \nspeaking over and over to anyone who would listen.\n  There was a lot of industry opposition to an RES, and dire \npredictions that it would cost consumers money and damage Colorado's \neconomy. But, those arguments were proven wrong. And Colorado \nindustries, consumers, and people across the political spectrum have \nembraced clean energy as part of Colorado's effort to win the global \neconomic race.\n  In fact, last year, the Colorado Legislature approved, and former \nGovernor Bill Ritter signed, a bill to increase the RES standard even \nfurther: from 20 percent to 30 percent renewable energy by 2020. This \nmakes the Colorado RES the second most aggressive standard in the \nNation, only after California.\n  Even more refreshing is that in the years since Colorado established \none of the earliest and strongest renewable electricity standards, our \nenergy producers have embraced the move. One of our State's largest \nutilities, Xcel Energy, has become a national leader in clean energy. \nIn proving that clean energy can be profitable and competitive, Xcel is \nmaking the case for how an RES can create jobs, stimulate the economy, \nand help us achieve energy independence.\n  The clean energy economy is one of the greatest economic \nopportunities of the 21st century, and the global demand for clean \nenergy is growing by $1 trillion every year. The lesson to be learned \nfrom Colorado is that clean energy can unleash the American \nentrepreneurial spirit. We must pursue forward-thinking policies that \nwill help America seize and lead this growing market.\n  Make no mistake. We are in a race against foreign competitors and are \nquickly being left behind. Last year, I returned from China where I \ndiscussed clean energy issues with American businesses located there. I \nsaw it firsthand. They are ready to eat our lunch when it comes to \nclean energy. China is pursuing renewable energy and clean energy \ntechnology so ambitiously, not because they want to save the planet but \nbecause it makes good business and economic sense.\n  In fact, China has announced that it is investing over $738 billion \nover the next 10 years in clean energy development--nearly the size of \nour entire American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Just imagine, their \neconomy uses a comparable amount of energy, but they take clean energy \nso seriously that they plan to invest a stimulus-sized amount of money \nsolely in renewables.\n  But we can't just rely on renewable energy. Rather, America must have \nan all-of-the-above energy policy. For example, conservation and energy \nefficiency efforts offer the quickest way to reduce energy demand \ntoday. And safe nuclear energy and natural gas can and should fill a \nlarger share of our energy portfolio as they both are cleaner fuels. In \naddition, we all know America will be dependent on fossil fuels for \nyears to come, so it is not realistic to exclude them in our strategy. \nAll of these elements should be in America's energy mix and we must \nacknowledge that to really embrace 21st century solutions.\n\n  But when we look at the future demands for clean energy and the \neconomic opportunities ahead of us, renewable resources hold the \ngreatest promise. And the more home-grown renewable energy we can \nproduce, the less money we need to spend buying oil from foreign \nnations that wish to do us harm, which means less money spent at the \ngas pump. I don't think anyone in this Chamber can argue with the \nproposition that we should be moving aggressively toward energy \nindependence with dividends like that.\n  It is time we made a concerted national effort to reclaim our \nposition at the front of the pack. We should be harnessing the wind and \nsun and other renewable resources here in America, and putting \nAmericans to work in good-paying jobs developing, building, and leading \nthe clean energy revolution. It is an example of what we call back home \n``Colorado common sense.''\n  But instead of pursuing some commonsense goals that are sure to move \nour economy forward, we are here today exchanging political punches on \nissues largely unrelated to our energy independence and the prices \nAmericans pay at the pump.\n  While I support reducing tax breaks for the five largest oil \ncompanies, I honestly wish this issue was a smaller part of a larger \ndiscussion on a comprehensive energy strategy that allows the U.S. to \nlead the global economic race. That said, I will vote to repeal these \nneedless tax breaks for Big Oil. Traditional energy production has \nreceived billions in subsidies over the last 70 years. And the top five \noil companies in particular make billions in profits that far exceed \nthe need for government support.\n  I happen to agree with the thousands of Coloradans who have told me: \nthese companies--among the biggest in the world--don't need and \nshouldn't receive taxpayer money, especially as we look for ways to \nconsolidate our Tax Code and reduce the deficit.\n  It is important to me that this bill is limited to the top five \ncompanies and does not include small, independent producers that \nprovide many jobs in Colorado. I should note that there are some tax \ncredits--such as the production tax credit for wind, the investment tax \ncredit for solar, and the intangible drilling costs tax credit for \nsmall oil and gas producers--that are important to jobs in Colorado and \nacross the country. While my ideal energy market would be free from any \ntax credits, I also want to make sure we continue to invest in domestic \nenergy industries that still need help getting off the ground. Just as \nwith most policy, it is a delicate balance.\n  In my home State of Colorado and in the Presiding Officer's home \nState of Pennsylvania and all over our country, Americans are feeling \nthe sting of rising gas prices. The pain at the pump puts a real crimp \nin the budgets of hard-working families and businesses everywhere. I \nhear this every time I am back in my home State listening and visiting \nwith the folks there. They think it is unfair, and I have to say I \nagree.\n  Runaway gas prices are not acceptable. I think it is our job, working \nacross the partisan divide, to bring a stop to it. I have to tell my \ncolleagues, instead of pursuing some commonsense goals that would move \nour economy forward and would mold a comprehensive energy proposal, we \nare punching away at each other on issues largely unrelated to our \nenergy independence and the prices Americans pay at the pump.\n  I am going to support the vote today. We ought to reduce tax breaks \nfor the\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nfive largest oil companies. But I have to say I wish this had been part \nof a larger discussion on a comprehensive energy strategy to allow us \nto lead the global economic race. That said, I am going to vote to \nrepeal what I think are needless tax breaks for Big Oil.\n  Traditional energy production has received billions of subsidies over \nthe last 70 years--70 years--and the top 50 companies in particular \nmake billions in profits that far exceed the need for more government \nsupport. I happen to agree with thousands of Coloradans who have been \nin touch with me to say that these companies, which are among the \nbiggest in the world, don't need and shouldn't receive taxpayer money, \nespecially as we look for ways to consolidate our Tax Code and reduce \nthe deficit.\n  It is important to me that the bill is limited to the top five \ncompanies and doesn't include small, independent producers that provide \na lot of jobs in Colorado. I should note that there are some tax \ncredits, such as the production tax credit for wind, the investment tax \ncredit for solar, and the intangible drilling costs tax credit for \nsmall oil and gas producers that are important for jobs in Colorado and \nacross our country.\n  I think we would agree that the ideal energy market would be free \nfrom any tax credits, but I also wish to make sure we invest in our \ndomestic energy industries that still need help getting off the ground. \nAs with most policy matters, this is a delicate balance.\n  Let me wind down my remarks with this request to my colleagues, that \nwe would take responsibility for our economic future and get serious \nabout energy independence. That means we would have to shed, each and \nevery one of us, some of our doctrinaire positions and what is too \noften on the floor a ``my way or the highway'' approach. There are ways \nto responsibly drill for oil while also increasing our renewable \nelectricity production. There are ways to safely expand nuclear power \nwhile also boosting energy efficiency. There are ways to harness \nnatural gas as a bridge fuel while also spurring a generation of \nelectric cars.\n  These are not either/or propositions. I think we especially have to \nseize the clean energy opportunity that is in front of us, so 2, 4, and \n10 years from now we are not still sidetracked by political infighting \nbecause we, once again, failed to make the tough decisions. A \ncomprehensive energy policy is critically important to our Nation's \neconomic recovery and our long-term energy future. Believe me, \nAmericans are ready for it. In fact, they are demanding it.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nMenendez's bill to eliminate subsidies to big oil companies. At a time \nwhen we have to make tough choices to address our budget deficit, when \nwe are cutting cancer research, at a time when Minnesotans are paying \n$4 a gallon at the pump, and at a time when oil companies are raking in \nrecord profits, we have to stand and say: Enough is enough. It is time \nto end the subsidies. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the bill.\n  We have had to make a lot of tough choices, and there are plenty \nstill to come. To avert a government shutdown, Congress enacted \nbillions of dollars in cuts. Some were pretty hard for me to swallow, \nfrankly--cuts such as $182 million from job training, $650 million from \ncommunity development funds that help communities provide basic \nservices such as roads and sewers and affordable housing, even Pell \ngrants.\n  These are cuts that will be felt by working families and people who \nare still struggling to find jobs and make ends meet. I voted for the \nspending bill that contained those cuts, not because they would be the \ncuts that I choose to make but because it was important to keep the \ngovernment open. Addressing our budget deficits will take compromise. \nIt will take shared sacrifice from everyone. That includes big oil \ncompanies that are making record profits because the price of oil is \nnow at $100 a barrel.\n  The bill before us would end $1.2 billion in subsidies to the five \nlargest oil companies in fiscal year 2012 and $21 billion over the next \n10 years. These companies make up three of the top five Fortune 500 \ncompanies and have had nearly $1 trillion in profit over the last \ndecade. While high oil prices are gouging the pocketbooks of American \nfamilies, these companies are on a pace for a record profit this year. \nIn the first quarter alone, these companies collectively made about $35 \nbillion in profits.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues, how high do oil prices have to go--how \nbig do the oil companies' profits have to be--before we can talk about \ndoing away with their handouts? These companies have legacy wells that \npump oil at a cost of about $10 a barrel--a little less. On average, \noil production costs them $15 a barrel. When exactly don't they need \nthese subsidies anymore? They are making record profits. At $100 a \nbarrel, why do they need the subsidies? If oil goes up to $102 a barrel \nor $110, or $150, can they give us the subsidies back then? There is \nabsolutely no rationale for these subsidies--none at all. How much \nmoney do these companies have to make before they do not need the \ngovernment's help anymore?\n  To me it sounds as though these companies do not need to be \nsubsidized by taxpayers. President George W. Bush thought so too. In \n2005 he said:\n\n       With $55 dollar oil, we don't need incentives to oil and \n     gas companies to explore. There are plenty of incentives.\n\n  When testifying before Congress in 2005, one oil executive stated \nthat removing many of these tax breaks would have no effect on his \ncompany's production activity. Today, with oil prices close to $100 a \nbarrel, it is doubly true.\n  Let me say something about House Speaker Boehner's statement on the \ndebt limit last week. The Speaker told us that in terms of dealing with \nthe deficit, everything is on the table, except for revenues. How can \nwe not look at billions of dollars in handouts to some of the most \nprofitable companies in America?\n  This is sort of like a family that cannot pay its bills, and they \ncannot pay for food and heat and electricity and medical bills and the \nmortgage all at the same time. So they gather around the table and the \ndad says: ``To make ends meet, everything is on the table. We are \npaying for this stuff, except for one of us getting an extra job or \nworking more hours or somehow bringing in more money. We can't do \nthat.'' And the son says: ``Gee, dad, I could do more hours at TGI \nFriday's. I could do that.'' ``No, son. That's off the table. No more \nmedicine for grandma. You go play with your Xbox some more.''\n  Revenues off the table, especially subsidies that do not do anybody \nany good? That does not make any sense and tells me that some of us are \nnot serious about fixing the budget deficit.\n  A recent report from the Joint Economic Committee concluded that:\n\n       Repealing or modifying the tax incentives discussed in this \n     report . . . would have little or no impact on consumer \n     energy prices in the immediate future.\n\n  In 2010, 60 percent of the big five oil companies' profits went to \nstock buybacks and dividends to their shareholders, not to exploration. \nSo even if they had fewer taxpayer subsidies and could only use, say, \n59 percent of their record profits for buybacks and dividends this \nyear, I am pretty sure they could get by just fine.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think we have \nthe wrong approach and they do not want us touching Big Oil's \ngovernment handouts. Instead, they are pushing an alternative bill that \nwould require the government to approve or reject a drilling permit in \n60 days or it would be deemed automatically approved. This is a very \ndangerous idea. Just this morning, I asked Director Bromwich, who heads \nthe agency in charge of offshore permitting, what he thought about this \nidea, and he said we would all be at greater risk from such a proposal.\n  This shows that some of my colleagues have not learned the lessons of \nthe BP oilspill where a shoddy approval\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nprocess and numerous industry errors led to a monumental disaster in \nthe gulf. This disaster brought economic hardship for thousands and \ncost 11 workers their lives. Let's not forget that.\n  Offshore drilling is becoming an increasingly complex industry. To \ninsist on a one-size-fits-all permit process ignores the increasing \ntechnical challenges that offshore drilling presents. The Republican \nbill is reckless and irresponsible, and I urge my colleagues to reject \nit.\n  Instead of ending handouts to wildly profitable companies, my friends \non the other side of the aisle are suggesting we throw caution and \nsafety to the wind--and continue to dole out these subsidies. They want \nto make cuts to job training programs, Pell grants, and cancer \nresearch. They have proposed converting Medicare into a voucher \nprogram, which would end the longstanding guarantee that our seniors \nwill have access to health care when they need it. It would end \nMedicare as we know it. But when we talk about touching one penny of \nbig oil's subsidies, they say: It is off the table.\n  I believe Americans come together in tough times and make sacrifices. \nWe are all not going to get everything we want, and that includes Big \nOil executives. At a time when almost 14 million Americans are \nunemployed, at a time when job training and other assistance programs \nare being cut, it is unconscionable for companies making record profits \nto refuse to do their part. It is unconscionable for them to refuse to \ngive up even one penny of subsidies that they frankly do not need.\n  I urge my colleagues to get serious about the deficit, to support the \nMenendez bill, and to end these wasteful handouts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are discussing a bill to raise \ntaxes. That is what it is. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, S. 940 will raise taxes by $21 billion over 10 years. And \nwhat provoked this bill to raise taxes? This time it is high gas \nprices.\n  I wish could say I am surprised, but since Democrats took control of \nthis Chamber, and since President Obama was elected, this seems to be a \nrecurring theme. No matter the question, the answer always seems to be: \nRaise taxes. There is rarely any consideration of how this impacts the \neconomy, how it impacts businesses and families who have to shoulder \nthis load.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle too often look at \nworking men and women as an endless source of cash that Washington can \nrely on for more governmental programs. The Democratic Party's emblem \nis a donkey. Sometimes I think they would be better off transitioning \nto a one-trick pony.\n  The Democratic bill we will be voting on later today is called the \nClose Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. That is certainly one message-tested \nname. ``Big oil''--check. ``Tax loopholes''--check. Again, never \nunderestimate the left's ability to underestimate the American people. \nThey think that because American citizens are angry at high gas prices, \nthey are going to run off the cliff and support a measure just because \nit mentions ``big oil'' and ``tax loopholes.''\n  I can tell you that the people of Utah are not going to support this \nbill, and the American people will not either.\n  The American people want and they need energy solutions. According to \na USA Today/Gallup poll, 7 out of 10 Americans say that gas prices are \ncausing financial hardship. FedEx and UPS have increased fuel \nsurcharges from 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent. By the time 2011 ends, \nexpect restaurant prices to be 3 percent or 4 percent higher, according \nto the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  The issue of high gas prices is much greater than the price at the \npump. The Joint Economic Committee concluded that the weak U.S. dollar \nhas added 56 cents to every gallon of gas. This is a drag on a fragile \neconomic recovery. It inflates the prices of everything from groceries \nto school supplies. Just recently, we found out that one in seven \nAmericans is on food stamps--one in seven. One writer has dubbed this \nthe ``Food Stamp Recovery.'' And this weak recovery is made weaker by \nhigher gas prices.\n  And to deal with this? Democrats decide that rather than promote a \nsensible energy policy, it is better to score a few cheap political \npoints at the expense of the politically unpopular oil companies. \nAmericans are rightly upset about the cost of gasoline. But the \nsolution to higher gas prices is not to raise taxes. Raising taxes on \ndomestic energy producers might be a good thing for Hugo Chavez, but it \ndoes nothing to lift the burden of increasing gas prices that are \nafflicting the American economy and working families. Under this bill, \nHugo Chavez's Citgo would receive a tax incentive while U.S. companies \nsuch as Exxon and Chevron would not. I was amazed to see the advocates \nof this legislation admit as much during a hearing on this matter last \nweek in the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an extra 5 \nminutes for my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. One after one, my Democratic colleagues acknowledged the \nobvious. The policies they were proposing--higher taxes on oil \ncompanies--had absolutely nothing to do with energy policy or sound tax \npolicy and everything to do with generating more revenue for more \ngovernment spending. They acknowledged that this legislation would do \nnothing--I repeat, nothing--to lower the price of gas at the pump. Not \na thing. They acknowledged that.\n  I can see now why Senator Landrieu of Louisiana and Senator Begich of \nAlaska called this tax increase proposal a ``gimmick'' and \n``laughable.'' These are two Democrats who have been honest about what \nis going on here. Raising taxes will do nothing to lower the cost of \nfuel. And for what it is worth, this bill will not help pay down the \ndeficit either. Nothing in this bill mandates that these new revenues \nwould be dedicated to deficit reduction. In fact, any net revenue \nincrease in this bill would be set aside and added to what we call \nsavings on OMB's pay-go scorecard, revenue that can be used to pay for \nfuture legislation. We all know that when we increase taxes, our \ncolleagues on the other side are going to spend every dime of it. That \nhas been a matter of fact.\n  So let's be clear about what is going on here. Democrats want to \nincrease taxes to pay for more government spending. They have been \nrefreshingly open about their intentions. One of my colleagues stated \nthat this bill will allow us to spend money on cops and kids. Another \nsaid it will ``raise a significant amount of additional revenue for \nimportant projects in the United States of America.'' But the choice \nhere is not lower taxes versus assistance for public safety and \nchildren. If Democrats want to pay down the deficit and have money for \nessential projects, there are plenty of options available besides \nincreasing taxes.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, has led a one-man crusade to \nidentify hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteful and redundant \ngovernment spending and programs. If the entire Democratic caucus spent \neven half the time investigating wasteful government spending as it \ndoes looking through the Internal Revenue Code for ways to increase our \ntaxes, and to malign a business like Big Oil, our fiscal situation \nwould be much better.\n  Make no mistake that this bill is a tax increase on American jobs. \nUnder this proposal, there is a disincentive for domestic energy \nproducers to invest in the United States. Under this proposal, American \ncorporations will be at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign \ncounterparts. Under this proposal, a lot of our oil companies--\nespecially the larger ones--are going to find it a lot better for them \nto work offshore, overseas, away from America, to find oil, which is \nwhat they are doing anyway, without all of the tragic tax increases \nthat come their way in our country.\n  Sometimes we talk ephemerally about the impact of tax increases on \nthe economy. In practice, this bill is a direct assault on American \njobs. And for what? It does not do anything to bring down the cost of \nenergy. Nothing. Nada. It does not do anything to bring down the \ndeficit. Not a thing. But what it does manage to do is gloss over the \nObama administration's lack of an energy policy--or should I say war on \nenergy?\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\n  The angry truth is, this administration abetted by Democrats has an \nenergy policy designed to increase costs at the same time that it \npurports to stand shoulder to shoulder with working families who cannot \nmake ends meet because of these increased energy costs.\n  This is the President's Energy Secretary, Steven Chu--the current \nEnergy Secretary:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels of Europe.\n\n  That is astounding to me. Some of those levels are approaching $10 a \ngallon.\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  The administration is talking out of both sides of its mouth. At the \nsame time that it feigns sympathy for the families hit hardest by \nrising energy prices, it attempts to impose a radical environmental \nagenda on an unwilling middle class. At the same time American families \nmoved to the suburbs so they could have room to grow and play, buying \nminivans and SUVs to accommodate their growing families, the \nenvironmental left is pushing its agenda of urban living, public \ntransportation and, yes, small families.\n  For all of its righteous anger about high gas prices, it is clear \nfrom its policies where the administration stands in this fight.\n  As a Senator who has worked hard to establish a strong energy \nfoundation for America, I have watched with dismay as President Obama \nhas done everything in his power to tear that foundation up, \naggressively stop domestic energy production, and leave our Nation \nvulnerable to our foreign competitors who are smart enough to develop \ntheir own energy resources.\n  Since taking office, President Obama has cut new energy leases by \nmore than 60 percent in this country and by more than 80 percent in my \nhome State of Utah. We have a lot of oil there. It is just a matter of \ngetting the permits to be able to drill for it or to develop it in the \ncase of tar sands and oil shale. Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming have an \nestimated 1.6 trillion barrels of recoverable oil through oil shale and \ntar sands.\n  We are all aware of the President's efforts to forestall domestic \nenergy development offshore, but less media attention has been given to \nits successful efforts to move the industry off our Federal lands in \nthe Intermountain West.\n  The Department of the Interior oversees more than 42 percent of the \nState of Utah, including much of the land where domestic energy \nproduction is pursued. One of the early moves of the Secretary of the \nInterior, Ken Salazar, my colleague and dear friend, was his \ncontroversial withdrawal of energy leases that had already been \nauctioned off and paid for by energy developers after years of jumping \nthrough environmental hoops--years; some estimate about 7 years, maybe \nlonger, of jumping through environmental hoops. Then, just by a stroke \nof a pen, they withdrew 77 leases that had been paid for.\n  This is a terrible signal to our domestic energy producers, and \ncompanies are now leaving our Federal lands in droves seeking a less \nhostile regulatory environment on private, State, and foreign-owned \nlands. Get that ``foreign-owned'' lands part. They are finding it is \neasier. They do not have all of the rigmarole and the redtape to go \nthrough to develop oil on lands overseas.\n  A recent survey showed, in the absence of national constraints, \nenergy companies would be investing an additional $2.8 billion in the \nRockies if they did not have all of these constraints and all of this \nrigmarole to go through.\n  S. 940 is terrible policy. In a long line of terrible policies, it is \nlousy energy policy, and it is lousy tax policy. Increasing taxes on \nAmerican production will only stifle our economy. If Democrats want to \nhave a conversation about tax policy and tax reform, we are ready to \nhave that conversation. But do not single out, through selective \ntaxation, one industry to take away these particular tax benefits that \nhave been useful in helping us develop our oil domestically.\n  We should not be exercising our power to tax in a punitive way that \nsingles out particular unpopular industries or just particular \nindustries. Fortunately, I do not think the American people are going \nto buy this latest installment of ``let's raise some taxes.'' They \nalways leave out the latter part, ``so we can spend more,'' and claim \nthat ``we are doing more for the people'' when, in fact, they are \nspending us right into bankruptcy.\n  This bill we are debating today will not do anything to address high \ngas prices. As Democratic supporters have acknowledged, there is \nnothing to help us with lower prices at the pump. It will not do a \nthing. But what it will do is raise revenue for the Federal Government \nto spend.\n  Yet, again, the party of big government has proposed additional taxes \nto fund that big government. You see, the deficit is not the Democrats' \nproblem. No. For the Democrats, the deficit is always somebody else's \nproblem. It is the fault of business or individual citizens for not \ndoing their ``fair share'' or accepting their ``shared responsibility'' \nto fund this government. These are new terms that are being used now.\n  The American people deserve better than this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the motion to proceed to S. 940 and to \nsupport the motion to proceed to S. 953 when we take it up tomorrow.\n  I know a little bit about oil and a little bit about developing oil. \nI know one thing. We have lots of oil in our country if we will just \ngive the permits and allow the development of that oil. It does not \ntake any brains to realize we have all kinds of oil offshore.\n  So for the President to go down to Brazil, give them a $2 billion \nsubsidy to develop their oil offshore, and then compliment them for \nhaving done so, with rigs that probably were in the Gulf of Mexico \nbefore, basically, it was shut down, and then say we will buy their oil \nfrom them, I mean, it is laughable, absolutely laughable--and not \ndevelop our oil in this country.\n  We know there is all kinds of oil in Alaska. We know there is all \nkinds of oil in ANWR. If one were to go to ANWR, one would be shocked \nat how barren the place is. Yet to hear the environmentalists talk, one \nwould think it was the most beautiful, lush part of the planet. The \nfact is, we can develop oil there without ruining ANWR and help our \ncountry in the process, save the taxpayers an awful lot of money, keep \nour country strong, and make us not dependent on Big Oil or anybody \nelse.\n  Would it not be wonderful if we could just have some good free market \nprinciples and allow our people to find our own energy in our country? \nA lot of people did not realize, until it came out last week, that the \nUnited States is the third largest energy producer in the world.\n  Now, we are the largest user by far, but there is a reason for that. \nWe have been the most important country, with the greatest economy, \nhelping people all over the world with our tax dollars.\n  I hope we vote down this bill today and vote up the one tomorrow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, American consumers are hurting. \nUnemployment remains stubbornly high at 9 percent. And, energy costs \nare escalating, and increasing the cost of many other goods and \nservices, such as groceries, clothing and other household necessities.\n  During the 2-week Senate recess in April, I met with Iowans at \nmeetings in 33 of Iowa's counties. One issue that came up at every \nsingle meeting was the high cost of gasoline at the pump. Iowa is a \nState that depends heavily on energy. Our rural families commute many \nmiles to go to work, take kids to school, and do their household \nshopping.\n  During the spring planting season, farmers use hundreds of gallons of \ndiesel fuel and gasoline in their trucks and tractors as they work to \nget the crops in the ground. Iowa's manufacturers are also heavily \ndependent on energy.\n  Prices at the pump are near $4 a gallon. All of our constituents are \ncrying out for action to lower these prices. So, it makes sense that \nCongress would consider steps to address the rising energy costs and \nwork to drive down the costs to consumers at the pump.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what the bill before us would do. This \nbill would not drive down the cost at the pump at all, and it would \nvery likely lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\n  The bill before us would increase taxes for the five largest domestic \noil producers. It won't lead to the production of any more oil and gas. \nIt won't create a single job. It very well could lead to less domestic \nenergy production and less employment in the U.S. energy sector.\n  At a time of $4 gas and 9 percent unemployment, why would the other \nside push a bill that will increase the cost of energy production, \nreduce domestic energy supply, and lead to job losses? The fact is, \nthis bill is not about reducing prices at the pump. The bill before us \nis not about reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It is about \nraising taxes. And one thing is for certain, if you raise taxes on an \nactivity, you get less of it.\n  What this Congress should be doing is increasing the domestic \nproduction of energy as a way to increase jobs, increase domestic \ninvestment, and lower prices at the pump. This bill does none of those \nthings, and actually does quite the opposite.\n  That is why I will oppose this tax hike bill, and support Senator \nMcConnell's alternative bill that will enact measures that will lead to \nthe development and production of domestic oil and gas. We can lower \ngas prices through increased supply. We can lower our dependence on \nforeign oil by opening up and providing permits for the development of \nresources that God gave us here in our country. It makes no sense to \nclose off vast areas of resources here in the United States, only to go \nhat-in-hand to dictators and oil Sheiks in Venezuela, Libya or Persian \nGulf countries.\n  In closing, I would like to mention that a number of my colleagues \nhave argued against the tax hikes on domestic energy producers as an \nunfair attack on just a handful of companies. I noticed with amusement \nthat the President of the Petrochemical and Refiners Association \nreleased a statement on this bill that, ``Imposing what would amount to \na multibillion-dollar energy tax would be bad for American consumers, \nfor the American economy and for America's national security. It would \nhurt American companies producing energy and fuels in our own country \nand give foreign competitors an unfair advantage, endangering American \njobs and making America more reliant on foreign energy.'' Yet this same \nperson, along with many supporters of the oil industry, hypocritically \nbelieves targeting biofuel tax incentives is just fine.\n  Singling out and targeting domestic biofuels, a critical piece of our \nenergy supply, will do nothing to reduce prices at the pump. It will do \njust the opposite. And, it will cost jobs and increase our dependence \non foreign oil. I only hope that the Senators who believe it is unfair \nto target the oil industry with punitive tax hikes will also recognize \nthat the same is true when they suggest targeting domestic biofuels \nproduction.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nClose Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, of which I am an original cosponsor, \nand in strong opposition of the Offshore Production and Safety Act.\n  I support the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act because it would repeal \nunnecessary subsidies and incentives to oil companies that will cost \ntaxpayers $21 billion over the next 10 years. That $21 billion must be \nmade up through taxes in other areas, such as individual income taxes.\n  These tax incentives for big oil, unfortunately, go toward corporate \nsalaries and profits--they do not lead to lower gas prices for American \nconsumers.\n  And I oppose the poorly named Offshore Production and Safety Act.\n  Instead of implementing the recommendations of The National \nCommission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, \nthis legislation attempts to irresponsibly increase production by \nshortcircuiting safety and environmental reviews, rigging the courts in \nfavor of the oil companies, and forcing oil leasing in offshore areas \nwithout further review.\n  The Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, introduced by Senator Menendez, \nwas written to end unnecessary and expensive tax subsidies. Is does so \nin the following ways:\n  It modifies the foreign tax credit that allows major oil companies to \ndeduct royalty payments dollar-for-dollar from their U.S. tax bill.\n  It limits the ability of oil companies to claim the domestic \nmanufacturing tax deduction. This deduction was created in 2004 to \nassist exporting manufacturers, not to subsidize oil companies.\n  It limits the deduction for intangible drilling and development \ncosts.\n  It limits the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells: \nFirms will no longer be able to calculate this deduction using the \npercentage depletion calculation method, under which they often take \nclaims that exceed the capital that was actually invested.\n  It limits the deduction for tertiary injectants, which are fluids and \ngases that oil companies pump underground to drive more oil from an \nexisting well, sometimes with negative environmental repercussions.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision I introduced in February to \nrepeal Outer Continental Shelf deep water royalty relief provisions \nincluded in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  These 2005 provisions created a financial incentive for oil companies \nto drill in the deepest parts of the ocean, where the environmental and \ntechnical risks are greatest.\n  If we learn anything from the BP oilspill, it is that we should not \nbe encouraging oil drilling in ocean waters so deep that it is beyond \nour technical capacity to address a spill. Yet that is exactly what the \nlaw does today.\n  Last week, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, CEOs of the big oil \ncompanies argued that they deserve to continue receiving these \nsubsidies.\n  ConocoPhillips's James Mulva went as far as to argue that raising \ntaxes on an industry that can afford to pay those taxes in order to \nhelp those who cannot is ``un-American.'' He argued it would lead to a \nparade of horribles: lost jobs, higher gas prices and less investment.\n  I could not disagree more strongly. Gas is at $4 a gallon, oil is \nabout $100 a barrel and oil company profits are at near-record levels. \nTheir claims are unfounded and absurd.\n  Let me start with investment. In 2005, with oil nearing $60 a barrel, \nMr. Mulva and other top executives testified that the companies did not \nneed tax breaks to continue oil exploration efforts. But Congress left \nthem in place. How can a drilling incentive unnecessary at $60 a barrel \nbecome essential at $100 per barrel?\n  Big Oil claims about gas prices are also unfounded. A recent analysis \nby the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that \neliminating the tax benefits would have virtually no effect on the \nprice of gasoline.\n  A report from the Joint Economic Committee came to the same \nconclusion, stating:\n\n       In reality, most of the so-called incentives have no impact \n     on near-term production decisions, and thus repealing them \n     would have no effect on consumer energy prices in the \n     immediate future. Even in the longer term, the current \n     proposed changes to these tax provisions would have little \n     impact on global production and a negligible effect on \n     consumer energy prices.\n\n  The CRS report also addressed another industry claim: that ending tax \nbreaks just for oil companies would be discriminatory.\n  Most of those tax breaks--such as the deductions for well depletion \nand intangible drilling costs--are unique to the industry. The only \nexception is a deduction for domestic production, designed to encourage \nmanufacturing companies to build factories here and export their goods.\n  But as CRS pointed out, there will be no cessation of drilling on \nAmerican territory as long as the oil and profits exist. Therefore, \nthis is a huge cost to taxpayers with zero effect.\n  Even the effect on industry profits--the Big Five earned a robust $35 \nbillion in the first quarter of this year alone--would be trivial, \naccording to CRS.\n  But this is simple arithmetic. The bill before us would repeal \napproximately $2 billion in subsidies annually, from five firms that \nmade $35 billion in profit in a single quarter earlier this year. This \nrepresents a scant 1 to 2 percent of their annual profit!\n  Bottom line: these subsidies are unnecessary, and returning $21 \nbillion over 10 years to the Treasury would be a good thing.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues who share my concern about the \ndeficit to vote yes on this bill.\n  Unfortunately, the minority leader has not chosen to address the \ndeficit in his legislation.\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\n  Instead, he has brought forward the Offshore Production and Safety \nAct.\n  This bill appears to be a solution in search of a problem. It \nattempts to make ``Drill Baby Drill'' a national policy, without \nrespect for the environment or the livelihoods that depend on a healthy \nocean.\n  Its introduction demonstrates that some in this body believe we can \ndrill our way to energy independence, and the only things standing in \nthe way are pesky environmental and safety regulations.\n  Unfortunately, the facts don't back that up:\n  The United States has only 3 percent of global oil reserves, but we \nuse more than 20 percent of supply.\n  Fifty-one new shallow-water permits have been issued since the \nadministration implemented stronger safety standards to ensure that an \noilspill similar to Deepwater Horizon will never happen again.\n  Thirteen deepwater wells have been permitted since February, when the \nindustry finally demonstrated it was capable of containing an undersea \nspill.\n  In 2010, the United States produced more than 2 billion barrels of \noil, the highest level of domestic production since 2003.\n  Oil production has increased every year under President Obama.\n  Despite these facts, we are being asked to consider a bill that would \nfurther reduce safety standards. The Republican bill repeals the 2010 \ndrilling plan that protects southern California's coast from new \ndrilling; establishes a 60-day deadline for the Federal Government to \nreview and grant drilling permits. If that deadline cannot be met, a \npermit would be automatically issued even if the delay is the fault of \nthe applicant. Authorizes leasing in long-protected waters of the north \nand central Atlantic coasts and Alaska, including Bristol Bay, without \nany further review. And overrides the ordinary rules of venue for court \ncases, engaging in preemptive ``forum-shopping'' by directing all court \ncases related to Gulf of Mexico energy production to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the fifth Circuit--even though that circuit doesn't include \nFlorida, the State with the longest coast on the Gulf of Mexico, nor \nAlabama.\n  Finally, the bill sets up all kinds of special rules, appearing to \ntry to ensure that the oil companies cannot lose in the fifth Circuit, \nby requiring challenges to be filed in 60 days, adding additional \nburdens of evidentiary proof, and prohibiting the courts from awarding \nattorneys' fees or other court costs even to the winning parties.\n  That pretty much ensures that the fishermen, shrimpers, and small \nbusinessmen who depend on the gulf for their livelihoods will be unable \nto defend their rights in court.\n  It is as if the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico had never happened.\n  Three-fourths of Americans recently polled by the Wall Street Journal \nsupported ending oil subsidies.\n  Americans recognize that this is a question of fairness.\n  While the oil companies are making huge profits, people are suffering \nand deficits are growing. We have an obligation to ask whether these \ntax giveaways are right, whether they are smart and whether we really \nneed them at all.\n  The answer is no. I encourage my colleagues to join me in fighting to \nend them.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will vote on a \nmotion to proceed to consideration of S. 940, the Close Big Oil Tax \nLoophole Act. I have not decided how I would vote on final passage of \nthe act in its current form. In fact, earlier this year, I voted \nagainst an amendment offered by Senator Levin that contained many \nsimilar proposals, primarily because there were provisions in that \namendment that I felt did not receive the full attention they deserved. \nYet because I believe that the full Senate ought to debate the merits \nof existing tax preferences for our Nation's oil and gas industry, I \nwill vote in favor of this motion to proceed. Additionally, beyond the \nTax Code changes, I strongly support the act's provision repealing the \nOuter Continental Shelf deep water and deep gas royalty relief, and \nthis repeal should also be debated by the full Senate.\n  The act's underlying provisions closely follow provisions that the \nPresident has proposed in the three budget recommendations he has so \nfar presented to the Congress--except that this bill would apply only \nto the so-called Big Five producers. As chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and as chairman of the Senate Finance \nSubcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources and Infrastructure, I have \nhad the opportunity to study and receive testimony on the act's \nunderlying provisions, and I believe there is merit in at least some of \nthese provisions. To reach that conclusion, I have looked at the \nprovisions through three lenses. First, will they increase gasoline \nprices at the pump? Second, will they increase dependence on imported \noil? And third, will they cause job losses in local communities?\n  With respect to the provisions at issue, I believe there are strong \ncases to be made that the answer to all three questions is no. In \nparticular, I highlight the testimony of Dr. Stephen Brown, a \nnonresident fellow at Resources for the Future--who previously was \nchief energy economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas--at a \nhearing I convened in my Finance Subcommittee on September 10, 2009. \nDr. Brown testified that removing these provisions from the Tax Code \n``will have very small effects on U.S. oil and natural gas markets--\nprimarily because the increased tax revenue amounts to less than one \npercent of the total revenue the industry is projected to earn on its \ndomestic production.'' In particular, his testimony noted that \n``eliminating the tax preferences would boost the world oil price by an \naverage of about 6 cents per barrel,'' that ``oil imports would rise by \nan estimated 0.1 percent of U.S. oil consumption,'' and finally that \nsuch changes are ``unlikely to have a significant effect on overall \nU.S. employment.''\n  But while there is a strong case that the answer to all three \nquestions is no, I nevertheless have serious reservations about any tax \npolicy change that focuses exclusively on one industry. Rather, we \nshould consider the tax treatment accorded to all taxpayers engaged in \nextracting domestic natural resources and, in the case of the section \n199 domestic production deduction, all U.S. businesses.\n  I am also troubled that this bill singles out only five firms, merely \nbecause of their large size and integrated nature. To be sure, I do \nbelieve we must be most sensitive to the smallest producers--the Mom \nand Pop businesses that are common in many rural oil and gas producing \ncommunities, including ones in New Mexico's southwest and northeastern \ncorners. But what about large producers who are not integrated?\n  Historically, the Tax Code drew no distinction between independent \nand integrated producers. But over time, Congress has scaled back or \neliminated incentives by distinguishing between independent and \nintegrated firms, and, within the latter category, between major \nintegrated and nonmajor integrated firms. This act would widen the \ndisparate treatment. Yet it is a false distinction to claim that all \nindependent producers are small. For instance, 10 independent firms \nthat had revenues exceeding $7 billion in 2009, with the largest among \nthem having revenues above $15 billion. Given the vast size and \nrevenues of some ``independent'' producers, it is not clear that the \nappropriate dividing line should be found merely at the fact that a \nfirm's revenues derive solely from production at the wellhead. Rather, \nI find it is difficult to justify excepting a firm under the rubric of \nbeing a ``small business'' when its revenues are high enough to qualify \nas a Fortune 500 company. And so if we proceed to debate this bill, I \nfeel strongly that we should consider alternative means of \ndistinguishing firms. For instance, we might do so based on revenue or \nthresholds based on average daily worldwide production above a \ndetermined level.\n  I have long been deeply concerned about our Nation's gaping budget \ndeficit. We should have a serious debate about which tax expenditures \nacross the board we can continue to afford. But the fact that gasoline \nprices are high or that five companies have large profits is not the \nideal basis for considering fundamental changes in tax policy.\n  While I would strongly prefer to have this debate in the context of \neither a broader national energy policy or a broader effort at deficit \nreduction, and\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\nwhile I would prefer a measure that does not single out a small handful \nof companies, I will vote for the motion to proceed to consideration of \nthe act. It is time to have a complete and serious debate over the \nmerits of the provisions at issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, even though I do not agree with \nhim, it is always a pleasure to listen to my friend from Utah give his \narguments. But I will just give mine instead of talking to him. I will \njust remind him of one thing. This bill is not intended to lower gas \nprices; it is intended to reduce the deficit. It clearly does that.\n  If my colleague cared so much about reducing that deficit, the oil \ncompanies are a good place to start. The money does not go for \nspending, it goes for deficit reduction.\n  Anyway, I rise today in support of the legislation authored by my \ngood friend from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez has \nchampioned this legislation for quite some time. I applaud the work he \nhas done to build support for it.\n  As you know, our leader, Senator Reid, has scheduled a vote on it in \njust a few minutes. I sincerely hope the bill will pass. Nothing would \nbe better in terms of showing bipartisanship and giving the American \npeople hope that we can come to a fair agreement on our long-term \nfiscal challenges than to pass this legislation today.\n  In the last election voters gave those of us who serve in this \nChamber two distinct mandates: First and perhaps foremost, they said: \nMake the economy grow. Create good-paying jobs. Make sure that American \ndream which says the odds are higher you will do better 10 years from \nnow than you are doing today, and the odds are higher still your kids \nwill do better than you, that American dream, make sure it burns \nbrightly.\n  Some have wondered if it is beginning to flicker, and their mandate \nto us in this election was get that candle glowing again. But, second, \nthey said do something else at the same time. They said in no uncertain \nterms: Reign in the out-of-control Federal deficit. They told us to \ntake the bull by the horns and confront our mounting debt.\n  On that point, I will agree with my colleague from Utah. Now, it is \nvery hard to accomplish one of these two goals. To accomplish both at \nonce is a Herculean task. There are many choices ahead, most of them \nrather difficult. That is why this is so hard. But one choice is not \ntough at all, not by a mile. It is obvious. At this time of fiscal \nrestraint, when we have to make cuts that are so painful and hurt \nmiddle-class families, to continue to give big oil companies giant tax \nbreaks makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Getting rid of these corporate subsidies to Big Oil is a no-brainer. \nDecades ago, when these breaks were enacted, oil was $17 a barrel. \nMaybe it made a modicum of sense in those days to give companies an \nincentive to explore and produce. But with the price of crude oil \nhovering at $100 a barrel, and Big Oil reaping record profits with \nevery barrel they drill, it defies logic to spend billions of taxpayer \ndollars on these subsidies.\n  Believe me, the free market gives the oil companies enough of an \nincentive to produce. When oil is $100 a barrel, they certainly do not \nneed a financial nudge from Washington. Now, at the same time, middle-\nclass Americans get hit with a double whammy. They are paying $70 or \nmore to fill that gas tank. Then, in addition, when they pay their \ntaxes, some of those hard-earned tax dollars are being used to line Big \nOil's pocket with these subsidies.\n  In my home State of New York, the price of gas is up 35 percent on \naverage compared to this time last year. Economists estimate the \ntypical family will pay as much as $1,000 more on gas this year than \nlast--$1,000 a year. The average family makes about $50,000. It is so \nhard they sit around the dinner table after Friday night supper, mom \nand dad. They sit down and figure out: How are we going to pay these \nbills? How are we going to give our kids the life that we want to give \nthem? And they are paying $1,000 more for gasoline. At the same time we \nare subsidizing oil companies.\n  Families across the country are still struggling to make ends meet as \nthe economy slowly recovers. With billions of dollars' worth of tax \nsubsidies and gas prices at record highs, it is no wonder the top five \noil companies just announced jaw-dropping profits. These companies are \nnot only among the most profitable businesses in the United States, \nthey are among the most profitable in the whole world.\n  In the first quarter of this year alone, the big five brought in $35 \nbillion in profit. In the past decade, they took home nearly $1 \ntrillion--that is trillion with a ``t.''\n  There is nothing wrong with these profits in and of themselves; in \nAmerica we celebrate success; we want the private sector to thrive. But \nat a time when the government is looking to tighten its belt and we are \ngrappling with painful cuts, both because we have the dual goal of \ngrowing the middle class and also reducing the deficit, it boggles the \nmind that we continue to subsidize such a lavishly profitable industry.\n  Moreover, as my great friend and colleague, Senator McCaskill, \nhighlighted this morning in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, \nthose record profits smell a bit fishy. There is a reason to suspect \nthat some of the biggest oil refiners are artificially depressing \nsupply in order to raise prices to pad their bottom lines.\n  I am proud to have cosigned Senator McCaskill's letter, as did the \nentire Democratic leadership team. I look forward to the FTC's \nresponse. I am also proud to cosponsor the Menendez bill we are \nconsidering today, Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. The legislation \nwill put an end to the taxpayer handouts to the five largest integrated \noil companies and use the $21 billion in savings to reduce the \ndeficit. This $21 billion is an excellent downpayment on our effort to \nget the Nation's fiscal house in order.\n\n  The bill repeals a host of Byzantine tax provisions that only a \nlobbyist could love, such as the deduction for tertiary injectants and \nthe deduction for intangible extraction costs. Small- and medium-sized \noil firms are exempt. The legislation, even though some might like to \ngo further, deals with the big five--ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, \nConocoPhillips, and BP.\n  I have heard pundits from the hard right parrot Big Oil's talking \npoint that repealing these giveaways would increase gas prices for \nconsumers. The facts beg to differ. Last week, two major independent \nstudies--one from the Congressional Research Service and another from \nthe Joint Economic Committee--found that ending these absurd subsidies \nwould not impact the price of gas. I compliment Senator Casey for his \nleadership on the second study.\n  In what was perhaps an inadvertent moment of candor at last week's \nFinance Committee hearing, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said:\n\n       Gasoline prices are a function of crude oil prices, which \n     are set in the marketplace by global supply and demand, not \n     by companies such as ours.\n\n  When he made that comment, Tillerson of ExxonMobil conceded that \nrepealing taxpayer-funded subsidies for Big Oil will not increase \nprices. Prices are set, as he says, by global supply and demand.\n  That is not to say repealing subsidies will necessarily bring down \nprices. We are not making that claim. All along we have been clear: The \npurpose of this bill is to make a dent in the deficit by repealing tax \nbreaks for the five companies that are the least in need of help from \nUncle Sam.\n  Lowering the cost of gas and ridding our country of its dependence on \nforeign oil requires a long-term, comprehensive approach. In the months \nahead, I expect the Democratic caucus will unveil a thorough and \nforward thinking plan to do just that.\n  In the meantime, I say to every one of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle: If they are serious about deficit reduction, the \nMenendez bill is their chance to show it now. There is no good reason \nnot to support this sensible legislation sponsored by my friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey.\n  Just try to wrap your head around it: Big Oil is reporting record \nprofits, gas prices are near an all-time high, and we, the American \ntaxpayers, are subsidizing the oil industry to the tune of $4 billion a \nyear. One needs the imagination of ``Alice in Wonderland'' 's Lewis \nCarroll to come up with a more ridiculous scenario.\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n  The bottom line is this: At a time of sky-high prices, it is \nunfathomable to continue to pad the profits of companies with taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies. The time to repeal these giveaways is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the energy \ntax bill that would eliminate so-called tax preferences for some oil \ncompanies. Actually, I agree with part of the bill--the part that says \nseveral companies will not be exempted because we want to continue to \nencourage them to do what we want to continue to encourage the industry \nto do. The rationale that the people who are the largest suppliers do \nnot need to be encouraged also does not make good sense to me.\n  My good friend Senator Schumer, who is actually chairman of the Rules \nCommittee on which I serve, said this bill is not intended to lower gas \nprices. Actually, I suggest we should have a bill on the floor that is \nintended to lower gas prices. Gas prices are costing jobs. Jobs cost \nrevenue. We generate a lot more tax revenue if we encourage private \nsector job creation that will solve a problem here by I think he said \n$4 billion a year. That is how much money we borrowed today; $4 billion \nis how much money we borrowed today. And we are looking at this as \nopposed to looking at the real problem we face.\n  This bill is brought up to make it even harder to create American \nenergy jobs. If there are any jobs you almost certainly will create, it \nis producing more American energy. I looked at the numbers. We use \nabout as much electricity in a bad economy as we do in a good economy. \nWe use about as much gasoline in a bad economy as we do in a good \neconomy. We ought to be producing every bit we can with American jobs. \nBut instead, we have had a moratorium on drilling in the gulf. We have \nhad the suspension of drilling leases that were issued in 2008. Some of \nthe first acts of this administration were to eliminate those. We now \ntalk about new taxes on energy companies, as if that is going to solve \nthe problem.\n  The administration recently announced it would encourage the sale of \noffshore leases. Why is that? I think it is because the administration \nhas finally decided that the economy does not benefit from policies \nthat increase energy prices. This is in stark contrast to what we are \ntalking about today.\n  The administration has had a hard time actually issuing the permits \nto make leases worthwhile. There is lots of complaining about the fact \nthere are leases out there not being used. Surprise, surprise. The \nleases to be used have to have a permit, and the permitting process has \nnever been more difficult than it is right now. In fact, some of the \nreasons are the actions of the EPA.\n  Shell Oil, being talked about today in another way, recently canceled \nits 2011 exploration plans in the Beaufort Sea in Alaska because EPA \nwould not grant them the necessary Clean Air permits. There was nothing \ndifferent about how they were going to extract this oil in the Beaufort \nSea now than there was when the exploration permits were issued and \nbillions of dollars were spent to pursue the oil in the Beaufort Sea, \nand then suddenly the EPA says: Oh, no, we are not going to give you \nthe permit it takes to get that oil out of the sea so American \ncustomers, American consumers will not benefit from it.\n  Both the Senate majority, as well as the administration, have not \nbeen willing to address this energy crisis in a way that solves the \nproblems. The tax increases will not reduce and will almost certainly \nincrease gasoline prices. If these companies are anywhere nearly as bad \nas the people on this floor say they are, why wouldn't they pass this \nalong? In fact, why wouldn't they pass it along if they were just any \nAmerican company? People pay taxes; companies do not pay taxes. Way too \nmany of those taxes are being paid right now at the gas pump as we have \ntax dollars that could go for something else going not to encourage job \ncreation but we see just the opposite happening.\n  The President's policies, as he said clearly when he was running for \nPresident--at least clearly to the San Francisco Chronicle--that under \nhis energy policies, energy costs would necessarily skyrocket. Senator \nHatch mentioned earlier Secretary Chu, right before he was chosen \nSecretary--so it is not anything that would have been a surprise to \nanybody--in December of 2008, he said what we need is to get our \ngasoline prices as high as the prices in Europe. Those prices are now \napproaching $10 a gallon.\n  I suppose this bill might have the impact of adding cost at the pump. \nCertainly, nobody suggests it has the impact of reducing cost at the \npump. I would think that the President and the Secretary of Energy and \nothers will begin to realize that where we need to be focused is not on \nmaking it less likely that we will produce American energy but making \nit more likely we will produce American energy.\n  These incentives are to produce energy here as opposed to somewhere \nelse. One of the incentives is a fraction of the manufacturing \nincentive that we try to give every manufacturer. These companies have \nresources around the world, as they should, and what we do is encourage \nthem to go other places to seek those resources. By the way, that means \nthe jobs are in other places, not here.\n  We need to find more American energy of all kinds. In doing that, we \ndo not need to figure out ways to make the current search for American \nenergy more expensive. We need to be focused on gas and oil, natural \ngas and coal, nuclear and solar, wind energy and biomass. If I left \nanything out, it is not because I intended to. We need to be looking \neverywhere we can for more American energy. This makes it more \ndifficult.\n  Our policy should be to find more, to use less, to look for ways to \nconserve the energy we have, whether it is better insulation in windows \nor cars that eventually run on something that is some combination of \ngas and battery powered or no gas at all and electricity. All that is \nfine, but most of that is not going to make any difference for quite a \nwhile. Twenty years from now, most cars are still going to be running \non gasoline. And 20 years from now, we are still going to need more \nU.S. oil and more U.S. refined gas. We need to be less dependent, not \nmore dependent. The money we spend should be to invest in the future \nand figure out what comes next and what is the best thing to do for the \nfuture.\n  We need to be focused on jobs and on spending, and this bill is not \nfocused on the targets we ought to be focused on today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, once again I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to support the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. To be \nhonest, I am disappointed this bill is facing so much opposition. All \nacross the country, people are talking about ways to rein in the debt \nand deficit. In Washington, DC, we are having a vigorous debate about \nthe best ways to do that.\n  I happen to think we should cut spending responsibly while continuing \nto make investments we need to grow the economy and create jobs for our \nmiddle-class workers. There are difficult issues we have to work \nthrough, but the bill before us should be an easy one. It says that the \nbiggest oil companies in the country should not be getting subsidies \nfrom American taxpayers. It says that the $2 billion a year we send to \nthese hugely profitable companies should be used instead to pay down \nthe deficit.\n  I do not understand why this seems to be so controversial. The big \noil companies are already making billions of dollars in profits from \nfamilies across the country who are paying sky-high prices at the pump. \nIn fact, the five biggest oil companies have made nearly $1 trillion in \nprofits in the last decade and $36 billion in the first 3 months of \nthis year alone.\n  It is not enough they are making money hand over fist from families \nwho are now paying sky-high prices. They then come before Congress and \nmake the outlandish claim that they need to be subsidized by taxpayers \nas well. It does not make any sense, and it has to end.\n  Budgets are more than numbers on a page. They are about our \npriorities and our values as a nation. I think before we cut spending \nin areas that will impact our middle-class families and the\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nmost vulnerable among us, we should focus right now on cutting out \nwasteful subsidies to huge companies that do not need it. That is what \nthis bill does.\n  I also want to talk about the high prices families are paying for gas \nin my home State and across the country. I was recently at home with \nSenator Cantwell, and we had the opportunity to meet with some local \nsmall business owners who talked about the impact these skyrocketing \nprices of oil and gas were having on their businesses. They are \nhurting. These small business owners are already struggling to keep \ntheir doors open in these tough economic times. Every time prices go up \nat the pump, they are pushed one step closer to the edge.\n  That is why I believe as a country we need to move away from our \ndependence on foreign oil and toward a more secure clean energy future. \nIt is why I called for a crackdown on the speculation that is part of \nwhat pushes up gas prices and why I was so disappointed that the House \nRepublican budget slashed funding for the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. That is the very agency that is charged with protecting \nconsumers from the excessive speculation in the markets.\n  I think that gets to a big difference between our two parties today. \nDemocrats are here fighting to rein in the deficit by ending the \nwasteful subsidies that the biggest oil companies are getting from the \nAmerican taxpayer; Republicans are fighting to cripple the agency that \nis charged with protecting middle-class families from being ripped off \nand preyed upon. These are two additional approaches to tackling the \ndeficit. I am going to keep fighting to make sure middle-class families \nare protected.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this legislation that will put \ntaxpayers and the middle class ahead of Big Oil. It will end the \nwasteful giveaways to oil companies and use that money to pay down the \ndeficit in a responsible way. So I, too, wish to thank Senators \nMenendez, McCaskill, Tester, and Brown for their great work on this \nissue, and I hope we can finally put this to rest and save taxpayers \n$21 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the American people understand this \nbill. They understand that if working families must sacrifice to help \nlower the deficit, then so should the most wealthy and powerful \nindustry in the country. If Big Oil wants to lower gasoline prices, \nthey would put a lot less money in their stock buybacks or their \nmultimillion dollar CEO salaries and a lot more in producing oil or \nthey could use some of their enormous profits to lower prices. But I \nguess in that world greed is good.\n  While the American people understand this bill--it is clear for them \nwhat it does--many on the other side of the aisle simply do not. \nBecause this is such a simple, commonsense idea, they have made up \narguments just to get through this debate.\n  One of my colleagues said it would raise the deficit. Only in \nWashington--only in Washington--could that comment actually be made \nwhen the Joint Tax Committee has clearly made it known this would lower \nthe deficit by $21 billion. It would lower the deficit by $21 billion, \nnot raise it.\n  Another argument I have heard is that this bill will somehow raise \ngas prices. That argument is absurd. With the big five oil companies \npoised to make $144 billion in profits this year alone, it means Big \nOil would simply have to settle for $142 billion in profits this year \nto pay their fair share of dealing with the deficit, and they wouldn't \nhave to raise gas prices 1 cent. That is what the Congressional \nResearch Service independently decided, as well as the Joint Tax \nCommittee.\n  I have also heard the argument Big Oil actually pays more taxes than \nother companies. That is not true for multiple reasons. ExxonMobil's \neffective tax rate is actually lower than the average American family's \nrate. They pay far higher taxes abroad than they do here, so there is \nno competitive disadvantage, and we have the lowest royalty rates in \nthe world.\n  We have rarely seen in this body a more stark contrast and a more \nobvious choice. American families are sitting around the kitchen table \ntrying to figure out how to make ends meet within the constraints of \ntheir own family budgets. We are simply asking Big Oil--making $144 \nbillion--to do their fair share. That is what this vote is all about.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, several years ago we faced a confirmation \ncrisis in the Senate. The majority at the time, the Republicans, were \nfrustrated with the inefficient way the Senate was performing our \nconstitutional duty of confirming Presidential nominees.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle passionately \nargued that all judicial nominees deserve an up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor. In their frustration, they threatened to dramatically \nchange the purpose of the Senate and the minority protections for which \nit was designed. That would have, in a manner of speaking, blown up the \ninstitution. That is why it was known as the nuclear option.\n  In the heat of this battle, several courageous Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans, agreed to a standard that would preserve the \ntraditions of this great body, the Senate. They ensured the Senate \ncould still provide the President its advice and consent, as the \nConstitution requires.\n  The agreement was significant but very simple. It was this: Except in \nextraordinary circumstances, those nominated to be Federal judges would \nget an up-or-down vote. The minority would not stand in the way of that \nvote. The agreement was grounded in common sense.\n  So far, in most cases, both sides have generally upheld that \nagreement. The nomination about to be before us, however, is not one of \nthose cases, and that is the nomination of Goodwin Liu.\n  Goodwin Liu is an extremely well-qualified public servant and an \nimpressive legal scholar. He was a Rhodes Scholar and clerked in the \nU.S. Supreme Court, which is something just a small percentage of \ngraduates from law school have the opportunity to ever do; that is, to \nbe a Supreme Court clerk. Goodwin Liu served as an associate dean at \nthe California Berkeley School of Law and is still a professor there. \nHe has done a significant amount of pro\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nbono work. He even helped launch AmeriCorps. On top of that, he has \nlived the American dream. He is a highly successful son of immigrants.\n  I think President Obama was wise to appoint him to the Ninth Circuit. \nSo do a lot of Democrats and so do a lot of Republicans.\n  Ken Starr--infamous as far as the Democrats go, the former White \nHouse special prosecutor--called Liu, who served in the Clinton \nadministration, ``a person of great intellect, accomplishment, and \nintegrity.''\n  Former Republican Congressman Bob Barr, an extremely conservative \nformer Federal prosecutor, also reviewed Liu's writings. He came away \nimpressed with, as he said, ``his commitment to the Constitution and to \na fair criminal justice system.''\n  One of President Bush's former White House lawyers said Liu's views \n``fall well within the legal mainstream.''\n  I could go on with more quotes from lawyers and legislators from the \nright and left and Independents, but we get the picture. Right, left, \ncenter--they think very highly of this good man.\n  Everyone agrees Goodwin Liu's nomination is far from the \n``extraordinary circumstance'' that would warrant a filibuster. The \nonly extraordinary things about Liu are his experience, his \naccomplishments, and his integrity.\n  He should be confirmed. At the very least, he should undoubtedly \ndeserve an up-or-down vote.\n  But Senate Republicans have already forgotten the lessons of the \nnuclear option. Today they are threatening to block this highly \nqualified nominee from confirmation. Vacancies on the Federal bench \ndelay justice for citizens seeking the help of our judicial system, and \nit isn't fair to leave in limbo well-qualified nominees.\n  So I am forced now to file cloture in order to ensure Goodwin Liu \ngets the vote he deserves. It is regrettable it has come to this.\n  As I file cloture, I remind my Republican colleagues once again that \npublic servants are not political pawns. Goodwin Liu has dedicated his \nlife to justice and fairness. As we consider his nomination, we owe \nsomeone of his caliber those same considerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3040-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF GOODWIN LIU TO BE A U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH \n                                CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, yesterday the White House announced \nit will not submit three pending free-trade agreements, FTAs, with \nSouth Korea, Colombia, and Panama until Congress reaches a deal on \nreauthorizing the trade adjustment assistance for workers programs, the \nso-called TAA. I applaud President Obama for putting the workers first \nbefore we do these trade agreements.\n  The trade agreements are very controversial, as they always are. The \npromises are always that they will create jobs, and they rarely do. \nThey usually result in a decrease in jobs. Yet too often Congress \njettisons the safety net to protect those workers who lose their jobs \nbecause of these agreements. That is why I applaud President Obama for \nmaking this one clear. He will not send these trade agreements to \nCongress until Congress has sent to his desk--not talked about it, not \ndebated it, not passed one committee or one House, but sent to his \ndesk--trade adjustment assistance expansion.\n  As my colleagues know, since we let this program expire in February \nbecause of Republican objections, Senator Casey and I went to the floor \nday after day in December and then again in February as Republicans \ncontinued to object just to continuing trade adjustment assistance as \nwe had begun in the Recovery Act 2 years earlier.\n  So what happened? Because of these Republican objections, we shut out \nservice workers and we shut out manufacturing workers who had lost \ntheir jobs to countries with which we do not have a free-trade \nagreement. So when workers lost their jobs because of outsourcing of \njobs to China or India, those workers couldn't get trade adjustment \nassistance until the Recovery Act, so they could get it in 2009 and in \n2010. Because of Republican objections to continuation of that, they \ncan't get it now.\n  Also, people who lost their jobs that were in the service industries \nexperienced this same kind of deadline on their eligibility.\n  Since Congress made reforms to TAA in 2009, more than 185,000 \nadditional trade-affected workers became eligible for training under \nthe TAA for Workers Program.\n  In 2010 alone, more than 227,000 workers participated in the TAA \nprogram, receiving training for jobs that employers are looking to \nfill. These are people who want to work. They lost their jobs because \nof a trade agreement. They can prove they lost their jobs because of a \ntrade agreement. A company shuts down in Elery, OH, and goes to Mexico; \na company shuts down in Steubenville, OH, and goes to New Delhi; a \ncompany shuts down in Lima, OH, and goes to Shanghai. When you can \nprove that, as you can in many cases, those workers should be eligible \nfor assistance from the government to get trained to get back to work.\n  The program also, of course, receives strong support from businesses \nthat know a skilled workforce is critical to their economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  But just 11 days ago--because of these Republican objections and \nbecause the TAA language was truncated--but just 11 days ago, the Labor \nDepartment denied the first three petitions filed by groups of workers \nseeking TAA assistance under pre-2009 TAA rules, including three \nworkers in Uniontown, OH. The reason: They are service workers.\n  In addition, the enhanced health coverage tax credit program also \nexpired in February. HCTC helps trade-affected workers purchase private \nhealth insurance coverage to replace the employer-sponsored coverage \nthey lost. It also helps those retirees who lose their benefits when \nthe company for which they worked goes bankrupt.\n  The HCTC prevents tens of thousands of Americans from falling into \nthe ranks of the uninsured. But right now, if we do not act, we are \nsimply giving these workers the cold shoulder.\n  So I applaud the administration for saying, yesterday, we will pass \nno more\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\nfree trade agreements without a deal on TAA. But this will require my \nRepublican colleagues to come to the table and agree on a package. We \nhave seen what unfair trade deals such as NAFTA and PNTR with China and \nCAFTA do to communities in Ohio and around the Nation. These are \nAmericans who lost their jobs, lost their pensions, lost their health \ncare--maybe all three--when the company they worked for moved \noperations overseas or went to bankruptcy court or faced a reduction in \ndemand for their products due to unfair foreign competition.\n  These Americans need TAA to get back on solid footing. These \nAmericans need Congress to defend against unfair trade and to \nstrengthen trade enforcement. There are several trade enforcement \nmeasures that Senator McCaskill and Senator Wyden and I and others have \nintroduced, and I hope they will garner bipartisan support in this \nChamber.\n  Senator Blunt, Senator McCaskill, and I testified in front of the \nTrade Subcommittee that Senator Wyden chaired the other day and talked \nabout some of these ideas and how to address them bipartisanly.\n  TAA has been a core pillar of U.S. trade policy. It has long enjoyed \nbipartisan support because it helps American workers who lose their \njobs and their financial security as a result of globalization.\n  I thank Senator Casey, Senator Stabenow, Senator Baucus, and Senator \nWyden for their leadership on trade adjustment assistance--language in \ngetting this legislation put forward.\n  Just the fairness of this: Again, put yourself--something we do not \ndo enough here--in the shoes of a worker in Champaign, IL, or Boulder, \nCO, or Mansfield, OH, a worker who shows up for work for 15 years, who \nhas been a productive worker, helped his company make money, was paid a \nmiddle-class, decent wage, and then all of a sudden their plant shuts \ndown because the jobs are outsourced to China. They did not do anything \nwrong. Are we going to do nothing to help them? Are we going to do \nnothing to help their communities?\n  It is pretty clear to me, the overwhelming consensus of the American \npeople say: Give them the opportunity to get training for another job \nif we cannot save their jobs. Give them some assistance on health \ninsurance so they can reach into their pocket, with some assistance \nthrough a significant tax credit, to continue the insurance for their \nfamilies. It will mean many of them will not lose their homes. Far too \nmany people who lose their jobs then lose their health insurance and \nthen lose their homes.\n  We have an opportunity actually to do something about this. So the \nPresident was exactly right. Do not bring these three free trade \nagreements--with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea--to the floor until \nwe have first taken care of the workers who lose their jobs--not at the \nsame time because we know what happens when we try to do that. All of a \nsudden, the assistance for workers gets jettisoned. But it must be done \nfirst to help these workers with their health insurance and with their \nretraining.\n  It will matter for literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions \nof American families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me salute my colleague from \nOhio for bringing up trade adjustment assistance. Because even if you \nare a proponent of expanding trade in the United States, you know the \nebb and flow of the economy is going to take away some jobs in this \ncountry as other suppliers arrive.\n  What the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Oregon, Ron Wyden, \nare trying to achieve is to make sure trade adjustment assistance is \nthere to help these workers make a transition to another job in another \narea that is expanding in our economy. That is the thoughtful thing to \ndo for their lives and the future of our economy. It is also a \nnecessary part of any conversation about the future of trade in the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3041-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3041-S3044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INTERCHANGE FEE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the effect of \ninterchange fee reform on small banks and credit unions.\n  Interchange fees are not well known by most Americans. They are known \nas swipe fees or interchange fees, and they reflect the amount of money \nthat is paid to a bank each time you use that bank's credit or debit \ncard. You do not know it as a consumer that you are being charged extra \nwhen you buy something in a store, but prices are higher because that \nfee is being paid to the bank every time you swipe the card.\n  Who establishes that fee? You would assume the bank does, but it is \nnot so. The fee that is charged every time you swipe a card is \nestablished by the credit card companies. The big giants Visa and \nMasterCard decide exactly how much that fee will be. And you ask \nyourself: Well then, what voice does a merchant or a retailer have in \nhow much that fee is going to be on each transaction?\n  And the answer is virtually no voice. It is a price-fixing mechanism \nwhere Visa and MasterCard, the major credit card companies, establish \nthe interchange or swipe fee to be paid to each bank, credit union, or \nfinancial institution that issues the credit or debit card.\n  It is a lot of money. Each month in America--just on debit cards \nnow--each month in America, they collect about $1.3 billion in \ntransactions where people use debit cards. Now, remember, a debit card \nis like your checking account. You are drawing money directly out of \nyour checking account to pay the merchant where you are doing business. \nIt is not like a credit card where, in fact, they have to collect the \nmoney from you later. This is a situation where the money is taken \ndirectly out of your bank account. You would think, as with the use of \nchecks in the old economy, this would be a low-cost transaction. And it \nshould be.\n  It used to be banks would process checks written to pay a restaurant \nor department store, charging pennies on the transaction--not a \npercentage of the transaction.\n  Well, the Federal Reserve took a look at what is being charged for \ndebit cards, where the money comes right out of your account. It turns \nout the average is about 40 cents a transaction. We asked them: Well, \nwhat is the reasonable amount that should be charged if you are going \nto take into account exactly how much it costs a bank to process a \ndebit card transaction? They said it was closer to 10 or 12 cents.\n\n  So merchants and retailers across America, on every single \ntransaction involving a debit card, are paying an inflated amount of \nswipe fee or interchange fee, and most of those fees go to the largest \nbanks in America. You see, almost 60 percent of all the debit card \ntransactions really focus on three major banks. That would be Bank of \nAmerica, Wells Fargo, and Chase. So there is a lot of money to be made \nin this business as long as they are using the debit cards and getting \nthe swipe fees.\n  We put in a new law last year which said the Federal Reserve should \nestablish what is a reasonable and proportional amount to be charged \nfor the interchange fee for debit cards. As I told you, the initial \ninvestigation suggested it is around 10 cents; and the actual charge is \n40 cents.\n  Now, these banks that are about to lose these major interchange fee \nreceipts are very upset about it because as of July 21, the new law \nwill go into effect which will bring the fee down to a reasonable and \nproportional level. So they are fighting this with tooth and nail. \nToday, I was at a breakfast here on Capitol Hill, and a group of \nlobbyists were there, and one came up to me and said: Durbin, your \nfight on the interchange fee has more lobbyists working in Washington \nthan any other issue, on both sides of the issue. I said: I understand \nthat. That was not my goal.\n  My goal is really to help the merchants, retailers, and consumers. \nYou see, when retailers are in a competitive atmosphere--if it is one \ngas station across the street from another--then saving 30 cents on a \ntransaction can really be part of a decision by a retailer to lower \nprices to become more price competitive in a competitive free market \natmosphere. That is what I am looking for. I want the consumers to be \nthe ultimate winners. I want retailers and merchants to be treated \nfairly.\n  Incidentally, for the record, what is the debit card interchange fee \ncharged\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nby Visa- and MasterCard-issuing banks in Canada? It is zero--zero. \nThere is no interchange fee in Canada because the government there \nsaid: We are not going to stand for this. You are really ripping off \nmerchants, retailers, and consumers. We will not let you do it.\n  The same thing happened in Europe. They brought down the interchange \nfees to dramatically lower levels.\n  Well, in the United States the battle is on. If you had to pick a \ngroup with the lowest level of credibility when it comes to this \ninstitution or Congress--maybe even the American people--I guess next \nto politicians, you would have to say big banks, particularly the big \nbanks that were bailed out by our Federal Government when they made a \nmess of things a few years back. So the big banks that issued the debit \ncards cannot come in here and lobby for themselves. The credit card \ncompanies themselves do not enjoy a very good reputation here either. \nConsumers know what a tough time it is to pay off those bills and the \nfine print they have to deal with in their contracts.\n  So what these groups have done--the credit card companies and big \nbanks--is to enlist small banks and credit unions to come and appeal to \nus, saying: We are in your city and community and the Durbin amendment \ncan hurt us. What they do not say is the law we passed specifically \nexempts--specifically exempts--all banks and credit unions with a \nvaluation lower than $10 billion.\n  So of the 7,000 or 8,000 credit unions in America, how many have a \nvaluation over $10 billion? Three. How many banks out of the 7,000 or \n8,000 have a valuation over $10 billion? Less than 100. So we are \ntalking about 100 institutions that will be affected by this law; and \nthe others are exempt.\n  I rise today to speak about the effect of this interchange fee reform \non these small banks and credit unions. Recently, the banking industry \nand some bank regulators have claimed that the small issuer exemption--\nthe $10 billion exemption--in last year's reform law may not work. The \nbanking industry people said there are market forces that could \nundermine it. They are wrong. I respect their right to speculate on \nwhat might happen when reform takes place. But in response, I point out \nthey simply have not provided any evidence to back up their claims.\n  In fact, all the hard evidence about the interchange system leads to \nthe opposite conclusion: that interchange reform will give small banks \nand credit unions competitive advantages against the bigger banks.\n  This is not just my conclusion. It is the conclusion of prominent \neconomists and industry analysts such as Andrew Kahr, who the \n``Frontline'' program profiled as one of the creators of the modern \ncard industry, the plastic card industry, and former IMF Chief \nEconomist Simon Johnson. In a recent online survey, even 60 percent of \nthe American Banker's subscription-paying readers agreed that \ninterchange reform will help small banks.\n  So the Members who come to the floor and say: Oh, this terrible rule \nchange that exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets is going \nto hurt them, they are not only wrong on the facts, they are wrong in \npublic opinion.\n  The key point to remember is that the debit interchange system is not \na properly functioning market. The interchange system has been designed \nin a way so normal market forces do not apply. No transparency. No \ncompetition.\n  Last year, a bipartisan majority of my colleagues recognized reform \nneeded to take place, and after years of studies and hearings, it \nbecame clear the interchange system was not going to cure itself. It \nwas broken and unfair. The system was structured to avoid normal \ncompetitive market forces.\n  Andrew Martin of the New York Times summarized the debit interchange \nsystem in his January 2010 expose. This is what he said:\n\n       Competition, of course, usually forces prices lower. But \n     for payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, competition in \n     the card business is more about winning over banks that \n     actually issue the cards than consumers who use them.\n       Visa and MasterCard set the fees merchants must pay the \n     cardholder's bank, and higher fees mean higher profits for \n     banks, even if it means that merchants and retailers have to \n     shift the cost to consumers.\n\n  Martin went on to quote Ronald Congemi. He is the former CEO of the \nStar debit network, who talked about his network's struggle to compete \nwith Visa.\n  Mr. Congemi said:\n\n       What we witnessed was truly a perverse form of competition. \n     They competed on the basis of raising prices. What other \n     industry do you know that gets away with that?\n\n  James Miller, former Director of OMB and Chairman of the Federal \nTrade Commission under President Ronald Reagan, elaborated on this in a \nrecent op-ed article titled ``The Debit Card Market Is Broken and Needs \nFixing Now.''\n  Here is what he wrote:\n\n       Under this dysfunctional system, the networks' competitive \n     incentives are to raise fees rather than to reduce them. One \n     network raises its fees higher than the other to encourage \n     banks to issue their cards. Then, soon after, the other \n     network raises its fees for the same reason. The result is \n     rapidly escalating fees. . . . This broken system would not \n     survive were it not for the fact that Visa and MasterCard \n     represent a combined 90 percent of the debit market. . . . \n     Merchants are powerless to negotiate and can't take their \n     business elsewhere, so they are left with no choice but to \n     pay.\n\n  In short, interchange is an abnormal market which has no naturally \noccurring market force to hold fees in check. Visa and MasterCard want \nas many of their debit cards to be swiped as possible. That is how they \nmake their money. By raising interchange rates that merchants must pay \nto banks, the card companies entice banks to issue more cards. \nMerchants cannot refuse Visa and MasterCard and they cannot negotiate \nwith them, so they are stuck with what they have to pay.\n  Last year, Congress decided we can no longer simply trust Visa and \nMasterCard to fix interchange fees however they wanted. We agreed there \nshould be reasonable constraints placed on the card networks to prevent \nthem from using their market dominance to set unreasonably high fees on \nbehalf of the Nation's biggest banks. We passed a law that said, when \nVisa and MasterCard fix fee rates on behalf of banks with over $10 \nbillion in assets, the rates, according to the Federal Reserve, must be \nreasonable and proportional to the amount it actually costs the banks \nto process the transaction.\n  Congress did not have the information about how much it actually cost \nbig banks to process transactions. The banks always kept that secret, \neven from the Government Accountability Office. So we directed the \nFederal Reserve to gather the information on the cost and put out a \nrule implementing the reasonable proportional standard. That is under \nway right now. The Federal Reserve believes they will report this rule \ntoward the first part of June, and it will go in effect July 21.\n  When it comes to small issuers, we said they are exempt. This means \nVisa and MasterCard can continue to fix interchange rates on behalf of \nsmall banks and credit unions in an unregulated environment such as \nthey do today. It is status quo for them.\n  Some people might say: Why would you let the credit unions and small \ncommunity banks charge a higher rate to swipe the debit card then the \nbig banks? You can make the argument that if you are going to protect \nconsumers at every level, it should affect every institution. But we \nspecifically exempted community banks and credit unions with valuations \nbelow $10 billion, believing that those community banks deserve a break \nand a helping hand. They have not shown much gratitude for that \nexemption.\n  Under the reform law, the only way small issuer interchange rates \nwould change is if Visa and MasterCard decide to change them. And Visa \nand MasterCard have no incentive to voluntarily lower fee rates for \nsmall issuers. Remember, in the interchange market, Visa and MasterCard \ncompete to raise fees to win bank business. They want to have high fees \nso banks issue more cards.\n  If MasterCard decides to voluntarily lower its small bank rates, \nthose banks are going to jump over and start issuing Visa cards. Does \nthat make sense for either of those two credit card giants? Of course \nnot.\n  So why would the small-issuer exemption not work? This is where some \ncreative arguments have come into play. I wish to respond to those \narguments I have heard.\n  First, claims have been made card networks will not maintain separate\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\ntiers of interchange rates for big, regulated issuers and smaller \nissuers. The facts do not support this. Visa, the dominant network, \nannounced in January it would, in fact, operate a two-tiered system, \nexactly the opposite of what all the lobbyists for community banks and \ncredit unions are saying on Capitol Hill. Visa has said they will \nrespect the interchange fee exemption for the smaller issuers.\n  Other smaller debit networks have made the same announcement. The \nonly company that has not is MasterCard, and they are expected to. \nSure, the law does not require them to operate two-tiered systems, but \nthe card networks will lose money if they do not. If networks want \nsmall banks to issue their debit cards, they have to offer interchange \nrate levels the small banks will be attracted to.\n  Second argument. The American Bankers Association claimed last week \nthat ``having two different prices for exactly the same product--\ntransaction processing--is not sustainable in a competitive \nmarketplace.''\n  But there is clear evidence to the contrary. Look at the current \ncredit card market. According to GAO, in 2009, Visa had 60 different \ncredit card interchange prices; MasterCard had 243. A merchant that \naccepts Visa or MasterCard credit cards might be charged any number of \ndifferent interchange fees, depending on whether it is a consumer or \ncorporate card and the type of rewards program.\n  If you have one of these frequent flyer cards, there may be a higher \ninterchange fee that is going to be charged to the company--to the \nretailer--where they accept your card. From the merchant's standpoint, \nthey treat it as exactly the same product. It is a credit card. But \nthere are many different interchange prices that the merchant might get \ncharged.\n  Visa and MasterCard have sustained this multi-tiered pricing \nstructure for years. The American Bankers Association has to know that. \nWhy would they state exactly the opposite? Because their biggest banks \nare the ones that are going to lose out if the consumers prosper under \nthis new change.\n  How have they been able to sustain this multi-tiered system, these \ncard companies? Remember, the interchange system is not a normal \ncompetitive market. In this case, card networks impose rules on every \nmerchant that requires merchants to accept every card with a network \nlogo on it. It means, if you are running a store in Springfield, IL, or \nDenver, CO, and someone shows up with a Visa card, you have signed a \ncontact that says: I honor every card with Visa emblazoned on it put on \nthe counter. Even though I pay a higher interchange fee as a retailer \nif it is a big rewards card with frequent flyer miles, all the rest of \nit, you have got to take it. That is the contract law that binds these \nmerchants.\n  Third, the American Bankers Association has claimed that if big bank \ndebit fees are reduced, merchants will discriminate and find some way \nto get customers to use big bank debit cards instead of small issuer \ncards. If this claim were true, we would surely see some evidence of it \ntoday because of multi-tier pricing in credit card interchange.\n  Let me give you an example. For supermarkets, a Visa credit card with \nno rewards program currently carries an interchange fee of 1.15 \npercent, more than 1 percent of what you purchase. That is the \ninterchange fee if it is a simple Visa credit card, no rewards. But a \nVisa Signature Preferred rewards credit card has an interchange fee of \nalmost twice that, 2.1 percent.\n  By the ABA's logic, supermarkets right now would be discriminating \nagainst rewards cards and steering customers to nonrewards cards--but \nthere is no evidence of that discrimination anywhere. I challenge the \nAmerican Bankers Association to put up or shut up. If you have some \nevidence to the contrary, let's see it. If you do not, retract the \nspecious claim.\n  Why don't merchants discriminate? The merchant community sent me a \nletter a few weeks ago explaining in detail how they lack the \ncontractual authority, the practical ability, and the economic \nincentive to discriminate. I also wish to add a commonsense point. Most \nAmericans only have one debit card. If a merchant tells a customer not \nto use his debit card because it was issued by a small bank, the \ncustomer would likely do one of two things, not purchase at all or pay \nwith a credit card. Credit cards carry much higher interchange fees \nthan debit cards. How then would discriminating against debit cards be \nin a merchant's interest?\n\n  When I talked to the merchants--like Wendy Chronister, who runs a \nwhole slew of gas stations in central Illinois--took the business over \nfrom her dad, she is a great young woman executive--and she said: \nSenator, they put the plastic on the counter, we take it. If it clears, \nwe move the transaction and move on to the next customer. We are not \ngoing to debate how many other cards you carry and where is the one \nwith the lower interchange fees. We do not have time for it, and we are \nnot going to put that kind of hassle on our customers.\n  Fourth, some make the argument that the nonexclusivity provision of \nthe reform law will clause small issuer exchange rates to go down. This \nnonexclusivity provision is often misunderstood.\n  Until recent years, normally all debit cards were set up by banks so \ntransactions could be run over one of multiple debit networks. But in \nrecent years, the dominant networks, particularly Visa, have formed \nexclusive deals with big banks so transactions on the debit cards could \nonly be run by one network. What they are trying to do--credit card \ncompanies are trying to do--is to monopolize the transactions as well \nas the cards.\n  These exclusivity agreements are threatening to drive smaller debit \nnetworks out of business. This trend hurts competition and creates real \nbarriers to entry for new networks.\n  All the nonexclusivity provision in the new law says is that banks \nhave to pick at least two unaffiliated card networks to enable on each \ndebit card, and merchants get to choose which of those networks they \nwant.\n  You know what? I wish to say to my friends at the Wall Street Journal \nwho write editorials saying what a bad idea interchange reform is: What \nwe are talking about is something called competition. For the biggest \nbusiness newspaper in the United States, you would think they would \nsupport something such as this.\n  Nonexclusivity is not new. Last month, the Pulse Network released its \nannual survey of debit card issuers. Pulse said that when it comes to \nthis nonexclusivity requirement, many issuers are already compliant, \nand we have not seen any small bank interchange rates decline as a \nresult. It is another smoke screen, a red herring.\n  The nonexclusivity provision gives the Fed broad discretion to lay \nout guidelines to make it more effective. The Fed also gets to choose \nthe effective date. In short, this provision is not the bogeyman that \nsome have made it out to be and is simply a safeguard that will ensure \nthat Visa does not become the only debit network left in the market.\n  What I have learned, after years of working on this complicated \nissue, is the following: Banks and credit unions will consistently \noppose any type of reform. The American Bankers Association is \nlegendary--it represents the banking industry--and the Credit Union \nNational Association, which represents the credit unions, both have \nstatements on their Web sites making it clear that there is no \nregulation of the interchange system they will support.\n  Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, now retired, and I tried to negotiate \nwith the banks and credit unions in 2009. We were thinking about doing \nan amendment to allow for greater interchange transparency and debit \ndiscounts. The banks and credit unions blasted a letter of opposition \nout before we even drafted the amendment.\n  Now, the opponents of my amendment say what we need are 30 months to \nstudy this. Study it for what? I know where it is going to end up. We \nhave been through this before. I have seen this movie. The American \nBankers Association and the Credit Union National Association, now \nmarching in lockstep on issues, are going to oppose any reform.\n  The entire financial industry is making a killing on the current \ninterchange system, to the tune of $1.3 billion a month. Do the math \nand figure out why this has every lobbyist in town working to defeat \nthe Durbin amendment--30 times 1.3. That is pretty close\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\nto $40 billion that is at stake if the amendment to stop this Durbin \nchange in the interchange fee system goes through.\n  The change needs to go through. There is widespread consensus that we \nneed to reform the interchange system to rein in Visa, MasterCard, and \nthe biggest banks on Wall Street. I do not think anyone disagrees with \nthat. In fact, I have seen polling across the country in every State, \nfrom virtually every political group--left, right, and center--where \nthey overwhelmingly support interchange reform.\n  The credit unions and community banks are selling a story which the \npublic is not buying. In carrying out this reform, I have bent over \nbackward to try to address small issuer concerns. I do not want small \nbanks or credit unions forced out of the debit card market. That is why \nwe exempted them. I want consumers to be able to bank at these \ninstitutions and use debit cards.\n  I have tried to protect small banks and credit unions, even though \nthey have made it clear they do not support any regulation of the \nsystem and even though they have fought me every step of the way.\n  By exempting small issuers from fee regulation, we have left intact \nan interchange system that has worked quite well for small issuers, and \nthat will almost certainly continue to work well. But let's be clear. \nThere is only one way we can provide these small issuers with an \nabsolute, 100-percent guarantee that Visa and MasterCard will give them \ninterchange rates they like. There is only one way to do it. That would \nbe to regulate the rates Visa and MasterCard fix for small issuers and \nmake sure they are appropriate.\n  I am happy to explore that. I can already tell you the small issuers \nare going to push back on that immediately.\n  They want their cake and they want to eat it, too. They want no \nregulation. They want to be able to charge interchange fees that reach \nthe heavens, and they don't care what happens to merchants, retailers, \nor consumers.\n  I think we have already taken care of small issuers with last year's \nlaw, but if they have some suggestions on how to give even more \nassurance that Visa and MasterCard won't set their rates at \nunsustainable levels, I will listen.\n  But make no mistake, I will not support any delay or repeal of the \noverall interchange rulemaking because this will let the big banks and \ncard networks off the hook. We are very close to finally reining in the \nabusive interchange system and providing help to consumers and \nmerchants. We cannot let the big banks and credit card companies avoid \naccountability yet again. They get away with too much.\n  In closing, I strongly believe we need interchange reform. We need to \nbring fairness, competition, and transparency to the broken debit \nsystem. I will work hard to make sure this reform happens soon.\n  I would think the fact that the opponents of this are trying to stop \nit before the Fed issues a rule is an indication that they don't even \nwant to see what the rule looks like. Why? It is $1.3 billion a month, \nthat is why. Change will cost the big banks big money. That is why the \ncredit card companies and banks on Wall Street are fighting this.\n  I have always tried to approach this issue in a reasonable way, \nfocusing on facts. I am always happy to engage with others who share \nthis approach, even if they disagree with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3044-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Specialist Joseph Cemper\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SPC \nJoseph Cemper who, while serving his country honorably, was killed on \nApril 16, 2011, by a suicide bomber at Forward Operating Base Gamberi \nin Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan.\n  Following in the footsteps of his father, SFC Eugene Cemper, Joe \njoined the Army in September 2009. The U.S. Army was their passion, and \nboth of these individuals took great pride in serving their country. \nJoe served admirably as a transportation management coordinator with \nthe 101st Special Troops Battalion, 101st Sustainment Brigade of the \n101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, KY. He bravely earned the \nprestigious Bronze Star, as well as a Purple Heart and the Combat \nAction Badge.\n  Joe grew up in Papillion, NE, where his grandparents continue to \nlive, before moving with his immediate family to Warrensburg, MO, where \nhe played football and was an accomplished high school wrestler. Joe \nwas highly competitive and energetic, yet always carried a smile. He \nwas a family man; his happiest times were when the family got together \nto spend time in the backyard barbecuing. Joe recently became a father \nhimself when he and his high school sweetheart Abbie gave birth to a \nson, Liam, on March 15, 2011.\n  SPC Joseph Cemper served his country honorably and made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his fellow Americans. His courageous choice to protect \nhis country and help the people of Afghanistan achieve peace and \nsecurity represents all that we can be proud of in our Armed Forces. I \nand all Nebraskans are proud to know that Joseph has been laid to rest \nin his native State of Nebraska.\n  I commend SPC Joseph Cemper's bravery and selflessness, while \noffering my deepest condolences to his fiancee Abbie; son Liam; mother \nAngie; father SFC Eugene Cemper; grandparents; brothers and sisters; \nfriends; and fellow servicemembers he left behind. It is a small \ncomfort for those who must now go on without one they loved so dearly, \nbut they know that Specialist Cemper gave his life for a noble goal. I \njoin all Nebraskans indeed, all Americans in mourning the loss of this \nfine young man. His heroism and his life will remain an inspiration for \nus all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3044-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3044-S3045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, six Louisiana law enforcement officers \nwere killed in the line of duty this past year and will be recognized \nin Washington as part of the 49th annual commemoration of National \nPolice Week. These brave officers made the ultimate sacrifice while \nserving their communities and are being honored for their courageous \nspirit and their unwavering commitment to serve and protect the \ncitizens of Louisiana. I want to welcome their families and colleagues \nto our Nation's Capital.\n  Established in 1962, National Police Week provides an opportunity for \nus to reflect on our law enforcement officers' contributions to \nbuilding safe and productive communities across the country. The events \nthis week are a collaborative effort to honor the service and sacrifice \nof America's law enforcement community including the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund, NLEOMF, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, FOP, the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary, FOA, and the \nConcerns of Police Survivors, COPS.\n  Thousands of law enforcement officers, supporters, and surviving \nfamily members of fallen officers will gather in Washington, DC, to \nhonor the memory of their colleagues and loved ones at various events \nincluding, the Peace Officers Memorial Day Service at the U.S. Capitol \nand the National Police Survivors' Conference. In addition, the names \nof our six Louisiana heroes will be engraved on the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial and formally dedicated during the 23d \nAnnual Candlelight Vigil. They will join a total of 158 U.S. law \nenforcement officers from around the country who gave the ultimate \nsacrifice in the line of duty last year.\n  The following brave officers gave their lives to protect our \nLouisiana communities: Sergeant Thomas M. Alexander, Rayville Police \nDepartment; Captain Timothy J. Bergeron, Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's \nOffice; Officer Alfred L. Celestain, Sr., New Orleans Police \nDepartment; Trooper Duane A. Dalton, Louisiana State Police; Sergeant \nTimothy C. Prunty, Shreveport Police Department; and Corporal Clovis W. \nSearcy, Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office.\n  In addition to honoring the fallen officers at National Police Week, \nlaw enforcement from around the country will gather this week to honor \nthe heroes who continue to keep our communities safe. I am pleased to \nrecognize one of Louisiana's own, Trooper Thomas Wild of the New \nOrleans Police Department, who will be honored at this year's National \nAssociation of Police Organizations', NAPO, 18th Annual\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nTOP COPS Award Ceremony. TOP COPS recognizes officers who have gone \nabove and beyond the call of duty from the previous year.\n  Trooper Wild, this year's recipient of the Life Saving Award from the \nState police for going beyond the call of duty, will be recognized for \nhis heroic actions and outstanding display of bravery last year when he \nsaved the life of two victims from an overturned vehicle. Trooper \nThomas Wild was assigned to the scene of an accident in which a van \nflipped multiple times and ultimately landed upside-down in a sugarcane \nfield. Trooper Wild helped transport the unconscious driver to the \nhospital and checked for additional victims at the accident sight. This \nwas all protocol that any officer would have done but in an \nextraordinary gesture Trooper Wild which beyond the call of duty by \ngiving his personal cell phone number to the victim's father.\n  Seven hours later Trooper Wild received a call from the victim's \nfamily. There may have been someone else in the vehicle. Although \nTrooper Wild was off duty, he quickly returned to the crash site \nsearching the nearby field and called out for the missing passenger. \nFinally, Trooper Wild heard a faint response of someone crying out for \nhelp. A few minutes later, he found 22-year-old Benjamin Kilvurn \nbleeding, dehydrated, and unconscious. Wild called an ambulance and the \nyoung man was rushed to the hospital.\n  Clearly going beyond the call of duty, Trooper Wild quickly responded \nto the concerns of a victim's family and saved the lives of not one but \ntwo men. His selfless actions represent the dedication and commitment \nthat our law enforcement officers have for our community. I thank \nTrooper Wild for his dedication and congratulate him for being \nLouisiana's TOP COP.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as our Nation begins its observance of \nNational Police Week, I speak today in memory of three Alaska law \nenforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty in 2010.\n  This is National Police Week, the week that we honor law enforcement \nheroes who have given their lives to protect our communities and those \nwho place their lives on the line every day. During this week we also \nremember the families of law enforcement whose sacrifices are no less \nimportant than their loved ones who wear the uniform.\n  One of the most significant and moving of the commemorations that \noccur during National Police Week is the candlelight vigil at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on Judiciary Square. More \nthan 19,000 names of fallen law enforcement officers are etched on the \nWall of Remembrance at the memorial. This year, 316 names have joined \nthem--152 officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in 2010 and 164 \nofficers who gave their lives before the memorial was created. Each of \nthese names was read at the candlelight vigil on the evening of May 13, \n2011.\n  Among the 316 names are three Alaskans: Sergeant Anthony Wallace and \nOfficer Matthew Tokuoka of the Hoonah Police Department and Charles \nCollins, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer assigned to the \nPort of Anchorage. They are the first Alaska law enforcement officers \nsince 2003 to die in the line of duty.\n  We are reminded time and again that fallen law enforcement officers \nare not heroes for the way they gave their lives but heroes for the way \nthey lived their lives. I would like to say a few words about each.\n  Hoonah is a village of about 760 people on an island in southeast \nAlaska. Sixty percent of year-round residents are Tlingit Indians. The \npopulation of the town swells during the summer as fishermen and \nvisitors descend. It is a peaceful and picturesque community.\n  That peace was broken on the evening of Sunday, August 29, 2010, when \na gunman ambushed and shot Sergeant Wallace and then Officer Tokuoka \nwho was off duty at the time, while the two were chatting. To add to \nthe tragedy, Sergeant Wallace's mother, who was visiting Hoonah and \nriding along with her son in his police vehicle, observed the shooting. \nA special tribute was paid to Sergeant Wallace and his mother Debbie \nGreene at last Friday evening's candlelight vigil.\n  Sergeant Tony Wallace was unique among the men and women of law \nenforcement. He was one of a handful of law enforcement officers \nanywhere who is deaf.\n  But Tony Wallace would not let his disability stop him from living a \nlife of adventure. His mother told a reporter: ``People would always \ntell him he couldn't do things but he tried even harder.''\n  He was a champion high school wrestler in his hometown of Franklin, \nOH, and went on to be a varsity All-American wrestler at the Rochester \nInstitute of Technology in upstate New York. Upon graduation he joined \nthe public safety department at RIT as a campus police officer. Tony \nWallace was destined to be a cop, following in the footsteps of his \nfather who served with the Franklin Police Department for 34 years. He \nwas living his dream and excelling at his job.\n  In 2006, Tony Wallace learned of a police job in Hoonah. He had never \nvisited Alaska before but he was an avid boater, hunter, and fisherman. \nHe was hired after a telephone interview and a background check. Just \nlike that off he went.\n  In no time, Tony was sending friends pictures of him holding large \nsalmon and encountering bears. He said he found the place where he \nwould spend the rest of his life, enjoying nature and helping others. \nHe graduated first in his class of 21 at the police academy. In his \nspare time he coached wrestling at the Hoonah School and played \nscrabble with the Elders at the Senior Center.\n  Tony is also survived by his daughter Lexis and his grandmother.\n  Matt Tokuoka was killed while trying to save the life of his friend \nand comrade Tony Wallace. Born in Seattle, he spent his childhood in \nHawaii and Idaho. He too was an accomplished hunter and fisherman and \nshared his passion with his children. Matt was a Golden Gloves boxer in \nHigh School and joined the U.S. Marine Corps after high school. Matt \njoined the Hoonah Police Department following his service in the \nMarines.\n  John Millan, the Hoonah Police chief at the time of the incident, \ndescribed Matt as a larger than life figure, every bit the Marine.\n  In John's words: ``Matt ran directly into a hail of bullets, when any \nother person would walk away and did so without hesitation. He called \nin a situation report, precisely like a Marine would in combat. He \nbegan to move Tony to safety when he laid down his own life.''\n  Matt Tokuoka is survived by his wife Haley and four children--\nMitchell, Hotchan, George and Layla, as well as his father, second \nmother, sisters and grandmother.\n  Matt and Tony were dedicated family people, ``Dear Ones,'' in the \nHoonah vernacular, who were beloved by their own families as their \nextended families in the Hoonah community. Their tragic loss last \nAugust rocked Hoonah to the core and the process of recovery has been \ndifficult. Tony and Matt were not only exemplary officers with \nsignificant records of public service. They were pillars of the \ncommunity.\n  Chuck Collins joined Customs and Border Protection in 2002 following \na successful career in the Air Force. Upon completion of training, he \nwas assigned to ``the port of his dreams'' in Anchorage. During the \nsummer he was assigned to temporary duty in Eagle, a remote border \ncheckpoint about 379 miles northeast of Fairbanks. He relished the \nassignment and I am told was active in the life of the Eagle community \nduring his annual summer duty there.\n  Officer Collins was killed when his government-issued Ford Bronco \nwent down a 200-foot embankment on the Taylor Highway and landed in a \nrain swollen creek. Officer Collins is survived by his wife Jody and \ntwo sons, both of whom are serving abroad in the military.\n  There is little that I can say in consolation except to note that \nMatt, Tony and Chuck touched a great many people's lives, they were \nrole models, and they sacrificed all to make Alaska a safe and peaceful \nplace. In valor there is hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3045-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3045-S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMERICORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to join the Vermont Commission \non National and Community Service in paying tribute to the outstanding \nAmericorps men and women who have volunteered countless hours this past \nyear supporting Vermont's communities, and communities around the\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\ncountry. The Vermont Commission on National and Community Service, \nfirst established by Governor Howard Dean in 1993, works with \nAmeriCorps volunteers, community volunteers and other organizations \nthroughout Vermont to grow Vermont's dynamic communities. The service \nto others and civic engagement that the volunteer programs organized by \nthe Commission promote are the cornerstone of Vermont's most treasured \nvalues.\n  Being a dedicated volunteer is often not an easy task. The Vermont \nCommission on National and Community Services allows servicemembers to \nshine through their vast opportunities and resources for our Vermont-\nbased volunteers. Within the scope of their work, the Commission \nprovides various opportunities to work in our communities through the \nAmeriCorps, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America programs. The \nexperiences of these volunteers will allow them to share their \ncommunity values with the rest of Vermont and our great country.\n  I continue to be impressed with the achievements our dedicated \nprofessionals and young volunteers reach during their inspiring \ncareers. I am pleased that the staff of the Vermont Commission on \nNational and Community Service, along with their Americorps members, \nare being recognized for all that they have done day in and day out \nthroughout Vermont. The skills and experiences of these volunteers are \ninstrumental in helping our communities tackle tough and complex \nproblems.\n  I am fortunate to call Vermont my home, and we are more than lucky to \nhave so many local role models that continue to inspire our young \ncitizens to get involved. Whether volunteering as an Americorps member, \nor helping a next door neighbor in need, Vermonters carry forward our \nlongstanding tradition of community service and involvement. This is \nwhy Vermont continues to be the great State that it is today. To the \nstaff and volunteers of the Vermont Commission on National and \nCommunity Service, again I say thank you for all that you do for \nVermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3046-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       COLORADO NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of the dedication of the Colorado National Monument \non May 24, 2011. The monument's 32 square miles of red rock canyons, \npinnacles and vistas on Colorado's Western Slope are a wonder to \nbehold. They provide essential habitat for keystone species like the \ngolden eagle and desert bighorn and a unique campus for junior rangers \nto learn and connect with the high desert ecosystem. Anyone who has \nhiked one of the Monument's many trails or driven historic Rim Rock \nDrive understands that this is a place worthy of celebration.\n  For a century now, visitors to this monument have been not only awed \nby its beauty but also inspired by its past. This rare piece of earth \ngained Federal recognition due to the dedicated efforts of John Otto, \nwho made his home in these canyons. He worked for years to build trails \nand organize support, succeeding in 1911 as President William Howard \nTaft signed a proclamation declaring the monument. Just weeks later, \nOtto made his first daring climb to plant an American flag at the top \nof the 450-foot tall spire known as Independence Monument, on the \nFourth of July. That day confirmed what Coloradans already knew--that \nwe had something special.\n  But John Otto didn't end his commitment there. He became the \nmonument's first park ranger, living in a tent and helping visitors \ndiscover the canyons for 16 more years. Through the lens of history, \nhis dedication stands as a shining example of what it means to work for \nsomething you believe in so strongly. The history of the Colorado \nNational Monument remains a testament to the spirit, conviction, and \nlove of our land that makes the State of Colorado what it is today.\n  By offering educational field trips to public schools, rangers at the \nColorado National Monument are working to ensure that the science and \nhistory of the monument will remain in the minds of young people across \nwestern Colorado. All Coloradans are proud of the fact that this \ntreasured landscape will continue to inspire visitors for generations \nto come. Mr. President and all other Members here today, please join me \nand all Coloradans in celebrating the monument on its \ncentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3046-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WOODWORTH, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On June 25-26, the residents of Woodworth will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Woodworth is a small but vibrant community in North Dakota. The town \nwas founded in 1911, and takes its name from the Northern Pacific \nRailroad's traffic manager and vice president at the time, J. G. \nWoodworth. It is located in Stutsman County and is the last stop on the \nrailroad track that runs along highway 36. The historical site, Camp \nGrant, is located near Woodworth, and was used in the Sibley Expedition \nof 1863. Woodworth earned the nickname ``the Cream City'' in its early \nyears, because the sale of cream and eggs was the main source of income \nfor many local farmers. The town is currently home to approximately 70 \nproud residents.\n  The citizens of Woodworth have organized numerous activities to \ncelebrate their town's centennial. Beginning on Saturday morning, they \nwill participate in a walk/run, with a breakfast, a parade, and art in \nthe park to follow. A truck/tractor pull, street dance, and fireworks \nwill round out the day's events. Woodworth's residents will conclude \nthe centennial festivities with a community worship service on Sunday \nmorning, and enjoy a home-run derby and music in the park on Sunday \nafternoon.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Woodworth, ND, and \nits residents on the first 100 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. \nFrom June 17-19, the residents of Tuttle, ND, will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's founding.\n  In 1911, the town of Tuttle was founded by an official with the \nDakota Land & Town Site Company, Colonel William P. Tuttle. Proud to \nhave a town named in his honor, Colonel Tuttle donated money for the \nTuttle Baseball Club's first baseball uniforms.\n  Located near the geographic center of North Dakota, Tuttle and its \nsurrounding area were settled by homestead families of Scandinavian and \nGerman Russian heritage. Many of the descendants of these settlers \nstill live and farm in the area today. In addition to farming, there \nare many community businesses and services in Tuttle such as the Senior \nCenter, Post Office, BJ Auction Service, Buchholz Trucking, Days Gone \nBy Cafe, Tuttle Community Store, Tuttle Farmers Elevator, and Tuttle \nTavern.\n  Today, the people of Tuttle enjoy fishing, boating, and hunting near \nplaces like Lake Josephine and Cherry Lake. Also popular are \ntraditional culinary specialties like knoephla soup, fleisch kuechle, \nand kuchen. Tuttle is a hard working community, whose vitality can be \nattributed to its strong family values and community spirit.\n  In honor of the city's 100th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized, among other things, a meet and greet fish fry, a centennial \n5K/10K Run/Walk, turtle races, a threshing bee and antique tractor \nshow, a parade, and a baseball game in Tuttle Ball Park.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nTuttle, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Tuttle and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nfrontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, I honor the 30th anniversary of \nBrewer Science, an innovative, high-technology company from Rolla, MO.\n  When Brewer Science was started by Dr. Terry and Paula Brewer in \n1981, it had only three employees. Like so many small businesses in our \ncountry, the company has grown and expanded because of its commitment \nto hard work, innovative solutions and exceptional service for its \ncustomers. From humble beginnings, the company has grown today to 263 \nemployees working globally to bring groundbreaking technology to \ncompanies worldwide.\n  Brewer Science is best known in the microelectronics industry for \nintroducing ARC brand bottom antireflecting coatings in 1981 to \nmicrochip makers. In the past 30 years, they have expanded their \nportfolio to include optoelectronic coatings, protective coatings, \nbonding processes and nanotechnology products, which enable the \nmanufacturing of advanced integrated circuits, sensors and displays \nthroughout the world.\n  As Brewer Science has continued to grow, their vision and philosophy \nhave remained consistent. The milestone that I ask us to honor today is \na tribute to this vision.\n  Brewer Science has translated their success in business into a better \ncommunity for Missourians. Brewer Science has had a positive impact on \nits community through service, volunteering, and donations to various \narts, educational and environment programs.\n  Brewer Science's passion for providing dedicated service and their \nemphasis on innovation serve as an inspiration for all Missourians. \nTheir achievements deserve the highest commemoration.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 30th \nanniversary of Brewer Science.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3047-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

He has served \nin numerous roles, including as the director of the Commission's Japan \noffice, as associate executive director, and currently as the \nCommission's executive director.\n  Dr. Gangloff has, through his work at the Commission, contributed \nsubstantially to research, training, and student exchange programs with \nJapan, and supported the valuable projects of countless scholars, \nstudents, and artists through Commission grant programs.\n  Throughout his tenure as executive director of the Commission, Dr. \nGangloff has worked with the leaders of several professional \norganizations of Japanese language educators, encouraging them to join \nforces and work together in order to provide maximum support for \nJapanese language teachers at all levels in the United States, from \nkindergarten through college. As a result of his efforts and continuing \nsupport, the Alliance of Associations of Teachers of Japanese was \nfounded in 1999 as a coalition that represents and serves two \npreviously separate organizations.\n  Dr. Gangloff also spearheaded a movement to create the North American \nCoordinating Council on Japanese Library Resources in 1991 to meet the \ndemands of the American library community for Japanese research \nmaterials. The creation of the NCC brought the activities of the Japan \nstudies library community into a clearinghouse that focuses on \nresource-sharing through cooperative collection development, \ninformation literacy at all levels within the Japan studies field and \nfosters close collaboration and consultation among librarians, the \nacademic community and funding agencies in both countries.\n  In addition, Dr. Gangloff is responsible for the strengthening of \nlong-term positive relations between the two countries through his \ncreation and long-term support and guidance of the U.S.-Japan \nLegislative Exchange Program which brings together on a semi-annual \nbasis, a core group of United States Congressional Members and Japanese \nDiet Members for in-depth and informal discussions on a broad range of \npolitical, economic and security issues. Discussions such as these \ncement the bonds between the two countries at the highest levels, which \nis especially important at times of great stress, such as the recent \ntragic events in Japan.\n  Dr. Gangloff was the driving force behind the creation in 1998 of the \nUnited States Japan Bridging Foundation, a charitable organization that \nexpands opportunities for American undergraduate students to study in \nJapan. This public-private partnership, directed by Dr. Gangloff, has \nraised over $4,000,000 and awarded over 1,000 scholarships to American \nstudents since its inception.\n  In short, Dr. Eric Gangloff has provided inspired leadership \nthroughout his career in cultural, educational, and scholarly dialogue \nand exchange between Japan and the United States. On behalf of the \ncongressional Members serving as Commissioners of the Japan-U.S. \nFriendship Commission--Senator Murkowski, Congressman Tom Petri, \nCongressman Jim McDermott, and myself--I would like to express our \ndeepest gratitude for these contributions and assure Dr. Gangloff that \nthe positive results of his hard work will be felt for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3047-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 1231.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     vote against the F-35 alternate engine appropriations \n     measure; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 73\n\n       Whereas, the federal government, now more than ever, needs \n     to eliminate wasteful spending programs from its budget; and\n       Whereas, the federal deficit recently hit $13.5 trillion; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense will spend $708 billion \n     on defense spending in the 2011 fiscal year for both base \n     defense programs and overseas contingency operations to \n     promote the safety and welfare of our nation; and\n       Whereas, Congress has planned to appropriate $465 million \n     for an alternate GE F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike \n     Fighter program in the Defense Appropriations Bill; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense has already contracted \n     the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, which has gone through \n     multiple series of testing and development; and\n       Whereas, no military aircraft in the past three decades has \n     been procured with multiple engine suppliers; and\n       Whereas, developing the alternate engine would cost $2.9 \n     billion dollars over the next two to three years; and\n       Whereas, having multiple engine suppliers will require \n     additional spending for two sets of parts, two production and \n     maintenance lines, and additional personnel and training, \n     which will lead to the production of fewer Joint Strike \n     Fighter planes; and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama, with urging from military \n     officials and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, vows to veto \n     the Defense Authorization Bill if the alternate engine \n     appropriation is included in the bill; and\n       Whereas, defense spending can be used more efficiently for \n     more vital military programs; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     encourage the members of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation to vote against the F-35 alternate engine \n     appropriations measure; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to President Barack Obama, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President pro \n     tempore of the United States Senate, and the members of the \n     Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-l2. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     enact legislation that creates a mortgage foreclosure \n     moratorium; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, the mortgage foreclosure crisis deepened after it \n     was disclosed that several large home mortgage lenders \n     utilized procedures that were legally insufficient to support \n     foreclosures; and\n       Whereas, after problems were revealed about the manner in \n     which foreclosure affidavits were processed, the uncertainty \n     about the true ownership of mortgages, and the questionable \n     legal standing of the entities that initiated foreclosure \n     proceedings, 2 of the nation's largest residential lenders \n     announced that they were each beginning a self-imposed \n     mortgage foreclosure moratorium; and\n       Whereas, although this crisis has its origins in numerous \n     events, practices, and policy decisions, a central element of \n     the foreclosure problem is the Mortgage Electronic Registry \n     System (MERS), an electronic registry of land records which \n     was created in 1998 by the Federal National Mortgage \n     Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n     Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and several large \n     U.S. banks; and\n       Whereas, today MERS is listed as the agent for mortgage \n     lenders on documents for 65 million home loans, which \n     represent about 60% of the mortgages in the United States, \n     and is the agent for about 97% of the home mortgages created \n     between 2005 and 2008; and\n       Whereas, although MERS boasts on its Web site that it \n     ``simplifies the way mortgage ownership and servicing rights \n     are originated, sold and tracked'' which ``eliminates the \n     need to prepare and record assignments when trading \n     residential and commercial mortgage loans'', housing \n     counselors and advocates have documented patterns of abuse \n     and fraud by mortgage servicers that utilized MERS; and\n       Whereas, joining MERS at the center of the foreclosure \n     crisis is the practice of ``robo-signing'', the process of \n     generating thousands of affidavits often by unskilled and \n     unqualified employees who neither read nor certified the \n     underlying documents, which are used to obtain summary \n     judgments in foreclosure proceedings; and\n       Whereas, since a large volume of mortgages were digitized, \n     there have been countless instances of original promissory \n     notes being lost or misplaced; in lieu of producing the \n     original promissory notes in the foreclosure proceedings, \n     servicers simply provided ``robo-signed'' affidavits that \n     state that the loan servicers own the notes; and\n       Whereas, court records in mortgage foreclosure cases have \n     documented egregious examples of: falsified documents; ``fee \n     padding''; misapplication of mortgage payments; and improper, \n     unnecessarily expensive insurance assessments, which, in \n     turn, precipitated defaults on otherwise up-to-date loans and \n     wholly improper mortgage foreclosures; and\n       Whereas, the effect of all of these problems and the \n     resulting consumer confusion cry out for a nationwide \n     moratorium on pending and new mortgage foreclosures; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     urge Congress to enact legislation that creates a mortgage \n     foreclosure moratorium to allow a thorough review of \n     foreclosure actions, provide meaningful opportunities for \n     homeowners to renegotiate their mortgages so as to avoid \n     foreclosure, enact further reforms, and allow the entire \n     housing market to return to normalcy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to President Barack Obama, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President pro \n     tempore of the United States Senate, and each member of the \n     Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-13. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     enact legislation relative to compelling lending institutions \n     to provide mortgagors modifications to home loans before \n     foreclosing on residential properties; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, the United States continues to experience an \n     unprecedented number of mortgage foreclosures and these, in \n     turn, have contributed to a real estate market that has \n     declined in a precipitous fashion; and\n       Whereas, when a residential mortgagor defaults on his or \n     her mortgage, it is common for the lending institution \n     involved to obtain the property back from the mortgagor by \n     way of receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure or by \n     foreclosing and then purchasing the property at a foreclosure \n     judicial sale; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, it is not unusual for a lending \n     institution to have a large inventory of foreclosed \n     properties and this has often led to a lending institution \n     repeatedly resorting to selling a foreclosed property at a \n     ``short sale'' price, which means that the sale price for the \n     individual home is significantly less than the mortgagor's \n     purchase price or even the amount of the mortgagor's \n     outstanding loan at the time of the foreclosure; and\n       Whereas, the credit rating of a person whose home has been \n     foreclosed is often very low and this means that even if the \n     person could afford a more modestly priced property than the \n     foreclosed home, the former homeowner is unable to qualify \n     for a loan under today's standards; and\n       Whereas, if a lending institution that expects to sell a \n     foreclosed residential property at a ``short sale'' price \n     were compelled to offer to the mortgagor modifications in the \n     terms of the mortgagor's home mortgage loan, the mortgagor \n     would, in many cases, be able to afford the home under the \n     modified loan terms and remain in his or her home; in that \n     case, the lending institution would avoid adding to its \n     foreclosed properties inventory, the residential mortgagor \n     might be able to remain in his or her home, the real estate \n     market would be improved because fewer ``short sale'' \n     properties would be depressing home prices on the market, \n     neighborhood blight and crime would be reduced due to the \n     decline in empty and vandalized homes, and all of these \n     circumstances would tend to stem the tide of neighborhood \n     deterioration that is due to the large number of foreclosures \n     and vacancies; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     urge Congress to pass legislation that would compel any \n     lending institution, before foreclosing on a residential \n     property occupied by a mortgagor, to provide the mortgagor \n     with modifications to the home loan that are reasonable for \n     the mortgagor and that include, but are not limited to, an \n     interest rate reduction, a term extension, or other changes \n     to the elements of the home loan, provided that the homeowner \n     is interested in remaining in the home and qualified for the \n     modified loan terms; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to President Barack Obama, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President pro \n     tempore of the United States Senate, and each member of the \n     Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-14. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to public access to the upper \n     Stehekin Valley within the North Cascades National Park; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                 Substitute Senate Joint Memorial 8004\n\n       Whereas, The United States Department of the Interior \n     manages one-fifth of the land of the United States and offers \n     unparalleled recreational opportunities throughout the \n     nation, affirming the nation's intent to set aside certain \n     areas of outstanding scenic and scientific value for the \n     employment of present and future generations; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service is a bureau of the \n     United States Department of the Interior and manages the 394 \n     units of the national park system. Annually, more than 500 \n     million people visit the national parks and monuments, \n     wildlife refuges, and recreational sites; and\n       Whereas, Tourism is an important component of the \n     Washington state economy and is sustained, in part, by our \n     national parks and forests, including Mount Rainier National \n     Park, North Cascades National Park, and the Olympic National \n     Park; and\n       Whereas, National parks provide significant economic \n     benefits to local communities, many of which are almost \n     solely dependent upon visitors to these parks; and\n       Whereas, the North Cascades National, Park honors \n     Washington state's natural and cultural heritage and provides \n     valuable educational and recreational opportunities for our \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, the primitive road to Cottonwood Camp was built \n     over 100 years ago in the late 1800s and existed prior to the \n     creation of the North Cascades National Park in 1968 and the \n     Washington Parks Wilderness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-668); and\n       Whereas, The road leading to Cottonwood Camp provides \n     revered access to exceptional day hikes and fishing \n     opportunities in the upper Stehekin Valley by the residents \n     of eastern Washington, as well as for many people across this \n     state and beyond; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service developed a shuttle \n     system utilizing this primitive road corridor to facilitate \n     more than 2,500 people per year access to the upper Stehekin \n     Valley from eastern Washington; and\n       Whereas, the upper portion of the road between Car Wash \n     Falls and Cottonwood Camp has been closed for many years due \n     to historical flooding events of the Stehekin river in two \n     key areas, destroying a critical link for hikers, horseback \n     riders, and other recreationalists between the Lake Chelan \n     National Recreation area, the Stephen Mather Wilderness \n     trailheads, and the North Cascades National Park; and\n       Whereas, the closure of this primitive road has restricted \n     access for the old and young alike to witness the grandeur of \n     this special place in a day hike from eastern Washington; and\n       Whereas, allowing the National park Service to relocate and \n     rebuild the upper Stehekin Valley Road on higher ground with \n     no net loss of acreage to the park or the Wilderness would \n     preserve the park's existing use as identified in the 1988 \n     Washington Wilderness Act and would mitigate the negative \n     environmental impact of the road washing out;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectively pray that \n     the United States Congress, the United States Department of \n     the Interior, and the National Park Service work \n     cooperatively with Washington state to ensure that all \n     citizens have the continued opportunity to access the upper \n     Stehekin Valley within the North Cascades National Park by \n     reestablishing this primitive road to keep this essential \n     recreational access corridor open: Be it\n       Resolved, that copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of the Interior, the Director of the National Park Service, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from \n     the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-15. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey urging Congress to create a post-deployment \n     assistance program for veterans at Fort Monmouth; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 82\n\n       Whereas, since October 2001 approximately 1,600,000 \n     Americans have been deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom \n     and Operation Iraqi Freedom; and\n       Whereas, for the first time since the Vietnam War, American \n     troops have been engaged in protracted and sustained ground\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n     combat and are under a continuous threat of insurgent \n     attacks; and\n       Whereas, since the deployment of military personnel after \n     September 11, 2001, 5,602 Americans have rendered the \n     ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms and 38,899 \n     Americans have been wounded in combat as of July 22, 2010; \n     and\n       Whereas, countless American soldiers have returned home \n     with post-traumatic stress disorder due to the horrifying and \n     life-threatening experiences they endured during deployment; \n     and\n       Whereas, post-traumatic stress disorder can lead to \n     suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, marital \n     problems, anger management issues, violent behavior, \n     insomnia, employment problems, and even criminal behavior; \n     and\n       Whereas, the impact of deployment to a combat zone is not \n     limited to the soldier, but can also have serious \n     psychological ramifications for the soldier's spouse and \n     children; and\n       Whereas, our nation is forever indebted to our veterans and \n     their families for the tremendous sacrifices they have made \n     to protect the freedoms that all Americans enjoy, and \n     therefore it is our national responsibility to care for \n     veterans and their family members who suffer from \n     psychological conditions caused by deployment to a combat \n     zone; and\n       Whereas, for over sixty years, the U.S. Military Academy \n     Preparatory School at Fort Monmouth has trained some of \n     America's bravest men and women for a life of service and \n     dedication to our country; and\n       Whereas, based upon the recommendations of the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Commission of 2005, the Department of \n     Defense has declared that the military facility at Fort \n     Monmouth, including the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory \n     School, is in surplus to federal needs and will be closed in \n     2011; and\n       Whereas, the school is an ideal place to house a federally \n     funded program designed to assist veterans with post-\n     deployment issues and provide them with the proper \n     psychiatric, psychological, medical and social care that they \n     so clearly deserve; and\n       Whereas, local veteran groups, such as Veterans Helping \n     Veterans, are the ideal types of organizations to administer \n     this program because of their similar experiences and their \n     unique understanding of the stress and trauma caused by \n     deployment to a combat zone: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. The United States Congress and Department of Defense are \n     respectfully urged to create a federally funded program that \n     provides post-deployment assistance for veterans at the \n     current U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School facility at \n     Fort Monmouth.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary of \n     the Senate, shall be transmitted to the President and Vice-\n     President of the United States, the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority \n     Leader of the United States House of Representatives, every \n     member of Congress elected from this State, and the Secretary \n     of Defense.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-16.

A bill to improve the provisions relating to the privacy of \nelectronic communications; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2011, a bill to \nbring our Federal electronic privacy laws into the digital age. Since \nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, was first enacted in \n1986, the ECPA has been one of our Nation's premiere privacy laws. But, \ntoday, this law is significantly outdated and out-paced by rapid \nchanges in technology and the changing mission of our law enforcement \nagencies after September 11.\n  In the digital age, American consumers and businesses face threats to \nprivacy like no time in history. With the explosion of new \ntechnologies, including social networking sites, smartphones and other \nmobile applications, there are many new benefits to consumers. But, \nthere are also many new risks to their privacy.\n  Just in the past few weeks, we have witnessed significant data \nbreaches involving Sony and Epsilon that impact the privacy of millions \nof American consumers. We are also learning that smartphones and other \nnew mobile technologies may be using and storing our location and other \nsensitive information posing other new risks to privacy.\n  When I led the effort to write the ECPA 25 years ago, no one could \nhave contemplated these and other emerging threats to our digital \nprivacy. Updating this law to reflect the realities of our time is \nessential to ensuring that our Federal privacy laws keep pace with new \ntechnologies and the new threats to our security.\n  This bill takes several steps to protect Americans' privacy in the \ndigital age. First, the bill makes common sense changes to the law \nregarding the privacy protections afforded to consumers' electronic \ncommunications. Under the current law, a single e-mail could be subject \nto as many a four different levels of privacy protections, depending \nupon where it is stored and when it was sent. The bill gets rid of the \nso-called ``180-day rule'' and replaces this confusing mosaic with one \nclear legal standard for the protection of the content of e-mails and \nother electronic communications. Under my bill, service providers are \nexpressly prohibited from disclosing customer content and the \ngovernment must obtain a search warrant, based on probable cause, to \ncompel a service provider to disclose the content of a customer's \nelectronic communications to the government.\n  This bill also provides important new consumer privacy protections \nfor location information that is collected, used, or stored by service \nproviders, smartphones, or other mobile technologies. To protect \nconsumer privacy, my bill requires that the government obtain either a \nsearch warrant, or a court order under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, in order to access or use an individual's smartphone \nor other electronic communications device to obtain geolocation \ninformation. There are well-balanced exceptions to the warrant \nrequirement if the government needs to obtain location information to \naddress an immediate threat to safety or national security, or when \nthere is user consent or a call for emergency services. The bill also \nrequires that the government obtain a search warrant in order to obtain \ncontemporaneous, real-time, location information from a provider. There \nis an exception to the warrant requirement for emergency calls for \nservice.\n  To address the role of new technologies in the changing mission of \nlaw enforcement, the bill also provides important new tools to law \nenforcement to fight crime and keep us safe. The bill clarifies the \nauthority under the ECPA for the government to temporarily delay \nnotifying an individual of that fact that the government has accessed \nthe contents of their electronic communications, to protect the \nintegrity of a government investigation. The bill also gives new \nauthority to the government to delay notification in order to protect \nnational security.\n  Lastly, the ECPA Amendments Act strengthens the tools available in \nECPA to protect our national security and the security of our computer \nnetworks. The legislation creates a new limited exception to the \nnondisclosure requirements under the ECPA, so that a service provider \ncan voluntarily disclose content to the government that is pertinent to \naddressing a cyberattack. To protect privacy and civil liberties, the \nbill also requires that, among other things, the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security submit an annual report to Congress \ndetailing the number of accounts from which their departments received \nvoluntary disclosures under this new cybersecurity exception.\n  In addition, the bill clarifies the kinds of subscriber records that \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigations may obtain from a provider in \nconnection with a counterintelligence investigation. This reform will \nhelp to make the process for obtaining this information more certain \nand efficient for both the government and providers.\n  I drafted this bill with one key principle in mind, that updates to \nthe Electronic Communication Privacy Act must carefully balance the \ninterests and needs of consumers, law enforcement, and our Nation's \nthriving technology sector. I also drafted this bill in careful \nconsultation with many government and private sector stakeholders, \nincluding the Departments of Justice and Commerce, State and local law \nenforcement, and members of the technology and privacy communities.\n  I thank the Digital Due Process Coalition and the many other \nstakeholders who support this bill. I also thank the Departments of \nCommerce and Justice for their guidance on how the ECPA impacts the \nneeds of our law enforcement community and our national economy. I look \nforward to continuing to work with all of these stakeholders as this \nbill moves forward.\n  Two decades before Congress first enacted the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, Chief Justice Earl Warren wisely opined \nthat ``the fantastic advances in the field of electronic communications \nconstitute a greater danger to the privacy of the individual.'' This \naptly describes the state of our digital privacy rights today. The \nbalanced reforms in this bill will help ensure that our Federal privacy \nlaws address the many dangers to personal privacy posed by the rapid \nadvances in electronic communications technologies. Accomplishing this \nchallenging task will not be easy. But, with the introduction of the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2011, we take a \nsignificant step towards this very important goal.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1011\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to renew the authority of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to approve demonstration projects designed to test \ninnovative strategies in State child welfare programs; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Finance Committee has a long history \nof working together in a bi-partisan fashion in the interest of \nchildren in Montana and across the Nation. I am happy to have you as a \npartner on child welfare issues. The Fostering Connections to Success \nand Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was a first step on the road to \nreforming the child welfare system. Today, with the introduction of the \nState Child Welfare Innovation Act, we take another step on the path \ntoward making lives better for the children we serve.\n  As the authors of this legislation, we build on the successes of \nwaivers since they were first authorized in 1994. Since that time, \nthese waivers have given States the flexibility needed to focus on new \npractices that prevent abuse and neglect and encourage permanency for \nchildren in our child welfare system.\n  It is important for us to understand that the goal of reauthorizing \nchild welfare waivers is not simply to develop and test new service \ndelivery models, but to put in place sound practices that state \ninnovation has determined to be effective in increasing positive \noutcomes for youth in the system.\n  Our March 11 hearing entitled ``Innovations in Child Welfare \nWaivers'' continued a productive conversation and helped us to craft \nlegislation to address some of the issues facing our Nation's most-\nvulnerable youth. I was happy we were able to welcome two graduates of \nthe foster care system to share their perspectives. In our \nconversations with youth, service providers and local government \nofficials, we have noted the successes of the program in spurring \ninnovative new practices while listening to the concerns regarding the \nchallenges that they have faced in the implementation of these waivers \nand in the system overall.\n  In this legislation, we continued to focus the waivers on producing \nimprovements in three important areas: the prevention of abuse and \nneglect; safety for children at home and in placements; and permanency \noutcomes. We have also asked States to focus on increasing the quality \nof care for kids in the foster care system. We heard from youth about \nwhat is important to them, including knowing what your rights are and \nunderstanding how to reconnect with biological parents in a healthy \nway. I am so pleased we were able to work together to give States the \nopportunity and incentive to address these concerns.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am also pleased to join with my partner \non the Senate Finance Committee in producing bipartisan legislation \nthat gives States increased flexibility to improve the lives of \nchildren and youth.\n  The legislation we will introduce today is the product of many months \nof work and is the result of an open and transparent process bringing \ntogether relevant stakeholders. The Committee has heard from the state \ngroups, the advocacy community and most importantly, youth both in and \nout of the foster care system. Young people in ``Foster Club,'' have a \nsaying: ``Nothing about us, without us.'' We have taken their motto to \nheart and the legislation we are introducing today reflects years of \ninput for youth in and out of foster care.\n  I agree with the Chairman of the Finance Committee when he \ncharacterized the State Child Welfare Innovation Act as another step on \nthe pathway to comprehensive child welfare reform.\n  Comprehensive child welfare reform is desperately needed. The current \nfinancing system is antiquated, relying on an income eligibility proxy \ndating back to pre-welfare reform standards. The majority of Federal \nsupport goes to the least desirable outcome: the placement of a child \nor youth into foster care. Federal priorities should be aligned so that \nStates are able to keep families together, safely.\n  But financing reform is not enough. The underlying foster care system \nneeds to be improved. Often times when children enter foster care, \nsiblings are separated. Children and youth are shuttled from place to \nplace. Their education is disrupted. Their ability to play sports or \nengage in after school\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\nactivities is thwarted. Under the current system, about 30,000 young \npeople a year exit foster care without a permanent connection and are \nat risk for homelessness, incarceration and drug abuse.\n  My State of Utah informs me that with flexibility, Utah can improve \non the State's decade-old effort to protect children and strengthen \nfamilies.\n  As we look to make improvements to our social service delivery \nsystems, we should be relying on the States to chart the way through \nflexibility and innovation. The States are the critical units within \nour constitutional democracy. The States are the laboratories of \ndemocracy, where appropriate solutions to problems are best crafted. \nThe Federal Government needs to give States maximum flexibility in \ncrafting solutions that work for their citizens. I am pleased that this \nlegislation is consistent with that approach and look forward to making \nfurther progress to improve the lives of children and young people.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to introduce this legislation with my partner \non the Senate Finance Committee, the Ranking Member of that Committee, \nSenator Hatch. I look forward to a new chapter in our work together \nthat helps put our Nation's child welfare system on the pathway to \nreform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 1014. A bill to provide for additional Federal district \njudgeships; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, together with my \ncolleague and friend Senator Kyl, the Emergency Judicial Relief Act of \n2011.\n  This bill would create a total of ten District judgeships in five \ncourts across the country that are facing true emergency situations.\n  I want to thank our cosponsors, Senators Cornyn, Klobuchar, Boxer, \nMcCain, Hutchison, and Franken, for working with Senator Kyl and me on \nthis bill.\n  As a member of the Senate, I take very seriously our duty to ensure \nthat the Nation's Federal courts have the resources they need to \nadminister justice for the American people. Our Federal courts bear \nresponsibility for adjudicating criminal cases, deciding civil rights \nand employment cases, and resolving commercial disputes between \ncompanies. When our courts become overburdened, we leave crime victims \nand criminal defendants in limbo and civil litigants without resolution \nto their problems.\n  In the Eastern District of California, the need for additional judges \nis acute. This District, which extends over 87,000 miles and \nencompasses California's Central Valley, faces far and away the worst \ncaseload crisis in the Nation.\n  The District is home to more than eight million Californians, but it \nhas only 6 active District Judges. For three decades, the District's \npopulation has been steadily growing, but the size of the Court has \nbeen unchanged. Congress has not created a permanent judgeship in the \nEastern District since 1978 and the only temporary judgeship created \nwas allowed to expire and never renewed despite repeated attempts by \nmyself and Senator Leahy.\n  The result is unacceptable. As of December 31, 2010, the District was \nmanaging 1,133 weighted filings per authorized judgeship, a caseload \nthat is not only the highest in the Nation, but also 300 weighted \nfilings per judge higher than any other District Court in the country \nand almost three times the threshold at which the Judicial Conference \nrecommends additional judgeships.\n  For everyday life, what this means is that individuals and businesses \nmust wait months, or even years to have their disputes resolved. \nAccording to the most recent statistics, criminal felony cases remained \npending in this court for a median of 12.7 months; and more than 10 \npercent of all civil cases were taking more than 3 years from the date \nof filing to be decided.\n  The delay is not for lack of effort. As Judge Lawrence O'Neill \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009, the Eastern \nDistrict's judges are among the most productive in the Nation, and the \ncourt is utilizing every resource currently at its disposal. The \ncaseloads are simply unmanageable.\n  U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has publicly remarked \non the problems in the District; so has Associate Justice Anthony \nKennedy; and the Judicial Conference of the United States has formally \ncalled on Congress to create more judgeships here.\n  The Emergency Judicial Relief Act of 2011 would provide a narrow, \ntargeted solution.\n  The bill would create new judgeships in five Districts across the \ncountry where the need is most staggering, four in the Eastern District \nof California, two in the District of Arizona; two in the Western \nDistrict of Texas; one in the Southern District of Texas; and one in \nthe District of Minnesota. Additionally, the bill would convert a \ntemporary judgeship in the District of Arizona and one in the Central \nDistrict of California to permanent status. The bill would be offset by \nraising civil filing fees $10, from $350 to $360.\n  Let me be clear. California needs far more judgeships than this bill \nwould create, and I will work with my colleagues to create those badly \nneeded judgeships.\n  In the meantime, this bill is a narrow, emergency measure to provide \nrelief in the handful of Districts that need it the very most.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass this commonsense, good \ngovernment bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently modify the limitations on the deduction of interest by \nfinancial institutions which hold tax-exempt bonds, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Municipal \nBond Market Support Act of 2011. This bill is\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\nsimilar to ones that Senator Crapo and I introduced in the 110th and \n111th Congresses. I am grateful for Senator Crapo's continued \nleadership on this issue, as well as the cosponsorship of our Finance \nCommittee colleagues, Senators Kerry, Snowe, Cardin, and Grassley.\n  Municipal bonds have long played an essential role in financing the \nconstruction, expansion, and repair of schools; highways, roads, and \nbridges; affordable housing; hospitals; public transit; water and \nsewage systems; and community-owned utilities. Since the enactment of \nthe Federal income tax in 1913, Congress has supported the municipal \nbond market by exempting municipal bond interest from taxation. Tax \nexemption confers Federal assistance on State and local capital \ninvestments; it also recognizes that decisions about which projects to \nfund are most appropriately made at the State or local level.\n  Historically, banks were significant purchasers of tax-exempt debt. \nBut the Tax Reform Act of 1986 severely curtailed banks' participation \nby automatically disallowing deductions for interest expense whenever \nmunicipal bonds are purchased. The 1986 Act left an exception only for \nbonds purchased from smaller municipalities, those selling no more than \n$10 million of bonds each year. But because the $10 million level was \nnot indexed to inflation, its purchasing power has eroded significantly \nsince 1986, leaving many smaller governments and non-profit educational \nand health care facilities either to defer projects to comply with this \nlow limit or find non-bank purchasers.\n  I was very pleased that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nincorporated a bill that Senator Crapo and I introduced, the Municipal \nBond Market Support Act of 2009, raising the $10 million small issuer \nexception to $30 million. Additionally, the Recovery Act included a \nprovision ensuring that the small issuer is made applicable at the \nultimate borrower level, so that bonds benefiting non-profit \nuniversities and hospitals will not exceed the limitation merely \nbecause they issue bonds through statewide authorities.\n  Taken together, those steps significantly enhanced demand for debt \nissued by small municipal governments, enabling municipalities across \nthe Nation, and particularly those in small and rural communities, to \nfinance the critical infrastructure projects that play an important \nrole in growing our national economy.\n  In 2009, the dollar amount of bank qualified issuances reached $32.7 \nbillion, double the prior year's level, with more than 6,000 issuances. \nBeneficiaries included a broad range of counties, cities, and school \ndistricts in all corners of my home state of New Mexico. For instance, \nthe proceeds of a $17 million bond issued by Santa Fe County financed \nroads, trails and parks for open space, a fire facility, a solid waste \ntransfer station, water rights acquisition and water projects. The City \nof Artesia completed two bank-qualified transactions, to finance \nbuilding a public safety complex and a new waste water treatment \nfacility. The Bloomfield School District placed $19 million in bank-\nqualified debt to finance capital expenditures. Similarly, in 2010, \nissuances climbed even further, to $36.8 billion, with more than 6,700 \nissuances representing a similarly diverse array of counties, cities, \nschool districts, infrastructure districts, and hospitals across my \nhome state of New Mexico and the country.\n  The ARRA-enacted provisions helped small communities across New \nMexico and the country finance critical infrastructure needs and create \njobs. The higher bank-qualified limit is a great success and deserves \nto be made permanent. The bill that Senators Crapo, Kerry, Snowe, \nCardin, Grassley, and I are introducing today would do just that, \nensuring that smaller governments and non-profit educational and health \ncare facilities can finance their capital needs, particularly in \nperiods of tight credit, and save taxpayer dollars.\n  At least 14 national organizations representing issuers of tax-exempt \nbonds are supporting the Act. These include the American Hospital \nAssociation; American Public Power Association; Council of Development \nFinance Authorities; Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities; \nGovernment Finance Officers Association; International City/County \nManagement Association; International Municipal Lawyers Association; \nNational Association of College and University Business Officers; \nNational Association of Counties; National Association of Health and \nEducational Facilities Finance Authorities; National Association of \nState Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers; National Association of \nState Treasurers; National League of Cities; and the U.S. Conference of \nMayors. I urge my colleagues to join these organizations in supporting \nour bill, to ensure that small municipalities across the country are \nable to finance critical infrastructure projects at reduced costs to \ntheir residents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 187\n\n       Whereas many minority populations disproportionately \n     experience health care barriers, exposure to environmental \n     hazards, mortality, morbidity, behavioral risk factors, \n     disability status, and unique social determinants of health;\n       Whereas the expected increase in minority populations in \n     the near future will impact the entire health system of the \n     United States, making the collective improved health of \n     minority populations even more critical to the Nation;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has \n     identified 6 main categories in which racial and ethnic \n     minorities experience the most disparate access and health \n     outcomes, including infant mortality, cancer screening and \n     management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS \n     infection, and immunizations;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, African-American, American Indian, and Puerto \n     Rican infants have higher mortality rates than White infants;\n       Whereas African-American women are more than twice as \n     likely to die of cervical cancer than White women and are \n     more likely to die of breast cancer than women of any other \n     racial or ethnic group;\n       Whereas in 2006, among adults older than 44, the rate of \n     death from coronary heart disease was 20 percent higher among \n     African Americans than among Whites, and the death rate from \n     stroke was 48 percent higher among African Americans than \n     among Whites;\n       Whereas in 2008, as compared to non-Hispanic Whites, \n     African American adults were 6 times more likely to have \n     medically-diagnosed diabetes, Hispanics were 1.5 times more \n     likely to have medically-diagnosed diabetes, and Asians were \n     1.2 times more likely to have medically-diagnosed diabetes;\n       Whereas African Americans and Hispanics represented only 27 \n     percent of the United States population in 2008, but \n     accounted for an estimated 68 percent of adult AIDS diagnoses \n     and 71 percent of estimated pediatric AIDS diagnoses in 2008;\n       Whereas in 2008, Hispanics and African Americans age 65 and \n     older were less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to report \n     having received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have a life \n     expectancy that is 5.2 years\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\n     less than the life expectancy of the population of the United \n     States overall;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has \n     identified diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasm, \n     unintentional injuries, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease \n     as the 5 leading causes of death among American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives die at higher \n     rates than other people in the United States from \n     tuberculosis, diabetes, unintentional injuries, and suicide; \n     and\n       Whereas health care experts, policymakers and tribal \n     leaders are seeking to address the disproportionate disease \n     burden and lower life expectancy for the American Indian and \n     Alaska Native people by examining various factors that \n     contribute to health status: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports national minority health \n     awareness in order to bring attention to the severe health \n     disparities faced by minority populations such as American \n     Indians and Alaska Natives, Asians, Blacks or African \n     Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, and Native Hawaiians and \n     other Pacific Islanders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/17/senate-section/article/S3062-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
