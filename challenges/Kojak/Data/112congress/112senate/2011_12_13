Madam President, in the last month, Republican leaders have \nrepeated this mantra over and over: We support a payroll tax cut for \nworking families. But we have not seen any proof of this yet. It has \nonly been talk.\n  Senate Republicans have twice voted down their own payroll tax \nproposal, and House Republicans were unable to bring their plan to a \nvote for weeks. We understand they are going to have a run at that \ntonight.\n  I have served in the House of Representatives. When I served in the \nHouse of Representatives, no one would ever consider pushing something \nthrough with a majority of the majority. When I served there, Bob \nMichel was the Republican leader, Tip O'Neill was the Speaker, Jim \nWright was the majority leader and the Speaker, and they always worked \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to get legislation passed. It is only a \nnew thing that now the Republicans are saying: We are not going to pass \nanything unless we can do it on our own. That is unfortunate.\n  I spoke to the Speaker yesterday. I have the highest regard for him. \nI consider him a friend. But I said to him, as seriously as I could, we \nare not going to finish the work for our country this year unless we \nwork together. You cannot pass anything in the House unless you get \nDemocratic votes because anything you pass with strictly Republican \nvotes fails over here; and over\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nhere we cannot pass anything unless we get Republican votes. It is a \nfact of life.\n  We have issues we have to complete this year. So we have to \nunderstand, as I explained to the Speaker yesterday, we are going to \nhave to do this together. We cannot magically say 53 Democrats are \ngoing to pass something here. In the House, even though the Republicans \nhave a majority, they know we have a bicameral legislature, and they \nhave to get something passed over here also.\n\n  I am very disappointed in what the Speaker has done to get a vote \nover there that he thinks will pass. He keeps adding ideological candy \nto the proposal. Last week, they were supposed to have a vote. At that \ntime, they could not get the Republican votes to do it. I suggested \nthey go to either the former Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, or Steny Hoyer, the \nminority leader over there--I do not know the exact title--but the two \nleaders, Pelosi and Hoyer, and the suggestion was turned down.\n  This ideological candy they have added to this bill to get \nrebellious, rank-and-file Republicans on board is not going to sell \nover here.\n  They recently added a provision to fast-track the controversial \npipeline proposal attractive to the tea party, which is not opposed by \nPresident Obama. It is not opposed by him. He is saying this is such a \nbig deal that, for example, the State of Nebraska feels it would--\nunless there are some major changes made--badly damage that most \nimportant aquifer we have in that part of the country. In fact, it is \nprobably the biggest, most important one we have anyplace in the \ncountry.\n  So as was announced yesterday by the Secretary of State, she said: If \nthe Republicans are trying to push this on me, I cannot make a decision \nin 3 months. That is what the legislation calls for. If they do that, I \nwill have to turn it down. The Secretary of State has said that in \nwriting.\n  In effect, as some have said, what they are trying to do is kill the \nhostage. The hostage is the Keystone Pipeline. If they push this \nthrough, it is bound and doomed to failure.\n  But to tell everyone where they are coming from--they, the \nRepublicans--Jim Jordan, who is a Republican Congressman, said about \nthe Keystone Pipeline:\n\n       Frankly, the fact that the President doesn't like it makes \n     me like it even more.\n\n  I repeat, the President has not said he does not like it. But as a \nresult of what has happened in Nebraska and other places along that \npipeline, there are some major studies that need to go forward.\n  President Obama and the Democrats in the Senate have already declared \nthe House legislation dead on arrival. Yet--after weeks of delay--\nRepublicans are going to vote on it tonight. They are wasting time \ncatering to the tea party folks over there, when they should be working \nwith us on a bipartisan package that can pass both Houses. We have \noffered solutions--serious, good-faith proposals with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  If Republicans continue to block these reasonable plans to cut taxes \nfor 160 million workers, there, of course, will be consequences. \nMiddle-class Americans will notice when they open their paychecks in \nJanuary they will have less money to spend, and they will have \nRepublicans in Congress to blame--no one else.\n  Also, for the third time in 2 weeks, Senate Republicans have \nfilibustered a qualified nominee, one of the President's nominees.\n  Last night, they blocked confirmation of Mari Aponte to serve as \nAmbassador to El Salvador--the job she already has. She has done it \nwell for 15 months. She has finalized an important international \nanticrime agreement with the people of El Salvador and forged a strong \npartnership with El Salvador in many different areas during her time as \nAmbassador.\n  I hope the Republicans will come to their senses before her term \nexpires at the end of the year and approve this good woman.\n  I had a Republican Senator come to me after the vote and say he \nbelieved Republicans wanted to vote for her, and he was glad I moved to \nreconsider the vote. I hope that, in fact, is the case.\n  Last week, Republicans blocked the nomination of Richard Cordray to \nserve as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. Mr. Cordray has a record of protecting \nconsumers from predatory lenders.\n  Two days before that, Republicans blocked the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to be on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. She is an \nexceptionally well-qualified person, with a great resume, an \nexceptional legal mind. She was blocked.\n  All three nominees were qualified. All three had bipartisan support. \nAll three were committed, enthusiastic public servants. Yet Republicans \nopposed their nominations for one purely partisan reason: to deal a \nblow to President Obama.\n  This kind of Republican obstructionism has, unfortunately, become \nvery commonplace. But it also has consequences, and Republicans aiming \nto hurt the President have once again harmed our country instead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8494-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today the House of Representatives \nwill vote on a bill that extends the temporary payroll tax cut as well \nas unemployment insurance and which will not add a dime to the Federal \ndeficit. In other words, the House bill would do both of the things the \nPresident and Senate Democrats have described as their top legislative \npriorities before the close of this year.\n  So it was surprising, to say the least, to read this morning that \nPresident Obama and my friend, the majority leader, are now plotting to \nblock this very legislation--even to the point of forcing a Government \nshutdown--over the inclusion of a job-creating measure that the \nPresident thinks will complicate his reelection chances next year.\n  That is what is happening in Washington this week, and the American \npeople need to know about it. So let me repeat what is unfolding right \nnow in the Capitol.\n  Yesterday, the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike--agreed to a spending bill that would \nfund the government through the end of the fiscal year; that is, next \nSeptember 30. Today, Republicans in the House will consider a bill that \ncontains the President's top priorities: an extension of the payroll \ntax cut and unemployment insurance.\n  But here is the problem: The House bill also includes a provision to \naccelerate construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project that has \nbeen described as the biggest shovel-ready project in America. \nEvidently, the President does not want this project approved before his \nelection next November--because a small faction of very liberal voters \nhe is counting on to get reelected do not like the pipeline.\n  We have already had 3 years of environmental studies. This project \nwas not only ready to go from an environmental point of view, it is \nshovel ready. It will produce jobs almost immediately, as soon as the \nPresident signs off on it.\n  Here is a project that would create tens of thousands of jobs, as I \nindicated, right away. It also would not cost the taxpayers a dime to \nbuild. It is being built by the private sector. It would reduce the \nshare of energy we import from unfriendly countries overseas, and it is \na project which everybody from labor unions--labor unions--to the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce says they support because it would create tens of \nthousands of jobs right away.\n  The Teamsters support getting the pipeline started right now. The \nAFL-CIO supports getting the pipeline started right now. This is the \nkind of project the Democrats themselves, including the President, have \nbeen saying all year they want.\n  But the Presidential campaign seems to be getting in the way, to the \npoint that my friend, the majority leader, now says he is willing to \nhold up a bipartisan bill to fund our troops, border security, and \nother Federal responsibilities rather than letting the President\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\ndecide if this pipeline project should move forward.\n  Let me say that again. The President and the Democratic majority \nleader, my friend, Harry Reid, are now saying they would rather shut \ndown the government than allow this job-creating legislation to become \nlaw. That is what would happen if they succeed in blocking this \nbipartisan funding bill from coming to the floor for a vote.\n  House Republicans are giving the President everything he asked for \ntoday. They just think that instead of simply providing more relief to \nthose who continue to struggle in this economy, we should also help \nprevent future job loss and incentivize the creation of new private \nsector jobs, all at the same time.\n  That is what the House bill does. It goes beyond government \nbenefits--beyond government benefits--and takes us a step toward \naddressing the jobs crisis at hand.\n  Most people would view this proposal as evidence that the two parties \nare putting their best ideas on the table and addressing both sides of \nthis jobs crisis--the relief side and the incentive side. Most people \nwould call it a balanced approach.\n  Unfortunately, the President does not seem to be happy these days \nunless he has an issue over which to divide us. If the Republicans are \nproposing it, he is against it, regardless of how many job losses it \nprevents or how many private sector jobs it would help create, and he \nis not even trying to hide it.\n  The majority leader signaled yesterday that he and the President are \nso determined to turn even the most bipartisan job-creating legislation \ninto a political issue that he will ask his Members to hold off signing \nthe government funding legislation--that they have already agreed to on \nan a bipartisan basis--just to hand the President what they view as a \npolitical victory this week.\n  This is not just irresponsible, it is reckless. The House is about to \npass a bill we believe--certainly going to consider today--would help \nworking Americans by extending the temporary payroll tax cut, help \nunemployed Americans by extending unemployment insurance, and which \nwould help Americans looking for work by accelerating the construction \nof the single biggest shovel-ready project in America. This is the \nbiggest construction project in America, ready to go. It only needs a \nsignoff from the President of the United States.\n  It deserves to pass with broad bipartisan support. They had a vote on \nthat earlier this year in the House. Forty-seven House Democrats voted \nto get this project started. So I would suggest that our friends put \nthe political games aside and give the American people the certainty \nand the jobs they deserve. Take up the House bill, pass it right here \nin the Senate, and send it to the President for a signature without \ntheatrics and without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8495-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this morning I rise to speak to the \nquestion the Senate will be focused on over the next day or so \nregarding a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I do not \nthink there is any doubt that we have to reverse this fiscal \nrecklessness, not just for our time but for all time.\n  I have consistently and vehemently championed a balanced budgeted \namendment for the past three decades in both the House and the Senate \nto prevent precisely the kind of fiscal quagmire we are enmeshed in \ntoday, with our Federal Government borrowing an astonishing 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend.\n  In my 30 years in Congress, I have cosponsored a balanced budget \namendment 18 times. I spoke or made statements in favor of it 35 times. \nSo I have had some experience in this battle to get the Federal \nGovernment to balance revenues with expenditures.\n  I learned that without a self-restraining mechanism, the debt over \ntime only goes in one direction--up. In fact, since 1981 we have \ndebated a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the Senate \non five different occasions and on four occasions in the House of \nRepresentatives through 1997. In the meantime, we have seen what has \nhappened with the mounting debt.\n  The impending vote to amend the Constitution represents an \nunambiguous choice between changing business-as-usual in Washington or \nembracing the status quo that we can no longer afford, that has brought \nthis country to the edge of our fiscal chasm; the status quo that has \nled to more than 3 years without passing a Federal budget; the status \nquo that has brought us the first ever downgrade of America's sterling \nAAA credit rating; the status quo that was exemplified by the \nsupercommittee's inability to agree on $1.2 trillion in debt reduction \nover the next 10 years.\n  Now we have two competing balanced budget proposals pending before \nthe Senate in a partisan duel that has become regrettably all too \npredictable in Washington. Our Nation is on the edge of a fiscal cliff \nand 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. There should \nnot be two competing proposals on an issue as critical as our Nation's \nfiscal health and survival.\n  We have been in legislative session for 86 days since July 1st, yet \nwe can only consign about 8 hours or so to the idea on debating the \nmighty question of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Prior consideration in the Senate, whether it was in 1982--it was 11 \ndays; in 1986 it was 8 days; in 1995 it was more than a month; in 1997 \nit was another month. We are giving 8 hours to debate two competing \nproposals rather than addressing the differences through the amendment \nprocess so we can ultimately resolve the question once and for all of \nwhether we should have a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  Amending is consistent with the tradition and practice of the Senate. \nYet, regrettably, we will be denied that opportunity which is \nunprecedented, frankly, on this question. It is a question that clearly \ndeserves much greater deference than is being accorded in the Senate.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote,\n\n       I place economy among the first and most important \n     republican virtues.\n\n  And, yes, that is republican with a small ``r.''\n  He went on to say,\n\n       Public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared.\n\n  He wrote in 1798:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution . . . I mean an additional article taking from \n     the Federal Government the power of borrowing.\n\n  Jefferson understood the perils of borrowing. We are not even going \nas far as Thomas Jefferson was advocating. But he also recognized the \ndanger of debt and deficits do matter.\n  He said:\n\n       One generation should not pay for the debts of another no \n     more than we should pay the debts of a foreign nation.\n\n  Jefferson could not have been more right. We have now entered what \nsome economists have labeled an economic danger zone because our gross \nnational debt is approaching 100 percent of gross domestic product. Our \noutstanding Federal debt exceeds the size of entire economy. There is \nno question that high levels of debt have stunted economic growth, \ncosting millions of American jobs at a time when we are experiencing \nthe longest period of long-term unemployment and the worst \npostrecession recovery in the history of\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\nthis country, the second worst recession in 100 years.\n  Just as disturbingly, the government currently pays $200 billion \nannually in interest to foreign countries--to foreign countries that \nhold our Treasury bonds, countries such as China and Russia. The cost \nof the net increase alone in interest will more than triple in the next \n10 years by the year 2021. That is just the net interest that we will \npay to foreign countries because of our bonded indebtedness.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office's most recent long-term \noutlook states that by 2035 interest costs on our Nation's debt will \nreach 9 percent of the gross domestic product, more than the United \nStates currently spends on Social Security or Medicare. CBO warned that \ngrowing debt would increase the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis \nduring which investors would lose confidence in the government's \nability to manage its budget and government would thereby lose its \nability to borrow at affordable rates.\n  That is exactly what is happening in Europe. It could also happen \nhere at any moment in time. It could be a small item that ultimately \nprecipitates and triggers a debt crisis, that puts this economy in \njeopardy and peril as we experienced so dramatically in America in \n2008. We do not know what all could ignite this explosive growth in \ndebt.\n  If interest rates were just 1 percentage point higher per year over \nthe next decade, the deficit would balloon by $1.3 trillion from \nincreased costs. To put these numbers in perspective, we have to look \nat the past. It took our Nation 200 years to accumulate its first \ntrillion-dollar debt. Yet in just the past 3 years alone the national \ndebt has soared by nearly $5 trillion.\n  Let's just repeat that for a moment. In the first 200 years we \naccumulated $1 trillion in debt. In the last 3 years we have \naccumulated $5 trillion.\n  So when the President stated last summer that we do not need a \nconstitutional amendment to do our jobs, well, not exactly. If that \nwere true, if such an amendment were not required for us to do our jobs \nthen why do we find ourselves wallowing in this economic morass? If \nCongress actually possessed the capacity to forestall the skyrocketing \ndebt of its own volition, why are we mired in a major debt crisis? Why \nare the CBO and other economic forecasters reiterating and underscoring \nthe negative outlook for the future if we do not grapple with this \ndebt?\n  The facts speak for themselves. In 1986 when the Senate failed by one \nvote to pass a balanced budget amendment, the national debt topped $2.1 \ntrillion. In 1995, the Senate failed again by one vote to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, and the national debt at that time was $4.8 \ntrillion. In 1997, when the Senate yet again failed to pass it by one \nvote, the national debt was $5.3 trillion, a number we found \nstaggering. But, apparently, it was not staggering enough, as the \nabysmal track record following 1997 dramatically demonstrates. In 1999, \njust 2 years after that fateful vote, the debt rose to $5.6 trillion. \nBy 2009 it rose to $11 trillion, and last year to $13.5 trillion. \nToday, it is at $15.1 trillion. The bottom line is that from 1997 to \n2011 the national debt has almost tripled.\n  In 1992, when I was serving in the House of Representatives, we \ndebated a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. During one \nparticular balanced budgeted debate on the floor, I said we have no way \nof knowing how bad things might get if we continue without a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Unfortunately, we can only speculate where we would be today had we \npassed that balanced budget amendment some 14 years ago. But we can no \nlonger afford to speculate about where we will be with respect to our \ndebt 14 years from now.\n  Let's not be confused as we hear all of the usual diversionary \nexcuses why this amendment should not pass. I have heard it time and \ntime again over the last three decades, as I have indicated. Those \nexcuses have been reiterated time and again in the nine times it has \nbeen considered between the House and the Senate over the last three \ndecades.\n  I have heard how a balanced budget amendment will be overly \nrestrictive, spending reductions too substantial, and that other \nmeasures would be equally effective without changing our Constitution.\n  Let's not be distracted by the siren's call with the masterful art of \ndeflection. As I recall, during the course of that debate in 1992 in \nthe House of Representatives, I was challenged by a colleague when he \nasked:\n  What if appropriations exceed estimated revenue? What if the \nPresident and Congress underestimate the amount of Federal revenues in \na fiscal year? What if it requires budgetary adjustments as a result of \na contracting economy, or inaccurate estimates?\n  Well, I said at the time, as I do now: welcome to the real world of \nfamilies and businesses in America that are trying to project their \ncosts every day--current costs, future costs, whether they will have a \njob, how much they will get paid, and how much health insurance will \ncost--not to mention the 49 States that have adopted a balanced budget \nrequirement That is the real world, but apparently not in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives. It is one we have long ignored to our \nfiscal peril.\n  These are issues that day in and day out the State capitals have to \ndeal with, as the Chair knows, being a former Governor of New \nHampshire. My husband was a former Governor of Maine, and I know that \nStates have to make tough choices and establish priorities, and they \nhave to understand what is coming in and what is going out. Why should \nthe Federal Government be any different?\n  So now we have a fiscal gap here in Washington where there not only \nis a disparity between revenues and expenditures, but there is also a \nshameful imbalance between the trust people place in us as elected \nofficials and the responsibilities we must carry out if we are to \ndemonstrate the worthiness of that trust.\n  Absent a permanent mechanism that compels and forces the Congress to \nset and fulfill its fiscal priorities, we will blithely continue in our \nwayward practices. Obviously, we only have to learn from the past to \nunderstand the future.\n  Rest assured that we have already tried every statutory mechanism \npossible. Yet nothing we have implemented has withstood the test of \ntime, circumvention, or clever gimmickry to bind both the House and \nSenate to provide continuity from Congress to Congress--nothing.\n  We have witnessed the positive effects of statutory limits with past \nbudget enforcement mechanisms, such as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, \nthe 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, and the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that \ncombined saved upward of $700 billion. Unfortunately, we allowed them \nto lapse because we could do it statutorily. We allowed these efforts \nto wither on the legislative vine. You could not do that with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  When we talk about a deficit reduction package for the future, \nanything we implement today could be undone by tomorrow or by the next \nCongress if we do not have the binding effect of a constitutional \namendment. That is the big difference. Congress does not want its hands \ntied. That is what this is all about--not tying Congress's hands, \nirrespective of the impact on the mountains of debt.\n  We have squandered historic opportunities. I tried for a legislative \ntrigger back in 2001 when we had projected surpluses to pay down the \nnational debt and invest in Social Security and Medicare, but it was \ndismissed and derided. Senator Bayh and I tried to get that through, \nbut people were not thinking about the future. I had seen from our \nexperience in the past and I knew we had to protect the surpluses we \nhad and invest them in the future. That didn't happen. People want to \nspend without restraint.\n  As we sadly know, the promises to get a handle on budget and deficits \nwere empty which is why we have not had budgets in the last 3 years--or \nwhy we passed only one appropriations bill last year for the first time \nsince the 1974 Budget Act. If you have no discipline in the budget \nprocess, you have no discipline in spending and a mounting debt. That \nis the net effect of what has happened over the last three decades.\n  The reality could not be more stark about the necessity for a \nbalanced budget amendment. Yes, we do need one if we are ever to ensure \nfiscal balance and restraint.\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\n  Finally, even Vice President Biden spoke to this issue in 1995, \nexpressing the same frustration I do today. He said:\n  There is nothing left to try except the balanced budget amendment.\n  That is where we are. And I still do not understand why we have two \ncompeting amendments now. It is not as if we don't have differences, \nbut why not amend one legislation? That is what the Senate is all \nabout. Regrettably, it has become another cynical process in the \nSenate, an all-or-nothing proposition, a zero sum game, either your way \nor no way.\n  We have two separate votes on two separate measures, creating a \nparallel universe with two different balanced budget amendments but \nzero opportunity to reconcile our differences. We know what the \nstrategy is. It is called lip service. It is to allow everybody to say \nthey voted for a balanced budget amendment, while the armies of the \nstatus quo employ every weapon to ensure it does not happen.\n  I regret that we are not treating this issue with the deference it \ndeserves--an issue that 70 to 80 percent of the American people support \nat a time in which the U.S. Congress has an approval rating of 9 to 12 \npercent--it varies from day to day. We should be embarrassed about how \nthis reflects on the institution because we are not focusing on the \nissues that matter to people in their daily lives. It matters because \nthey understand that we are shackling future generations.\n  We can either bring disrepute upon ourselves by continuing to \nmortgage our future to cover the fiscal offenses of today or we can \nrise to the occasion and meet our moral responsibility and bequeath the \ngeneration to come a nation unencumbered by the shackles of perpetual \ndebt. The decision is ours and history awaits our answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I inquire of the Chair, how much time remains on our side \nfor morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 39\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am sure I won't need all that time, but I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for as much time as I may use of that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Maine for her leadership on the balanced budget amendment issue \nfor so long now. This is a fight that people have fought for so long \nthat some have become very cynical about whether we will actually ever \nact in a responsible fashion to deal with the runaway debt our country \ncontinues to accrue where about 40 cents out of every dollar being \nspent today is out of borrowed money.\n  We know this is not just a theoretical problem, it is very real. When \nwe look at what is happening in Europe, with countries engaged in \nsovereign debt crises that have made promises they cannot afford to \nkeep, the day of reckoning has come to Europe. The day of reckoning for \nthe United States may not be far behind.\n  I think it is really important to lay a few foundational points. Let \nme start with the preface of the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica because what we are talking about doing is amending the \nConstitution--something we have only done 27 times since the founding \nof our country. But the Constitution of the United States starts this \nway:\n\n       We the people of the United States of America, in order to \n     form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic \n     tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  It is important to recognize that this is a constitution created by \nthe American people. This is not something handed down from on high \nthat we cannot change or should not change. This is our Constitution. \nWe own it. It is within our power to amend the Constitution when \ncircumstances make it prudent for us to do so.\n  Let me also refer to article V of the U.S. Constitution. This is the \nbasis upon which we are seeking to amend the Constitution by this vote \ntomorrow. Article V says to Congress:\n\n       When two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, \n     shall propose amendments to the Constitution.\n\n  And then should the joint resolution pass with two-thirds the vote in \nboth Houses, then it goes to the States, where 38 States--three-\nquarters of the States--would have to ratify that amendment before it \nwould become the fundamental law of the land.\n  There is another provision in article V that I will talk about in a \nminute which allows the States, in the face of inaction by Congress, to \nask for a constitutional convention to be established for that purpose. \nAs I said, I will save that for a later time.\n  Madam President, all 47 Members on this side have cosponsored S.J. \nRes. 10. But this doesn't have to be a partisan endeavor. Indeed, the \nlast time, in 1997, when there was a vote on a constitutional \namendment--and it failed by 1 vote in the Senate--11 Democrats joined \nRepublicans to come within 1 vote of passing that joint resolution, \nwhich had already passed the House of Representatives. So this doesn't \nhave to be and indeed should not be a partisan undertaking.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, what did our financial situation look \nlike in 1997? Our deficit was $107 billion--that is right, $107 \nbillion. Today, it is roughly $1.3 trillion. Our national debt, which \nrecently broke the $15 trillion mark, back then was roughly $5 \ntrillion. So we have seen almost a threefold increase in our national \ndebt since 1997, when we came within one vote of passing a \nconstitutional amendment and sending it to the States.\n  We know that throughout American history, our government has faced \nfiscal challenges. Our Founders had their own when they had to amend \nthe Articles of Confederation to provide for a constitution that \nallowed us to deal with our financial problems. But what are the \ndifferences between those faced by the founding generation and those we \nface today? Back then, government was the solution to the problem. \nToday, the size and growth of government is the problem. The American \npeople understand the difference, clearly.\n  As I said, the American people are absolutely repulsed by the idea \nthat Congress continues to spend 40 cents out of every dollar that is \nspent in borrowed money. I know people like to say this is a problem \nfor the next generation and beyond, but all you have to do is look \nacross the Atlantic Ocean to what is happening in Europe today, and you \nrealize, no, this is our problem, in this generation now, in \nEurope. The ramifications could easily extend to the United States and \ncreate a recession, if not worse, as we go through a sovereign debt \ncrisis.\n\n  The American people also understand this huge debt we bear is a job \nkiller because it dampens economic growth. Only by the private sector \neconomy growing do you get the sort of job creation that will help get \nus out of this mess. Right now, we are muddling along at roughly 2 \npercent of GDP, which is not even enough to deal with the unacceptably \nhigh unemployment. Yes, we had a break last week, when we saw the \nunemployment rate come down a little bit. But a closer look at the \nstatistics reveals it was because so many people had quit looking for a \njob. They gave up.\n  We also know this is a national security risk, this high debt. Former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said the debt \nwas the single largest threat to our national security. This is the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You wouldn't think that was part \nof his portfolio, but that is what keeps him awake at night and worries \nhim--our debt, and the fact that China is the major purchaser of that \ndebt, a country with interests that are not exactly aligned with ours, \nto say the least.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the debt undermines our \ncapacity to act in our own interests and sends a message of weakness \ninternationally. Then there is a quote from a former colleague of ours \nway back in 2006, who said this:\n\n       Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \n     internationally.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial \n     assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's \n     reckless fiscal policies.\n\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\n\n  You may have guessed who said that. Yes, that was then-Senator Barack \nObama.\n  What I think people find absolutely unnerving, disappointing, and, \nyes, even shocking is the lack of leadership on this issue, not only \nbecause our national debt is a growing fiscal problem as well as a \nnational security risk, but it has created a crisis of confidence in \nour political system and people's confidence in the Congress's ability \nto do what we get paid for, what we got elected to do, and that is to \nsolve our Nation's problems, including our Nation's fiscal problem.\n  President Obama understands this very well. That is why he appointed \na bipartisan fiscal commission, now called the Simpson-Bowles \ncommission, which came up with $4 trillion in debt reduction along with \nother recommendations, such as tax reform, which would make us more \ncompetitive globally. But since December 2010, when that report was \nrendered, what has the President done with regard to that report that \nreceived bipartisan support--I believe it was 11 out of the 18 members, \nincluding 3 Republican Senators at that time, Judd Gregg, Mike Crapo, \nand Tom Coburn? The President walked away from it. He walked away from \nit. What did he do when he gave his State of the Union speech shortly \nthereafter? He didn't even mention it.\n  But what did he do? Did he come up with a counterproposal or a \ndifferent proposal? No, he held back, and he waited until the chairman \nof the House Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans passed \na budget out of the House--something that has not happened in the \nSenate for more than 900 days--and then the President attacked. He \nengaged in scare tactics that I believe are beneath the dignity and \nresponsibility of the Office of the President of the United States.\n  Leadership on the national debt has not only been lacking from the \nWhite House, but Congress hasn't done much better. It is true what the \nSenator from Maine has said, the basic conundrum we have had at times \nwhen we have passed deficit reduction legislation, such as Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings and others, is that purely statutory fixes are fine but \nthey can't bind future Congresses. We need a constitutional amendment \nthat will make it the law of the land that cannot be ignored by future \nCongresses. This is what I hope we will do by embracing our \nresponsibility and passing this constitutional amendment.\n  The facts show that the time for a strong balanced budget amendment \nis now. It is today. Joint Resolution 10 is a strong balanced budget \namendment that will protect the American people from runaway deficits \nand reckless spending. If ratified by three-quarters of the States; \nthat is, 38 States, it would require a two-thirds supermajority of \nCongress in both Chambers to approve a deficit in any fiscal year. A \nsupermajority would be needed in times of emergency to approve a \ndeficit in any given year. And it can't be open-ended. It has to happen \neach year a deficit might be run.\n  We can imagine that emergencies could occur, but it shouldn't be a \nroutine matter, as it is now, where we engage in deficit spending. This \namendment would provide exceptions where it would require a majority of \nboth Chambers to approve a deficit during a time of declared war and a \nthree-fifths supermajority in both Chambers could approve a deficit \nduring military conflicts.\n  So for those of our colleagues who are worried this balanced budget \namendment would provide such a straitjacket it would deny us the \nflexibility to respond to our Nation's emergencies, the amendment \nitself provides the means to deal with those extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  Joint Resolution 10 would also require a two-thirds majority to \napprove outlays beyond 18 percent of GDP. That is roughly what our \nrevenue has been--roughly 18 percent of GDP--although today our \nspending is at 25 percent. Because of the recession and the fragile \neconomic recovery, our income is roughly 15 percent. So we are running \nat roughly a 10-percent annual deficit.\n  This amendment would require a two-thirds majority to raise taxes. We \ndon't have a tax problem; we have a spending problem, and we are not \nable to keep up with the promises we have made both in terms of \nentitlements and other spending. This would require the discipline of a \ntwo-thirds supermajority to raise taxes in order to balance the budget. \nSo we could do it when there was a broad consensus that it was \nnecessary but not provide the easy out to raise taxes in order to \nbalance the budget unless two-thirds said that was all right. It would \nalso provide for a three-fifths supermajority to raise the debt limit.\n  Finally--and this is important--the balanced budget amendment, Senate \nJoint Resolution 10, would require the President to submit a balanced \nbudget to the Congress each year. The President has historically \nsubmitted a budget in, I believe, roughly February of each year, but it \nis rarely balanced. Indeed, the last budget submitted by \nPresident Obama was not even brought up for a vote by our friends \nacross the aisle. When we insisted upon a vote on that budget, it lost \n97 to 0. No Democrat and no Republican voted for President Obama's last \nbudget because it continued the reckless spending and the debt.\n\n  It is important this body support a strong balanced budget amendment \nand not a fig leaf or cover vote, because Senate Joint Resolution 10 \nhas the strongest provisions on spending and taxes in addition to \nprovisions that would allow us to balance the budget.\n  I know there is another alternative that will be voted on, but I am \nafraid this alternative offers more of a mirage than a real solution. \nFirst of all, it does not include all spending. This would make \ngovernment accounting even more mystifying, even more opaque, less \ntransparent. Can you imagine families and small businesses doing \nsomething such as that, saying, well, we are going to balance our \nbudget, but we are not going to include all the spending we do? Small \nbusinesses and/or families don't have the luxury of moving things off \nthe balance sheet--in sort of Enron-style accounting--and neither \nshould their government. Either you balance the budget or you do not.\n  The alternative we will be presented an opportunity to vote on, next \nto this strong balanced budget amendment, does not protect the middle \nclass from higher taxes. It would not have stopped the 21 tax increases \nthat were enacted in the first 3 years of the Obama administration. \nThat is right, 21 tax increases during the first 3 years of this \nadministration. The problem in Washington is not that it is too \ndifficult to raise taxes, the problem is it is too easy.\n  A real solution to our debt crisis must permanently change the \npropensity to tax and spend with reckless disregard. A strong balanced \nbudget amendment will actually solve the problem. Let's remember the \ndisease here in Washington the balanced budget amendment is designed to \ncure is out-of-control Federal spending, and big deficits are a symptom \nof that disease. Any doctor will tell you just treating the symptom \ndoesn't cure the disease. Without treating the underlying cause of \nthose symptoms, we would not be making matters better, we would be \ncreating again another illusion of a solution.\n  The strong balanced budget amendment which I support, along with 46 \nof my Republican colleagues--and I hope a significant showing on the \nother side--will treat the disease along with the symptoms. An \namendment with too many exceptions and loopholes will not. A strong \nbalanced budget amendment will reassure financial markets and the \nAmerican people that we understand the magnitude of the problem.\n  As I talk to my constituents in Texas and others around the country--\nwho are the type of people we are looking to to create jobs by making \nthe investments, by starting businesses, and by growing existing \nbusinesses--they tell me with the growing debt, with uncertainty about \ntax policy, with overregulation, and with Washington's unwillingness to \ndeal with a potential sovereign debt crisis, and slow economic growth \nin the private sector, they are going to sit it out. They are sitting \non the sidelines. They are not going to take imprudent risks with the \ncapital they have acquired after going through this recession and \nbecoming leaner and becoming more efficient. They are not ready to get \nback in the game until\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nthey get a signal from us we are actually serious about solving our \nfinancial problems.\n  Unfortunately, the President not only has neglected his own \nbipartisan fiscal commission--the Simpson-Bowles commission--and fallen \nfor the siren call of his political advisers to not offer a \nconstructive solution but, rather, attack those who do, the President \nhas compounded his mistake in this area by saying, ``We don't need a \nconstitutional amendment to do our jobs.'' Presumably, that refers not \nonly to our balanced budget amendment but to an amendment offered by \nthe Democrats as an alternative to the Senate Republican balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The President has claimed a balanced budget amendment is not \nnecessary because ``the Constitution already tells us to do our jobs \nand to make sure that the government is living within its means and \nmaking responsible choices.'' Who does he think he is fooling? Who does \nhe think he is kidding? The President does himself no credit, and, \nindeed, I think demonstrates a lack of commitment to dealing with our \nNation's problems when he says things such as that. He knows the \nexperience of this Congress--whether it is Republican administrations \nor Democratic administrations--has been that without a balanced budget \namendment we simply are not going to have the tools necessary to get \nthe job done.\n  According to one White House spokesman, balancing the budget is ``not \ncomplicated.'' Well, if it is not complicated, why hasn't the President \nof the United States submitted a balanced budget proposal? His last one \nbroke the bank, made the debt worse, didn't solve the problem, and was \nrejected 97 to 0 by a bipartisan vote in this body.\n  The same White House spokesman said:\n\n       All that is needed is that we put politics aside, quit \n     ducking responsibility, roll up our sleeves, and get to work \n     . . . get beyond politics as usual.\n\n  I have to say, what bunk is that? Don't they know how little \ncredibility that sort of rhetoric has when it comes to solving the \nproblem? Just saying it does not make it so. What people are looking \nfor is concrete action by the Congress.\n\n  The strange thing to me was, when the President of the United States \ninvited the Republican conference over to the executive office building \nseveral months back, he asked for ideas around the table. Several of \nus, including me, told him: Mr. President, if you would embrace \nsolutions to solving these problems, we would work with you because we \nare Americans first and not members of political parties first. We are \nAmericans. We didn't come here just to posture and to act like we were \nsolving the problem while doing nothing. We actually are willing to do \nit because, frankly, we are concerned. Many of us are beyond concerned; \nwe are scared. This is no longer just for our children and \ngrandchildren. This is about the present generation. This is about us, \nand all we need to do is look at what is happening in Europe, and it \ncould be our problem in the foreseeable future. I am not just talking \nabout decades, I am talking about years. It could be earlier.\n  Everything we read about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the \nhistory of these crises in the past is, once the public loses \nconfidence in the ability of a sovereign nation to pay back its debt, \nthen things slip away very quickly. We have seen that happen in Europe \nwith the price of the debt on Italian bonds and Greek bonds going \nthrough the roof because people know they can't be paid back. If people \nbegin to doubt for a minute our lack of resolve at dealing with this \nfiscal crisis and this debt crisis, we could well be not just in a \nsimilar mess, we could be worse off because there will be no European \nUnion, there will be no IMF to bail out the United States of America, \nthe largest economy of the world.\n  Let me close for now by saying this is not just a matter of \nconjecture whether a balanced budget amendment would help and would \nwork; 49 different States have some form of balanced budget \nrequirement. Vermont is the only one that does not. Of these, 32 States \nhave constitutional provisions. Additional States require that their \nGovernor actually propose a balanced budget or require a balanced \nbudget indirectly by prohibiting the State from carrying a deficit into \nthe next year.\n  But the point is, this is not just a matter of conjecture and \nguesswork. We know because we have seen at the State level that \nbalanced budget requirements are effective. What do they do? Well, we \nknow State balanced budget requirements are only effective when \ncombined with limitations on taxing and spending. States with \nlimitations on taxing and spending are less likely to raise taxes to \nbalance the budget than States without such a limitation. States with \ntaxing and spending limitations have a slower growth of government than \nStates without such limitations.\n  In other words, States with taxing and spending limitations have a \nslower rate of growth and cost and size of government than States \nwithout them. So we know a balanced budget amendment could work.\n  I hope my colleagues--as frustrated as I am, on a bipartisan basis, \nwith the lack of leadership on this--will show leadership. We shouldn't \njust look for leadership at the White House or anywhere else. We ought \nto look at ourselves in the mirror and ask what can we do to solve this \nproblem. I submit that a balanced budget amendment would go a long way \nto putting us on the path to fiscal responsibility.\n  Now, we can't do it overnight because we didn't get into this mess \novernight. But just as Vice President Biden said back in 1995:\n\n       I have concluded that there's nothing left to try except \n     the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  That is what Vice President Biden said in 1995. I agree with him. But \nif it was true then, it is even more true now.\n  So I hope tomorrow, when we have a chance to vote, we will vote for a \nreal solution--a real balanced budget amendment, S.J. Res. 10--that \nwill avoid the temptation to act once again as if we are doing \nsomething, without actually delivering a solution to the problem, by \nproviding a cover, a fig leaf that, once again, will undermine the \npublic's confidence in our commitment, in our willingness, in our \nleadership when it comes to the Nation's problems. Ultimately, the \nAmerican people will have the final say. If we don't do it tomorrow, \nthen the American people will have another chance to have an election \nand vote and presumably choose people who will deal with the problem.\n  Ultimately, we know--getting back to article V of the Constitution--\nif Congress does not propose a solution, to quote article V, the \nCongress ``on the Application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the \nseveral States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments.''\n  So the final word is not with the Members of Congress. Although we \ncan solve the problem tomorrow if we voted on it and we passed it and \nencouraged our colleagues in the House to pass it, ultimately, there \nwill be an intervening election. But, ultimately, beyond that, the \nConstitution--which is the Constitution of we, the people of the United \nStates--the people of the United States will have the final word, \nwhether it be in the next election in 2012 or by means of a \nconstitutional convention called on the application of two-thirds of \nthe States, of which I am told about 20 applications are already \npending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, I reserve the remainder of my time, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about jobs and \npolitics.\n  There are a lot of folks in Washington who pay lipservice to jobs and \na lot of people that are playing politics.\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\nBut it sure doesn't seem that many folks are interested in doing the \nhard job of creating jobs.\n  Folks all over Montana have been asking for good-paying, liveable-\nwage jobs, the kind of jobs that can't be outsourced, jobs that put \nfolks to work in our forests, jobs that build the energy infrastructure \nthis country needs. Right now there are two proposals that will do just \nthat.\n  First, I would like to talk about my Forest Jobs and Recreation Act. \nThis bill will stabilize the wood products industry in Montana by \nensuring a dependable timber supply that will give certainty to loggers \nin the woods and workers in the mills.\n  This bill will allow for the restoration of 100,000 acres of national \nforest lands in Montana, reducing the chances of out-of-control forest \nfires that could devastate our communities, our watersheds, and our way \nof life.\n\n  Recent data released by the Forest Service shows that wildfires that \nburn where the trees were thinned were less expensive to fight, they \nwere easier to control, and did less structural damage to neighboring \nbuildings.\n  This bill also puts people to work by rolling up roads, improving our \nwater quality, and protecting big game habitat. It protects nearly 1 \nmillion acres for our children and grandchildren in wilderness and \nrecreation areas.\n  This is a bipartisan solution, supported by industry and \nconservationists. It is the product of people who were on polar \nopposites of the issue who came together to find solutions for how we \ncan manage our forests better. We could take a lesson from their \nexample. They brought those solutions to me to be put into law. This is \na bill that will move the country in the right direction with a \nresponsible balanced solution, and it will create jobs.\n  But rather than getting this bill passed, it has become a political \nfootball in the appropriations process. Some House Republicans seem to \nbe more concerned with their own job rather than creating Montana jobs \nby passing my Forest Jobs and Recreation Act. That isn't fair to \nMontanans who are anxious to get back to work, to reclaim a life that \nhas been disappearing in a rapid rate. We lost over 1,700 jobs in the \ntimber industry in 2009, more last year, and still more this year.\n  I would ask folks who are negotiating this final deal right now to \nthink about the folks who are counting on us to set politics aside and \ndo what is right for our country and for Montana.\n  This same logic applies to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Right now, the \nPresident has the power to create jobs by approving this pipeline. He \ncould make the decision to approve this pipeline in the very near \nfuture.\n  Now, let me be clear. He should do it right. Doing it right means \napproving this pipeline while respecting private property rights. I \nsupport the pipeline. But I will never support any corporation--much \nless a foreign corporation--given the right to take away property from \nMontanans or any other American without a fair deal that is negotiated \nin good faith.\n  Doing it right also means ensuring that the highest possible safety \nstandards are followed throughout Montana and rural America. I do not \nbelieve we should have to wait until January of 2013 for a decision \nthat can create American jobs right now. In Montana, we need the jobs. \nWe need the ability to provide incentives to boost production in places \nwhere it makes the most sense, such as the Bakken formation in eastern \nMontana.\n  Now, many folks don't know that the Keystone Pipeline will actually \ninclude an onramp in Baker, MT. That onramp will tap into the booming \nBakken formation, and it will ensure that we are getting the most out \nof American energy resources. That matters to our economy and it \nmatters to our energy and national security. The Keystone XL pipeline \nwill transport North American oil and will help move this country away \nfrom spending billions of dollars per day in Middle Eastern countries \nthat do not like us very much.\n\n  At the same time, I am concerned about the way folks on both sides of \nthis issue are handling it right now. We do not need to entangle this \nissue with a payroll tax in the House bill that would add more than $25 \nbillion to our debt and that would cut Medicare benefits.\n  It is time to quit playing politics and start doing what is right, \nwhether it is the Forest Jobs Act or the Keystone pipeline. It is time \nto move forward, working together to create jobs in this country.\n  Instead, politicians on both sides are using these important items as \npolitical footballs and that is too bad. We should be acting \nresponsibly to create jobs with this pipeline and to put folks back to \nwork in the woods with my bill. Instead, we are watching political \nmaneuvering designed to score points rather than create jobs. We all \nknow this is how Washington acts. The people who lose are the hard-\nworking Americans and Montanans who want to get back to work. They want \nto build and maintain the infrastructure that powers and protects \nAmerica.\n  I am proud to again offer my support for the Keystone XL pipeline and \nthe jobs it will create. We need a quicker decision based on the merits \nof the project. After setting aside their differences and working \ntogether to protect our forests, Montanans also deserve the passage of \nthe Forest Jobs and Recreation Act. Instead of irresponsible partisan \nfights, it is time that Congress finally takes a page from those who \nconstructed the forest jobs bill. They set aside nearly 30 years of \npartisan bickering to find solutions where everyone gives a little and \ngains a lot. It is the right way to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto engage in a colloquy with my colleagues for the remainder of the \nDemocratic time in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8500-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8500-S8507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I understand that some of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate and in the House as well do not believe global \nwarming is real and they do not want to see our country and, in fact, \nother countries around the world take the necessary actions to deal \nwith this issue. That is fine; everybody is entitled to their opinion. \nBut it does seem to me to make a bit of sense that we listen to the \nleading scientists of this world, not only in our own country but \nthroughout the world, and hear what they have to say about global \nwarming and the need to respond.\n  The National Academy of Sciences in our country, the United States, \njoined by academies of science in the United Kingdom, in Italy, in \nMexico, Canada, France, Japan, Russia, Germany, China, India, Brazil, \nSouth Africa, have said ``climate change is happening even faster than \npreviously estimated'' and the ``need for urgent action to address \nclimate change is now indisputable.''\n  They are not talking about whether climate change is real or not \nreal. What they are saying and what scientists all over the world are \nsaying is that climate change is happening even faster than previously \nreported. Eighteen scientific societies, including the American \nGeophysical Union, the American Chemical Society, and the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science said:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  That comes from the American Geophysical Union, the American Chemical \nSociety, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \nFurther, it is not just scientists in our own country or throughout the \nworld who are talking about climate change, who are talking about the \nneed to respond vigorously to that crisis, but right within our own \ngovernment, the U.S. Government, we have the Department of Defense \nsaying:\n\n       Climate change is an accelerant of instability.\n\n  What that means is that when there is drought, when countries around \nthe world are unable to grow the food they need, when there is flooding \nand people are driven off the land, and when people migrate from one \narea to another,\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\nthis creates international instability, which is of concern to the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The CIA understands that ``climate change could have significant \ngeopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, \nenvironmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile \ngovernments,'' as well as ``food and water scarcity.'' That is from our \nown CIA.\n  But it is not just scientists around the world, not just government \nagencies in the United States; you have a business whose life and \ndeath, whose profit margin depends upon understanding this issue and \nthat is the insurance industry. If the insurance industry ends up \npaying out a whole lot of money when there are disasters, they are \ngoing to lose money. They have to understand climate change and the \ndisasters, the weather disturbances that occur from that. This is what \nthey say, in a report from the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners. They found there is ``broad consensus among insurers \nthat climate change will have an effect on extreme weather events.'' \nThese are guys whose profit margins depend upon that analysis.\n  Many Americans and people around the world are concerned about the \nfuture impacts of global warming on our planet and what is going to \nhappen 10 or 20 years down the line, and that is terribly important. We \nhave to understand what climate change is going to do to our planet in \nyears to come. But we do not have to just look at what may happen 20 or \n30 years from today; we should be looking at what is happening right \nnow, in the year 2011. The World Health Organization reports annual \nweather-related disasters have tripled since the 1960s, causing more \nthan 60,000 deaths per year. The National Climatic Data Center shows \nthat 26,500 record-high temperatures were recorded in weather stations \nacross the United States this summer. Texas set the record for the \nwarmest summer of any State since instrument records began in 1895. \nOklahoma set a record for its warmest summer, exceeding records set \nduring the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. Drought in Texas has led to \nwildfires that destroyed more than 1,500 homes in Texas.\n  A 2010 heat wave in Russia killed 56,000 people. The heat wave in \nEurope in 2003 killed 35,000 people. We can look at Pakistan, which in \n2010 had a record 129-degree temperature. All of that is consistent \nwith what scientists have been warning us about for years.\n  NASA's James Hansen said climate change ``loads the dice'' in favor \nof more extreme weather events. Hansen said the answer to whether \ngreenhouse gas emissions are contributing to these extreme weather \ndisturbances is ``yes . . . humans probably bear responsibility for the \nextreme event.\n  There is much to be said. I think a number of colleagues are coming \nto the floor. But I want to yield the floor to a Senator who has been \nan absolute leader on this whole issue, fighting for the environment, \nand that is Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the statement my colleague has made is \ntruthful and important, but there is absolutely more to this story even \nthan that. At another time I will discuss at greater length the oceans \ndimension to what is happening to our planet as a result of the carbon \npollution we are emitting at literally unprecedented levels in human \nhistory. But for now let me say it is very severe, very dire, and to \neveryone who is listening and paying attention, the ocean is emitting \nwarning signs that we disregard at our peril.\n  In addition to the threat of environmental harm, connected to the \nproblem of carbon pollution is a huge opportunity and that is the \nopportunity of clean energy. Clean energy will drive the decades to \ncome. Clean energy jobs can and should be powering our economic \nrecovery.\n  We are in a race right now. We are in a race for dominance and for \npreeminence in the clean energy economy that is emerging. All around \nthe world, other countries see it. They are competing in that race. \nThey are putting everything they have into winning that race. But \nbecause we have a political system that is still listening to the \ndirty, polluting energy industry and using the politics of Washington \nto interfere, we are constantly having to fight to stay even. One of \nthe things we are fighting right now to preserve is the section 1603 \nTreasury grant program, which will expire at the end of this year if we \ndo nothing. This program has been vital for our renewable energy \nindustry. It has leveraged nearly $23 billion in private sector \ninvestment, supported 22,000 projects which collectively power more \nthan 1 million homes. This is big. This is no longer some tiny little \ncottage industry. The National Renewable Energy Lab estimates the 1603 \nprogram has supported up to 290,000 U.S. jobs.\n  If we look more largely at the renewable energy sector, renewable \nenergy is more labor intensive, creates more jobs than fossil fuel \nenergy per dollar invested, creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy \nper megawatt generated, and the clean economy as a whole, including \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency and environmental management, \nemploys 2.7 million workers in this country. It is more than the fossil \nfuel industry, but the fossil fuel industry owns this town and they \nkeep stepping on this larger, growing, clean energy industry.\n  We are seeing it, unfortunately, out there in real life. Americans \ninvented the first solar cell in 1995. America had 40 percent of the \nglobal manufacturing volume. We are now down to 7 percent of the global \nmanufacturing volume of solar cells.\n  China is investing $20 billion more in clean energy every year to \naccelerate ahead of us. European countries have feed-in tariffs so \ninvestors can know what their clean energy product will sell for and \nthat is attracting capital and growth there, and we simply are not \nkeeping up. We are now, in the United States of America, the home to \nonly 1 of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers. This is an unhealthy \nplace to be and we need to get back into this fight. The mature \nindustries that America leads have demonstrated the important role of \ngovernment intervention at their early days. Our commercial aviation \nindustry has been the envy of the world through its entire history. The \nUnited States of America subsidized airmail to help support this \nfledgling industry. They purchased planes for military purposes to help \nsupport it and supported it with aeronautics R\n\n  The same thing should be happening in clean energy, and we need to \nwork very hard to make sure this 1603 Treasury grant does not die on \nthe cutting room floor as we come to the end of this year. If it does, \njobs will go with it. There will be an immediate response. Projects \nwill be terminated, people will be laid off, divisions of companies and \nsmaller companies will close, and it is an unnecessary, self-inflicted \ninjury we should avoid.\n  Let me bring it home. In Rhode Island this project has facilitated \nsolar panel installation on three new bank branches. The TD Bank has \nopened in Barrington, East Providence, and Johnston, RI. Those projects \ncreated jobs, put people to work, and lowered the costs of their \nelectrical energy. Step by step it gets us off foreign oil and these \nforeign entanglements to defend our supply.\n  The city of East Providence, RI, is in the middle of planning a 3-\nmegawatt solar project on an old landfill, land that had gone out of \nuse effectively but now will be generating power for that city. \nConstruction has also begun on three wind turbines at the Fields Point \nwastewater treatment facility in Providence. The turbines will meet \nmore than half of our big water utility's energy needs.\n  A company called Hodges Badge--if your child has ever won an award in \na track meet, in a horse show, or in a school production, they probably \ngot a ribbon for it, and that ribbon was probably made by Hodges Badge. \nIt is a great Rhode Island company. It has 95 employees. They have gone \ncompletely clean energy, and they are doing that to protect those 95 \njobs. They are doing it to lower their energy costs, and they are doing \nit to do the right thing.\n  I salute Senator Sanders for his eloquence on the real problem of \nclimate change and the campaign of lies and propaganda that has \ninterfered with our ability to deal with what is a real and emerging \nproblem, and also to\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\npoint out that the second step in this is that there are jobs and there \nis economic success behind the clean energy industry that will lead us \nout of the predicament we are creating for ourselves because people \nhere are in the thrall of the polluting industries.\n  I thank Senator Sanders very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to reiterate the very important \npoint that Senator Whitehouse has made. This struggle is not only to \ntransform our energy system, to move away from fossil fuel, and to end \nthe absurdity of importing over $300 billion a year in oil from Saudi \nArabia and other foreign countries and move toward energy independence, \nthis effort is to cut greenhouse gas emissions so that we save the \nplanet. This effort also has to do with creating jobs in the midst of \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  I hope that every Member of the Senate is on the side of the American \nworkers in helping us to grow sustainable energy companies so we create \nthe jobs we need in this country rather than let China and other \ncountries dominate those industries.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to give the floor over to the \nchairperson of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, certainly \none of the great environmental leaders here in the Senate, Senator \nBarbara Boxer of California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the time remaining in Senator \nSanders' block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 36\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator satisfied if I take about 7 minutes?\n  Mr. SANDERS. That would be fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say how proud I am of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. To be chairman of the committee that has such \nincredible Senators, such as those you have heard from--Senator \nSanders, Senator Whitehouse; we also have Senator Cardin, Senator \nCarper, Senator Baucus, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Merkley, and \nSenator Lautenberg. I hope I am not leaving anyone out. These are the \nenvironmental voices, the commonsense voices for jobs, for clean \ntechnology, for a bright future for our Nation, so to be the chairman \nof that committee is an honor beyond my every expectation.\n  It is not to say we don't work with Republicans; we do on public \nworks matters. We work very well with Senator Inhofe and his team of \nRepublicans on public works, but when it comes to the environment, \nthere is nobody home over there. As a matter of fact, they do harm.\n  Today I am going to talk about the need to create jobs through this \nsector, but I also want to say, while my colleagues are here, an \ninteresting development that has happened on the payroll tax cut bill \nthat the House is about to pass. We have a kind of inside-the-Beltway \nterm when extraneous provisions are added to a bill that will bring \ndown the bill, and we call that a poison pill amendment. I have never \nsaid to you when I coined that phrase ``poison pill'' amendment that it \nis literal. In this case they have attached to the payroll tax cut--\nwhich is on the one hand giving a tax cut to the middle class--a \nliteral poison pill by rolling back a Clean Air Act provision that will \nrequire a very small percent of the boilers in this country to cut back \non the filthiest of all pollution, including mercury, arsenic, and \nlead. I will say that again: mercury, arsenic, and lead.\n  If I were to stop anyone in the street, they don't need a degree in \nscience to know if those are good things or bad things for you. They \ndidn't even have to see the movie ``Arsenic and Old Lace'' to know that \narsenic is bad. Lead damages the brains of our kids. Mercury has \nhorrible impacts, particularly on children. So they have attached a \npoison pill, literally, because it will kill 8,100 more people than \notherwise would have been killed from pollution. They have attached \nthat to the payroll tax cut. How is that for a Christmas gift? Hi, I am \nyour Senator, here is a tax cut for you of about $1,000, but, sorry, \nyou might die from breathing in too much poison in the form of mercury, \nlead, and arsenic.\n  That is what is going on here. Honestly, we have asked for a lot from \nSanta in our day, but we never asked for lead, arsenic, and mercury.\n  The reason Senator Sanders took to the floor today--and the reason I \nam proud to be here--is because we all say here in this Chamber that we \ncare about jobs. We all say here in this Chamber that we want to be \nenergy independent. We should all add that we want less pollution. Our \ncolleagues on the other side never mention it. We should add that we \nwant less carbon pollution, which is leading us to extreme weather \nconditions, climate change, but they don't say that. We say that.\n  How do you do it? Well, there are many ways. One is to enforce the \nclean air laws we have, by the way, that will help get carbon out of \nthe air. But a very easy way as we extend this payroll tax cut, which \nwe all want for our middle class, is to say we should extend those \nclean energy tax breaks that allow us to move toward innovation. You \nhear a lot of talk from the other side about how solar energy is in \ndecline and they talk about Solyndra and the problems there. Let me \ntell you something, that mindset would mean we never would have made it \nto the Moon because we know what happened to Apollo 1. It was not good. \nWe didn't walk away from going to the Moon. We expected there would be \nproblems with the program that we put together. That is why we had $2 \nbillion to offset any companies that might not make it. Do we stop \ncancer research because a lot of the scientists' leads don't pan out? \nWe don't walk away from cancer research. But our friends on the other \nside, the minute they can seize on something to walk away from clean \nenergy, they do. I have come to the conclusion that there is only one \nreason for it, and that reason is they represent--and this is my \nopinion--big oil, big polluters, the people who, over the years, have \ntried to stop us from moving away from those fossil fuels.\n\n  All you have to do is read the history books to see how big oil \nteamed up with the auto industry to take out all the railroad tracks \nthat they could to stop the competition. All you have to see is the \nmovie ``Who Killed the Electric Car.'' You cannot even find those GM \ncars. They took them and literally flattened them and they bought time \nfor the gas-guzzling cars until finally, with President Obama's \nleadership, we were able to influence the companies in Detroit to make \nthem understand the very simple fact that if we move to cleaner burning \nfuels, if we move to fuel economy, they are going to make a lot more \nmoney because that is the future.\n  What we face here instead of seeing an extension of the clean energy \nprovisions to help us move toward solar, to help us move away from \nfossil fuels, to help us get a better balance of payments, to move away \nfrom the Middle East dictators, we see nothing. What do we see? We see \nanother poison pill in another one of their bills over there to repeal \nthe standards for light bulbs. What are these people thinking? They \nneed a light bulb to go off in their own head. We have to move toward \nenergy efficiency. It is a win-win-win.\n  I am going to talk about California in my remaining time. We have \nseen great progress there. We have added 79,000 jobs in the clean \nenergy sector in the past 7 years, and that clean energy sector remains \none of the most promising industries in our State, and people are \nhappy. We are going to put a million solar rooftops on in California. I \nknow Senator Sanders has been calling for this for years. California is \ndoing it with Governor Brown leading the way with the legislature. Do \nyou know what that means? It means that people are going to work in \nCalifornia. You cannot be in China unless you have an extremely long \narm and put a solar rooftop on in Los Angeles or in Riverside County or \nSan Francisco or San Diego. So we need to reauthorize 1603, the \nTreasury grant program, which allows developers to receive a grant in \nlieu of a credit, in lieu of a writeoff. That means they will get the \nfunding and they can move forward with their front. It is leveraged by \n$22 billion in private sector investment. If we extend the program, we \nwill be creating 37,000 jobs.\n  I have to ask rhetorically: What is wrong with the Republican Party \nthat they don't understand that when you extend these kinds of tax \ncredits, you move away from the dictators who control the oil supply \nand who would turn on us in a minute, and instead you create jobs here \nat home, the air is less\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\npolluted, the kids have less asthma? There are very few things that we \ncould come to the floor and say are such a win-win-win.\n  There is 48-C in the manufacturing tax credit, which provides a \ncredit for facilities that make clean energy equipment components. We \nknow there is a demand for these programs.\n  I want to say to my colleagues on the other side who are on the EPW \nCommittee, I hope they will join me at 2:30 p.m. We are going to have a \npress conference to talk about the need for protecting the air that we \nbreathe and for the need to see a payroll tax cut that doesn't come \nover here loaded down with things that are going to lead to riders that \nare unrelated, that are going to lead to the death of our people.\n  Simple message: No poison pills that poison the people, please. I \nhope they will join me there. But I want them to know, and I want to \nsay, Senator Whitehouse organized a letter that was critical to get all \nof us on this letter. I ask Senator Whitehouse, through the Chair, how \nmany signatures did you get?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We had over 30. The number is still climbing \nretroactively--but more than 30 Democratic Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is a very large number of Senators to have put their \nnames on a letter. These letters are hard. People are busy. They do not \nhave time. You get 30 names on a letter, and we say: Extend these tax \ncuts for jobs, for the environment, for all the good things. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the letter Senator Whitehouse organized \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington. DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking, Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Baucus, and Ranking Member Hatch: We are writing to \n     urge your support for the extension of key expiring clean \n     energy and efficiency tax provisions that create jobs and \n     protect our environment. Allowing these incentives to expire \n     would harm the U.S. economy, eliminate tens of thousands of \n     jobs, and sideline billions of dollars of private sector \n     capital investments. In particular, the renewable energy \n     industry would be negatively impacted by an expiration of \n     provisions.\n       One of the most critical tax provisions set to expire this \n     year is the 1603 Treasury Grant Program (TGP), which has \n     provided a way to finance renewable energy projects despite \n     the breakdown of tax equity markets and has proven a \n     particularly effective job creation tool. Over the last two \n     and a half years, the TGP has leveraged nearly $23 billion in \n     private sector investment for 22,000 projects in every state \n     and across a dozen clean energy industries, including solar, \n     wind, biomass, fuel cell, combined heat-and-power, and \n     hydropower projects. To date, the program has spurred the \n     construction of sufficient new generation capacity to power \n     more than one million American homes and has supported \n     roughly 290,000 U.S. jobs. Allowing the TGP to expire would \n     shrink financing available for renewable energy projects by \n     52 percent, according to a July 2011 survey by the U.S. \n     Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance. This would kill \n     tens of thousands of jobs across all clean energy industries \n     and states.\n       We have seen what happens when these credits expire. The \n     biodiesel production tax credit lapsed in 2010, and fuel \n     production dropped dramatically, shuttering dozens of plants \n     and putting thousands of people across the country out of \n     work. Given our nation's urgent need for more transportation \n     fuels from domestic sources that are both secure and \n     environmentally sound, we cannot let that happen again. With \n     the biodiesel tax credit in place again for 2011, domestic \n     production has more than doubled, supporting more than 31,000 \n     jobs and generating at least $3 billion in GDP and $628 \n     million in federal, state, and local tax revenues.\n       We also support additional funding for the Advanced Energy \n     Manufacturing Tax Credit (48C), which has leveraged timely \n     private investments in new, expanded, or re-equipped advanced \n     energy manufacturing projects throughout the country. The \n     program has been able to leverage $5.4 billion in private \n     investment, boosting growth and creating new U.S. \n     manufacturing jobs producing components and equipment for the \n     burgeoning global renewable energy industry. Applications to \n     the program have far exceeded the program's original \n     allocation, indicating a tremendous potential for continued \n     investment and job creation in the manufacturing sector. \n     Without funding for programs like this, we effectively \n     forfeit clean energy manufacturing to countries like China.\n       The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has facilitated tens of \n     billions of dollars in new clean energy generating capacity, \n     particularly in the wind industry, which has created \n     thousands of new manufacturing and construction jobs in many \n     of the hardest hit parts of our country. Last year, new wind \n     power represented over one-third of all new U.S. electricity \n     generation capacity. This is an industry in which the United \n     States currently has a trade surplus with China, Brazil. and \n     other fast-growing developing economies. We need a timely \n     extension of the PTC to keep these jobs in the U.S. and \n     provide certainty to investors.\n       These expiring tax provisions have demonstrated their \n     effectiveness in catalyzing private investment and job \n     growth, spurring U.S. technological innovation, and \n     diversifying our nation's energy mix. In light of the \n     critical role these incentives and others have played in \n     fostering U.S. economic growth, now is not the time to let \n     them lapse, even temporarily. We believe it is important \n     these critical tax provisions be part of any year-end tax \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       John F. Kerry, Sheldon Whitehouse, Barbara Boxer, Jeff \n     Bingaman, Maria Cantwell, Benjamin L. Cardin, Jeanne Shaheen, \n     Robert Menendez, Bernard Sanders, Richard Blumenthal, Dianne \n     Feinstein.\n       Mark Udall, Sherrod Brown, Ron Wyden, Daniel K. Akaka, \n     Debbie Stabenow, Tim Johnson, Tom Udall, Jeff Merkley, \n     Michael F. Bennet, Mark Begich, Amy Klobuchar.\n       Jack Reed, Patrick J. Leahy, Al Franken, Joseph I. \n     Lieberman, Tom Harkin, Christopher A. Coons, Frank R. \n     Lautenberg, Barbara A. Mikulski, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Carl \n     Levin, Bill Nelson, Daniel K. Inouye.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would yield back to our leader on this important block \nof time. I would yield my time back to Senator Sanders. We are \ndetermined to get this done right for the American people.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Boxer very much, not only for her words \nbut for her leadership on the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I wish to reiterate a very important point Senator Boxer made. She \nreminds us of great moments in the history of this country. This \ncountry, with great difficulty but persistence, built a railroad ahead \nof the rest of the world that went from the east coast to the west \ncoast. It was not easy. This country led the world in putting a man on \nthe Moon. It was not easy, at great expense, difficulties, but we did \nit. Does anybody not think this country can lead the world in \ntransforming our energy system away from polluting fossil fuels to \nenergy efficiency, to sustainable energies such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, biomass, other technologies? Can we not lead the world in \nmaking our own country more energy efficient, making our air cleaner \nbut also in creating large numbers of jobs as we weatherize our \nbuildings, as we build the solar panels we need to build the wind \nturbines, as we put more engineers and scientists to work to help us in \nthis energy transformation.\n  I wish to pick up on a point Senator Whitehouse made a moment ago, \nwhich is that while we talk about energy transformation, while we all \nunderstand that over a period of years, the oil industry, for example, \nhas received billions and billions of dollars of permanent tax breaks, \nwhat we are fighting for right now is to see that the 1603 renewable \nenergy grant program is renewed. As Senator Whitehouse indicated, 1603 \nallows renewable energy developers to get a grant instead of a tax \ncredit. Since 2009, when this program was enacted, it has leveraged \nnearly $23 billion in private investment supporting 22,000 projects in \nall 50 States and supported approximately 290,000 jobs, according to \nthe National Renewable Energy Lab. Since 1603 was enacted, solar jobs \ndoubled to more than 100,000 jobs.\n  We have to make sure that before Congress adjourns for the Christmas \nholidays, we renew 1603. It is enormously important for the renewable \nenergy industry, enormously important for jobs in our country.\n  With that, I would yield the floor to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator Sanders. Senator Cardin has arrived \nso I will hand off to him in a moment. But to the Senator's point about \nthe imbalance between support for the fossil fuel energy industry and \nthe renewable energy industry; the first being one that hurts our \nnational security, pollutes our air and costs a fortune and\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nis phasing out and the second being one that is growing, that is clean, \nand that is the way of the future.\n  According to the Environmental Law Institute, the U.S. invested \nalmost six times more in subsidies for fossil fuel from 2002 to 2008 \nthan we did in renewable energy. So by a factor of six times, we have \nour thumb on the scales supporting the old dirty industry against the \nnew, rather than supporting the new the way our international \ncompetitors are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a response from Secretary Chu to a \nletter Senator Sanders and I and other Senators wrote to him about the \nstatus of and success of our clean energy investments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2011.\n     Hon. Bernard Sanders, Hon. Jeff Bingaman, Hon. Debbie \n       Stabenow, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman, \n       Hon. Christopher Coons, Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse, Hon. \n       Richard Blumenthal, Hon. Jon Tester, Hon. Patty Murray, \n       Hon. Mark Udall, Hon. Patrick Leahy, Hon. Tom Udall, Hon. \n       John Kerry, Hon. Carl Levin, Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr., \n       Hon. Tim Johnson, Hon. Michael F. Bennet, Hon. Jack Reed, \n       Hon. Daniel Akaka, Hon. Jeff Merkley, Hon. Kirsten E. \n       Gillibrand,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: Thank you for your October 5, 2011 letter \n     requesting an update on United States investment in clean \n     energy technology and job creation. I strongly agree that the \n     United States faces a critical decision point in our Nation's \n     energy future if we hope to compete in and win the global \n     clean energy economy. As President Obama has said, ``The \n     country that leads the clean energy economy will lead the \n     21st century global economy.''\n       The annual global clean energy market is estimated to be \n     worth more than $211 billion, up 32 percent from 2009. The \n     global market for solar photovoltaic systems alone represents \n     an $80 billion market this year. It is estimated that the \n     global renewable energy market will grow to $460 billion by \n     2030, with a cumulative investment from 2010 to 2030 of \n     approximately $7 trillion in new capital. This increased \n     market is being driven by increased global demand and \n     technological advances that are rapidly making renewable \n     energy cost competitive with fossil energy.\n       The economic stakes are high. However, we are currently at \n     risk of falling behind our global competitors who are seizing \n     the opportunity by investing more heavily and establishing \n     market policies that give them a strategic advantage. The \n     United States currently ranks first in only one of the top \n     ten clean energy benchmarks. Thanks to our world-class \n     universities and national labs, we still hold an edge in \n     technology innovation, but we are falling further and further \n     behind in key areas such as manufacturing competitiveness and \n     exports. Countries like China are moving forward with large \n     investments.\n       There are some who say that we cannot compete with China. I \n     respectfully disagree. However, time is of the essence. I \n     would like to work with you to establish a comprehensive \n     energy policy that targets all aspects of the energy value \n     chain--innovation, manufacturing, deployment, financing, and \n     markets--to provide the certainty American businesses and \n     entrepreneurs need to compete with their global counterparts. \n     Without a comprehensive, long-term energy policy framework \n     focused on this full energy value chain, American business \n     will continue to move capital and jobs overseas to take \n     advantage of more business friendly policies.\n       The questions you have posed in your letter are very \n     important to understand America's current position in the \n     clean energy economy, including where we have been successful \n     and where we need to improve. While these questions are very \n     complex, I have attempted to succinctly answer each of them \n     as directly as possible. I also have included additional \n     background information related to each question you raise to \n     provide a fuller understanding of our domestic clean energy \n     landscape.\n       I know that you care deeply about these issues and that you \n     understand the opportunity presented by the growing demand \n     for clean energy technologies. There is a growing debate in \n     Congress on issues relating to the clean energy innovation \n     chain and the steps we can take to position America to win \n     the clean energy technology race. I want to make sure you \n     know that I am personally available, along with my senior \n     staff and the full resources of the Department to assist you \n     in gathering information and in providing technical \n     assistance on these issues. I am fortunate to have a \n     thoughtful team of professionals who wrestle with these \n     issues every day, and I would be happy to make them available \n     to you.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond and for your \n     commitment to America's energy future. I look forward to \n     working with you and your colleagues to help recapture our \n     leadership role in clean energy by establishing smart \n     policies to win the clean energy technology race.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven Chu.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Questions and Answers\n\n       1. How have the investments that the United States has made \n     over the last several years contributed to the growth in \n     energy efficiency deployment and renewable energy generation, \n     and what projections can you share for the near future?\n       Jobs: The clean energy sector directly employs nearly 1.6 \n     million people in the U.S. The Recovery Act alone has already \n     saved or created over 225,000 clean energy jobs and is \n     estimated to add an additional 800,000 jobs by the end of \n     2012. As of August 2011, the U.S. had created over 100,000 \n     solar-focused jobs and at least 75,000 jobs related to wind \n     installation in 2010.\n       Renewable Energy: Through investments in clean energy, the \n     United States is on track to double U.S. renewable energy \n     generation in four years (from 71 TWh in 2008 to 178 TWh in \n     2012). For example, the highly leveraged 1603 grant in lieu \n     of tax credit program has led to the deployment of more than \n     5,000 renewable energy projects across the country. These \n     projects have enough capacity to power more than one million \n     homes.\n       Energy Efficiency: Over the last two years, the Department \n     of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program has helped more \n     than 750,000 low-income households save on average more than \n     $430 per year on their energy bills. The program has \n     supported over 14,000 jobs across the country and thousands \n     of additional jobs throughout the supply chain. Residential \n     efficiency standards are currently saving consumers about $25 \n     billion per year in energy costs--a savings of approximately \n     $250/year per household. A recent analysis estimates that \n     appliance standards have created an industry supporting \n     340,000 jobs, with expected growth to 380,000 jobs by 2030.\n       Transportation: Three years ago, American businesses \n     accounted for only two percent of the market for advanced \n     batteries. We are now on track to establish annual production \n     capacity for 500,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, \n     helping support a projected total of 1 million electric \n     vehicles on the road by 2015. New fuel economy standards will \n     save American families an average of more than $8,000 at-the-\n     pump for cars in 2025 compared to those in 2010. These \n     improvements will reduce America's dependence on oil by an \n     estimated 12 billion barrels, and, by 2025, reduce oil \n     consumption by 2.2 million barrels per day--enough to offset \n     almost a quarter of the current level of our foreign oil \n     imports.\n       Near-Future Projections: All the trends suggest that the \n     cost of electricity from solar and onshore wind is either \n     already or will soon be cost competitive without subsidies \n     with electricity from natural gas in many parts of the \n     country. This will result in sharp increases in renewable \n     energy deployment. Between 2010-2030, estimates suggest a 7.9 \n     million cumulative net job-years of direct and indirect \n     employment to be created as a result of this electricity \n     supply forecast. The renewable energy and energy efficiency \n     sectors are estimated to see a 6.4 million net job-\n     years increase (an 80 percent share of total increase) \n     during this period, with the rest of the increase mostly \n     coming from natural gas.\n       2. In particular, how is clean technology playing a role in \n     rebuilding our manufacturing base, and creating jobs in \n     construction and manufacturing supply chains?\n       Roughly 26 percent of all clean energy jobs lie in \n     manufacturing. On average, clean energy manufacturing exports \n     represent roughly twice the value of traditional exports on a \n     per job basis ($20,000 versus $10,000). Between 2003 and \n     2010, technology manufacturing produced explosive annual job \n     growth rates (e.g. 18.4 percent for solar thermal, 14.7 \n     percent for wind, 10.7 percent for solar photovoltaics, \n     etc.).\n       3. How do our policies and investments in clean technology \n     compare to foreign competitors, how would proposed reductions \n     in clean energy research and development funding impact \n     American competitiveness, and do American manufacturers have \n     a level playing field?\n       The table gives a global score card for clean energy \n     investments. The U.S. has fallen behind China and other \n     nations in total clean energy investments. Venture capital \n     investments are largely focused on technology innovation, and \n     the U.S. is the overwhelming leader. However, technology \n     innovation is a lagging indicator of prior investments in \n     science and engineering R, the majority of which is \n     government sponsored. In 2008, the U.S. invested only 0.03 \n     percent of its GDP on public energy R, which ranks behind \n     China, Japan, and Canada and is tied with S. Korea. Finally, \n     U.S. public energy R investments have declined by a factor \n     of four since the late 1970s. While the U.S. is currently the \n     leader in technology innovation, increases in Chinese \n     investments in energy R suggests that U.S. leadership in \n     the future is not guaranteed.\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Number for Top\n          Categories (Year)                   Top Rank                Rank         US Ranking      US Numbers\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Clean Energy investments        China..................  $54.48                       3  $34B\n (2010).\nClean Energy Investments as Fraction  Germany................  1.40%                        9  0.23%\n of National GDP (2010).\nFive Year Growth Rates in Clean       Turkey.................  190%                        11  61%\n Energy (2010).\nVenture Capital Financing (2010)....

In \n     particular, China is outpacing the U.S. by over 2 to 1 in \n     clean energy asset financing, which typically produces the \n     largest number of jobs.\n       Chinese trade practices are also having a significant \n     impact on the ability of U.S. clean energy manufacturers to \n     compete in the global marketplace.\n       4. How do current incentives for renewable energy compare \n     to support for other energy technologies when those \n     technologies were first emerging?\n       The success of fuels and technologies in the energy market \n     depend on a wide range of factors, one being subsidies. The \n     Environmental Law Institute found that between 2002 and 2009, \n     fossil fuels received more than double the amount of \n     subsidies (approximately $70 billion) than renewable fuels \n     ($29 billion) over the same period. Moreover, their report \n     suggests the most significant portion of the fossil fuel \n     subsidies are in the form of Foreign Tax Credits, indirectly \n     supporting the overseas production of oil.\n       Over the longer term, another report suggests that the \n     historical average of annual energy subsidies is roughly \n     $4.86 billion for oil and gas (1918-2009), $3.5 billion for \n     nuclear (1947-1999), $1.08 billion for biofuels (1980-2009) \n     and $0.37 billion for renewables (1994-2009). Accordingly, \n     for the first 15 years since the birth of each technology, \n     non-hydro renewables for electricity generation seem to have \n     received lower subsidies in equivalent dollars than the other \n     technologies.\n       In energy R alone, federal spending since 1978 on fossil \n     fuel and nuclear energy sources has significantly outpaced \n     spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy: nuclear \n     energy (37 percent); fossil energy (26 percent); renewable \n     energy (16 percent); energy efficiency (14 percent).\n       5. What is the potential for continued growth in energy \n     efficiency deployment and renewable energy supply, and job \n     creation in these sectors, over the next 10 years and beyond?\n       The current world market for renewable energy is projected \n     to grow from approximately $195 billion in 2010 to \n     approximately $395 billion in 2020 and $460 billion by 2030. \n     The cumulative investment from 2010 to 2030 will be \n     approximately $7 trillion in new capital. The potential \n     growth for energy efficiency is also significant. McKinsey \n     and Company estimates that the U.S. economy has the potential \n     to reduce annual non-transportation energy consumption by \n     roughly 23 percent by 2020, eliminating more than $1.2 \n     trillion in energy waste. This would also result in the \n     abatement of 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse-gas emissions \n     annually--the equivalent of taking the entire U.S. fleet of \n     passenger vehicles and light trucks off the roads for one \n     year. The Center for American Progress estimates that \n     retrofitting just 40 percent of the residential and \n     commercial building stock in the United States would:\n       --Create 625,000 sustained full-time jobs over a decade;\n       --Spark $500 billion in new investments to upgrade 50 \n     million homes and office building;\n       --Generate as much as $64 billion a year in cost savings \n     for U.S. ratepayers, freeing consumers to spend their money \n     in more productive ways.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n       The U.S. imports roughly 50 percent of the oil we use, much \n     of it from countries that are not always friendly to the \n     U.S., and we pay an estimated $1 billion per day. Our economy \n     and our people are vulnerable to fluctuations and steady rise \n     in global oil prices, and we do not have much control over \n     them. We are more dependent on foreign oil today than we were \n     at the time of the first ``energy crisis'' nearly 40 years \n     ago.\n       We urgently need to develop alternatives for transportation \n     energy that are based on domestic, clean and sustainable \n     resources. The U.S. invented the lithium ion battery that is \n     used in plug-in hybrid cars, and in 2009 it had only about 2 \n     percent of the world's manufacturing volume. We need to \n     innovate to regain our lead; otherwise we will become \n     importers of batteries instead of oil.\n       Between 2003 and 2010, the technology-focused ``cleantech'' \n     sector produced explosive job gains in the U.S. and the clean \n     economy has outperformed the overall nation's economy. \n     Roughly 26 percent of all clean energy jobs lie in \n     manufacturing, compared to just 9 percent in the broader \n     economy. On average, clean energy manufacturing exports \n     represent roughly twice the value of traditional exports, on \n     a per job basis ($20,000 versus $10,000). The renewable \n     energy sector is estimated to see a 5.7 million net job-years \n     increase (a 72 percent increase) between 2010-2030, with the \n     rest of the increase mostly coming from natural gas (1.6 \n     million job-years). This is a fast-growing sector to create \n     new jobs in the U.S.\n       The cost of renewable energy has fallen dramatically (solar \n     over 70 percent in the last three years) and these costs will \n     continue to decline. Renewable energy costs are competitive \n     with conventional energy costs in many parts of the world and \n     will be in the U.S. within several years. Therefore, the \n     current world market for renewable energy grew 30 percent \n     between 2009 and 2010, and is projected to grow from \n     approximately $200 billion in 2010, to approximately $400 \n     billion in 2020 and $460 billion by 2030. The cumulative \n     investment from 2010 to 2030 will be approximately $7 \n     trillion in new capital. Other nations are positioning \n     themselves to avail of this massive opportunity because this \n     will create new domestic jobs.\n       The U.S. invented the modern solar cell, and had more than \n     40 percent of the global manufacturing volume in 1995. Today, \n     it has about 7 percent of the manufacturing volume. This is a \n     rapidly growing industry, and we are falling behind.\n       The global competition for clean energy jobs is fierce. \n     China ranks first among all nations in overall investment, \n     clean energy asset financing, and the use of public markets \n     to invest in clean energy. The United States currently ranks \n     first in only one of the top 10 clean energy benchmarks--3rd \n     in overall investments, and 9th when it comes to investment \n     as a percentage of GDP. Trends in 5-year investment growth \n     rates in clean energy show that U.S. does not appear among \n     the top 10 countries.\n       America faces a choice about what to do with the \n     opportunity presented by the global clean energy race. We can \n     compete in the global marketplace--creating American jobs and \n     selling American products--or we can buy the technologies of \n     tomorrow from abroad. I believe all Americans would agree \n     that the U.S. should compete to win the future.\n       How can we win the future? We must leverage our Nation's \n     strengths and core competencies to simultaneously address the \n     five components of our energy value chain--innovation, \n     manufacturing, deployment, finance and markets.\n       1. We have the world's best and most innovative \n     universities, national labs and small businesses in clean \n     technologies. We must double down with smart and sustained \n     investments in R to unleash our unique capacity to innovate \n     clean energy technologies.\n       2. We must provide long-term predictable support for \n     American entrepreneurs and businesses so that they can \n     catalyze private sector investments to translate these \n     innovations into manufacturing and jobs. This will enable \n     these technologies to become globally competitive, affordable \n     worldwide, and to be sold without subsidies.\n       3. American entrepreneurs and businesses need access to \n     low-cost, long-term, and large-scale capital if they are to \n     be globally competitive. We have the world's largest capital \n     markets. We must find ways to leverage this strength by \n     unlocking this capital to finance clean energy investments \n     for both manufacturing and deployment.\n       4. Finally, innovation, manufacturing and deployment occur \n     only if there is a demand for these technologies here in the \n     U.S. Just like the new fuel efficiency standards are creating \n     a market for domestic innovations in transportation, policies \n     such as the Clean Energy Standard can create demand for clean \n     electricity from renewables, nuclear and clean fossil fuels \n     produced in the United States, and provide certainty for \n     American entrepreneurs.\n       The stakes are too high to wave the white flag and \n     surrender. It is a fight we can and must win.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield to Senator Cardin.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank my colleague for yielding. I wish to thank \nSenator Sanders, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Boxer, who were on the \nfloor on this issue.\n  I just wish to underscore the point that was just made about having a \nlevel playing field, where we have tilted the scales in favor of fossil \nfuels over renewables. My colleagues have already talked about the \ndirect difference in our subsidies. I would like to add an additional \nelement; that is, when you look at the subsidies we give to the fossil \nfuel industries, they are permanent. They are in the Tax Code. They do \nnot go through the annual exercise of an extender.\n  What does that mean? That means the lack of predictability in \nsustainable energy means there is a higher cost for investment. It \ntilts the scale in favor of oil and gas, rather than on sustainable, \nrenewable energy sources. I would just mention three. The Congressional \nResearch Service did a report on this, just three of the provisions \nthat benefit the oil industry: the excess of\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\npercentage over cost depletion, the expensing of exploration and \ndevelopment costs, and the amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures. Just those three provisions that are permanent in our Tax \nCode, between 2010 and 2014, will cost the taxpayers over $10 billion.\n  We are subsidizing the oil industry, and we should not be doing that. \nWe should be encouraging a transformation to sustainable energy issues \nas my colleagues have pointed out for the purposes of national \nsecurity. It is good for our environment and it is good for jobs. This \nis about jobs. That is why we cannot go home until we have extended the \ntax provisions, particularly 1603 but others of the energy-related, \nsustainable energy provisions.\n  I wish to talk for one moment, if I might, about the production tax \ncredit we need to extend because I want to talk about one specific \nproject in Maryland, on a brownfields site that we are dealing with \nthat relates to energy. Some might say: OK. That does not expire until \n2013. But here is the problem. You have to have it in production by \nthat date. Our waste-to-energy projects--it is not going to be in \nproduction by that date. So if we do not extend it this month, the \nproject will be at a standstill in Baltimore.\n  There are 1,900 jobs at stake--1,900 jobs are at stake on just that \none project which, by the way, helps our environment, helps our energy, \nand also helps our economy. That is why it is critically important that \nbefore we leave, we extend these sustainable energy tax credits, so we \ncan get the investment.\n  Quite frankly, I would like to see us make some of these permanent. \nWe make them permanent, we get predictability. We get predictability, \nit is less cost, it encourages more activity in this area. That is what \nwe should be about, creating jobs for our country. The wind energy \ncredit alone would allow us to create another 54,000 jobs. So this is \nabout job growth for America. It is about our energy security, and it \nis about a cleaner environment. It is about America's future.\n  That is why we have taken the time to point out to the American \npeople that Congress needs to make sure it is active on these areas \nbefore we adjourn for the year. We owe that to the people of this \ncountry.\n  With that, I will yield to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the Senator from \nMaryland not only for his important remarks now but for, year after \nyear, the strong work he is doing in trying to create jobs in America \nin sustainable energy.\n  I would like to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for his \nthoughts.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator Sanders. I wish to go back to this \nquestion of the jobs and the economic value we get from clean energy. \nThe Department of Energy reports that the clean energy sector alone \ndirectly employs nearly 1.6 million people in the United States. So \nnearly 1.6 million families are depending on the paychecks they get \nfrom the clean energy sector.\n  Within that, it is growing. The United States has created over \n100,000 solar-focused jobs--100,000 solar-focused jobs--and at least \n75,000 jobs related to wind energy installation in 2010. In Rhode \nIsland, we are seeing that coming on. The newspaper today, the \nProvidence Journal, reported on a permit application for the cable that \nwill connect an offshore wind facility that is going in off Block \nIsland back to the grid onshore to bring the power from that \ninstallation back and into the New England energy grid.\n  But when it gets going, think of the jobs that are going to be \ninvolved in that. Senator Reed and I worked very hard to shore up--get \nmoney to shore up the waterside, the side of the pier at Quonset so it \nwould be capable of dealing with very heavy-duty installation barges \nand things such as that.\n  So the Quonset Point facility is now ready for this construction. We \nhave the trains and new highways that bring in the pieces of those big \nturbines. The turbines are so big you cannot build them in China, in \nEurope. We have to assemble them onshore and put them right on the \nbarge. So the assembly of them will take place in Rhode Island, right \nat Quonset, and that will mean a lot of jobs.\n  Then we have to barge them out and we have the barge operators and \nthe barge captains and the tugs. Then we sink the base, and we have to \nhave divers and builders and people who are experts in that kind of \nmarine construction.\n  Then we put them up. We have to operate them. We have to maintain \nthem. What they do is they contribute clean energy to the grid. They \nare a constant supply because of the wind over the Atlantic being such \na powerful resource, and it is kind of a win-win situation. So we see \nthe need to get behind this in an immediate way in Rhode Island.\n  It would be one of the great tragedies if we let the Chinese and the \nBelgians and the French and the Dutch and whoever else get ahead of us \nin this competition. We do not need to. It is wrong. We are taking \nourselves out of a race we should be winning when we do that. I commend \nSenator Sanders for his effort to bring us together to continue to make \nthis point. There are jobs here. There is an energy industry that is \ngoing to lead the economy of the next decades of this world, and we \nwant America to be at the front of it and not to have sand thrown in \nour gears by the dirty, polluting energy industry that is on its way \nout as its last contribution to the damage it is now doing to our \neconomy and to our environment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I wish to thank my friend from Rhode Island for his \nremarks and for his extraordinary effort in fighting for jobs and \nprotecting our environment.\n  If we read some headlines today in the media, we might think, \nespecially the rightwing media, that renewable energy in America is on \nthe verge of collapse. Quite literally--this is quite literally the \ncase. A recent headline from FOX News said: ``Entire solar industry on \nbrink of collapse.''\n  The reality is quite the contrary. The fact is, not only is the solar \nindustry not on the verge of collapse, the reality is the American \nsolar energy industry is thriving, as is the renewable energy industry \nmore broadly. We have doubled the number of solar jobs in America since \n2009. It does not sound to me like that industry is collapsing. It \nsounds to me like it is doing extraordinarily well.\n  Today, more than 100,000 Americans work in the solar industry, at \nmore than 5,000 companies in every single State in our country, and \nthat includes manufacturing, installation, and supply chain jobs.\n  Mr. President, last year we installed nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar \npower in the United States--more than double the amount installed in \n2009. That doesn't sound like an industry that is collapsing to me. \nWith the solar industry growing at a rate of 69 percent annually, it is \none of America's fastest growing industries and is creating jobs all \nover our country. The cost of solar panels has fallen 30 percent over \njust the last 2 years, continuing a long-term decline in the price of \nsolar and making it more and more competitive with other energy \ntechnology.\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the Chair.)\n  Madam President, everyone, from Walmart to the U.S. Marine Corps, is \nlooking toward a future in solar. Walmart is installing solar panels at \n130 stores in California, and they say:\n\n       Walmart has reduced energy expenses by more than a million \n     dollars through our solar program.\n\n  The military--the U.S. Department of Defense--is using solar energy \nwith battery storage to fully power forward operating bases in \nAfghanistan.\n  Marine COL Bob Charette said:\n\n       For the Marines, renewable energy is about saving lives by \n     reducing the number of dangerous fuel convoys needed for \n     resupply.\n\n  The reason I am making these points is that many people don't know \nthe extent to which we are already making progress in sustainable \nenergy. We are on the verge of something extraordinary. But it is \nimportant to understand where we are today and to refute those people \nwho suggest that solar and wind are not the technologies for the \nfuture.\n  In terms of wind, that technology is growing rapidly. Texas alone has \nmore than 10,000 megawatts of wind energy installed. That is equal in \ncapacity to 10 nuclear powerplants--in Texas alone. Iowa now gets 20 \npercent of its electricity from wind. There are 75,000 wind energy jobs \nin America today and more than 400 manufacturing facilities\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nin 43 States. The price of wind energy has dropped by 90 percent since \n1980, and wind electricity today is competitive with fossil fuels at 5 \nto 6 cents per kilowatt hour. At the same time, we are increasing \nAmerican manufacturing of wind turbines, and now 60 percent of turbine \ncomponents installed in the United States are made in America, up from \n25 percent in 2005.\n  In the midst of this horrendous and painful recession, the story of \nrenewable energy in the United States is actually a rare good news \nstory. It is a good news story. Renewable energy is helping to cut \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions, it is making our country more \nenergy independent, and it is creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  But all of this could be significantly slowed down if we do not \ncontinue Federal support for the renewable energy industries at a \nfraction of the kind of support we are giving to fossil fuels. It is \nabsurd that we even have to fight to extend renewable tax credits and \ngrants when fossil fuel industries enjoy permanent subsidies. Mature \nindustries, such as oil and gas, continue to reap billions every year \nin Federal subsidies and massive tax breaks that never expire, despite \nthe fact that the top five oil companies earned nearly $1 trillion in \nprofits over the last 10 years. So here we are struggling to help wind \nand solar--new technologies--and we are giving massive tax breaks to \nmature industries that are incredibly profitable.\n  Contrast what we do for renewable energy to what we do with fossil \nfuel and specifically with regard to the production tax credit for wind \nenergy, which was allowed to lapse three times in recent years--1999, \n2001, and 2003--leading to an average dropoff of 81 percent in new wind \nenergy installation each time the credit expired. The wind credit is \nset to expire again in 2012.\n  The point here is the one Senator Cardin made a moment ago. Unless \nthere is predictability, unless the industry knows these tax credits \nwill be there, they are not going to start investing or working on new \nprojects only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them. They \nneed stability and predictability, which is why we have to move not \nonly to extending these tax credits but to making them permanent.\n  I also want to say a word about the Keystone XL Pipeline, and that is \nto say there are some in the House and some in the Senate who want to \nuse year-end legislation to tack on a rider that says to the State \nDepartment: You have to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline within 60 \ndays.\n  Let's be clear about what we are talking about in terms of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. What we are talking about is a 1,700-mile oil \npipeline from Canada to the gulf coast that would carry tar sands oil. \nTar sands oil is not like regular oil. It requires an energy-intensive \nprocess to get it out of the ground, extract it, and, in fact, to \nrefine it. That means it emits approximately 82 percent more carbon \nemissions when produced compared to regular oil, according to the EPA.\n  Tar sands oil is also hard to clean up when it spills. Refining tar \nsands also produces more toxic air pollution compared to conventional \noil. A tar sands spill in the Kalamazoo River in Michigan that happened \nin 2010 is still being cleaned up, at a cost now exceeding $700 \nmillion.\n\n  In my view, the last thing we need is to eliminate the environmental \nand safety reviews now taking place and fast-track approval of this \npipeline.\n  I also note to my colleagues who want to fast-track Keystone XL that \nI, along with several other Senators and Congressmen, asked the State \nDepartment inspector general to look into allegations of conflicts of \ninterest in the preparation of the environmental impact study of \nKeystone XL. The contractor the State Department used for the impact \nstudy, Cardno Entrix, has financial ties to the project developer, \nTransCanada. Those ties need to be investigated to ensure that the \nFederal environmental and safety reviews were done correctly and \nwithout bias. That inspector general special review is under way right \nnow. I think it is completely inappropriate to try to fast-track this \npipeline when we have not even heard back from the inspector general \nabout potential conflicts of interest. I urge my colleagues to allow \nthat special review to play out before any decisions are made.\n  I will conclude my remarks this morning by thanking my colleagues for \njoining me--Senators Whitehouse, Boxer, and Cardin--who speak for many \nother Members of Congress and I think who speak for tens of millions of \nAmericans, who see an energy future in this country in which we break \nour dependence on foreign oil, in which we no longer spend over $300 \nbillion a year for oil from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries; \nwho see a future in this country where we move toward energy \nindependence; who see a future in this country where the United States \nis a leader in reversing global warming by not only cutting greenhouse \ngas emissions in America but providing technology and expertise for \ncountries all over the world, for them to do the same; and also \nunderstand that, as we move to energy efficiency--and I have to tell \nyou that in Vermont we are leading the country in energy efficiency. \nWhat we are seeing as we weatherize homes is fuel bills going down for \nthe middle-class, working-class people by 30, 40, 50 percent. We are \ninvesting in weatherization, and the payback is pretty good. It takes \nplace over a very few years, when you cut fuel prices 30 to 50 percent.\n  In Vermont, we are probably doing as well as any other State in that \narea, but we can and will do a lot better. Tens of thousands of homes \nin our State can be weatherized. When we do that, we not only cut \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we not only reduce the need to import foreign \noil, we also create jobs. We create jobs for those people who are \nproducing the insulation, the new doors, the windows, and the new \nroofing that makes homes and buildings more energy efficient.\n  Furthermore, in our State and around the country, we are seeing, as I \nindicated a moment ago, significant progress in moving to sustainable \nenergy--the solar industry, growing very rapidly; wind energy, growing \nvery rapidly; other technologies, growing very rapidly. As a nation, we \nshould be proud of the change that is taking place. But understand that \nwe have a long way to go to be the kind of energy efficient and \nsustainable energy Nation we know we can become and to help lead the \nworld in a new energy direction.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 10--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it occurs to me that all Senators swear an \noath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I \ncarry a copy around with me. It is our duty. It is our responsibility. \nBut the pending amendments to the Constitution that are on the floor of \nthe Senate threaten the constitutional principles that have sustained \nour democracy for more than 200 years.\n  In addressing the Nation's debt and deficit, what is lacking are not \nphrases in our Constitution. What is lacking is the seriousness within \ntoday's Congress to act, and the willingness in Congress to cooperate \nin forgoing solutions that meet the real needs of our country and its \npeople. These are human failures, not the failure of our constitutional \nframework. Nor are these failures insoluble or inherent. We balanced \nthe budget and even created budget surpluses less than two decades ago.\n  Now we are being asked to put the problem once again under the pillow \nfor another day--this radical partisan proposal would be out of place \nin our national charter.\n  Never in our history have we amended the Constitution--the work of \nour Founders--to impose budgetary restrictions that require \nsupermajorities for passing legislation. Yet now it seems every Member \non the other side of the aisle has joined to put forth a radical \nproposal to burden our Constitution with both of these kinds of \nstrictures.\n  The Hatch-McConnell proposal is different in kind than any other \namendment to our Constitution. It is not consistent with the design of \nour founding document or the stance taken by our Founding Fathers.\n  It is a bad idea to write fiscal policy into our Nation's most \nfundamental charter. It is simply unnecessary. We do not need a \nbalanced budget amendment to balance a budget. A vote for this \namendment does absolutely nothing to get our fiscal house in order. \nCongress can work to continue our economic recovery. We can pass the \nappropriate legislation that leads to a Federal balanced budget, just \nas we did in the early 1990s.\n  I remember that very well because I was here. I remember, in this \nbody, not a single Republican voted to balance the budget. It took the \nDemocrats in the Senate and the Vice President of the United States to \npass that balanced budget. Not a single Republican voted for a balanced \nbudget in the House. They gave a lot of speeches on the floor that if \nwe passed that balanced budget amendment, everything would come to a \nscreeching halt. Actually, what happened was we passed it, and \nPresident Clinton was able to leave his successor a huge surplus.\n  With a growing economy, with what we did by votes in the House and \nthe Senate--not by a constitutional amendment--we were able to create \nsignificant budget surpluses and pay down the debt until those \nsurpluses were squandered. We have done it before. We can do it again. \nWe need only work together to make the tough decisions, not to pass \nsomething that is a feel-good, bumper-sticker kind of item which kicks \nthe can down the road and binds future Congresses to a fiscal proposal \nthat is fundamentally unsound and the consequences of which are not \nunderstood.\n  The Republican proposal in the Senate is significantly more radical \nthan the version the House of Representatives rejected in a bipartisan \nvote last month. In fact, the Hatch-McConnell constitutional amendment \nis the most extreme of all the pending proposals. The proposal, by its \nterms, will neither balance the budget nor pay down the Nation's debt, \nsomething everybody says they want. Instead, at a time of partisan \nbrinksmanship that has led to the first-ever downgrading of our \ncountry's credit rating this summer and when ideological gridlock is \nthe Republicans' operating principle, it would require supermajorities \nto pass legislation for the first time in our Nation's history. It \nwould require a supermajority to raise the debt ceiling in times of \neconomic crisis. Did we learn nothing from the disaster we went through \nlast summer, which should have been a routine lifting of the debt \nceiling and became a political free-for-all for weeks and months, cost \nthe American taxpayers billions of dollars and caused people to lose \ntheir retirement money in the stock market? Do we want to do that \nagain? I hope the Senate rejects this proposal.\n  Two weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the \nConstitution held a hearing to examine the Hatch-McConnell proposal. \nAll those witnesses, including those who were invited by the measure's \ncosponsors, presented thoughtful critiques of this extreme proposal and \nvoiced serious concerns about its wording. Even Republican cosponsors \ndiscussed possible changes to the language in order to better achieve \ntheir goals. This is not the proposal that Senator Hatch previously \nfavored. This is one of more than two dozen pending versions. In fact, \nwe were not told which of the many versions of the proposal would be \npending until yesterday. This proposal has not been considered by the \nConstitution Subcommittee or the Judiciary Committee. The House of \nRepresentatives has already voted down a less-extreme version of this \nproposal by a bipartisan majority. Yet here is the Senate of the United \nStates, being forced to vote on some proposal for a constitutional \namendment without doing any of the hard work or the votes that are \nexpected to accompany an amendment to America's Constitution. This is \nno way for the Senate to proceed on a proposed constitutional \namendment. This is not some feel-good resolution. We are talking about \namending America's charter.\n  The Hatch-McConnell proposal contains many problematic provisions and \nit leaves many significant questions unanswered. Section 10 of this \nproposal relies on estimates for outlays and receipts. We know that \neconomists' estimates and recommendations do not always agree. So what \ndo these proposed constitutional provisions really mean? We know that \nestimates are not static but ever changing. What if during the course \nof a fiscal year, there was a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, or \na shift in the economy? What then? What if estimates were recalculated \nor revised, as employment statistics are every month? Would that make \nevery penny expended by the Government over a revised estimate \nunconstitutional? Would that mean we could not help disaster victims or \ncould not respond to a terrorist attack?\n\n  Another provision would limit total outlays for each fiscal year to \n18 percent not 16, not 20, not 17.9 of the previous year's Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP). But who is to decide what the ``GDP'' was for a \nparticular time period? What is to be included and what is not? How \noften do those estimates and artificial constructs get revised? Since \nwhen do economic surveys and shifting estimates belong in the \nConstitution? And what policy decision justifies the constitutional \npermanence of the number 18? I note that not even the budget proposed \nthis year by Representative Ryan and the House Republicans, with all \nits draconian cuts and the end of Medicare as we know it, would satisfy \nthis arbitrary 18 percent of GDP limit. None of the budgets proposed by \nor passed under President Reagan, not one, would have satisfied this \nproposal. At the end of the Bush\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nadministration we survived the worst economic downturn since the Great \nDepression and are now in economic recovery. This is not the time to \nenact such a measure which would take us in the wrong direction. We \ncannot ``cut'' our way to a balanced budget without imposing great \nsuffering. It would tank the economy rather than aid our continuing \nrecovery.\n  Besides its arbitrary nature, limiting outlays to 18 percent of the \nprevious year's GDP would leave Congress unable to respond swiftly and \neffectively to economic downturns and natural disasters. The Hatch-\nMcConnell proposal would require a two-thirds supermajority to spend in \nexcess of 18 percent of the previous year's GDP for a specific purpose. \nFilibusters and requirements for supermajorities have become routine to \nthe detriment of the American people. They have stymied congressional \naction on behalf of the American people. This proposal would give a \nminority in Congress even more power to hold the country and our \neconomy hostage. Have we not seen what that can mean? Have the lessons \nof the last year been lost on the Senate?\n  The Hatch-McConnell proposal would make permanent bad policy choices. \nSection 4 is a transparent attempt to enshrine tax breaks for \nmillionaires and wealthy corporations by requiring a two-thirds \nsupermajority to impose any new tax or even to close existing tax \nloopholes. We need a balanced approach to fix the deficit problem. And \nthe wealthiest among us are those who least need a heavy hand on the \nscales in favor of their interests.\n  Let's look at what has happened. We have fought two unfunded wars. It \nis the first time in our history that we not only did not pass a tax to \npay for a war we are in but actually passed a tax cut and borrowed \nmoney to pay for these wars. We squandered the surpluses the last \nadministration inherited, ran up deficits and the national debt.\n  I would remind everybody, we can achieve a balanced budget. We have \ndone it before. Working with President Clinton, Democrats in Congress \nvoted for a balanced budget. But I don't want to hear lectures from the \nother side, when every single Republican voted no the last time we had \na successful balanced budget. Our strong economy in the Clinton years \nled to budget surpluses. If we are serious about reducing the deficit \nand paying down our debt, we need to get to work improving our economy, \ngetting Americans back to work, and continuing to recover from the \nworst economic conditions since the Great Depression.\n  One of the most glaring problems with this proposal is it provides no \nclear enforcement mechanism or standards for enforcement. Section 8 of \nthe Hatch-McConnell proposal expressly prohibits courts from increasing \nrevenues to enforce the amendment, but remains silent on judicial \nenforcement of the amendment by cutting spending. This proposal assumes \nour Federal courts are equipped to enforce this amendment. Do we want \nto say we will simply relinquish Congress's constitutional power of the \npurse to an unelected judiciary with no budget experience--something no \nCongress, Republican or Democratically controlled--has ever done \nbefore? Do we want judges deciding fiscal policy? Do we want judges to \ndecide whether we cut Social Security or Medicare?\n  I recently asked Justice Scalia at a hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee whether the Federal judiciary was equipped to \nhandle such a task--the same task my friends on the other side of the \naisle want the Federal judiciary to do. Do you know how he answered? He \nlaughed. He indicated that budget issues and determining the allocation \nof resources is not the judiciary's proper role. Of course he is right, \nand I expect this is one area where all nine members of the Supreme \nCourt would have answered the same. The proponents of this effort to \ntransform courts into budget-cutting bodies are wrong. The Republican \nproposal does not even make clear who, if anyone, has standing to bring \nsuch challenges in court. None of these questions has been adequately \ndebated or considered. Such a drastic change to the time-honored role \nof the judicial branch of our government should not be written into our \nConstitution presumptuously.\n  In addition to all these concerns, the American people need to \nunderstand what the real-world effect of such an amendment would be on \ntheir daily lives. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we received \nalarming testimony from the president-elect of AARP, warning of the \ndamaging effects such a constitutional amendment would have on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. He testified that if such a \nconstitutional amendment were in place today, the average Social \nSecurity benefit would be cut by 27 percent. Maybe that is what Members \nof this body want to do, cut Social Security by 27 percent. I do not. \nDo they want to balance the budget on the backs of hard-working, lower \nincome, and elderly Americans by drastically cutting the safety net? I \nwould say that is not the answer to our economic challenges, especially \nas we continue to give tax breaks to millionaires and continue to fight \nunfunded wars.\n  The notion of amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget \nis not new. The Senate rejected balanced budget amendments in 1995, \n1996, and 1997. We proved after the Reagan and Bush administrations had \ntripled the national debt that we could through hard work and \nlegislation, balance the budget. That is what Congress did in the late \n1990s. We helped create hundreds of millions of dollars in surpluses \nthat were paying down the national debt. Those surpluses were \nsquandered by tax cuts for the wealthy and two unfunded wars. That is \nthe cause of our budget imbalance.\n  We should not, for the first time in American history, amend the \nConstitution to set fiscal policy. It is a bad idea. It is even more \nirresponsible to consider doing so when we do not yet understand the \nfull weight of the consequences of who is going to bear the burden.\n  I have never seen the solemn duty of protecting the Constitution \ntreated in such a cavalier manner as it is today. I have heard many say \nthey revere the Constitution. Let us show it the respect it deserves \nrather than treating it like a blog entry or a bumper-sticker slogan. \nLet us not be so vain in this body to think we know better than our \nFounders and better than the constitutional Framers who preserved our \nliberties for more than 200 years.\n  Our constitutional principles have served the test of time. They \ndeserve protection. I will stand with the Constitution. I will stand \nwith the Constitution of this country, and I will oppose this ill-\nconceived proposal to amend it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my full \nstatement, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have the good fortune of serving with \nSenator Leahy on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is the chairman; I \nam the ranking Republican. In that capacity, we have jurisdiction over \nconstitutional amendments. So I rise to support S.J. Res. 10, which is \ncosponsored by all 47 Republicans.\n  I am very pleased we are taking up a balanced budget amendment. The \nSenate has passed a balanced budget amendment in the past. More \nrecently, it has come close to passing a balanced budget amendment.\n  I regret that this amendment has not become law. I believe that had \nthe Constitution been amended to require a balanced budget, we would \nnot be faced with the dire budgetary situation that is before us--a \n$1.5 trillion deficit for each of the last 2 or 3 years, and maybe as \nfar as we can see into the future if we don't get things under control.\n  The balanced budget amendment before us is very straightforward. It \nprovides that total outlays shall not exceed total receipts unless each \nHouse of Congress, by a two-thirds vote, agrees to do otherwise. It \nprovides spending discipline. Total outlays cannot exceed 18 percent of \ngross domestic product unless two-thirds of both Houses of Congress \nvote to waive the cap. The President will be required to submit a \nbalanced budget to the Congress.\n  To avoid balancing the budget by imposing tax burdens, new taxes or \nincreases in total revenue can be imposed only by a two-thirds vote of \nboth Houses, and the debt limit will be able to be raised only with \nconcurrence of three-fifths of both Houses.\n  To provide a level of flexibility in wartime--and that would call for \nconsiderable flexibility because wars are\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nnever predictable--the provisions on outlays and receipts, total \noutlays, and the debt limit can be overcome by less than the normal \ntwo-thirds vote by a three-fifths vote.\n  To minimize disruption, the amendment will not take place for 5 \nyears.\n  Finally, the courts cannot enforce the balanced budget amendment by \nordering a tax increase.\n  Reverence for the Constitution is a sentiment we all share. But the \nConstitution provides for an amendment process. When it is necessary, \neach generation has amended the Constitution when a guarantee of free \nspeech or the abolition of slavery or giving women the right to vote \nrequired a constitutional amendment. No one has said reverence for the \nConstitution was the end of the matter.\n  We have reached that point of necessity with the balanced budget \namendment. The Congressional Research Service reports--and I wish to \nquote a fairly long quote:\n\n       The budget deficit each year from 2009 to 2011 has been the \n     highest ever in dollar terms, and significantly higher as a \n     share of GDP than at any time since World War II. Under \n     current policies, the Federal debt is projected to grow more \n     quickly than the GDP, leading observers to term it \n     unsustainable.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the CRS.\n  The very purpose of the Constitution, according to its preamble--and \nI know the preamble is not governing on anything we do or what the \nSupreme Court does, but it shows intention--the preamble was meant to \nextend the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity--and I \nwant to emphasize that word ``posterity.'' It is because the growth in \nthe national debt is unsustainable, as I read from the Congressional \nResearch Service, that our posterity may not receive the blessings that \nseveral generations of Americans so far have received. It is hard to \nimagine an amendment more in keeping with the goals of the Constitution \nthan this one. Otherwise, runaway debt will expand exponentially. A \npermanent spiral can be created in which the debt feeds on itself. We \nare kind of in that spiral right now. Is it permanent? I sure hope not.\n  Take a look at Europe today, where we ought to learn lessons about \nthe lack of fiscal soundness. Nations there risk default when they \noverspend, and they are in that position of almost default now. If we \nare not careful, our country, the United States, at some point will \nface the same crisis. It is frightening to contemplate, and \nparticularly frightening as a threat to the blessings we ought to give \nto generations after us.\n  We hear from opponents that Congress can balance the budget now \nwithout a balanced budget amendment, but the fact is it cannot. For \nmore than 40 years, Congress has been unable to summon the ability to \nbalance the budget. Statutes that sought to provide a path to a \nbalanced budget failed.\n  Let me speak here about a personal involvement I had when I was a \nMember of the other body, working with Senator Harry Flood Byrd of \nVirginia. The Byrd-Grassley amendment was adopted in either 1979 or \n1980. It was a statute that was just a few words. It said Congress \ncan't spend any more money than it takes in.\n  Do you know what happened? For several years after that until it was \nfinally repealed in the early 1990s, Congress delayed it for a year at \na time as part of the appropriations process. So statutes are not a \ngood way of making this happen. Gramm-Rudman was probably a little more \nsuccessful, at least once or twice, but it soon was repealed. By \nputting something in the Constitution requiring a balanced budget, it \nis going to discipline Congress in a way that statutes cannot provide \ndiscipline; in other words, a constitutional amendment will succeed \nwhere statutes have been proven to have failed based upon the examples \nI gave and other examples that can be given.\n  The only exception was when we had 3 years going into this century \nwhen a financial bubble provided windfall revenues. We all know about \nthat. I believe it is $568 billion we paid down on the national debt \nfor 4 fiscal years after a Republican Congress was elected in 1994.\n  Anyway, except for that, we have not been able to have very sound \nfiscal policy. Then because Congress has been unable to control \nspending, the budgets have been in deficit and the national debt has \nincreased. The only way Congress will exercise the discipline to \nbalance the budget is if the Constitution forces it to do so.\n  We can say this from some experience, particularly if you believe the \nStates are the laboratories of our political process and of government \npolicy, because 46 State constitutions require their budgets to be in \nbalance. They meet that requirement. As Members of Congress, we do take \nan oath to adhere to and defend the Constitution. We take that oath \nseriously. If the balanced budget amendment became part of the \nConstitution, we would adhere to it or face the consequences from the \nvoters.\n  This amendment wisely contains effective tax limitations as an \nintegral part. I have favored a balanced budget with tax limitations \nfor more than 20 years. For decades, Federal spending has far outpaced \neven the steady and sizable growth in taxes and revenues. Raising taxes \ndoes not produce surpluses. The historical fact is they spur more \nspending. For every additional dollar in taxes Congress has raised \nsince World War II, it seems as though it has given us a license to \nspend about $1.13 for every $1 that has come in for additional taxes.\n  Don't take my word for that. A person who studied that for a long \nperiod of time, Professor Vedder, of Ohio University, has written about \nthat. You will find his figures just about the same. I think he said on \naverage since World War II, $1 coming into the Treasury was a license \nto spend $1.17 instead of the $1.13 I give here.\n  Raising taxes, then, would make balancing the budget harder, not \neasier. Bring a dollar in here, spend $1.13. You hardly get ahead. It \nseems we cannot ever reach an agreement of how high taxes have to be in \nthis body to satisfy the appetite of Congress to spend money. That is \nnot just a Democratic problem, that is a problem on both sides of the \naisle here in Congress.\n  That brings us to this issue about a supermajority requirement for \ntax increases. A balanced budget amendment may well encourage tax \nincreases, fueling greater spending and the continuation of additional \ndebt and costs in servicing that debt. The failure to balance the \nbudget is a fiscal issue of greatest importance.\n  But getting back to our obligations to posterity under our \nConstitution, it is also a moral issue. Maybe the moral aspects of it \nare more important than the economic aspects of it. Without a balanced \nbudget amendment, our children and grandchildren will pay for this \ngeneration's chronic inability to live within its means. We live high \non the hog and worry about our children and grandchildren paying for \nit.\n  In the absence of an amendment, the standard of living of future \ngenerations will likely decline. The fears of many Americans that the \nnext generation will not live as well as this one are in many respects \ntraceable to decades of fiscal irresponsibility on the part of \nCongress. This balanced budget amendment would mean a stronger economy. \nIt would surely mean good government, as fiscal responsibility ought to \nbe a part of good government. Obviously people are concerned now about \nthe problem of jobs. Employers are particularly concerned that Congress \ndoes not have a sound fiscal policy. That leads them not to hire \nanybody. A balanced budget is going to mean more jobs.\n  I believe the American people are willing to do their part to prevent \nfuture generations from being saddled with an unconscionable level of \ndebt. They are willing to do so even if it means that some Federal \nspending they support would be affected. This is especially true if our \nbudgeting is done fairly.\n  I believe if one listens closely to the arguments of the opponents of \nthis measure, one will hear more arguments against a balanced budget \nthan against a balanced budget amendment. There will need to be \ndifficult actions taken. It is those difficulties that have prevented \nCongress from balancing the budget. Those difficulties are, therefore, \nreasons for a constitutional amendment, not reasons against a \nconstitutional amendment. But balancing the budget is necessary and it \nwill take an amendment to the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica to make sure it is done consistently.\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\n  We also hear arguments about the need to run deficits when the \neconomy is in a recession. That kind of brings us to where we are right \nnow. We have been in a recession for 3 years. The amendment before us \npermits Congress to vote to run a deficit in that situation, but be \nskeptical of that argument. If deficits and debt gave us a strong \neconomy, right now we would be in the midst of the greatest economic \nboom in our history. Obviously we are not in that economic boom. \nDeficits of $1 trillion-plus and a national debt of $15 trillion are \nnot stabilizing the economy in the way that people who argue that maybe \nin a time of recession you ought to have a lot of deficit spending have \nclaimed.\n\n  In fact, I believe the size of the deficit and debt is one reason the \neconomy is not performing well. The size of looming deficits and debt \nis another. The markets are not viewing the debt as stabilizing a weak \neconomy. Rather, they view it correctly as a drag on the economy. That \nis why jobs are not being created. That is why corporations have $1 \ntrillion in their treasuries in the United States, $1 trillion in their \ntreasuries overseas, $2 trillion that is not being spent, that is not \nmaking corporations any money. It is lying there. They want to invest \nit in jobs and machinery and get the economy going and make more money.\n  On the issue of enforcement, the opponents attack straw men. They say \neither that the amendment cannot be enforced, so it is toothless, or \nthey say the courts will enforce it, leading to chaos. Both of these \narguments cannot be true. This amendment will be enforced by the \nPresident submitting a balanced budget and Congress complying with the \namendment, as do State legislators all over the country. Members take \nan oath and voters will punish those who do not obey the constitutional \ncommand.\n  With respect to the courts, the text of the amendment prohibits \ncourts from raising taxes. Of course, judicial standing requirements, \nripeness, and the doctrine of political questions will mean that the \ncourts will continue to lack the power of the purse, as has been the \ncase throughout 225 years of history of our country.\n  In the past dozen years, Congress has been unable to balance the \nbudget even when times are good. Had we passed a balanced budget \namendment when it was before us in the past, we would not have racked \nup the huge deficits that now confront us.\n  We have heard in the past that a balanced budget amendment was not \nnecessary because Congress could balance the budget on its own. We know \nhow successful Congress has been doing that. Those arguments were \nwrong. Today we face one of the worst debt pictures in our history. If \nnothing is done, the future will be even worse. We owe a responsibility \nto the American people and to future generations to maintain the fiscal \ndiscipline that has allowed us to be the world's biggest economy.\n  Our pleas for a balanced budget amendment have been denied by its \nopponents in the past. We warned at that time what road lay ahead if we \nfailed to pass a balanced budget amendment. Time has unfortunately \nproved us right. It is not too late if we act now, but time is growing \nshorter each year.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and enact a constitutional \nrequirement that the budget be balanced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of \nlegislation I have authored to amend the United States Constitution to \nrequire that Congress balance the Federal budget. The Senate's debate \non the balanced budget amendment, which will occur over the next few \ndays, is an incredibly important debate. It is a debate that will spark \na wide range of emotions and it will test our policies, goals, and \nphilosophies. Thus, I want to recognize at the outset that we hold \nstrong and differing opinions about the wisdom of adding a balanced \nbudget amendment to our U.S. Constitution. Amending the Constitution is \nnot something any of us in the Senate takes lightly. In fact, we have \nonly amended our Constitution some 27 times in the history of our \nNation. Our Founding Fathers in their wisdom designed the Constitution \nto discourage amendments. They created a high hurdle to clear before an \namendment can be passed by the Congress and ratified by the States.\n\n  I intend today to make a case for why my proposal, which has been \ncosponsored by several of our colleagues, meets that elevated standard. \nToday I aim to explain why this balanced budget amendment will help \nrestore the fiscal health of our Nation, protect our national security, \nand spur our future competitiveness in the global economic race.\n  Let me start by discussing some basic facts that color this debate. \nFirst, our government debt now totals over $15 trillion. That is \n$48,000 for every man, woman, and child in our country. Let me say that \nagain: $48,000 for every man, woman, and child. Moreover, we borrow 40 \ncents of every dollar that the Federal Government spends. The total \namount of public debt now held by us equals 68 percent, almost 69 \npercent, of our gross domestic product. That reflects a level rarely \nseen in our country's history.\n  Finally, in August of this year, one of the major credit agencies \ndowngraded our Nation's credit rating because of Congress's inability \nto work in a bipartisan manner to reduce our debt. I don't think I have \nto tell the viewers that the last thing our struggling economy or job \ncreation efforts needed was that downgrade. It is little wonder that \nAmericans hold us in such low regard or that other countries wonder \nwhat we are doing in the Nation's Capitol.\n  I could go on and on, but I will not. These facts are appalling \nenough to most Americans. These are hard-working Americans who balance \ntheir checkbooks on a weekly and monthly basis. It is appalling to me \nthat Congress is so unable to resist the temptation to spend without \nlimit while also trying to keep taxes as low as possible. We have even \nbeen willing to watch the debt grow to a level where national security \nexperts are telling us that our own self-created problem is a bigger \nthreat than any of our enemies.\n  In the last several years Congress has taken steps to try to reach an \nagreement on how to reduce our deficit and pay down our debt. Many of \nus have spent countless hours working in bipartisan groups to chart a \ncommonsense balanced debt reduction plan. I have not given up hope that \nwe may eventually reach a comprehensive plan to cut spending, reform \nthe Tax Code, and shore up programs such as Social Security and \nMedicare which are critical to our Nation's middle class. To give up on \nthat goal would be to say to hard-working Americans, we are not serious \nabout ensuring that the American dream is within everyone's reach. \nAfter watching Congress struggle to reach even a basic plan to cut \nspending or reasonably raise new revenues to pay our bills, I am \nconvinced we need additional tools that force fiscal discipline. If we \ndon't put limits on how Congress does its budgeting, the question won't \nbe whether we can stop the bleeding, it will be how much do we cut to \nthe bone or even into vital organs the programs that we value. In other \nwords, without some fundamental reforms now, the foundations of our \ngovernment will be severely weakened later.\n  To be sure, a balanced budget amendment will not solve the problem on \nits own, but a reasonable balanced budget amendment would help us \nensure we never get into this position again. Passing my middle-ground, \ncommonsense balanced budget amendment would send a strong signal to the \nfinancial markets, U.S. businesses, and the American people that we are \nserious about stabilizing our budget for the long term. That is the \nsignal they want to see to give them the confidence to expand and \ncreate jobs.\n  Before I move to making the case for specifics in my balanced budget \nproposal, I want to make a few points about exactly how our \nskyrocketing national debt affects all of us. As a start, our debt \nthreatens investments we need to make. It harms our ability to compete \nwith countries around the world, it inhibits job growth here at home, \nand it dampens our innovative spirit. If we don't address our debt now, \nit would sap the economic power that has enabled our Nation to become \nthe most powerful force on the globe.\n  Throughout most of our history--perhaps aside from the Great \nDepression--our economic strength has enabled the\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nUnited States to create an environment that is good for business. This \nstrength has then helped our own people on our Main Streets thrive in \ncommunities all over Colorado and across our Nation, and it has meant \nthat every generation has been able to build on their parents' success, \nseize opportunity, and live the American dream. We all know this is \nwhat has made the United States exceptional. But today across our great \ncountry, families are wondering whether the American dream is still \nwithin their reach. Whether you are a college graduate and living at \nhome because you are unable to find a job or a middle-aged factory \nworker laid off for the second or the third time struggling to pay your \nbills, our economic future seems a bit tougher.\n  Our country has endured a terrible economic slump for over 3 years \nnow. In order to move quickly to turn things around, we need businesses \nto hire again. Business and community leaders across Colorado and \nelsewhere have told me that in order to have the confidence to do that, \nthey need to know our national debt is not poised to send our economy \noff a cliff. The cochairman of President Obama's bipartisan commission \non debt reduction tapped into that sentiment and called our debt a \ncancer that is eating away at our economic health. Beyond pure economic \nfactors, our growing debt burdens us more broadly.\n  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for whom we all \nhave enormous respect, ADM Mike Mullen, warned that our national debt \nis ``the single biggest threat to our national security.'' By now these \nare familiar arguments here on the floor of the Senate. We know the \nchallenges that confront us. The problem is Congress is not doing what \nevery economist and every one of us in this body acknowledges we must \ndo, and that is get our out-of-control budget under control. We all \nhave our theories for why this is the case. I personally believe that \npart of the problem is the nature of Congress itself. We are all \ntemporary single Members of a greater body. We each have our own \nconstituents, goals, and responsibilities. It is sure tempting to come \nto Washington, fight like hell for our corner of the Nation, and lose \nsight of or willfully ignore the bigger picture. As Members of \nCongress, it seems as if we are hardwired to fight for results that are \nimportant to our constituents and our political ideologies.\n\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. Democrats are reticent to \nsupport meaningful adjustments in entitlement spending, and many of my \nRepublican friends turn a blind eye to the revenues needed to support \nretiring baby boomers and our national security needs.\n  My father, who had the great privilege of serving for 30 years in the \nHouse of Representatives as a Congressman from southern Arizona, \nwitnessed this same phenomenon several decades ago, and he used to \nrecall the advice that was given to freshmen House Members. That advice \nwas: ``If you want to get ahead in Congress, do two things--vote for \nevery appropriations bill and against every tax bill.''\n  In many ways the Federal budget deficits we face are so daunting \ntoday because too many Members of Congress have taken that advice \nliterally over the past decades, but also because it is what Americans \nexpected of us. It is only natural that people want the best of both \nworlds. We cannot continue down this budgetary path and hope that the \nresults will be any different than they have been in the past.\n  In fact, the results get worse by the day. Based on what I hear from \nColoradans, our constituents are now ready to make a little sacrifice. \nThey are ready for us to make some tough decisions that may cause a \nlittle budget pain. Americans now get it, and that is why it is time \nfor some serious action. A balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution is serious action. It would require us to consider our \nlarger, collective obligation to the national economy.\n  I will admit that my support of the balanced budget amendment has not \nmade me particularly popular with some of my Democratic colleagues. \nDemocrats traditionally have not been big fans of the balanced budget \namendment idea. These days Democrats are suspicious that balanced \nbudget proposals are a Trojan horse. They look good on the surface, but \nactually they are designed to further dismantle government programs \nthat most Americans value. But a few decades ago Democrats were leading \nthe charge for a reasonable balanced budget amendment.\n  Most notably, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois--a progressive and \nserious-minded legislator--was perhaps the greatest champion of a \nbalanced budget, and I want to share with my colleagues some of his \nwords. In debating the balanced budget amendment in 1993, Senator Simon \nsaid the following, which he addressed to his fellow progressives:\n\n       I am here to tell you that the course we are on, unless it \n     is changed soon, absolutely threatens all of the programs \n     that you and I have fought for and believe in so strongly. \n     The fiscal folly that we followed for more than a decade has \n     brought us to a crossroads. We face a basic decision, whether \n     through default or through our actions to choose wisely the \n     course that will lead us away from the brink.\n       If we do not act, interest payouts will spiral upward until \n     they consume not only Social Security but health care, \n     education, transportation investments--every need on our \n     national agenda. My warning to you today is that a rising \n     tide of red ink sinks all boats.\n\n  That is a powerful warning from a very wise and respected colleague. \nHis warning is even more serious in December of 2011 than it was in \n1993.\n  There are not any easy answers here, especially since our aging \npopulation and the post-9/11 national security needs have squeezed our \nNation's budget in ways we have seldom seen in our country's history. \nBut it is time for us to listen to hard-working Americans who are \ntelling us loudly and clearly, make the tough decisions necessary to \nget our national debt under control. So I say to my colleagues here \ntoday, it is time to put aside our political differences, check \nultimatums at the door, work across the aisle, and challenge ourselves \nto put our country first.\n  I want to reiterate a point I made earlier, which is that a balanced \nbudget amendment is not the sole answer to the problems we face. It is \nnot a perfect solution, and I recognize that. For example, it will not \nhelp us deal with our current debt, much less reduce it. For that we \nneed a comprehensive plan along the lines of the recommendations of \nPresident Obama's bipartisan commission. It has been headed by former \nClinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Senator Al Simpson.\n  Two years ago I helped create the Bowles-Simpson Commission, and I \ncontinue to believe its recommendations, which would lower the debt by \nmore than $4 trillion over the next decade, are the best place to start \non a path toward fiscal soundness. Let's own up to the mistakes of our \npast and take charge of the opportunity staring us in the face by \npassing the Bowles-Simpson debt reduction plan. That plan would require \nall of us to put some skin in the game, and it represents our best path \nto balance our books.\n  I have also fought for bipartisan proposals to create a Presidential \nline-item veto to ban earmarks and to enforce pay-as-you-go budgeting. \nThese should all be and could be and must be tools in our responsible \nbudgeting toolbox. Even though we have to find the courage to get our \ncurrent fiscal house in order, we also need to have stronger rules in \nplace to ensure Congress is not tempted to fall off the wagon in the \nfuture. In my view, passing a balanced budget amendment to prevent us \nfrom ever again trading fiscal responsibility for political expediency \nis a critical step we must take.\n  That long windup brings me to the balanced budget amendment proposals \nunder debate in the U.S. Congress today. Let me start by saying that I \nwas pleasantly surprised to see last month the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives pursue a balanced budget amendment that was more \nrealistic than what some of my Republican colleagues here in the U.S. \nSenate have proposed. The House proposal required a balanced budget \nunless three-fifths of the House and Senate agreed there was an \neconomic downturn, a national disaster, or another emergency that \nrequired temporary expenditures and increases thereon.\n  It was a straightforward measure, and it was designed to garner a \nbroad range of support. However, the House\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nproposal fell short by nearly two dozen votes, largely because it did \nnot win enough support from Democrats. As we know, in order for a \nbalanced budget amendment to succeed, it must be bipartisan. So I was \nsurprised to see that after the House balanced budget amendment failed, \ninstead of seeking to find consensus with those who could bring along \nadditional Democratic votes like me, my colleagues in the Senate on the \nother side of the aisle, led by my dear friend Senator Hatch, have \ntaken an altogether different route.\n  There are important differences between the two approaches the Senate \nwill vote on this week, my amendment and Senator Hatch's amendment. So \nI want to spend some time differentiating between the two proposals \nbecause they represent two philosophically different ideas. We will \nhave a vote on both of these proposals later this week.\n  Balancing our books is a simple equation based on the principle that \nour Nation is healthier without an unreasonably large debt load. \nMembers of both parties can agree on that. Yet Senator Hatch's proposal \ngoes a number of steps further and seemingly seeks to shrink government \naltogether. Not only does it require an unwieldy two-thirds majority to \nwaive it in case of national emergencies, it also locks in special \ninterest tax breaks and could weaken Social Security, Medicare, and \nother important programs that are supported by a vast majority of \nAmericans.\n  Ironically, Senator Hatch's proposal--at least by some analyses--\ncould jeopardize our national defense as well. Why do I say that?\n  I see my dear friend on the Senate floor. I look forward to engaging \nwith him over the course of this important debate.\n  The Republican proposal prevents government from spending more than \n18 percent of gross domestic product, which is less than the historical \naverage, less than what George W. Bush spent, less than what Ronald \nReagan spent, and less than what is required to care for our Nation's \nseniors and protect our homeland against terrorist attacks. Quite \nsimply, to my way of looking at this, Senator Hatch's alternative \nproposal goes too far and has the potential to harm our middle class \nand future economic growth.\n  So what am I proposing? Well, let me tell you what I think my \nproposal would do, and I would note that it is cosponsored by a number \nof my colleagues from across the country.\n  My amendment would allow us to avoid the mistakes of the last decade \nwithout locking ourselves into a requirement that could tie our hands \nin an emergency. In such a case, if we tie our hands, we could make our \neconomy worse for the middle class and small businesses and therefore \nfor all of us.\n  My balanced budget amendment proposes and incorporates a big dose of \nColorado common sense. It is aimed at finding common ground that both \nparties and a big majority of Americans can support. It starts with a \nstrict requirement for balancing our books. My proposal would then \nallow deficits only when three-fifths of the House and Senate vote to \naddress serious economic downturns or a war or other emergencies. \nHowever, it would also prevent some of the worst mistakes Congress has \nmade in the past 10 years. For example, it would prevent deficit-\nbusting tax breaks for Americans who earn $1 million or more per year. \nI think the Presiding Officer and I have a fundamental question. We \nwonder why we should continue to give tax breaks to the wealthiest \namong us during times when we are running huge deficits and aggregating \ndebt like never before.\n  My amendment would also create a Social Security lockbox to keep \nCongress from raiding the trust fund to hide the true size of our \nannual deficits. Right now, the Treasury Department owes close to $3 \ntrillion to the Social Security Administration. What I want to do is to \nsee that never again is Social Security used as a slush fund to remedy \nour budgeting problems.\n  In sum, my proposal upholds the principle that we should pay for our \ngovernment in a responsible manner, with waiver authority to be used \nonly in exceptional circumstances. I think most Americans could agree \nto that. Coloradans certainly do.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to acknowledge that passing a \nbalanced budget amendment will require some flexibility and \ncooperation, and my version is designed to do just that. It is meant to \nbridge the divide between us.\n  The American people are demanding that we get our fiscal house in \norder. As usual, they are a few steps ahead of us. We have an \nopportunity to catch up to the American people. So I am here on the \nfloor of the Senate today to ask my colleagues of both parties and both \nChambers to support my proposal. As I have said, amending the \nConstitution may not be the solution desired by many in this Chamber. \nIt is not something to be done without great thought. I, therefore, \nlook forward to an honest and spirited dialog about the balanced budget \namendment. I look forward to discussing the best ways to dig ourselves \nout from under our suffocating debt in a way that will encourage \ninvestment and job creation and help Americans and small businesses \nfeel secure about their economic future. Our children's future depends \non it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I care a great deal for my colleague from \nColorado, and I appreciate his explanation of his amendment. \nUnfortunately, as I view his amendment, it might work as long as you \naccept the rachet up of spending and taxing. That is what we are trying \nto stop around here. His S.J. Res 24 would be a band-aid on the system. \nIt does not address the cause of our unbalanced budgets. An amendment \nthat does not limit spending and does not limit taxes will never solve \nthis crisis. It is just that simple. And to work, they have to use \nbudget gimmicks.\n  I wish to begin by thanking my friend, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Grassley. In his service on the committee, \nhe has always been a champion of our limited government, and with his \nremarks today he has again proven himself a strong advocate of \nconstitutional government. So, too, my good friend and collaborator on \na balanced budget amendment, Senator Cornyn, deserves recognition, as \nwell as my partner in the Senate, Mike Lee, and a whole raft of \nothers--47, to be exact. Earlier today, Senator Cornyn highlighted \nadmirably the threat our debt poses to the liberty and prosperity of \nall of America's citizens. And although he has not spoken yet, I know \nin advance that my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Mike Lee, \nwith whom I worked closely in drafting S.J. Res 10, will deliver \npowerful remarks later today in support of this amendment and about the \nimportance of restoring meaningful limits on the power of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Today we are engaged in a historic debate. You might not know it from \nthe amount of time dedicated to the subject, but I am confident that \nwhen the history of our country is written, today will be marked as a \nturning point.\n  Today is the day that every Republican in the Senate stood up for a \nstrong balanced budget amendment that will begin to restore this \nNation's fiscal integrity. It is the day that conservatives stood up \nand supported a constitutional amendment that would reset the limit on \nthe size and power of a federal government that has grown far too \nlarge. It is the day that the people of this country stood up for \nserious constitutional limits on Congress and the President, who have \nspent with impunity for far too long.\n\n  We are having this debate for a simple reason: Our Nation is now $15 \ntrillion--actually more than $15 trillion and going up every day--in \ndebt. This chart shows just how much it was just a few minutes ago. It \nis important to put this number in perspective.\n  The Nation achieved the ignominious landmark of a trillion-dollar \ndeficit in President Obama's first year in office. We are now in our \nthird straight year of trillion-dollar deficits. The Federal Government \nis now borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends. The \nburden of this debt is more than $48,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that interest payments alone \non all of this debt will total $4.5 trillion, crowding out many other \nnational priorities. For 2010, spending on interest on the national \ndebt is greater than\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nthe funding for most other Federal programs. Let's look at that. As you \ncan see, in 1 year, spending on interest on the national debt is \ngreater than funding for most programs--$656.7 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense; $414 billion for interest expense; $173 billion \nfor the Department of Labor; $129 billion for the Department of \nAgriculture; $108 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs; and \njust one other I will mention, $92.9 billion for the Department of \nEducation.\n  Well, the impact of this quickly escalating debt burden could prove \ncatastrophic for economic growth and for American families. In a letter \nto the then-ranking member of the House Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, \nthe Congressional Budget Office determined that ``beyond 2058, \nprojected deficits in the alternative fiscal scenario become so large \nand unsustainable that CBO's model cannot calculate their effects.'' \nThat ought to tell you something. In other words, the CBO model crashes \nwhen it even attempts to calculate the impact of all of this debt on \neconomic growth. Yet all of these numbers might be understating the \nNation's debt burden. What happens if interest rates rise? Right now \nthey are at historic lows, but that will not always be the case, and we \nare figuring on historic lows right now as though they are going to \ncontinue.\n  According to CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, which is our most \nrealistic fiscal scenario, debt held by the public will reach 82 \npercent of GDP by 2021. Now, that is if they are right, and they have \nnever been right yet over the long term; they are always low. Absent \nreal fiscal reforms, it will reach 100 percent of GDP by 2035. But this \ndoes not tell the whole bleak story. The fact is, when you include the \nIOUs the government has issued to itself, intergovernmental holdings, \nour debt is already at 100 percent of GDP--larger than our entire \neconomy.\n  When are our friends on the other side going to start thinking about \nthese things and start realizing that they are taking us right down \ninto bankruptcy in this country? This debt burden we have is simply not \nsustainable. If interest rates go back to their average in the 1990s, \nour public debt will increase by 77 percent over even these grim \nestimates I have just mentioned. We are spending at historical highs \nand going higher, and with interest on the debt taking a larger and \nlarger share of spending, we need to be very concerned as a nation that \nwe are entering a debt spiral from which we will have a difficult time \nextricating ourselves.\n  For these reasons, ADM Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, concluded that our national debt is the ``biggest \nthreat we have to our national security.'' For these reasons, Standard \n& Poor's issued its historic downgrade of U.S. Treasuries this past \nsummer.\n  The impact of this debt is more than academic; it will eventually \nlead to higher interest rates for all Americans, undermining the \nability of people to purchase a home, buy a car, or even start a \nbusiness. Most importantly, it will fundamentally alter the \nrelationship of citizens to their government. It will further undermine \npersonal liberty. It will lead to more government control of the \neconomy. And it will jeopardize the livelihoods of American business \nowners and workers as ever-escalating debt and government spending \nembolden those who seek higher taxes to finance this leviation.\n  The solution to this problem is S.J. Res. 10, the balanced budget \namendment supported by every Senate Republican, all 47 of us.\n  In the time I have been fortunate enough to serve the people of Utah, \nI have sponsored 5 balanced budget amendments and have been an original \ncosponsor of 18. These amendments have not been identical. Their \nprovisions have been honed over time. I am confident this version \nstrikes just the right balance.\n  It is the right amendment for the right time. We face a crisis of \nspending and a government that has clearly exploded in size. This \nconstitutional amendment is the only one that will be debated this week \nthat will address that crisis and would reduce the size of this \nLeviathan government.\n  The President has strongly opposed not only this balanced budget \namendment but any balanced budget amendment. As he said: ``We don't \nneed a constitutional amendment to do our jobs.'' My goodness. That is \nwhat he said on July 15 of this year.\n  I wish to spend a few moments considering the President's claim. The \nPresident claimed that a balanced budget amendment is not necessary \nbecause ``the Constitution already tells us to do our jobs--and to make \nsure that the government is living within its means and making \nresponsible choices.''\n  The President's spokesman, Jay Carney, elaborated in greater detail \non why a balanced budget amendment is not necessary. According to him, \nbalancing the budget is ``not complicated.'' All that is needed is that \nwe put politics aside, quit ducking responsibility, and roll up our \nsleeves and get to work. Yet all I hear from the White House is that we \nhave to have more taxes and more spending.\n  This is the lament of the tough chooser, a term coined by the \njournalist Andrew Ferguson. The tough chooser talks a lot about making \ntough choices. But when it comes to actually making them, the tough \nchooser goes missing.\n  Tough choosers, concerned about our deficits and debt, voted for \nObamaCare, even though it increased spending by $2.6 trillion and taxes \nby over $1 trillion.\n  Tough choosers reject a balanced budget amendment because all that is \nrequired, in their view, is some tough choosing by legislators. The \nproblem with this theory is that the so-called tough choosers never \nstep up.\n  The past history of the balanced budget amendment is all the evidence \nwe need that a constitutional amendment is required to force \nlegislators and the White House to make these tough choices. But given \nPresident Obama's rejection of the balanced budget amendment, it is \nworth considering his own actions this year and his personal \ncontributions to deficit reduction. That record is a weak one of denial \nand avoidance.\n  Following the clear statement of the American people last November \nthat Washington needed to address deficits and debt, the President had \nan opportunity to lead with his fiscal year 2012 budget. Yet this is \nhow the Washington Post described the impact of that budget. After next \nyear, ``the deficit will begin to fall, settling around $600 billion a \nyear through 2018, when it would once again begin to climb as a growing \nnumber of retirees tapped into Social Security and Medicare.''\n  So the President, who today is telling us that he and Congress are \nwilling to buckle down and make tough choices to balance the Nation's \nbooks, gave us a budget that did little to put this country on a path \ntoward long-term fiscal sustainability.\n  The President's budget landed with such a thud and was so \nunresponsive to the desire of the American people to tackle the debt, \nthat he took a mulligan and attempted a budget do-over in the Spring. \nIn an April 13 speech at George Washington University, President Obama \noffered a revised budget. True to form, he did not stick his neck out \nand actually offer anything that could be scored by the CBO. Yet \nRepublicans did analyze the President's speech, and after stripping out \nthe gimmicks and the rosy scenarios, they found that far from making \nany tough choices, his do-over actually added $2.2 trillion to the \ndeficit.\n  This avoidance of tough choosing by Washington's tough choosers is, \nunfortunately, the norm.\n  We have heard the President's argument before. I have heard it now \nfor 35 years, maybe not just from him but from others as well. We hear \nit every time a balanced budget amendment comes to the floor and is \ndebated in the Senate. The opponents claim there is no need for a \nbalanced budget amendment; all that is necessary is that we put \npolitics aside and make the tough choices.\n  So how is that working out for our country?\n  When I introduced my first balanced budget amendment in 1979, the \nnational debt was $827 billion. We thought that was astronomical. In \n1982, when the Senate passed a balanced budget amendment that I \ncosponsored, the national debt had risen to $1.1 trillion. In 1986, \nwhen the Senate failed by one vote to pass a balanced budget amendment \nthat I cosponsored, the national debt topped $2.1 trillion. By 1997,\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nwhen this body voted on a balanced budget amendment that I introduced, \nthe national debt had passed the $5 trillion mark. Today, it is three \ntimes that amount--over $15 trillion.\n  The record is clear. Absent the constitutional restraint of a \nbalanced budget amendment, Congress and the President do not make the \ntough choices. Instead, they take the path of least resistance. They \ngladly disperse Federal dollars today--to grateful special interests--\nand then figure out a way to pay for it tomorrow, except they never \nfigure out the way.\n  This is not the political and economic philosophy of the Founders, \nwho warned at the birth of our Republic against debt and overspending. \nThat is the political philosophy of J. Wellington Wimpy, who would \n``gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.''\n  A balanced budget amendment is not an abdication of Congress's \nresponsibility. On the contrary, it would force Congress to live up to \nits responsibilities. It would force Congress and the President to make \nthe choices about national spending priorities they have thus far been \nunwilling to make.\n  I don't think there are many Americans who question whether our \nfiscal situation would be better today if we had enacted and the States \nhad ratified a constitutional amendment when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident.\n  This is where we are headed as a country if we don't get our fiscal \nhouse in order. We are headed off a cliff. I could have put up a map of \nGreece, but that might have understated our predicament.\n  Yet to hear the opponents of a balanced budget amendment talk, one \nwould think the problem we face as a country is the amendment, not the \nout-of-control spending that demands such an amendment.\n  These misplaced priorities fundamentally understate how much \ngovernment spending is accelerating in this country and the threat this \nspending poses for personal liberty, constitutionally limited \ngovernment, and free enterprise.\n  As I noted earlier, our true debt burden is already 100 percent of \nGDP. This is very dangerous territory. According to the economists \nCarmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, public debt burdens above 90 \npercent of GDP are associated with 1-percent lower economic growth.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a short article outlining their thesis \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Bloomberg.com, July 14, 2011]\n\n    Too Much Debt Means the Economy Can't Grow: Reinhart and Rogoff\n\n             (By Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff)\n\n       As public debt in advanced countries reaches levels not \n     seen since the end of World War II, there is considerable \n     debate about the urgency of taming deficits with the aim of \n     stabilizing and ultimately reducing debt as a percentage of \n     gross domestic product.\n       Our empirical research on the history of financial crises \n     and the relationship between growth and public liabilities \n     supports the view that current debt trajectories are a risk \n     to long-term growth and stability, with many advanced \n     economies already reaching or exceeding the important marker \n     of 90 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, many prominent public \n     intellectuals continue to argue that debt phobia is wildly \n     overblown. Countries such as the U.S., Japan and the U.K. \n     aren't like Greece, nor does the market treat them as such.\n       Indeed, there is a growing perception that today's low \n     interest rates for the debt of advanced economies offer a \n     compelling reason to begin another round of massive fiscal \n     stimulus. If Asian nations are spinning off huge excess \n     savings partly as a byproduct of measures that effectively \n     force low-income savers to put their money in bank accounts \n     with low government-imposed interest-rate ceilings--why not \n     take advantage of the cheap money?\n       Although we agree that governments must exercise caution in \n     gradually reducing crisis-response spending, we think it \n     would be folly to take comfort in today's low borrowing \n     costs, much less to interpret them as an ``all clear'' signal \n     for a further explosion of debt.\n       Several studies of financial crises show that interest \n     rates seldom indicate problems long in advance. In fact, we \n     should probably be particularly concerned today because a \n     growing share of advanced country debt is held by official \n     creditors whose current willingness to forego short-term \n     returns doesn't guarantee there will be a captive audience \n     for debt in perpetuity.\n       Those who would point to low servicing costs should \n     remember that market interest rates can change like the \n     weather. Debt levels, by contrast, can't be brought down \n     quickly. Even though politicians everywhere like to argue \n     that their country will expand its way out of debt, our \n     historical research suggests that growth alone is rarely \n     enough to achieve that with the debt levels we are \n     experiencing today.\n       While we expect to see more than one member of the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development default \n     or restructure their debt before the European crisis is \n     resolved, that isn't the greatest threat to most advanced \n     economies. The biggest risk is that debt will accumulate \n     until the overhang weighs on growth.\n\n\n                         Historical Precedents\n\n       At what point does indebtedness become a problem? In our \n     study ``Growth in a Time of Debt,'' we found relatively \n     little association between public liabilities and growth for \n     debt levels of less than 90 percent of GDP. But burdens above \n     90 percent are associated with 1 percent lower median growth. \n     Our results are based on a data set of public debt covering \n     44 countries for up to 200 years. The annual data set \n     incorporates more than 3,700 observations spanning a wide \n     range of political and historical circumstances, legal \n     structures and monetary regimes.\n       We aren't suggesting there is a bright red line at 90 \n     percent; our results don't imply that 89 percent is a safe \n     debt level, or that 91 percent is necessarily catastrophic. \n     Anyone familiar with doing empirical research understands \n     that vulnerability to crises and anemic growth seldom depends \n     on a single factor such as public debt. However, our study of \n     crises shows that public obligations are often hidden and \n     significantly larger than official figures suggest.\n\n\n                      Creative Accounting Devices\n\n       In addition, off-balance sheet guarantees and other \n     creative accounting devices make it even harder to assess the \n     true nature of a country's debt until a crisis forces \n     everything out into the open. (Just think of the giant U.S. \n     mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose debt was \n     never officially guaranteed before the 2008 meltdown.)\n       There also is the question of how broad a measure of public \n     debt to use. Our empirical work concentrates on central-\n     government obligations because state and local data are so \n     limited across time and countries, and government guarantees, \n     as noted, are difficult to quantify over time. (Until we \n     developed our data set, no long-dated cross-country \n     information on central government debt existed.) But state \n     and local debt are important because they so frequently \n     trigger federal government bailouts in a crisis. Official \n     figures for state debts don't include chronic late payments \n     (arrears), which are substantial in Illinois and California, \n     for example.\n\n\n                        Public and Private Debt\n\n       Indeed, it isn't unusual for governments to absorb large \n     chunks of troubled private debt in a crisis. Taking this into \n     account, chart 1, attached, shows the extraordinarily high \n     level of overall U.S. debts, public and private.\n       In addition to ex-ante or ex-post government guarantees and \n     other forms of ``hidden debts,'' any discussion of public \n     liabilities should take into account the demographic \n     challenges across the industrialized world. Our 90 percent \n     threshold is largely based on earlier periods when old-age \n     pensions and health-care costs hadn't grown to anything near \n     the size they are today. Surely this makes the burden of debt \n     greater.\n       There is a growing sense that inflation is the endgame to \n     debt buildups. For emerging markets that has often been the \n     case, but for advanced economies, the historical correlation \n     is weaker. Part of the reason for this apparent paradox may \n     be that, especially after World War II, many governments \n     enacted policies that amounted to heavy financial repression, \n     including interest-rate ceilings and non-market debt \n     placement. Low statutory interest rates allowed governments \n     to reduce real debt burdens through moderate inflation over a \n     sustained period. Of course, this time could be different, \n     and we shouldn't entirely dismiss the possibility of elevated \n     inflation as the antidote to debt.\n\n\n                             Extremely Rare\n\n       Those who remain unconvinced that rising debt levels pose a \n     risk to growth should ask themselves why, historically, \n     levels of debt of more than 90 percent of GDP are relatively \n     rare and those exceeding 120 percent are extremely rare (see \n     attached chart 2 for U.S. public debt since 1790). Is it \n     because generations of politicians failed to realize that \n     they could have kept spending without risk? Or, more likely, \n     is it because at some point, even advanced economies hit a \n     ceiling where the pressure of rising borrowing costs forces \n     policy makers to increase tax rates and cut government \n     spending, sometimes precipitously, and sometimes in \n     conjunction with inflation and financial repression (which is \n     also a tax)?\n       Even absent high interest rates, as Japan highlights, debt \n     overhangs are a hindrance to growth.\n       The relationship between growth, inflation and debt, no \n     doubt, merits further study; it is a question that cannot be \n     settled with mere rhetoric, no matter how superficially \n     convincing.\n       In the meantime, historical experience and early \n     examination of new data suggest the need to be cautious about \n     surrendering to ``this-time-is-different'' syndrome and \n     decreeing that surging government debt isn't as significant a \n     problem in the present as it was in the past.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, while one might quibble with the \nparticulars of Reinhart's and Rogoff's assessment, failure to take it \nseriously, given the recent struggles of the eurozone, amounts to \nwhistling past the graveyard.\n  To be clear, the long-term source of our fiscal problem is \noverspending, not a lack of revenue. Our friends at the Heritage \nFoundation have done an excellent job of putting all this spending into \nhistorical perspective.\n  I will run through some charts highlighting just how unusual and \nunsustainable recent levels of Federal spending have become. Any way we \ncut it, spending is up. Federal spending per household is skyrocketing, \neven with the $2.1 trillion in deficit reduction achieved by this \nsummer's Budget Control Act.\n  In 1965, Federal spending per household was $11,431. In 2010, it was \n$29,401. It is projected to hit $35,773 in 2020. That is per household.\n  Federal spending is growing faster than median income. Between 1970 \nand 2009, total Federal spending rose by 299 percent, while median \nhousehold income has gone up 27 percent in the same time period.\n  Federal spending that is far out of line with historical averages is \nthe cause of our annual deficits and total debt--not the much reviled \n2001 and 2003 tax relief extended by President Obama and a Democratic \nCongress.\n  Historically, revenues have averaged around 18 percent of GDP. As the \neconomy recovers, CBO projects revenues to return to that historical \naverage. Yet spending is going higher and higher.\n  The end result of all this spending is not pretty to look at. Our \nnational debt is going to skyrocket. Up to 344 percent by 2050.\n  The problem the Senate Republican balanced budget amendment is meant \nto address is reckless spending. We will hear many arguments against \nthis amendment. We will hear it prevents tax increases. We will hear it \nprevents deficit spending in an economic downturn. We will hear it \nhamstrings the Nation in times of military emergency and that it \nprevents spending in excess of 18 percent of GDP.\n  It does no such thing. What it does do is require a broad national \nconsensus before Congress spends beyond its means. It makes certain \nthat there is deep bipartisan agreement before raising taxes--a \nprovision the Nation would have benefited from prior to the decision of \nthe President and congressional Democrats to drive through $1 trillion \nin ObamaCare tax increases on nearly party-line votes, and it demands \nwide support for spending in excess of 18 percent of GDP.\n  As my friends at Americans for Prosperity put it in their letter of \nsupport for the Republican proposal, the amendment ``strikes a balance \nbetween allowing flexibility for some deficit spending in times of \nnational emergency, while requiring supermajorities in both Chambers to \ndo so. This assures citizens that the Federal Government will only run \na deficit when there is broad consensus that a genuine crisis demands \nit.''\n  That sounds like pretty good language to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter from Americans for \nProsperity be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans for Prosperity,\n\n                                                   March 31, 2011.\n       Dear Senator Hatch and Cosponsors: On behalf of more than \n     1.7 million Americans for Prosperity (AFP) activists in all \n     50 states, I applaud you for proposing a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution that includes a \n     strong limit on total federal spending. Over the past decade \n     or so, it has become increasingly clear that unless there are \n     firm constitutional guardrails to constrain federal spending \n     elected officials are either unable or unwilling to overcome \n     the institutional forces that facilitate endless profligacy. \n     Your proposed amendment seeks to establish those guardrails \n     in a responsible and, hopefully, effective way.\n       One of the most important provisions in your proposed \n     amendment is a spending cap that would limit federal outlays \n     to 18 percent of GDP. This limitation reflects a proper \n     vision of limited government and the relationship of spending \n     to GDP in the post-WWII period. Additionally, by insisting \n     that spending is restrained in order to balance the budget \n     you guard against the amendment being hijacked and distorted \n     to advance economically-destructive tax increases.\n       Your amendment also strikes a balance between allowing \n     flexibility for some deficit spending in times of national \n     emergency, while requiring supermajorities in both chambers \n     to do so. This assures citizens that the federal government \n     will only run a deficit when there is a broad consensus that \n     a genuine crisis demands it.\n       Several other provisions nicely round out your balanced \n     budget amendment. Your insistence on two-thirds majority vote \n     to approve tax increases or spending above 18 percent of GDP \n     is laudable. Your measure to prohibit courts from legislating \n     tax increases from the bench is important and prescient. \n     Finally, a five-year transitionary period from ratification \n     to legal efficacy will give budgeteers enough notice to take \n     meaningful action without the politically-contentious \n     transition that could otherwise be used as a pretext to \n     oppose the amendment.\n       While it is always difficult to predict how the Judicial \n     Branch will interpret any portion of the Constitution, the \n     mere presence of a balanced budget amendment will serve to \n     compel the tough decision making that is often skirted in \n     today's federal budget process. It's time for the federal \n     government to balance its books, and AFP is proud to support \n     your amendment. I urge your colleagues to support its passage \n     and I look forward to working with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      James Valvo,\n                                   Director of Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we will hear there is a reasonable \nalternative being offered. But we need to understand this for what it \nis. It doesn't put any spending limitations on Congress. It leaves wide \nthe door for massive tax increases to pay for levels of spending that \nare far outside our constitutional traditions. Even the requirement for \nbalance--that outlays not exceed revenues--lacks strength, if we read \nit carefully.\n  The bottom line is that there is no substitute for the strong \nbalanced budget amendment being offered by the Senate Republicans.\n  A number of protaxpayer groups committed to liberty and \nconstitutionalism have written in support of our balanced budget \namendment--Let Freedom Ring, Americans for Tax Reform, the National \nTaxpayers Union, the 60 Plus Association, Americans for Limited \nGovernment, and the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, just \nto mention a few.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 30, 2011.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Toomey,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Lee,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write to encourage your colleagues to \n     support your Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution, signaling the United States Senate is serious \n     about reforming federal government spending.\n       The amendment limits spending to 18 percent of Gross \n     Domestic Product (GDP). Capping spending at this level puts \n     spending in line with the historical average of revenue \n     receipts. Since 1970, spending has averaged 21 percent of GDP \n     while tax revenues have consistently stayed around 18 \n     percent. However, CBO projects spending will explode over the \n     next decade, averaging over 23 percent of GDP. Capping \n     spending at 18 percent demonstrates that the government \n     should be cognizant of its means--and live prudently within \n     them.\n       Most importantly, your Balanced Budget Amendment places the \n     onus of responsible budgeting on lawmakers, rather than \n     passing the burden onto taxpayers who are already shouldering \n     the weight of failed ``stimulus'' programs and bailouts. It \n     does this by requiring any net tax increases to overcome a \n     two-thirds supermajority in each chamber of Congress.\n       This clause is vital to keep the debate where it should \n     be--federal overspending. Americans are not taxed too little; \n     Washington spends too much. In the same vein, the spending \n     restraint in the amendment cannot be waived unless a two-\n     thirds majority agrees to do so.\n       While the bill could be strengthened to require a \n     supermajority to waive the spending cap during a declared \n     war, it does require a vote of three-fifths of the Congress \n     to approve spending beyond the cap in the times of a military \n     conflict. What's more, the amendment requires a three-fifths \n     vote to raise the debt limit, forcing Congress to confront \n     its poor spending habits rather than simply increasing its \n     borrowing authority.\n       Thus, we support the Balanced Budget Amendment and \n     encourage your colleagues\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\n     to cosponsor the measure to signal lawmakers are serious \n     about fiscal restraint.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grover Norquist,\n       President, Americans for Tax Reform.\n     Mattie Corrao,\n       Executive Director, Center for Fiscal Accountability.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                                   March 31, 2011.\n\n   An Open Letter to the United States Senate: Support the Consensus \n                       Balanced Budget Amendment!\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 362,000 member National \n     Taxpayers Union (NTU), I write to provide our strong \n     endorsement of the ``Consensus Balanced Budget Amendment'' \n     (BBA), which is the product of negotiations among advocates \n     of several BBA measures. We commend Senator Hatch and his \n     colleagues, Senators Lee, Cornyn, Kyl, McConnell, Toomey, \n     Snowe, Risch, Rubio, DeMint, Paul, Vitter, Enzi, Kirk, and \n     Crapo, for introducing this legislation and urge all Senators \n     to cosponsor the resolution.\n       NTU has approached the current legislative evolution of the \n     BBA not merely as an interested observer or even as a \n     concerned stakeholder. Instead, we view this process through \n     a 40-plus-year organizational history in which constitutional \n     limits on the size of government have occupied the central \n     part of our mission.\n       Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, my organization helped to \n     launch and sustain the movement for a limited Article V \n     amendment convention among the states to propose a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment (BBA) for ratification, all while pursuing a \n     BBA through Congress. Our members were elated over the \n     passage of S.J. Res. 58 in 1982, and the passage of H.J. Res. \n     1 in 1995 through the House of Representatives. In both cases \n     the measures, whose provisions varied somewhat, fell short of \n     enactment in the other chambers of Congress. More recently, \n     we have provided endorsements to BBA legislation such as S.J. \n     Res. 3 and H.J. Res. 1.\n       To our members, a BBA would provide the very lifeblood that \n     will restore and sustain the financial health of our \n     Republic. We are therefore elated over the intensifying \n     interest among Members of Congress and state legislators in a \n     unified BBA concept. The proposal admirably harnesses this \n     energy, by combining and refining elements from several \n     amendments introduced thus far in Congress. These include \n     strong ``supermajority'' safeguards against reckless tax or \n     debt increases as well as override provisions to confront the \n     realities of military conflicts.\n       Also of great importance is the amendment's spending \n     limitation clause. Although several types of mechanisms could \n     answer to the purpose of controlling growth in expenditures, \n     any such protection incorporating Gross Domestic Product \n     (GDP) must pay careful heed to historical experience. In this \n     case, an annual spending cap at 18 percent of GDP is clearly \n     the most prudent choice. Such a level reflects the share of \n     economic output that federal revenues have typically \n     represented since World War II. Given that constitutional \n     amendments should be designed with a long nod to the past and \n     an equally farsighted view to the future, 18 percent is a \n     most stable and logical benchmark.\n       In addition, setting the expenditure limit at 18 percent \n     would make a vital contribution toward harmonizing all parts \n     of the amendment so that the whole functions as intended. An \n     assumption that spending should normally be linked to the \n     average and customary federal revenue proportion would by its \n     very nature give Congress and the President a starting point \n     that is closer to balance. Indeed, the limit helps to remedy \n     Washington's increasingly metastasized affliction of tax-\n     spend-and-borrow, by elevating the concept of expenditure \n     restraint to its rightful place in policymaking. While the \n     two-thirds ``supermajority'' override requirement is \n     essential to ensuring this place, so is the 18 percent cap on \n     expenditures. If set too high, the spending limit would \n     merely institutionalize, rather than minimize, deficits. \n     Recent spending-to-GDP ratios in excess of 20 percent--and \n     the resulting pressures to borrow or tax even more--ought to \n     convince fiscal disciplinarians of the need for a carefully-\n     designed limit.\n       We understand the political environment within which the \n     consensus BBA was crafted, and, given our history, we \n     appreciate the many challenges in the legislative effort that \n     lies ahead. Yet it is precisely our longstanding devotion to \n     this reform that gives us cause to make several observations. \n     Moving forward, Senators must commit to passage of the BBA in \n     this Congress, not simply another ``test vote'' tied to some \n     legislative urgency. This means making the Amendment a part \n     of the Congress's everyday narrative on tax and spending \n     policy, thereby leading a national discussion that occupies a \n     primary place in the public square. Nor should the BBA be \n     held as some proxy to other reform approaches. Indeed, \n     statutory or regulatory steps to control the nation's \n     finances are not ``second-best'' substitutes; their very \n     effectiveness depends upon a constitutional foundation that \n     will set the boundaries within which they can operate.\n       Furthermore, supporters of this BBA must reach far and wide \n     across the aisle to obtain the necessary bipartisan backing \n     that will ensure passage of the measure. The temptation to \n     put electoral calculations first is unacceptable to \n     taxpayers, who (properly) surmise that concerted action to \n     control deficits cannot wait until after 2012. Likewise, \n     Senators must engage their House colleagues as well as state \n     legislators in their capitols back home, many of whom have \n     both the commitment and the experience to see the BBA through \n     to passage and ratification.\n       Through all of these means, and toward the critical end of \n     enacting a Balanced Budget Amendment, NTU and members pledge \n     the fullest possible measure of their time, energy, and \n     resources. Together, we can fulfill this long-overdue \n     obligation to future generations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Pete Sepp,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 31, 2011.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of more than seven million \n     senior citizen activists, the 60 Plus Association thanks you \n     for introducing the joint resolution proposing an amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States relative to \n     balancing the budget.\n       Thanks to your outstanding leadership, this effort shows a \n     solid commitment to restore the fiscal stability of the \n     United States by balancing the nation's budget.\n       We applaud your efforts to respond to the overwhelming \n     concern Americans have to the spiraling debt and out-of-\n     control spending and cannot stress strongly enough that \n     senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors believe that current \n     budget policy cripples our economic stability and threatens \n     our nation's future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James L. Martin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Americans for\n\n\n                                           Limited Government,\n\n                                      Fairfax, VA, March 31, 2011.\n     Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\n     361-A Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     104 Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader McConnell and Senator Hatch: As you are well \n     aware, the nation is risking a fiscal calamity that threatens \n     a catastrophic default on the $14.2 trillion national debt \n     and the collapse of the dollar as the world's reserve \n     currency. If something is not done to bring the nation's \n     fiscal house into order, soon the debt will become too large \n     to even refinance, let alone be repaid.\n       That is why Americans for Limited Government strongly \n     endorses the Senate Republican Balanced Budget Amendment and \n     urges all members of the Senate to fight for its immediate \n     adoption. Soon the gross national debt will become larger \n     than the entire economy, and by 2021, the Office of \n     Management and Budget projects it will soar to over $25 \n     trillion.\n       Interest payments alone threaten to destabilize the \n     nation's finances very soon. In 2010, the Treasury paid a \n     total of $413 billion in interest, including $216 billion to \n     the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The total \n     interest is a real obligation that requires real borrowing to \n     meet, and cannot be readily discounted as revenue to the \n     entitlement programs when it is in fact a liability to \n     taxpayers.\n       The total interest owed on the debt will actually be over \n     $1.2 trillion in 2021. And since the government never \n     anticipates the debt being paid down, the number will easily \n     grow to over $2.4 trillion by 2030. Moody's has warned that \n     when interest owed on the debt reaches 18 to 20 percent of \n     revenue, the nation's gold-plated Triple-A credit rating will \n     be downgraded. The trouble is that the Office of Management \n     and Budget projects total interest owed for 2011 to be $430.4 \n     billion, which is already 19.79 percent of the projected \n     $2.174 trillion of revenue. That means time has already run \n     out.\n       Currently, the $14.2 trillion national debt already stands \n     at 95.5 percent of the nation's $14.8 trillion Gross Domestic \n     Product (GDP). While it is unclear at what percentage of \n     debt-to-GDP that the debt will become too large to refinance, \n     the warning signs are already there that we cannot even meet \n     our current obligations honestly.\n       Pimco reports that in 2009, 80 percent of treasuries were \n     purchased by the Federal Reserves, and in 2010, it had to buy \n     70 percent, bringing its current U.S. debt holdings to $1.3 \n     trillion. As a result, the Fed is the largest lender to the \n     U.S. government in the world--all with printed money--more \n     than China or Japan. When the Fed ends QE2 in June, it will \n     likely keep a high water mark of $1.5 trillion in treasuries \n     holdings.\n       Printing money to refinance the debt cannot continue for \n     long without very severe consequences, including a potential \n     collapse of the dollar as the world's reserve currency, \n     hyperinflation, and a complete default on the nation's \n     obligations. The time to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     is now, before it is too late and it becomes impossible for \n     the debt to ever be repaid.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment being proposed, once \n     implemented, will make it possible that for the first time \n     since 1957, the national debt can be reduced. This must begin \n     to occur to reassure the nation's creditors that the U.S. \n     intends to honor its obligations with real money, not with a \n     ``pretended payment'' that economist Adam Smith warned \n     against.\n       With the upcoming vote on increasing the national debt \n     ceiling above $14.294 trillion,\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\n     now is the opportunity to use your leverage not just to get \n     an up-or-down vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment, but to \n     get it adopted. To do so, we urge you to take your case \n     directly to the American people, who will join with you in \n     fighting to make certain that another increase in the debt \n     will never again be necessary.\n       The American people must be advised of these cataclysmic \n     risks of inaction. There is a very dangerous misconception \n     that the nation can just continue borrowing and printing \n     money perpetually. It cannot. Nor will it long endure as the \n     world's foremost economic and military superpower if it tries \n     to.\n       Besides a failure to meet our fiscal obligations, a \n     national default will mean that the U.S. will be unable to \n     meet its security obligations around the world, destabilizing \n     whole regions, and threatening national security. It is \n     likely for this reason that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, described the debt as the number \n     one danger facing America.\n       With a projected $1.645 trillion budget deficit for this \n     year alone, the hour grows late for real action to rein in \n     the federal government's unsustainable spending binge. It is \n     clear that Congress lacks the political will to do what is \n     necessary on its own. It needs the constitutional limits on \n     spending, taxation, and the balanced budget requirement \n     outlined in your amendment to compel it to act prudently when \n     handling the American people's finances.\n       We thank you for your work on this critical issue, and urge \n     you to use all the tools at your disposal, including the \n     leverage of increasing the national debt ceiling, to ensure \n     speedy adoption of the Balanced Budget Amendment. If you will \n     take a courageous stand to save this nation from certain \n     ruin, the American people will surely stand with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Wilson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) will soon \n     introduce an amendment to the Constitution requiring that the \n     federal budget be balanced. This amendment has received wide \n     support, including that of Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \n     Mike Lee (R-Utah), John Cornyn (R-Tex.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), \n     Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), John Thune (R-S.D.) and Marco Rubio (R-\n     Fla.). On behalf of the more than one million members and \n     supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support this legislation.\n       Federal spending has ballooned out of control. Taxpayers \n     are bracing themselves as the nation rapidly approaches its \n     statutory, record-breaking $14.3 trillion debt limit. \n     According to the Congressional Budget Office, recession-\n     depleted tax revenues are scheduled to rebound to their \n     historical average of 18 percent of gross domestic product \n     (GDP) by 2018 and reach 18.4 percent by 2021. Federal \n     spending, which has historically been 20.3 percent of GDP, \n     however, is projected to reach 26.4 percent of GDP by 2021. \n     America is on a dangerous trajectory as Congress continues to \n     increase spending and raise debt ceilings without regard to \n     incoming levels of revenue. Washington has put taxpayers at \n     risk by violating a Budgeting 101 rule of thumb: Don't spend \n     more money than you take in.\n       This proposed constitutional amendment would ensure that \n     total outlays will not be allowed to exceed 18 percent of the \n     U.S. GDP of a fiscal year and will require the president to \n     submit a balanced budget to Congress that reflects the 18 \n     percent cap. A two-thirds majority vote would be required of \n     both the House and Senate to override the spending cap, \n     increase taxes or levy a new tax. Additionally, a three-\n     fifths majority vote in both Houses would be needed to \n     increase the debt limit. In times of declared war, a simple \n     majority vote will be necessary for a specific excess amount \n     above the 18 percent cap, and in times of military conflict a \n     three-fifths majority will be required. In order to protect \n     taxpayers, the amendment prohibits courts from raising \n     revenue as a means of enforcement.\n       The federal government has a moral and fiscal \n     responsibility to Americans that it has simply been shirking. \n     Congress cannot continue on a spending rampage while ignoring \n     the nation's balance sheets. This legislation proposes a \n     practical and necessary constitutional amendment that will \n     safeguard taxpayers and force Congress to balance the \n     national budget. All votes on the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     will be among those considered in CCAGW's 2011 Congressional \n     Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am so pleased conservative leaders such \nas Ed Meese, Dick Thornburgh, and Ken Blackwell have stood in support \nof a strong balanced budget amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nthe op-eds to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Bloomberg.com, July 20, 2011]\n\n              Deficits Need Balanced-Budget Amendment Fix\n\n                          (By Dick Thornburgh)\n\n       A late entrant in the budget deficit-debt ceiling talkathon \n     in Washington is increasing support for a constitutional \n     requirement that the federal budget be balanced every year. \n     Liberals will no doubt characterize this proposal as a nutty \n     one, but careful scrutiny of such an amendment to our \n     constitution demonstrates its potential to prevent future \n     train wrecks in the budgeting process.\n       Constitutional budget-balancing requirements are already \n     available to most governors and state legislatures, along \n     with a line-item veto and separate capital budgeting, which \n     differentiates investments from current outlays. They work.\n       Any debate in Congress will probably include the following \n     arguments against a balanced-budget amendment:\n       First, that the amendment would clutter our basic document \n     in a way contrary to the intention of the Founding Fathers. \n     This is clearly wrong. The framers of the Constitution \n     contemplated that amendments would be necessary to keep it \n     abreast of the times. It has, in fact, been amended 27 times.\n       Moreover, at the time of the Constitutional Convention, one \n     of the major preoccupations was how to liquidate the post- \n     Revolutionary War debts of the states. It would have been \n     unthinkable to the framers that the federal government would \n     systematically run a deficit, decade after decade. The \n     Treasury didn't begin to follow such a practice until the \n     mid-1930s.\n       Second, critics will argue that the adoption of a balanced-\n     budget amendment wouldn't solve the deficit problem \n     overnight. This is absolutely correct, but begs the issue. \n     Serious supporters of the amendment recognize that a phasing-\n     in of five to 10 years would be required.\n       During this interim period, however, budget makers would \n     have to meet declining deficit targets in order to reach a \n     final balanced budget by the established deadline.\n       As pointed out by former Commerce Secretary Peter G. \n     Peterson, such ``steady progress toward eliminating the \n     deficit will maintain investor confidence, keep long-term \n     interest rates headed down and keep our economy growing.''\n       Third, it will be argued that such an amendment would \n     require vast cuts in social services, entitlements and \n     defense spending. Not necessarily. True, these programs would \n     have to be paid for on a current basis rather than heaped on \n     the backs of future generations. Difficult choices would have \n     to be made about priorities and program funding. But the very \n     purpose of the amendment is to discipline the executive and \n     legislative branches, not to propose or perpetuate vast \n     spending programs without providing the revenue to fund them.\n       The amendment would, in effect, make the president and \n     Congress fully accountable for their spending and taxing \n     decisions.\n       Fourth, critics will say that a balanced-budget amendment \n     would prevent or hinder our capacity to respond to national \n     defense or economic emergencies. This concern is easy to \n     counter. Clearly, any sensible amendment proposal would \n     feature a safety valve to exempt deficits incurred in \n     response to emergencies, requiring, for example, a three-\n     fifths majority in both houses of Congress. Such action \n     should, of course, be based on a finding that such an \n     emergency actually exists.\n       Fifth, it will be said that a balanced-budget amendment \n     might be easily circumvented. The experience of the states \n     suggests otherwise. Balanced-budget requirements are now in \n     effect in all but one (Vermont) of the 50 states and have \n     served them well.\n       Moreover, the line-item veto, available to 43 governors, \n     would ensure that congressional overruns--or loophole end \n     runs--could be rejected by the president. The public's \n     opposition, the elective process and the courts would also \n     restrain any tendency to ignore a constitutional directive.\n       In the final analysis, most of the excuses for not enacting \n     a constitutional mandate to balance the budget rest on a \n     stated or implied preference for solving our deficit dilemma \n     through the political process--that is to say, through \n     responsible action by the president and Congress.\n       But that has been tried and found wanting, again and again.\n       Surely the U.S. is ready for a simple, clear and supreme \n     directive that compels elected officials to fulfill their \n     fiscal responsibilities. A constitutional amendment is the \n     only instrument that will meet this need. Years of experience \n     at the state level argue in favor of such a step. Years of \n     debate have produced no persuasive arguments against it.\n       The stakes are high. Perhaps Thomas Jefferson put it best: \n     ``To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us down with perpetual debt.''\n       That is the aim of a balanced-budget amendment. Reform-\n     minded members of Congress should support such an amendment \n     to our Constitution as a means of resolving future \n     legislative crises and ending credit-card government once and \n     for all.\n       A nutty idea? Not by a long shot.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Patriot Post, Apr. 5, 2011]\n\n      Hatch and Lee's Balanced Budget Amendment: A Win for America\n\n                           (By Ken Blackwell)\n\n       Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee introduced a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment (BBA)\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\n     to make it a constitutional requirement for Washington, D.C., \n     to end our deficit spending and culture of debt. And our \n     national grassroots organization, Pass the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, is working with them to compel lawmakers to \n     approve this change to the Supreme Law of the Land.\n       The BBA requires that the U.S. cannot spend more than it \n     takes in. There are a few exceptions, such as allowing two-\n     thirds of the House and Senate to suspend it for a specific \n     reason for one year, with lower thresholds to respond to a \n     military threat to our national security or an official, \n     declared war against a specific nation (not some open-ended \n     or global military operation).\n       The amendment is cosponsored by all 47 Senate Republicans. \n     This raises eyebrows in that the last time a proposed BBA was \n     voted on, 1997, it enjoyed Democratic support with 66 votes, \n     falling a single vote short in the Senate.\n       A separate story here is Utah's leading role. That state's \n     senior senator, Orrin Hatch, designed one version of the BBA. \n     Utah's junior senator, Mike Lee, designed another. Both \n     senators--one tied as the most senior Republican in the \n     chamber and the other among the newest--then designed a \n     composite version.\n       The resulting BBA addresses several major economic \n     priorities. In addition to forcing a balanced budget, the BBA \n     caps federal spending at 18 percent of GDP. It also requires \n     a 60-percent vote to raise the national debt limit. It \n     requires a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. And in forbids \n     courts from ordering any tax increase. The BBA thus addresses \n     multiple aspects of fiscal policy in a full-spectrum response \n     to America's debt-and-deficit nightmare.\n       Utah's predominance regarding a constitutional amendment is \n     no surprise. Hatch is the former chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and was talked up as a potential Supreme \n     Court nominee years ago. Lee is the only former Supreme Court \n     law clerk in the Senate, and is already mentioned as a \n     potential Supreme Court nominee. These two senators may be \n     bookends in seniority and age, but they are the foremost \n     constitutional scholars in the Senate.\n       The Constitution is extraordinarily difficult to amend, \n     requiring two-thirds of the House and Senate to propose it to \n     the states, then three-fourths of the states (38) to ratify \n     it.\n       To turn the BBA into reality, Senators Hatch and Lee are \n     working with a national grassroots organization, Pass the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, to organize volunteers in every \n     legislative district in America to mobilize political \n     momentum.\n       We are very grateful to have Senators Hatch and Lee as \n     Honorary Chairman. With their leadership, as well as others \n     such as Co-Chairman Ken Buck of Colorado, the BBA has the \n     best chances of passing since America's fiscal mismanagement \n     began decades ago.\n       This is not just about economic conservatives. We must \n     balance our national budget for the sake of our children's \n     future. And our national debt has now become a national \n     security concern as well. This is the perfect fusion of the \n     three legs of the Reagan Coalition, and will benefit all \n     Americans.\n       There are also serious political implications. TBBA could \n     change the national debate. With several GOP presidential \n     contenders endorsing the idea, this will likely be an issue \n     for the 2012 elections. Those of us involved at the \n     grassroots level with this issue and determined on making it \n     so.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Heritage Foundation, July 21, 2011]\n\n Balanced Budget Amendment: Instrument To Force Spending Cuts, Not Tax \n                                 Hikes\n\n                          (By Edwin Meese III)\n\n       As Congress considers what to do about federal overspending \n     and overborrowing, conservatives must maintain focus. We must \n     pursue the path that drives down federal spending and \n     borrowing and gets to a balanced budget, while preserving our \n     ability to protect America and without raising taxes. An \n     important part of that conservative agenda is adoption of a \n     sound--repeat, a sound--Balanced Budget Amendment. A Balanced \n     Budget Amendment is not sound if it leads to balancing the \n     federal budget by tax hikes instead of spending cuts. Thus, a \n     sound Balanced Budget Amendment must prohibit raising taxes \n     unless a two-thirds majority of the membership of both Houses \n     of Congress votes to raise them. Without the two-thirds \n     majority requirement, the Balanced Budget Amendment becomes \n     the means for big spenders to raise taxes.\n       Supporters of the Balanced Budget Amendment rightly want to \n     force the federal government to live within its means--to \n     spend no more than it takes in. Because the government has \n     failed for decades to follow that balanced budget principle, \n     America is now $14.294 trillion in debt, a debt of more than \n     $45,000 for every person in the United States.\n       President Obama is making things worse. In discussions with \n     congressional leaders, he has pushed hard to get authority to \n     borrow yet more trillions of dollars and hike taxes. And the \n     White House reiterated this week that President Obama opposes \n     amending the Constitution to require the federal government \n     to balance its budget.\n       A Sound Balanced Budget Amendment Must Require Two-Thirds \n     Majorities to Raise Federal Taxes. Like 72 percent of the \n     American people, The Heritage Foundation favors passage by \n     the requisite two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and \n     ratification by the requisite 38 states of an effective \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to become part of our Constitution. \n     Heritage has made clear that an effective Balanced Budget \n     Amendment must control spending, taxation, and borrowing; \n     ensure the defense of America; and enforce, through the \n     legislative process and without interference by the judicial \n     branch, the requirement to balance the budget. A sound \n     Balanced Budget Amendment will drive down federal spending \n     and end federal borrowing.\n       To date, Congress has proposed one largely sound Balanced \n     Budget Amendment for consideration--Senate Joint Resolution \n     10, often called the Hatch-Lee Amendment after its main \n     proponents. It has a number of important features, such as an \n     annual federal spending cap of not to exceed 18 percent of \n     the economy's annual output of goods and services (called the \n     gross domestic product, or GDP) that Congress cannot exceed, \n     except by a law passed with two-thirds majorities in both \n     Houses of Congress or in specified circumstances involving \n     military necessity.\n       A crucial feature is included in section 4 of the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment proposed by Senate Joint Resolution 10: \n     ``Any bill that imposes a new tax or increases the statutory \n     rate of any tax or the aggregate amount of revenue may pass \n     only by a two-thirds majority of the duly chosen and sworn \n     Members of each House of Congress by a roll call vote.'' The \n     requirement that no tax hikes occur without the approval of \n     290 Representatives and 67 Senators is essential in a sound \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. Without the requirement for two-\n     thirds majorities for any tax increase, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment becomes a sword for big spenders to use to raise \n     taxes, instead of a shield to protect Americans from tax \n     hikes. Those who seek to anchor into our Constitution a \n     requirement to balance the budget must always remember that, \n     if the only requirement is ``balance,'' that can be achieved \n     two ways--cut spending or hike taxes. A sound Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will balance the budget by driving down federal \n     spending and not by driving up federal taxes.\n       Balanced-Budget States that Allow Simple Majorities for Tax \n     Hikes Face Situations Very Different from that of the Federal \n     Government. Some look at the experience of states that have \n     requirements in their constitutions for a balanced state \n     budget and draw the wrong conclusion about the need for two-\n     thirds majorities for taxation. They mistakenly conclude that \n     a requirement merely for simple majorities in state \n     legislatures to raise taxes suffices to keep state taxation \n     under control and therefore that a federal Balanced Budget \n     Amendment should require only simple majorities in Congress \n     to raise taxes. But the balanced budget requirement at the \n     state level occurs in a very different context from such a \n     requirement at the federal level.\n       As a practical matter, state legislators regularly work and \n     live among the people they represent, often do their \n     legislative work face-to-face with their constituents, and \n     often depend upon direct contact with voters to persuade \n     voters to keep the legislators in office. As a result, state \n     legislators tend to be closely attuned and responsive to the \n     need of their constituents for reasonableness in taxation. In \n     contrast, U.S. Senators and Representatives spend much of \n     their time distant from the people they represent, often deal \n     with their constituents through the insulation of large \n     staffs, and amass large campaign funds through political \n     fundraising that allow them to depend more upon expensive \n     mass communications than upon direct contact with voters to \n     persuade the voters to keep them in office. As a result, U.S. \n     Senators and Representatives tend to be less directly attuned \n     and responsive to the need of their constituents for \n     reasonableness in taxation than state legislators are. \n     Accordingly, while a requirement for merely simple majorities \n     in state legislatures to raise taxes may suffice to keep \n     taxes under control in that state, simple majorities are not \n     likely to keep taxes under control at the federal level--as \n     the experience of federal tax increases in the last 50 years \n     proves.\n       Some who recognize the need for taxpayer protection by \n     requiring supermajorities, rather than just simple \n     majorities, of the two Houses of Congress to raise taxes \n     think a supermajority of three-fifths of both Houses would \n     suffice. While three-fifths would add a modicum of taxpayer \n     protection in the House, three-fifths would add little if \n     anything in the way of taxpayer protection in the Senate, \n     which already often requires a three-fifths majority to \n     proceed to consideration of legislation. The existing three-\n     fifths rule in the Senate has often failed to protect \n     taxpayers from federal tax increases in the past. A sound \n     Balanced Budget Amendment would add protection for taxpayers \n     in both Houses of Congress by a requirement for two-thirds \n     majorities of the membership of both Houses to raise taxes.\n       Conclusion: Adopt the Two-Thirds Majority Requirement for \n     Tax Hikes, to Make the Balanced Budget Amendment the \n     Instrument of Spending Cuts and Not Tax Hikes. America's \n     soon-to-be New Minority--people who pay federal income tax--\n     need protection from unreasonable taxation. When all \n     Americans have the right to vote, but only a minority has the \n     duty to pay the federal income taxes from which all Americans \n     benefit, the risk is high that a non-taxpaying\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\n     majority will elect a Congress pledged to adopt taxation that \n     oppresses the taxpaying minority The impulse to seek \n     something for nothing has regrettably taken root in the \n     American body politic in the past century. The requirement in \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment of a two-thirds majority of the \n     membership of both Houses of Congress to raise taxes will \n     protect a taxpaying minority against oppressive taxation.\n       As Congress continues on the path toward adopting a joint \n     resolution to recommend a Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     states for ratification, Congress should ensure that the \n     Amendment includes a requirement for approval by two-thirds \n     of the membership of the two Houses of Congress for tax \n     hikes. Absent such a requirement, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will encourage tax hikes instead of spending cuts \n     as the means to balance the budget, making the Amendment the \n     friend of the tax, spend and borrow crowd, instead of the \n     friend of those who believe in limited government, free \n     enterprise, and individual freedom.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. While a number of liberal groups committed to more \ngovernment spending have lined up against our proposal, there is hardly \na groundswell of support for the Democratic alternative. In fact, the \nlack of support for that proposal demonstrates more than anything I can \nsay that it is a proposal designed with politics in mind. It is \ndesigned to provide cover for Members who want to say they support a \nbalanced budget amendment while opposing the only amendment that would \nactually reduce government spending.\n  The bottom line is that not all balanced budget amendments are \ncreated equal. The Senate Republican amendment is one to restore \nliberty and constitutional government by reducing the size and power of \nWashington. By contrast, the Democrats' alternative promises more of \nthe same. It does nothing to rein in spending or address the fiscal \ncrisis this Nation faces. The differences between these proposals \nhighlight clearly the distinctions between conservatives in Congress \nand the President and his supporters.\n  Although I am ever hopeful, I am realistic about the chances the \nSenate will pass S.J. Res. 10 tomorrow. I suspect the vote for the \nSenate Republican amendment will be as low as any the Senate has taken \non a balanced budget amendment. This, though, shows how stark the \ndifferences have become between the two parties. The Democratic Party \nis now openly the party of tax and spend, the party of bigger and \nbigger government.\n  That is why today's debate and tomorrow's vote represents what Ronald \nReagan called ``a time for choosing.''\n  As President Obama's speech in Kansas showed the other day, he is not \nbacking away from his goal of fundamentally reordering American society \nin a way that transforms individuals and businesses into the arms of \nthe State. The President, having completely abandoned the political \nmiddle and thrown in with the far left to secure his reelection, is now \narguing that it is wrongheaded to believe one's success in life is \nowing to one's own hard work. Because the President seems to believe \nthat individual success is ultimately not the result of personal effort \nbut, instead, due to society, adherence to and respect for property \nrights, and the simple notion that one owns the fruit of one's labors \nbecomes for him and his supporters a quaint artifact of an earlier era \nin American history.\n  The candidate of hope and change has turned out to be the President \nof spreading the wealth around. To succeed, he has embraced the \npolitics of envy and class warfare that is far outside the mainstream \nof our political heritage.\n  The Republicans' balanced budget amendment offers nothing so \ngrandiose. All we seek is the restoration of some limits on the power \nof the Federal Government and meaningful reductions in spending, and we \ngive the time to get there too in our amendment. All we promote is a \ndecent respect for the right to one's own wages and the freedom \npromised in our Declaration of Independence.\n  The Senate Republican balanced budget amendment secures these \nblessings of liberty, and I urge every one of my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The opponents of this amendment will say it is somehow improper to \nconstitutionalize a requirement for a balanced budget. Hogwash. Many of \nthose same individuals do not bat an eye when five unelected Justices \non the Supreme Court rewrite the Constitution to fit their own \npreferred policy goals. Yet it is somehow inappropriate for the Senate \nto send a balanced budget amendment to the people in the States for \nratification.\n  What are they afraid of? The Constitution ultimately belongs to the \nsovereign American people. It is only law because of their sovereign \nactions of ratification and amendment.\n  It seems odd the Democratic Party that claims Thomas Jefferson as its \nfounder would oppose giving the American people a voice on this \nfoundational constitutional issue. After all, if President Obama, the \nprogressive Democrat, was so confident in the strength of his \narguments, he could rest easy knowing the people would decline to \nratify a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  So what are they so afraid of? Why are they so afraid to send this \namendment to the people for ratification? Thirteen States could defeat \nthis amendment. All they need to do is get 13 States to go against this \namendment. That is what it would take to defeat it. That is all it \nwould take. But it would be the people who would decide, not just a \nbunch of people here. If that is all the opponents of this amendment \nneed, why are they so worried about sending it to the States for \nratification? Why the lack of confidence in their powers of persuasion?\n  I can tell you why. The people of this country would ratify this \namendment so quickly its opponents' heads would spin. Those who oppose \nsending this balanced budget amendment to the States for ratification \nknow the people are eager to ratify it. That is certainly the case in \nUtah. Earlier this year, Utah passed S. Con. Res. 201 expressing \nsupport for S.J. Res. 10, the balanced budget amendment I introduced, \nalong with my friend and colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, and my \nfriend and colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, as well as 44 other \nSenators, all of whom deserve credit for this amendment.\n  I commend to my colleagues the Utah Senate's Concurrent Resolution \n201 of the 2011 Second Special Session.\n  Mr. President, I take the instruction from Utah's State \nrepresentatives very seriously. The Utah Legislature made it clear it \nsupported ratification of this amendment, and I am confident if the \nMembers of this body listen to their own State legislatures--49 of \nwhich are required to balance their own budgets--similar instructions \nwould follow.\n  Here is the bottom line. Liberal special interests oppose the Senate \nRepublicans' balanced budget amendment because they know the people \nwould ratify it. And if the people ratified it, the government-funded \ngravy train would come to an end.\n  I look forward to this debate today. It is an important one, and I am \nconfident that eventually the American people will ratify a balanced \nbudget amendment and restore the promise of America's Declaration of \nIndependence and Constitution for future generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the balanced \nbudget amendment. In fact, it is beyond me to imagine how anybody in \nthis body could oppose a balanced budget amendment. I ran my election \nlast year primarily on this fact--that government spending was out of \ncontrol and the debt was consuming our country and that we needed new \nand more serious rules to bring the budget under control.\n  We have tried in the past. This body passed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nwith bipartisan support in the 1990s and immediately began to evade it. \nThis body passed pay as you go and then proceeded to disobey their own \nrules 700 times. And we wonder why 9 percent of the people approve of \nCongress? It is because we cannot even obey our own rules.\n  So we need new rules. We need a balanced budget amendment that would \nbe an amendment to the Constitution because we do not adhere to the \nrules we pass. This body is literally out of control.\n  Now, the other side says: Trust us. Trust us. We can balance the \nbudget. The other side hasn't passed a budget this year or last year--\nnot just a balanced budget, the other side can't pass any budget. So I \nthink we need new and stronger rules to force us to do\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nwhat is right, do what every American family has to do; that is, \nbalance their family budget. A nation is no different. A nation has a \nprinting press and can run deficits for longer, but there are \nramifications.\n  The enormous debt we are accumulating as a country--we are borrowing \n$40,000 every second. During the time of my 5-minute speech, we will \nhave borrowed millions of dollars. So there are ramifications. We have \nto pay for our debt in some way. We can either tax people or we can \nborrow--we are at the limits of both--or we can simply print the money. \nBut as we print money to pay for our debt, we destroy the value of the \nexisting currency. So those who have savings, those who are on fixed \nincomes--senior citizens, the working class--those who use every penny \nof their paycheck to pay for their needs are being robbed on a daily \nbasis by inflation. Inflation is the end result of debt.\n\n  If we look at the approval of Congress being 9 percent, and we \ncontrast that with how much of the public is for a balanced budget, 75 \npercent of the public--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--would \nvote in favor of a balanced budget amendment. Yet this body is out of \ntouch because we can't get anybody from the other side even to talk to \nus about a balanced budget amendment. We worked for months to see what \nit would take to make one acceptable to the other side, and we got \nnowhere.\n  We need to balance our budget because the debt is a threat to our \ncountry. This is not just me saying this. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve has said our debt is unsustainable. Admiral Mullen, part of \nthis administration, has said our debt is the greatest threat to our \nnational security. Erskine Bowles, who led the deficit commission and \nhas been known as a Democrat, said we are approaching the most \npredictable crisis in our history, and it will be a debt crisis.\n  All throughout Europe there is a debt crisis: Italy is having trouble \npaying its debt; Greece is underwater; Portugal, Spain, and Ireland are \nall tenuously holding on and trying to pay their debts. That European \ncrisis, that destruction of the Euro, is coming this way. Our debt now \nequals our economy.\n  Senator Hatch mentioned we have a $15 trillion debt and a $15 \ntrillion economy. Many economists say when our debt approaches 100 \npercent of GDP--where ours is now--we are losing 1 million jobs a year. \nSo this is having a drain on the here and now. It is not just that this \ndebt is being passed on to our kids and grandkids. The debt is \naffecting jobs.\n  When I talk to college kids, I say: The chance of you getting a job \ndepends on what we do with the debt. If we continue to finance our \nspending through debt, you will not have a job. You will have less \nlikelihood of getting a job.\n  Now, some say it would be too hard to balance the budget. It is just \ntoo far out of whack. We can't do it. It is pretty bad. We are \nborrowing 40 cents on every dollar. If we look at the spending, \nborrowing 40 cents on every dollar is remarkable. When we look at our \nbudget, the revenue coming in is being consumed by entitlements and \ninterest. Everything else we spend--national defense, roads, everything \nelse--the rest of the 40 percent of the budget is being borrowed. It is \nout of control.\n  Can you imagine any business or any family in this country borrowing \n40 percent every year, year after year after year? It can't be done. \nThere are ramifications and a day of reckoning is coming.\n  Some say: How could we ever balance our budget? I will tell you how. \nIf we cut 1 percent of spending--this is called the penny plan--cut one \npenny out of every dollar in Federal spending for 6 years and freeze \nspending for 2 years, the budget will balance in 8 years. If we were to \npass a balanced budget amendment and send it to the States, there is a \n5-year window in the amendment, plus it takes a couple of years to \npass, so it would be about 8 years.\n  So we could balance the budget in 8 years simply by cutting one penny \nout of every dollar. One might ask: How could that be, when they are \ncutting trillions of dollars and not balancing the budget? The reason \nis, when they talk about cutting spending around here, they are always \ntalking about cutting proposed increases in spending. They are never \ntalking about real cuts in spending. What I am talking about is a real \ncut.\n  We spend $3.8 trillion in our budget this year. One percent is $28 \nbillion. Next year, we would spend $3.8 trillion minus $38 billion. A \nreal cut of 1 percent each year for 6 years balances our budget in 8 \nyears. It could happen, but it is going to take some resolve.\n  People need to understand the alternative. The alternative, if we do \nnothing, is that our debt is going to consume us as a nation. We have \nbeen warning about this for some time. Senator Hatch has been active. \nThe last time we voted on this was in 1997. Fourteen years later we \nhave had a significant revolution at the polls, and people are anxious \nto say: Do something, protect us from this mountain of debt. Yet there \nis still great resistance in this body.\n  I would say people in this body who vote against the balanced budget \namendment do so at their own peril and do it against the will of the \npeople. If they think it is so important to continue to accumulate \ndebt, and that debt is fine, they should vote against this amendment. \nBut they are thumbing their nose at the people. They are thumbing their \nnose at the American people who are very worried about our Republic and \nvery worried about this debt.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today in support of the balanced budget \namendment and encourage my colleagues to give serious thought to voting \nfor this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too rise in strong support of the \nbalanced budget amendment--the strong, meaningful, balanced budget \namendment presented on this side of the aisle because it is an \nimportant, necessary effort to rein in the biggest economic problem and \nthreat we have facing us.\n  I want to dovetail and expand on some of Senator Paul's comments, \nwith which I certainly agree.\n  First of all, I hope it is perfectly clear that our debt--our \ngrowing, unsustainable level of debt--is a clear and present danger and \nan immediate danger to our Republic, to our democracy, to our economy, \nand to our future.\n  Overspending has been a problem for quite a while in Washington. It \nhas been a problem under Republican and Democratic administrations and \nCongresses. But forever it was a problem because we were passing on \nthese big debt figures, this big burden to our kids and grandkids, and \nwe were kicking the can down the road. It was a problem for the future \nwhich we should correct now but largely a problem for the future.\n  As Senator Paul said, that is not true anymore. It is an immediate \nthreat right now. It is not a question of just our kids and grandkids; \nit is a question of next month, next year, whether we avoid a crisis, \nas is brewing in Europe, which could be the biggest hit to our economy \nsince the Great Depression, bigger than what we went through in 2008. \nSo this issue is an immediate threat, and it is not some esoteric issue \nabout balance sheets. Again, as Senator Paul said, it is an immediate \nthreat to the health of our economy, to the prospect and ability of \nAmericans, including young Americans coming out of college, to get good \njobs, to settle into good careers.\n  The second thing, which I hope is obvious, is that to get ahold of \nthis problem, to deal with this threat, Congress needs enforced \ndiscipline. We need a fiscal straitjacket because we have proven, \nunfortunately, over and over, under Democratic and Republican \nmajorities, under Democratic and Republican Presidents, that we are not \ngoing to do it on our own. We need the enforced discipline--the fiscal \nstraitjacket, if you will--of a balanced budget amendment.\n  Why do I say this? Well, even knowing the threat we face right now, \nwhat does Congress do? Congress passes a debt plan. We pass cuts. While \nthe so-called cuts of $2.1 trillion sounds like a lot of money--it is \nin some sense--it is largely cuts to the growth of government spending. \nEven under this plan that Congress recently enacted, we are still \nracking up new debt. We are still adding on $7 trillion to our already \nunsustainable level of debt in the next decade, increasing it 50 \npercent, from $15 trillion to $22 trillion. That is the best we can do \nwithout enforced discipline even in the crisis atmosphere\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nwe have now, even with the understanding we have now. I hope that \nproves we need this enforced discipline. The balanced budget amendment \nRepublicans have put forward gives us that discipline we need.\n  First of all, I wish to compliment so many who have worked with me on \nit--Senator Hatch, Senator Lee, many others. I was in the working \ngroup, and I was in several meetings to get the details right because \nthe devil is in the details. We don't need a fig leaf. We don't need a \ntalking point. We need a balanced budget constitutional amendment that \nwill work.\n  The details are right in this proposal, and it will work. Why do I \nsay this? Well, within 5 years of ratification, under the amendment, \nCongress must pass a budget, the President must submit a proposal that \nis balanced, but not only that, the size of the Federal Government is \nlimited to 18 percent of GDP. That is the long-term historical average \nof revenues in modern history. That is where we need to be. That is not \nmy decision; that is not the decision of a single Member of Congress; \nthat is the average of where revenues have been in the modern period.\n  It requires a strong supermajority to ensure that we don't continue \nthe practice of exceeding spending caps with gimmicks and emergency \nspending for things that are not truly emergencies. For instance, a \ntwo-thirds vote of both Houses is required for a specific deficit for a \nfiscal year. A majority vote is required for a specific deficit when we \nhave a declared war, and it needs to be a declared war in that \ninstance. A three-fifths vote is required for a deficit during a \nmilitary conflict and--this is important--with the requirement \nspecifically that that is ``necessary by the identified conflict.'' In \nother words, the overage from a balanced budget is only for that \nconflict, not just a general exemption. A two-thirds vote of each House \nis required to increase taxes, and that is important so that this is \nnot just a mechanism for ever-increasing tax rates that will quickly \nstagnate the economy. A three-fifths vote of each House is required to \nincrease the debt limit, which is also important.\n  The details are important. I am confident we have gotten the details \nright in this proposal.\n  We also have a Udall proposal, a Democratic balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. Unfortunately, I think that gets the details \nvery wrong. I am pleased that Senator Udall and Democratic colleagues \non the other side are committed to the notion of a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. That is important, and that is progress. But \nthe devil is in the details, and I am afraid they got some of those \ndetails very, very wrong. For instance, there is a huge loophole \nexemption for whenever the country is in a military conflict--not just \na formally declared war but any military conflict. Unfortunately, we \nare going to be in that situation for a lifetime under the present war \nagainst terror, so that is a huge, gaping loophole. Under that \nloophole, the amount beyond a balanced budget which is allowed isn't \nspecific to that conflict, it is just a general exemption. So it is a \nbig loophole.\n  There are other loopholes too. Social Security is completely exempt \nfrom this structure. I think that is a big mistake because that is part \nof our budget situation and because we need this very enforced \ndiscipline to fix and to save Social Security. That is one of the top \nitems I want to fix and save. That is one of the first places we need \nthis enforced discipline to fix and save Social Security.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to come together behind this important \nand necessary enforcement tool. The American people recognize the \nproblem. They recognize this--a strong, meaningful balanced budget \namendment--as an important part of the solution. They want us to act in \na positive way, and I urge that support for this balanced budget \namendment and for that solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I wish to thank my colleague from Louisiana, who has made \ngreat points about where we are.\n  I do think it is good news that we are talking about balancing the \nbudget, but unfortunately, as we often do, this is really a political \nshow more than a real attempt to actually balance the budget. The whole \nprocess is set up to fail.\n  We know the President has said that we don't need to balance our \nbudget and that it is an extreme idea. The majority leader here in the \nSenate has called a bill that cuts spending and caps spending and sends \na balanced budget amendment to the States to ratify the worst \nlegislation he has ever seen. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in \nthe House, has said that to balance the budget would cost jobs and that \nwe would do it on the backs of the poor. Now we are to believe that our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side here are serious about working with \nus to balance the budget.\n  The situation is too serious to just play politics, and I know from \ntalking to a number of my Democratic colleagues that they feel the same \nway, that they know we need to balance the budget. It is very difficult \nfor them as a party because a lot of their platform is based on more \npromises for government and more government spending.\n  In effect, a balanced budget amendment that meant we couldn't spend \nmore than we were bringing in would change politics in Washington \nforever, which is something we have to do. But at least we are \ndiscussing the idea of balancing the budget.\n  We know that the President's budget, the only budget we have seen--we \nhaven't seen one out of the Senate in the last several years--increased \nour debt another $10 trillion over the next 10 years. It didn't balance \nit.\n  Just about every Republican voted for a budget, a 10-year budget \noffered by Senator Pat Toomey that balanced in 10 years without cutting \nSocial Security or Medicare. So we can do it. We can do it without \nhurting Americans. If we do it now, we can actually control our own \ndestiny rather than what we see across the Atlantic in Greece and other \nEuropean countries. They lost control of their destiny. They are now in \nthe control of other countries and of fate. But America is still in a \nposition that, if we make the decisions now to begin the process to \nbalance our budget, even if it took 10 years, we could save our country \nand perhaps save freedom for the world. But there is no question that \nif we continue on the same course we are on today, we will bankrupt our \nNation, lose control of our destiny, and change the world forever. But \nat least we are talking about balancing the budget, and maybe that is a \ngood first step.\n  Today, the Democrats have offered a weak alternative to the \nRepublican balanced budget so that they can say they are for it. Again, \nI think that is important to get on record, that we are at least for \nthe idea of stopping spending more than we are bringing in. For the \npast 2\\1/2\\ years, as I mentioned, the Senate Democrats, who are in \ncharge here, haven't even produced a budget, let alone the idea of \nbalancing one. President Obama, as I said, proposed a budget that \ndoubled the national debt in the next 10 years. That is not responsible \nleadership at a time when we are already at an unsustainable debt \nlevel.\n  Despite all the bipartisan promises to cut spending, Washington is \nstill voting to make government bigger and more expensive than ever. \nAnd this includes some Republicans joining the fray here to just \nincrease spending. Federal spending went up 5 percent in the first 9 \nmonths of the year despite all the hoopla about us doing something \nabout spending.\n  There is one way to judge whether we are cutting spending or not, \ndespite all the rhetoric here and the Washington-speak. If we want to \nknow whether we are spending more, we just have to ask ourselves: Are \nwe spending more than we did last year? The answer is yes. And we are \ngoing to spend more next year than we did this year, based on the bills \nwe are passing this week and next. So this isn't austerity. It is \ngluttony. It is political gluttony.\n  Since Obama became President, the debt limit has been raised four \ntimes. The debt is rising faster and higher than ever. Yet the Senate \nrefuses to pass a budget or cut spending. We must budget and balance \nthe budget or we are going to bring down our whole country.\n  Republicans have offered a strong balanced budget amendment that \nlimits government spending to 18 percent of gross domestic product--\nGDP--and\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nrequires a two-thirds majority to raise taxes, and it has earned the \nsupport of every Republican in the Senate. That is pretty unusual for \nus. Passage of that amendment should have been tied to the last \nincrease in the debt limit, but it wasn't. President Obama was given \nanother $2 trillion to borrow, and Americans received nothing in \nreturn, no cuts in spending.\n  The Democratic amendment differs in three ways from the Republican \namendment.\n  What Republicans are trying to do is to reduce the level of spending \nrelative to our total economy and to make sure it is difficult to raise \ntaxes to balance the budget. And we should all agree on that. We \nshouldn't go back to the taxpayer every time we spend too much. The \nemphasis should be on reducing our spending. But the Democratic \namendment doesn't cap spending to the historical levels, which means we \ncan balance the budget by raising taxes and continuing to increase \nspending. So our amendment is designed to cap that spending at a \ncertain level.\n  Secondly, the Democratic balanced budget amendment does not require a \nsupermajority to raise taxes. So during regular order here, we can \nincrease taxes to meet the requirement to balance the budget. It would \nbe a nice safeguard for the American taxpayer that we would at least \nhave to get a supermajority to raise taxes in order to balance the \nbudget.\n  For some reason, the Democratic balanced budget amendment inserts \njust an element of class warfare, saying that we cannot decrease taxes \non those making over $1 million. It doesn't sound like something we \nwould do anyway, but it is not something that should be part of a \nconstitutional amendment that we send to the States to ratify.\n  The strong Republican balanced budget amendment would force both \nparties to find ways to cut spending and reform entitlements. Those are \nthe things we have to do. The weaker Democratic version does not do \nthat because it preserves the status quo where it is easier to raise \ntaxes than cut spending, which is where we are today.\n  For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, Senate Democrats have not produced a \nbudget, let alone a balanced one. President Obama proposed a budget \nthis year that doubled the national debt. Again, that is not a budget; \nthat is a loan application and this country cannot continue to operate \nbased on more borrowed money and more spending and more threats of \nraising taxes.\n  If we want to get the economy going and balance our budget, we have \nto cut spending. That is the whole idea of the Republican balanced \nbudget amendment. Let's get serious about saving our country and the \nfreedoms for which so many have fought. If we do not do it soon, we \nwill lose control of our destiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to join many of my \ncolleagues, as Senator DeMint has said, to endorse the balanced budget \namendment that Republicans are offering. We have 47 Republicans in the \nSenate and there are 47 cosponsors and supporters of this approach to a \nbalanced budget. Our approach addresses the fundamental problem in \nAmerica and that is government spending. Big problems require bold \naction. Today's staggering national debt, $15 trillion, is crippling \nour economy. We must take action to stop it.\n  The 40-year average of total U.S. Federal Government spending is 20.8 \npercent of gross domestic product. For 2011, Federal spending was 24.1 \npercent of GDP. Looking forward, if we stay on the same course we are \non, Federal spending is projected to be 40 percent of GDP in 2046, and \nby 2085 it will reach 75 percent of GDP. We are reading a lot of \nstories about European countries that are doing exactly what we are \ntalking about how the future for America will look like if we do not \ncurb spending right now.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think increasing \ntaxes will reduce the deficit. However, the facts state otherwise. The \ntrajectory of government spending, as I have outlined, could not be met \nwith tax increases. There are not enough tax increases if you went to \n100 percent rate of tax. There would not be enough to support that kind \nof government spending.\n  In addition to that, as we have been saying, increasing taxes is \ngoing to lower the capability of our small businesses to hire. That is \nwhat we are trying to spur right now, more employment. It is going to \ntake systemic changes in government spending to get the debt and \ndeficits down in this country. Lower spending is the only way we can \nhave the systemic changes that are necessary to lower the government \nburden so the debt begins to get less and less.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have proposed their solution with a \ndifferent approach to a balanced budget amendment. In our opinion, it \nis flawed because it fails to include a supermajority requirement to \nraise taxes and it separates Social Security from the Federal budget. \nThat might seem like a good idea on its face, to assure that Social \nSecurity never goes under because there would not be a connection \nbetween Social Security and the Federal budget, but in fact as we speak \ntoday it is part of our Federal budget because the Social Security \noutlays exceed what is coming in revenue from Social Security. \nExcluding Social Security from our Federal budget would not solve our \ndeficit spending or shore up Social Security's finances for current and \nfuture generations. Right now, Social Security is on a glidepath toward \ninsolvency.\n  I firmly believe that entitlement reform is vital to any long-term \nsolution to our Nation's financial problems. It is essential that we \nassure the markets that long-term financial challenges are being \nconfronted, and that includes entitlement reform so that Social \nSecurity will be on a glidepath toward solvency rather than the other \nway around.\n  Earlier this year I proposed a modest Social Security reform that \nwould gradually increase the retirement age so it more closely \nresembles today's actuarial tables and life expectancy. It would \ndecrease the annual cost of living slightly by adjusting it if \ninflation exceeds 1 percent. If inflation exceeds 1 percent, then you \nwould have a cost-of-living adjustment. Otherwise, you would not.\n  In addition to spending reduction and entitlement reform, we need \nlong-term progrowth tax policies in place, not constant threats of tax \nincreases. When we hear our small business people talking about why \nthey are not hiring--because I think probably every one of us in this \nSenate as we travel around our States and in the country asks our small \nbusiness people why aren't you hiring? Why aren't you adding to our \neconomy?--they say two things. They say, No. 1, the regulations of this \ncountry are driving them down. It is like a blanket over their \ncapability to produce, get more traction and hire people. So it is \noverregulation that we are seeing rampant in this administration.\n  The second thing is our President is always talking about tax \nincreases. He talks about it every time I see an interview or a speech. \nThose people out there need to pay more taxes. You know what, if you \nare being constantly threatened with more taxes, you know you have to \nlook at your budget and adjust, and that adjustment usually means you \nare not going to hire people if you know your expenses are going to go \nup through regulations and more taxes.\n  If we are going to make conditions in this country better for private \nsector job growth in this country, which certainly would lead to a \nstronger economy, we have to address spending and tax policy. Our \nbalanced budget amendment moves forward on these fronts. We reduce \nspending responsibly, to put our country on a fiscally responsible \npath. We can shift the spending trajectory in this country by passing \nthe balanced budget amendment and implementing a long-term plan that \ncaps Federal spending. The Federal Government has grown exponentially \nin the last few years. We cannot sustain that. That is not a \nresponsible position when we know unemployment is almost 9 percent. We \nhave to have policies that will encourage employment. That is the way \nto grow revenue.\n  We can grow revenue, but not by taxing the people who are hiring. \nRather, we can do it by giving them a regulatory playing field that is \nresponsible\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nand not overbearing, and by making sure we have not only a tax policy \nthat encourages hiring but one that is stable and predictable.\n  If taxes are going to change every year, that is not predictable and \nit is not stable. I hate it when I talk to an international company and \nI am talking to someone in that company--maybe the CEO, or chief \nfinancial officer--and I say, why are you moving that part of your \ncompany overseas? They will invariably say: Because there is a better \nregulatory environment.\n  That is shocking. It is shocking for an American CEO to say we can \nbetter predict what the conditions for regulations are in foreign \ncountries than we can in America. That is not the foundation to revive \nour economy.\n  We have a balanced budget amendment that we believe addresses the \nissues of this economy. It will put caps on Federal spending. It will \nstart bringing down the size of government to meet the gross domestic \nproduct of our country. Right now it is off balance and we need to put \nit right so we do start hiring in this country in the private sector. \nHiring in the government sector is not a long-term growth strategy. We \nneed jobs in the private sector for permanency and we will do that with \na balanced budget amendment that puts caps on spending. Systemic change \nis what is necessary in this kind of environment. I hope Members on \nboth sides of the aisle will look at these amendments and realize we \ncould help the jitters in the market get calmed by addressing this in a \nlong-term way.\n\n  The balanced budget amendment we are offering--and we will vote on \ntomorrow--is the best approach. It is looked at by people in the real \nworld, the business world, the hiring world. They are saying what they \nneed is stable regulatory environment and taxes that are not \nconfiscatory so they will have the ability to hire more Americans and \ncreate greater revenues through people who are working and producing--\npeople who are going to pay taxes, people who are going to export and \nkeep our economy on a growth pattern rather than one that continues to \nsit there with a high unemployment rate that is stagnating our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to join with the Senator \nfrom Texas and agree with her about the need for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution and agree with her comments about the \neconomy in this country and our need to focus on jobs and debt and the \nspending. I agree with her and I agree with the majority of the \nAmerican people. That is why I am here today to talk about the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  We are at a time in the calendar year where the holidays are rapidly \napproaching. Americans across the country are looking very closely at \ntheir budget. That is what families do, they look at their budget and \nthey consider what costs are out there and what money is available to \ndeal with those costs. They are looking at gifts and travel and holiday \ncelebrations. They are carefully balancing their regular monthly \nexpenses with these additional special costs in order to avoid starting \nthe new year with a mountain of new debt. Americans understand there \nare consequences for irresponsible spending. Folks know if they make \ndecisions which they later decide were not the best decisions, then by \nNew Year's Day bills will come due and they will have real concerns.\n  Formulating a responsible budget is not always easy, but it is \nabsolutely necessary. It is the right, the reasonable, and the \nresponsible approach. The problem is, unlike the rest of this country, \nWashington does not seem to be concerned about responsible budgeting. \nIn fact, Washington does not seem to be concerned about any kind of \nbudgeting. In Washington, the President is responsible for submitting a \nbudget every year. Congress is then responsible for passing a budget \nevery year. It has not happened this year; it did not happen last year. \nThe House of Representatives did their job when they passed Paul Ryan's \nbudget, but this body, the Senate, did nothing. In fact, this Senate \nhas not passed a budget in over 950 days.\n  What has happened in the last 950 days? Well, in 2010, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff said: ``The single biggest threat to our \nnational security is our debt . . . '' The single biggest threat to our \nnational security is our debt. Washington did nothing.\n  A year ago this month, the President's bipartisan commission made \nrecommendations to rein in the debt. The recommendations have been \nlargely ignored. More recently, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction failed to present a plan to cut $1.2 trillion from the \ndeficit as required by the legislation. Our national debt is now over \n$15 trillion. Our credit rating has been lowered for the first time in \nthe history of this great Nation. So here we are, $15 trillion in debt \nand no real plan to get out of it. The American people deserve better. \nThey expect better.\n  Back home in Wyoming folks understand the importance of balancing \nbudgets and living within their means. What they don't understand is \nwhy Washington doesn't get it. A constituent from my hometown of \nCasper--Mike Brewster is his name--wrote to me earlier this year. Folks \nin Wyoming like Mike get it. Mike wrote:\n\n       One of the values that makes our state and our communities \n     so strong is being financially solvent. We do not spend more \n     than we make. If we max out our credit cards, we don't ask \n     for higher credit limits, we cut our spending. To do anything \n     else would label one a fool.\n\n  Referring to the national debt, he went on in his letter and said:\n\n       Let's be clear; this is a crisis. This crisis wasn't caused \n     by a lack of revenue; it was caused by spending way beyond \n     our means. The only logical solution is to reduce spending--\n     that is the ``Wyoming Way.'' That is what your constituents \n     would have to do if they had the same mess in their personal \n     finances, and that is what you must do to properly represent \n     us.\n\n  Mike is absolutely right, this is a crisis. It is a crisis that could \nhave been prevented and a crisis where we need to solve it by doing the \nright thing. If we are going to balance Uncle Sam's checkbook, we need \nto stop charging everything under the Sun to the taxpayers' credit \ncard. That means we need to stop spending more than we take in, and in \norder to achieve this, I believe that now, more than ever, we need a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Amending the Constitution is not something I take lightly. This is \nthe single most important document in our Nation's history, and I am \nvery hesitant to suggest amending it. However, Washington's \nunwillingness and inability to be responsible stewards of taxpayers' \ndollars has left us no choice. We need to begin the long road to \nfinancial recovery by balancing each and every budget. We do it in \nWyoming, and Washington should follow suit.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a new idea. In fact, a bill that \nwould have sent a balanced budget amendment to the States for \nratification failed by one vote in 1997 right here in the Senate. Over \nthe years many Democrats who serve in the Senate today have voiced \ntheir support for a balanced budget amendment.\n  Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said:\n\n       Before I ask for your vote, I owe it to you to tell you \n     where I stand. I'm for . . . a balanced budget amendment.\n\n  That was what he said in 2006.\n  Debbie Stabenow had another similar quote in 2000: ``I crossed the \nline to help balance the budget, as one of the Democrats that broke \nwith my party.''\n  Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said back in 1997 when they \nwere voting on a balanced budget amendment: ``I believe we should have \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am willing to go \nfor that.''\n  Senator Tom Harkin said: ``Mr. President, I have long supported a \nbalanced budget amendment. I expect to do so again . . . ''\n  We could go on and on with Democrats who in the past stood up to \nsupport a balanced budget amendment.\n  It seems to me if folks on the other side of the aisle are serious \nabout balancing the budget, they will support the only balanced budget \nresolution with teeth. The Republican plan imposes real spending \ndiscipline that cannot be undermined by simply raising taxes on hard-\nworking Americans. If we are going to amend the Constitution, we need \nto make sure the balanced budget requirement cannot be easily \nsidestepped by either party. The Republican plan does just that.\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\n  Our creditors will not wait for a politically convenient time to \ncollect our debts. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer to reduce \nthose debts. Irresponsible, unsustainable spending and debt has \nconsequences, consequences we simply cannot afford to pay.\n  If you don't believe me, look at Europe. Everyone in this body needs \nto take a long, hard look at Europe and then decide what future they \nwant for our great Nation. This is not about doing what is right for \nDemocrats or Republicans; it is about doing what is right for all \nAmericans and for this entire country.\n  As Art Middlestadt from Cheyenne, WY, said in a recent e-mail: \nAllowing our children to suffer the consequences of Washington's \nreckless budgeting is unconscionable. Well, this is about showing Art \nand the rest of America that we hear them and we understand them. \nFamilies know this, individuals know this, and the sooner Washington \nknows this, the better.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of balancing the Federal \nbudget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, one of the things about a debate such as \nthis is that I have something I always do, and that is I will sit down \nand cross off things I was going to say that somebody else has already \nsaid. Unfortunately, almost everything has been said, but there are a \nfew things that have not. I wish to put this in a more of a historic \nperspective.\n  I can remember back in 1968. In 1968 I was elected to the Oklahoma \nState Senate, and at that time we were all concerned about the deficit \nspending and the debt in this country. I remember so well a kind old \ngentleman from Nebraska. He was U.S. Senator Carl Curtis. Carl Curtis \ncontacted me--because I was kind of an aggressive person at that time--\nand said, I have an idea. I have been up here trying to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution and I have been trying for years \nto do it. One of the primary objections they have is they could never \nget the majority, the three-fourths necessary to ratify the \nConstitutional Amendment. He said, this is my idea: Let's go ahead and \nget three-fourths of the States to preratify a budget-balancing \namendment to the Constitution. I thought that was an ingenious idea, \nand so we did.\n  I passed a resolution in the Oklahoma State Senate in 1968 that said \nwe were going to preratify it. In fact, we came within one State of \nhaving the three-fourths necessary to do that; not that that would have \npreratified it, but it would have taken away the argument that Carl \nCurtis had that they objected to in that they would never be able to \nratify this in the States. I thought that was a great idea. We came \nclose to doing it way back in 1968. I remember this very well. I was \ntrying to impress upon the American people how much that debt was, and \nat that time the debt was $240 billion. I said, if you take dollar \nbills and stack them up, by the time you get to $240 billion, it is the \nheight of the Empire State Building. That was only $240 billion.\n\n  A lot of the groups and Members who are opposed to passing the \nbalanced budget amendment think we don't need one. They actually \nbelieve Congress and the President can balance the budget without any \nenforceable accountability. But in 1986 when the amendment failed by \none vote--and I remember that year so well because that was the year I \nwas elected to the House of Representatives here in Washington--the \nnational debt at that time was $2.1 trillion. By 1997, when the Senate \nconsidered the amendment again, the debt had risen to over $5 trillion, \nand it got up to about $10 trillion when this President took office, \nand that is where this all starts.\n  What has happened since President Obama has been in office is \nsomething that is totally unprecedented in the history of this country. \nIn the years he has been there, it has gone up 42 percent. I was \nconcerned back in 1968 with $248 billion, and now the increase in this \nshort period of time has gone from $10 trillion to $15 trillion.\n  I think everyone knows the need to reduce spending is evident. We \ndon't have to do anything more than look across the Atlantic. I think \nmy friend from Wyoming covered that pretty well. When you stop and \nthink what has happened to these countries over in Europe--and it is \nnot just Greece and Italy; there are other countries too. They could \nnot resist their insatiable appetite to spend money they did not have. \nWhat has happened there is happening in this country. I agree with my \nfriend from Wyoming, we are right behind Europe in this case.\n  I remember, and probably everyone in this Chamber remembers, during \nyour elementary years reading about the history of this country. A guy \nnamed Alexis de Tocqueville came to the United States. He came here, \noddly enough, to study our penal system. That was back in the founding \nyears of this country. When he got here, he was so impressed with the \nwealth of our Nation that he stayed and wrote a book. In this book he \ntalked about how one plot of land was given to each person who came \nover and they were able to keep the benefits of their hard labor, and \nthe prosperity was indescribable at that time. It is said in the last \nparagraph of the de Tocqueville book that once the people of this \ncountry find they can vote themselves money out of the public trust, \nthe system will fail. That is why I say this is not an ordinary time. \nThis is not 1968, 1986, 1997, where we tried this before. This is to \nthe point where we will realize the accuracy of de Tocqueville's \nprediction.\n  It has been publicized recently that 47 percent of the people are not \npaying Federal taxes and not paying income taxes. That is dangerously \nclose to that 50 percent he was talking about several hundred years \nago. So this year Washington has been patting itself on the back with \nthe Budget Control Act we passed in August which cut spending by $900 \nbillion over the next 10 years. We are slowly starting to chip away at \nappropriations bills. These have not been as advertised. They have not \ncome close to solving the problem. This is demonstrated by the fact \nthat next year's deficit is still expected to be right around $1 \ntrillion. I know this is kind of offensive to some of the people who \nparticipated in this great committee that was charged with the great \nresponsibility of finding $1 trillion over 10 years.\n  When I talked to a large chamber group in Oklahoma on Monday \nmorning--we had over 500 people there--I said: Can you understand what \nis happening here in terms of the request that has been made of coming \nup with $1 trillion over 10 years?\n  As the Senator from Wyoming said, the President submits a budget. It \nis not the Democrats, not the Republicans, not the House, not the \nSenate. It is the President. He has now submitted three budgets. In his \nthree budgets he has had deficits each year of almost $1.5 trillion.\n  I remember in 1997 going down to the floor when Bill Clinton was \nPresident of the United States, and that was the first $1.5 trillion \nbudget to run the country. That was $1.5 trillion to run the entire \nUnited States of America. Yet this President has come up $1.5 trillion \nin deficit over and above the revenues we had each year for 3 years.\n  If you have the requirement of coming up with $1 trillion over 10 \nyears and yet this President has increased the deficit by almost $5 \ntrillion in the short period of time--it probably will be $6 trillion \nby the time the last budget is realized--then how in the world are you \never going to dig out of this? Well, the answer is you cannot.\n  Further, when I was talking to the people in Oklahoma on Monday, and \nI said, the requirement for the first year was $44 billion--if you take \n$44 billion as a requirement to cut spending in the first of 10 years \nand yet the President has had an increase of $1.5 trillion in his \nbudget for 1 year, obviously that is not much of a requirement.\n  Obviously, that is not much of a requirement. That is not going to \ndo. So to me that demonstrates what we are not able to do without \nhaving a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The amendment \nwe have makes it difficult to raise taxes. It also requires that the \nPresident and Congress pass a balanced budget each year. It does \nsomething else that is very significant. The amendment would also limit \nthe amount of spending allowed to 18 percent of GDP, which is the \nhistoric level of revenue the Federal Government has collected since \nWorld War II.\n  So it covers these things. People complain about it, saying: Well, we \ndo\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nnot know. There could be times of crisis. There could be times of war.\n  This has it built in. If we are in a declared war, you do not have to \nfollow the guidelines in the balanced budget amendment. In fact, you \ncould actually violate it because that is in times of war. We \nunderstand that. If it is not a declared war, you can do it with a \nsupermajority. So this has those built in safeguards to take care of \ncontingencies that we cannot determine what they are right now, such as \nwar, such as a crisis we have.\n  Now, some of those people--not too many people will come to the floor \nand say this, but in their own minds they still believe this idea that \nmore government spending can actually make the economy grow. And I do \nnot know how they can still believe that after what they call the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It was $825 billion. That was \nsupposed to be a stimulus package. That was supposed to stimulate the \neconomy. Yet only 3 percent of that actually went to things that \nspecifically would stimulate the economy, such as roads, bridges, and \nthings we were supposed to do. It was all financed with extra \ngovernment debt and with projects such as Solyndra, which has gotten a \nlot of attention recently, and other projects. It was more social \nengineering. We all know that. So we know you cannot increase spending \nto pull us out of the situation we are in. They also said that would \ncause the unemployment rate to get down to well below 8 percent. Of \ncourse, we know now that it did not do that. So none of the projections \nactually came to be realized. The economy is still very weak despite \nthe fact that the President was able to secure nearly $1 trillion in \nstimulus spending. It did not help this time. It is not going to help \nagain. It never helped in the past.\n  To enforce the amendment, the courts would be prevented from \nmandating tax hikes. Further, to raise the debt limit, a three-fifths \nmajority of both Chambers--both, not just one--would be required.\n  So it does take care of all of these contingencies that I think would \nbe necessary and answers the complaints that people have who say it \nwould be dangerous to have a balanced budget amendment.\n  I know it works. The funny thing about it, when they say it will not \nwork, look at the laboratories we have for the Federal Government. My \nState of Oklahoma, balanced budget amendment. It has all of these \nthings built into it. In fact, it is not as generous as the one we are \nadvocating. But nonetheless, I remember my years in the State \nlegislature. We would get up toward the end of the year, and they would \nsay: Well, wait a minute, we can't do that because we can't go into a \ndeficit. If the States can't do it, we can pass the same thing.\n  So I would merely say, try to put it in the historic perspective. If \nyou do that, then you will see why it is a sense of urgency that 47 \npercent of the people are on the receiving end of government. It would \nturn around and get to that point where, as Tocqueville said, we cannot \ngo beyond.\n  Remember in 1968 the Carl Curtis thing. That was a $240 billion \ndeficit; 1986, $2.1 trillion; in 1990, it was up to $10 trillion. It \ntook all of that time to get up to $10 trillion. That has almost \ndoubled with this one administration, with this President. So this is \nnot business as usual. This is not like the balanced budget amendments \nhave been in the past. They are structured very much the same way, but \nthe sense of crisis is here.\n  I have 20 kids and grandkids. What we do here is not going to affect \nme personally, but it is going to affect future generations. This is an \nopportunity to really do something meaningful.\n  I urge the support of S.J. Res. 10, a strong balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing my clear and unequivocal support for a balanced budget \namendment to our Constitution, Senate Resolution 10.\n  With our out-of-control and unsustainable debt threatening nothing \nless than the American dream and the opportunities that will be \navailable for our children and our grandchildren, we need to pass a \nmeaningful balanced budget amendment, and this, in my view, can be one \nof the single most important steps we can take to get America's fiscal \nhouse in order and to save our country from looming insolvency.\n  Madam President, 49 States in this country have some requirement to \nbalance their budget. The Federal Government should be no different. My \nhome State of New Hampshire has a legal requirement to balance its \nbudget and has long followed this commonsense tradition of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  This is a subject I have discussed extensively with my constituents \nover the last year while I have done townhall meetings throughout our \nState focusing on our Nation's debt crisis. I have done a PowerPoint \npresentation to show my constituents the hard numbers on the fiscal \nstate of this country. And it is deeply troubling where we are today: 3 \nstraight years of $1 trillion-plus deficits, over $15 trillion dollars \nin debt, Medicare and Social Security on a path to insolvency as early \nas 2024 and 2036, respectively, and nearly half of our debt--47 \npercent--currently is being held by foreign entities, and the single \nbiggest foreign holder of our debt is China.\n\n  I also talk about spending and deficits in terms of how it relates to \nyour average New Hampshire family. In New Hampshire, if you use \nWashington's budgeting logic where we are borrowing 40 cents of every \nsingle dollar--in 2008, the New Hampshire median household income was \n$66,000. If you used Washington logic, the amount that family would \nspend would be $107,000 or $41,000 more than they earned. That would \nnever fly in New Hampshire where families sit around their kitchen \ntables and they use their common sense to balance their budget. Yet in \nWashington we continue to perpetuate this borrowing to sustain our \ngovernment every day.\n  If you look at where we are, one of the most troubling statistics \nthat really impacts our economic growth is the share of our gross debt \nto the size of our economy or our GDP. That is now 100 percent. Just 5 \nyears ago, that ratio was closer to 60 percent.\n  As many of us in this Chamber are aware, economists Carmen Reinhart \nand Ken Rogoff have concluded in a study that over the past century, \nfor nations that reach where we are, where total debt reaches over 90 \npercent of the size of our economy, there is a negative impact on \neconomic growth. And we can expect lower job growth and fewer economic \nopportunities. We certainly cannot afford that in this troubling time \nfor Americans.\n  So not only do we need to get our fiscal house in order because it is \nthe right thing to do so we are not dependent on other countries such \nas China to fund our government, we also need to do it so we can \nprovide opportunities for future generations of Americans.\n  New Hampshire citizens understand we cannot keep spending money we do \nnot have. They make those commonsense decisions on their own family \nbudgets. Small business owners in New Hampshire are astounded when I \ntell them our Federal Government is operating without a budget. They \nwould never run their businesses without a budget. But they do not \nunderstand why Congress cannot even perform such a basic function of \npassing a budget blueprint.\n  It has now been 958 days since the Senate last passed a budget. I \nhave to say that I was really honored and excited to be the newest \nappointment to the Senate Budget Committee. However, I have been \nincredibly, incredibly disappointed that we have not in that committee \ndone the hard work that needs to be done, the thing that is right for \nthis country--to sit down, to make the hard choices, to put together a \nbudget blueprint and to pass a Senate budget, to have the robust debate \non the Senate floor about how we prioritize our spending and how we \nlive within our means. The American people deserve better. They deserve \nus to do our job and to pass a budget for our country that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\n  In that time, in those 958 days that the Senate has not passed a \nbudget, the Nation's debt has increased by $3.9 trillion. When you \nthink about it, it is deeply troubling. I am hopeful that if we bring \nforward and pass the requirement of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, it will also force Congress to do the basic function of \nputting together a responsible and balanced budget for our country.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of passing this budget control \nmeasure, the balanced budget amendment, Senate Resolution 10. I think \nit is important for my constituents and the American people to know, if \nwe pass the balanced budget amendment in this body, in the Congress, \nthis is putting the question to you, to the American people, to decide, \ndo you want the Federal Government to balance its budget?\n  So when we pass an amendment to the Constitution, we are simply \nsending along to the States the decision of should we amend our \nConstitution. I cannot think of anything more important than sending \nthat question to the American people, to our State legislatures, to \ndecide should we live within our means; should we be bound by the same \nrequirements the States have, by the same common sense we find at home \nto balance our budgets and live within our means.\n  Madam President, for fiscal year 2011 we spent 24.1 percent of our \nGDP. That is well above the historical spending average of a little \nover 18 percent, if we go back to 1960 where the revenue we had has \ncome in. So we are at a huge trajectory of spending at 24.1 percent. \nYet in 2011 our revenues only accounted for 15.4 percent of our economy \nbecause of the difficult times we are in relative to our economic \ngrowth.\n  Under the Republican proposed balanced budget amendment, we put the \nhandcuffs in place that are needed to put us on a path to eliminate \nthis by capping Federal spending at the historical level of revenue at \n18 percent. Why is this important? It is important because we can't \ncontinue to spend well beyond our means. We have to acknowledge that a \nmeaningful balanced budget amendment will also cap Federal spending at \nits historical levels.\n  It is not difficult to see what will happen if we don't get control \nof our fiscal situation right now. Budget shortfalls will only get much \nworse, driven by massive increases in entitlement spending and interest \npayments, and the reality is the failure to act will result in America \ngoing the way of what we see happening in Europe right now, the way of \nGreece, Italy, and Ireland: our economy in tatters and our standard of \nliving greatly diminished.\n  We cannot let that happen to our country. We must act now. We must \npass this balanced budget amendment in the Senate and send that \nquestion to the House and also send that question to the States so the \npeople of this country can decide if we should be responsible and have \nto balance our budget. Left unchanged, Medicare, Social Security, \nMedicaid, and other mandatory health programs alone will eventually \ngrow to consume every single dollar of the revenues our government \ntakes in.\n  Without reform, the Social Security trustees project the program will \nbe insolvent by 2036. As a result, beneficiaries may see a benefit cut \nof 23 percent in just 25 years. The Medicare trustees project it is \neven more immediate and dire. The Medicare trustees project Medicare \nwill be insolvent by the year 2024.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. We need to show the political will \nand courage to reform these programs, make them sustainable, and to \nreform them and preserve them for those like my grandparents, who are \nrelying on them, and for future generations to know that these programs \nwill be there. But if we fail to take this challenge on now and \ncontinue to kick the can down the road, then these programs will be \ngreatly diminished, and they will continue on an unsustainable path \nthat is bankrupting our country.\n  In this debate, it is important to remember that in 1997 the balanced \nbudget amendment failed to pass this body by only one vote. At that \ntime, our national debt stood at $5.4 trillion. We now have a $15 \ntrillion debt. That debt equates to about $128,000 per household. That \nis a huge amount of money to an average household. Under the Budget \nControl Act, which I opposed last August, the debt will be allowed to \nreach a new limit of $16.4 trillion, left unchecked.\n  Congress has raised the debt limit 79 times since 1960, and in just 4 \nshort months since the debt limit was last increased, over $700 billion \nhas been added to our debt, since we took that action in August.\n  Speaking of the debt limit, the Republican-backed balanced budget \namendment will require a congressional supermajority to raise the debt \nceiling. That means three-fifths of both Chambers will have to approve \nunless it is a time of war. That would require a majority in a time of \nwar. That is a very important measure because we can't continue to \nincrease the debt limit without addressing the underlying drivers of \nthis fiscal crisis that faces our country.\n  I also want to briefly touch on taxes. The Republican version of the \nbalanced budget amendment, S. Res. 10, would require a supermajority to \nraise tax rates. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. \nUnder S. Res. 10, a two-thirds approval of both Houses of Congress \nwould be required for any bill ``that imposes a new tax or increases \nthe statutory rate of any tax or the aggregate amount of revenue.''\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are proposing an \nalternative--S. Res. 24--to the balanced budget amendment that I have \njust described. While this proposal sounds good, it fails to squarely \naddress the magnitude of the challenges we face. It doesn't apply to \nall spending. It also doesn't contain a cap on spending. It does \nnothing to strengthen our entitlement programs, and it does nothing to \nmake it harder to raise taxes. It does nothing to make it more \ndifficult to raise the debt ceiling. In my view, it is insufficient to \nbe meaningful to pass along to the States for a vote.\n  The Republican alternative contains the elements that I just talked \nabout--a balanced budget, spending caps, a supermajority to raise \ntaxes, and making it more difficult to raise the debt ceiling, unless \nand until we address the underlying causes of our fiscal crisis.\n  This issue is deeply personal for me. I fundamentally believe all of \nus have a duty to make this country stronger than we found it. As the \nmother of two young children, Katherine, now 7, and Jacob, 4 years old, \nwho are both very excited for Christmas, I want the American dream to \nburn as brightly for them as it has for me. It is not too late for our \ncountry or for this body to make the tough decisions that will put our \ncountry on a fiscally responsible path.\n  I feel a solemn duty to make sure we make those choices now and that \nwe don't continue to kick this can down the road to future generations \nand burden them with a debt they did not incur. The last thing I want \nis for my children to ask me: Mom, you knew we were going bankrupt. \nWhat did you do to save our country?\n  Now is the time for courage. All of us recognize the enormity of the \nfiscal challenges we face, as well as the dire cost of continued \ninaction in this body. The Republican balanced budget amendment \nprovides a solid foundation that will set our Nation on a fiscally \nresponsible path. This is an urgent need that we have right now. We \ncannot do what we did in 1997 and fail to pass the balanced budget \namendment. We should send this question to the States and let them \ndecide, let the people of this country decide: Should we live within \nour means? Should we balance our budget? Should we deal with this debt \ncrisis now and make sure our children and all children and our \ngrandchildren will have the same opportunities we have been blessed to \nhave in the greatest country on Earth?\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. Res. 10.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from New \nHampshire on some of what she said with respect to facing up to our \ndeficit and debt. This debt does present a clear threat to our country, \nand it must be confronted. I agree with her entirely on the question of \nthe importance of that and the priority of it.\n  I disagree entirely with respect to this amendment that is before us. \nI came to the Senate floor to address this balanced budget amendment \nbecause I believe it would be a profound\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nmistake for this country. In fact, I believe if this amendment were in \nforce today we would be in a depression. I believe adopting this \namendment would have and could have disastrous consequences for the \neconomy and for the future strength of this Nation.\n  I would like nothing more than to have a balanced budget. I believe \nin balanced budgets. I believe this debt represents a clear threat to \nthe country. But I do not believe a constitutional amendment is the way \nto achieve it. I believe the way to achieve it is for us to make the \ndecisions to balance the budget, to cut the spending, to raise the \nrevenue, to actually balance the budget--not leave it to a \nconstitutional amendment or to unelected judges or to the States but to \nmake those decisions here and now.\n  I have been part of the fiscal commission where 11 of 18 of us agreed \nto a plan to get our debt under control. I have also been a part of \nfour Democrats and four Republicans who have produced a plan that would \nget us back on track.\n  Here are the key provisions in the proposal before us. First, it \nwould require the adoption of a balanced budget each year unless two-\nthirds of the House and the Senate voted to waive the requirement.\n  Second, it would cap spending at 18 percent of the prior year's gross \ndomestic product, again, unless two-thirds of the House and the Senate \nvoted to waive the requirement.\n  We have not had a spending level of 18 percent of GDP in as long as I \ncan remember. So that is a formula I think that goes against the \nreality of the needs of this country--not only the need for support for \neducation but also for our national defense.\n  It would prohibit passage of any bills that increased revenue unless \ntwo-thirds of the House and the Senate voted to waive the requirement. \nThe Senator just showed a chart that showed revenue at the lowest level \nit has been in 60 years as a share of our national income. Again, \nrevenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years. This constitutional \namendment would say it would take a two-thirds vote to change it. \nReally? Revenue is the lowest in 60 years, and we are going to have a \ntwo-thirds vote to change it? Boy, that is a guarantee we are not going \nto have the necessary revenue to balance the budget anytime soon.\n  It would require a three-fifths vote in the House and Senate to \nincrease the debt limit.\n  Here are what I see as the key problems with this proposal. First, \nmost important, it would restrict our ability to respond to economic \ndownturns. It would effectively block the implementation of \ncountercyclical policies. This would only compound economic declines \nand possibly throw us into a recession or even into a depression.\n  Two of the best known economists in this country did a review of what \nwould have happened absent a Federal response after the events of late \n2008. Alan Blinder, former deputy head of the Federal Reserve, and Mark \nZandi, the head of Moody's Economics, a former campaign adviser to John \nMcCain, did an analysis of what would have happened in this economy \nabsent the Federal response--the TARP and the stimulus. Their \nconclusion is that had we not had that Federal response, we would be in \na depression today. We would have 16 percent unemployment. We would \nhave 8 million more people unemployed.\n  This amendment would have prevented that response. What a mistake, \nwhat a profound mistake. Further, this amendment uses Social Security \nfunds to calculate balance and subjects the Social Security Program to \nthe same cuts as other Federal spending. Further, it shifts ultimate \ndecisions on budgeting to unelected and unaccountable judges.\n  Finally, The State ratification process for a balanced budget \namendment could take years to complete.\n  We don't have years. We need to act now, and we don't need an excuse \nfor inaction by saying: Oh, we passed a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution that will not take effect for God knows how long.\n  Here are some additional problems that are specific to this proposal. \nThe 18 percent of GDP spending cap is Draconian and unrealistic, \nparticularly given the retirement of the baby boom generation and \nrising health care costs. The restriction on legislation that raises \nrevenue would effectively prevent any increase in revenue, even if it \nis part of a bipartisan, balanced debt reduction plan.\n  What a profound mistake that would be. Again, I repeat: Revenue as a \nshare of our national income is the lowest it has been in 60 years. \nSpending as a share of our national income is the highest it has been \nin 60 years. So this proposal would absolutely handcuff us on the \nrevenue side of the equation, locking in deficits for God knows how \nlong. It doesn't make sense.\n  Making it more difficult to raise the debt limit, this proposal \nincreases the likelihood of default. We saw the turmoil created by our \nnear default this summer. Why would we want to make an actual default \nfar more likely to occur?\n  We can also see that on our current course, by 2021, spending on \nSocial Security, Defense and other nonhealth care spending and interest \nalone will reach more than 18 percent of GDP. What is missing? \nMedicare. If we stay on our current course, under this balanced budget \namendment, Federal spending on Medicare would have to be completely \neliminated. Let me repeat that. On our current course, by 2021, \nspending just on Social Security, Defense, nonhealth care spending, and \ninterest alone will reach more than 18 percent of GDP. What is missing? \nMedicare. Medicare would have to be completely eliminated if we aren't \nto change what we are doing with Social Security, not to change what we \nare doing with Defense and other nonhealth care spending. Obviously, we \ncan't do anything about the interest expense. That has to be paid.\n  It is notable an 18-percent spending limit is so unrealistic that \neven the House Republican budget would violate this restriction in \nevery single year. Let me repeat that. This 18-percent restriction on \nspending is so unrealistic that even the House Republican budget would \nviolate this provision in each and every year of its life.\n  Norman Ornstein, a respected scholar at the American Enterprise \nInstitute--a Washington think tank--described a balanced budget \namendment as a very dumb idea. In a column in Roll Call earlier this \nyear, he wrote:\n\n       Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and more \n     destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment. Here \n     is why: Nearly all our states have balanced budget \n     requirements. That means when the economy slows, states are \n     forced to raise taxes or slash spending at just the wrong \n     time, providing a fiscal drag when what is needed is \n     countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In fact, the \n     fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010 was barely countered \n     by the Federal stimulus plan. That meant the Federal stimulus \n     provided was nowhere near what was needed but far better than \n     doing nothing. Now imagine that scenario with a Federal drag \n     instead.\n\n  Mr. Ornstein has it exactly right. A balanced budget amendment would \nhave a devastating impact on our economy at the worst possible time. \nMr. Ornstein is not alone in that sentiment. Macroeconomic Advisers, a \nleading economic forecaster firm, had this to say in a company blog \nposted in October:\n\n       If actually enforced in fiscal year 2012, a balanced budget \n     amendment would quickly destroy millions of jobs while \n     creating enormous economic and social upheaval. The effect on \n     the economy would be catastrophic.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The effect on the economy would be catastrophic.\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       No model could capture the ensuing chaos and uncertainty, \n     which would make matters far worse.\n\n  Macroeconomic Advisers went on to conclude that enforcing a balanced \nbudget amendment in 2012 would result in 15 million fewer jobs.\n  Let me repeat that: 15 million fewer jobs. That is largely in line \nwith the Blinder and Zandi analysis of what would have happened absent \nthe Federal response to the economic downturn.\n  Here is what Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan administration economic \nadviser, wrote in a New York Times online column in November:\n\n       The idea of mandating a balanced budget through the \n     Constitution is dreadful. And the proposal that Republican \n     leaders plan to bring up is, frankly, nuts. The truth is that \n     Republicans don't care one whit about actually balancing the \n     budget. If they did, they would want to return to the \n     policies that gave us balanced budgets in the late 1990s. Of \n     course, no Republican favors such policies\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\n     today. They prefer to delude voters with pie-in-the-sky \n     promises that amending the Constitution will painlessly solve \n     all our budget problems.\n\n  We must absolutely address the Nation's deficit and debt. Our friends \non the other side have that exactly right. Our economic future depends \non our ability to put the budget back on a sound long-term path. That \nis why I believe what is actually needed is for us to put our energy \nand effort into writing a budget that actually balances, cutting the \nspending, raising the revenue, making the tough choices. That is the \nbest way forward.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is not the answer, \nand this balanced budget amendment is particularly troubled. It would \nrestrict our ability to respond to economic downturns, it would impose \na Draconian and unrealistic spending cap, and it would effectively \nprevent any increase in revenue, even if it is part of a bipartisan \nbalanced deficit reduction plan.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  On a separate matter, let me just say when my colleague said we don't \nhave a budget, we do have a budget. I sometimes think our colleagues \nmissed out on what happened on August 2. We passed the Budget Control \nAct. The Budget Control Act provided a budget for this year and for \nnext year. That is the budget we are operating under. It was passed in \nthe Budget Control Act on August 2.\n  So when they put up these signs that say we haven't had a budget for \n958 days or 858 days, that is not right. We do have a budget. They may \nnot particularly like the budget. They certainly may not like the way \nit was done because it wasn't done through the regular process. It \nwasn't done as a budget resolution. It was done as a law. Budget \nresolutions are not signed by the President of the United States; they \nare purely a congressional document. The Budget Control Act is actually \na law. It imposed a budget for this year and next year and 10 years of \nspending caps. That is the law of the United States. That is a budget.\n  For my colleagues to stand and say we don't have a budget, it almost \nmakes me wonder, did they miss out on the debate and the passage and \nthe signing of the Budget Control Act? I tell my colleagues, that is \nour budget. It is in law. It is not just a resolution, it is the law of \nthe land.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened with a great deal of \ninterest to my good friend and colleague, and I do care a great deal \nfor him. He has been budget chairman for quite a while. Frankly, he has \nbeen a lone voice over on that side, trying to get all of us to live \nwithin our means. I have great respect for him for at least trying.\n  But we call budgets line-by-line discussions of just exactly what are \nthe inflows and outgoes as determined by the Budget Committees. He \nhasn't been able to pass a budget mainly because he can't get his side \ntogether to do it. It is a disgrace not for him but because our \ncolleagues will not do it. Nobody wants to do that because if they \ntruly had a budget, that would mean we would have to get spending under \ncontrol. We can't just keep doing it by adding taxes. We have a low \nrate of income coming in right now mainly because spending is \ncompletely out of whack.\n  I listened to my colleague very carefully. I have to say he made a \ntremendous case for the constitutional balanced budget amendment \nbecause he kept going on and on about all the problems we have. He \ndidn't mention we have been spending 25 percent of the GDP. Usually, \nthat is around 20 percent. So 25 percent is a whopping amount of money. \nOur former CBO Director said: I guess the new normal will be somewhere \naround 23 percent. We have been spending around 20 percent, while the \nrevenues are around 18 percent. Now they are spending 25 percent of our \nGDP.\n  If there was ever an argument as to why we need some restraint in the \nCongress of the United States, it is, No. 1, they can't get a budget \nover there. We have a darned tough enough time over here when we are in \ncharge. No. 2, we are spending this country blind. I think the \ndistinguished Senator made that case eloquently. I think it is both \nparties too. But there is certainly one party that is much more used to \nspending than the other--I have to say that--and it is not the \nRepublican Party.\n  Look, all I heard in this last dissertation was what a rough road to \nhoe our country has. This amendment allows for 5 years to gradually \nreach a point where we can live with a balanced budget constitutional \namendment. What it does is send a message to everybody in this body and \nthe other body, over in the House of Representatives, that the game is \nover. We better get it in shape in 5 years. Some people don't think we \ncan do it in 5 years. I am not so sure we can, but we have to try.\n  Let me tell you, this country is in real trouble. My distinguished \ncolleague and friend, whom I admire greatly because he does tell it the \nway it is--though sometimes has his own interpretation as to the way it \nis--made a pretty darned good case that we are out of control. I have \nonly been here 35 years, but I have to say I haven't seen many days \nwhere we have even come close to a balanced budget, and I have seen \nspending after spending after spending and demands for taxes so they \ncan spend more. Both sides are at fault, in my opinion, but one side \nmuch more than the other.\n  I just wanted to make these points, because, my gosh, he made a great \ncase for the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Frankly, I don't \nsee how anybody listening would say the current way we are doing things \nis the right way to do it. Yes, this amendment would put constraints on \nCongress, and they would be tough constraints, but don't buy this \nargument there is no way we can raise revenue or no way we can spend \nunder certain circumstances.\n  It is just that you have to have a supermajority vote to do it, and \nyou are going to have to make a case for it for the first time, in my \ntime here, I will tell you that.\n  I don't think anybody in this country thinks Congress is doing what \nis right with regard to raising taxes and spending. I have to say that \nI have watched it for all these years I have been in the Congress, and \nit is not working because we don't have the constraints that make us \nhave to make it work. That is what this balanced budget amendment is \nall about.\n  What they offer as a balanced budget amendment wouldn't put \nconstraints on anything. It is just there so they can have something to \nvote for so they can say they voted for a balanced budget amendment. It \nis anything but a balanced budget amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the urgent \nneed for our government to begin living within our Nation's means. We \nface a very grave fiscal crisis, one that threatens America today and \nthe American dream for future generations. It demands that we get our \nNation's fiscal house in order. So I am pleased the Senate is now \ndebating a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n  In February 1997, a month after I came to the Senate, I went to the \nSenate floor to urge my colleagues to pass a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution to prevent our growing debt from swallowing our \nfuture prosperity. Unfortunately, that effort came up one vote short. \nSince that time, our national debt has ballooned to an astonishing \n$15.1 trillion.\n  Sometimes when we deal with large numbers, it is easy to lose sense \nof what they mean and difficult to put them into context. What $15.1 \ntrillion in debt means is that a child born today will automatically \ninherit a debt burden of more than $48,000. That debt has been largely \naccrued not for that child's benefit but for our own. It is difficult \nto imagine a more egregious example of taxation without representation \nthan forcing our children and grandchildren to bear the future tax \nburden for today's excesses.\n  Unfortunately, as we have seen over the last decade, the addiction to \nbudget deficits is not simply a Democratic or Republican problem. Both \nparties have had a difficult time showing restraint when it comes to \nspending. We have had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the Deficit Reduction Act, \nand the Budget Enforcement Act, and yet deficits not\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nonly persist but have grown larger. The fiscal year that ended on \nSeptember 30 marked the third consecutive year in which the United \nStates has run deficits in excess of $1 trillion. Deficits have become \na part of the way that Washington does business. Spend now and let \nsomeone else deal with the consequences later.\n  Those spendthrift ways are catching up with us. Our skyrocketing debt \nhas become a drag on our economy and a threat to our future prosperity. \nWe simply do not have the luxury of putting off difficult decisions. We \nare consistently spending more than we take in, and by a large margin. \nIn the last fiscal year, government outlays totaled 24.1 percent of \ngross domestic product--the second highest level, after 2009, since \nWorld War II. Despite the very serious warning signs that we are on the \nwrong fiscal course, this marks the second consecutive year that the \nSenate has not even bothered to pass a budget resolution.\n  It is progress that the Budget Control Act that passed last summer \nincludes caps on discretionary spending, and I have worked very hard \nwith my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to put together \nresponsible and thoughtful spending bills that live within those caps. \nBut, as my colleagues know, the biggest driver of our long-term debt \nand deficits is not discretionary spending but the mandatory spending \nthat continues to balloon on autopilot.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped that the so-called \nsupercommittee, which was created by the Budget Control Act, would be \nable to reach bipartisan agreement to reform mandatory spending and \nchange our fiscal trajectory. Unfortunately, that bipartisan agreement \nremains elusive as both parties failed to come up with a deficit \nreduction plan that was capable of winning a simple majority of panel \nmembers. Instead, we have automatic spending cuts that are set to kick \nin, which could have very serious consequences for our national \ndefense. Again, Congress has avoided making difficult choices about our \nnational priorities.\n  The events currently unfolding across the Atlantic, with European \nleaders scrambling to stop the debt contagion that threatens the \neconomic prosperity of the continent, should be a clear warning signal \nto us of what could come if we do not stem the tide of red ink that is \nengulfing our Nation. We must put in place structural reforms that will \npermanently force Washington to align expenditures and revenues.\n  Every day when I enter my office building, I am reminded of the \nfamous quote attributed to its namesake, Senator Everett Dirksen. The \nwry observation he offered some four decades ago--``A billion here, a \nbillion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money''--seems \ntragically quaint today. I am convinced, now more than ever, that a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment is what is needed to address \nour growing debt and deficits.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my \nsupport of S.J. Res. 10, which would require a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Let me start off by saying that we need \nthis amendment to protect the American taxpayer and bring back fiscal \ndiscipline to Congress. We need this amendment not because the American \ntaxpayer is taxed too little, it is because Washington in particular, \nCongress--spends too much. Finally, we need this amendment to show the \nAmerican taxpayer that we are serious about eliminating waste, fraud, \nabuse, and duplication from the Federal budget and are serious about \nputting our country back on a path to prosperity, not bankruptcy.\n  The Nation's debt now stands at the unsustainable level of $15.1 \ntrillion. The Federal Government is borrowing 40 cents of every dollar \nspent. According to the CBO, by 2021 debt held by the public will reach \n82 percent of GDP. Without real and meaningful action by Congress to \nreform the way we do business, the Nation's debt will balloon to well \nover 100 percent by 2035. CBO projects that the cost of simply paying \nthe interest on all of this debt will total $4.5 trillion over the next \ndecade. And we wonder why there is so much uncertainty in our economy, \nwhy businesses are not expanding and creating jobs that we so \ndesperately need, why the approval rating of Congress is at alltime \nlows--and, may I add, justifiably. The writing is on the wall, and that \nwriting says that Congress can no longer allow politics and special \ninterests to direct how hard-earned taxpayer dollars are spent. We must \nmake hard choices now and live within our means as every American \nfamily is required to do.\n  The President has said that we do not need a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution to cut spending and balance the budget. \nWhile that may be true, it is not the reality. When the Senate passed a \nbalanced budget amendment in 1982, the national debt was $1.1 trillion. \nIn 1997, when the Senate failed by one vote to pass a balanced budget \namendment, the national debt was over $5 trillion. Today, it is over \n$15 trillion. Unfortunately, Congress has proven time and time again \nthat they are unable to cut spending and must be required by law to do \nso. S.J. Res 10 is a strong, meaningful, and commonsense balanced \nbudget amendment that will reassure financial markets and the American \npeople, therefore, providing confidence that our economy so desperately \nneeds.\n  First and foremost this constitutional amendment will require the \nPresident to lead by example and submit a balanced budget to Congress. \nSince being elected, President Obama has failed to send a balanced \nbudget to Congress for consideration.\n  S.J. Res. 10 would also require Congress to pass a balanced budget \nthat limits outlays to 18 percent of GDP. In addition, it would require \na vote of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress in order to raise taxes \non the American people. This provision is vitally important to ensure \nthat we are not punishing the American taxpayer by making them pay for \nout of control spending by Washington. Finally, S.J. Res. 10 would \nrequire a vote of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress to increase \nthe Nation's debt limit. This constitutional amendment also includes \nlimited waivers that would, for example, allow Congress during a \ndeclaring of war to enact deficit spending or to raise the debt limit \nby a simple majority vote.\n  My colleagues on the other side have brought forth their own balanced \nbudget amendment; however, their proposal fails to ensure that Congress \nwill make the hard choices necessary to solve our current and long-term \nfiscal crisis. For example, the Democrats' balanced budget amendment \ndoes not apply to Social Security spending. According to the 2011 \nreport by the Social Security Trustees, Social Security faces permanent \ndeficits unless the Congress reforms the system. In fact, the program \nis projected to face a deficit of $46 billion this year. The Social \nSecurity disability trust fund is projected to become insolvent in \n2018. We cannot be serious about solving our Nation's financial \nproblems unless we include the Social Security Program, which is one of \nthe largest drivers of future debt. In addition, their balanced budget \namendment does not cap spending at 18 percent of GDP, it does not \nrequire a supermajority of Congress to raise taxes and does not require \na supermajority of Congress to raise the debt limit. As we know too \nwell, Congress has never voted against raising the debt limit.\n  This week, the Senate has the ability to show the American people \nthat they are serious about fixing our fiscal crisis by adopting this \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. This balanced budget \namendment is a vital step in ensuring that future generations will have \nthe same opportunities that all of us here in this body have \nexperienced. I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 10.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority whip on \nthe floor. I would like to propound a UC, and if he disagrees, please \ntell me. I would like to be recognized for 5 minutes, followed by \nSenator Shaheen from New Hampshire for 5 minutes, followed by Senator \nEnzi for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I would just like to add \nmy name at the end of the queue for at least 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. With no objection from me.\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the time.\n  I first thank Senator Hatch from Utah for 16 continuous years of work \non the balanced budget amendment. It was his fight in 1995 that brought \nthat amendment to the floor within one vote of passing in the Senate, \nand it is his fight today to bring it back for another vote.\n  I have listened to a substantial number of the speeches, and I come \nback to three points.\n  Facts are stubborn, and there are three facts: First, we are spending \ntoo much; second fact, we are promising too much to our people; and \nthird fact, we are borrowing too much.\n  I ran a real estate company for 22 years. Real estate is all about \nborrowing and leverage, but you learn a lesson in real estate and you \nlearn it very painfully. There is such a thing as good leverage and \nthere is such a thing as too much leverage, and our country is at the \nbreaking point on leverage.\n  We have a process problem in the Senate and the House. We can't deal \nwith our financial fiscal affairs, our promises to our people or our \nborrowing, and it is time we change the paradigm.\n  I support a balanced budget amendment because if it is ratified by \nthree-fourths of the States and becomes a part of the Constitution, it \nforces the Congress to just say no on spending when we are spending too \nmuch, it forces the Congress to look at entitlements and recognize that \nwe can only promise that which we can afford, and it forces us to look \nat debt and recognize when we are in too much debt and we have become \noverleveraged.\n  I want to put in a plug for something Senator Shaheen and I have been \nworking on for a long time, and it is a fundamental process change \ncalled a biennial budget where you appropriate in odd-numbered years \nfor 2 years, not 1, and you spend that even-numbered year, the election \nyear, overseeing your expenditures and your programs to find savings, \nto find waste, and to try to balance your budget. If we changed our \nprocess and forced ourselves to do something like that, we wouldn't be \nfacing the catastrophic consequences we are today.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for being on the floor and \nrecognize her for her leadership on the issue, also, as one from a \nState that does biennial budgeting, as do 20 of the 50 States in the \nUnited States of America.\n  I will tell you an interesting story about biennial budgeting. The \nnation of Israel got in financial difficulty 4 years ago. They were \nborrowing too much, they were spending too much, and they were going in \ndebt too much. Israel asked around the world: What should we do to \nchange our fundamental process? And they changed to a biennial budget. \nTwo years later, their GDP was better, their deficit ratio was down, \nand GDP had gone up about 7.5 percent in 2 years, all because they got \ntheir fiscal house in order.\n  So while some will argue that you can't do a balanced budget because \nit won't work, some will say 18 percent is too much, some will say you \njust can't do this and you just can't do that, there is one thing we \ncan't do anymore; that is, spend beyond our means, borrow beyond what \nis good for our children and grandchildren, and promise to our seniors \nand those in poverty that we can deliver more than we can deliver.\n  If we face the day of reckoning now and we reprioritize our \nentitlements, if we put our Tax Code on the table and reform it and we \ncut spending where we can, we can come up with a trifecta that will \ntake this debate to ancient history, and we will begin getting the \nUnited States of America back in good fiscal soundness. That is what a \nbalanced budget amendment starts, and I hope the end of it is that \nprocess and a biennial budget as well.\n  I thank the President for the time, and I yield to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for \nhis very thoughtful comments.\n  Senator Isakson has been working on a biennial budget for a very long \ntime. I was pleased to join him in this session of Congress. And I \nagree with him. I believe this is one of the ways we can encourage more \noversight of our spending and hopefully address some of the budget \nissues we face. So I appreciate and share his beliefs that this is an \nimportant change we should make.\n  I am actually on the floor not to speak on the balanced budget \namendment, however, but to talk about what I believe is very important \nfor us to do before the end of this year; that is, address the \nextension of the payroll tax cut.\n  In November, the private sector added 140,000 new jobs to our \nworkforce. In fact, businesses have now created 100,000 jobs in each of \nthe last 5 months. This is a positive trend we haven't seen in the past \n5 years. While this is encouraging, we still have a long way to go \nbecause more than 13 million Americans remain unemployed and millions \nmore are underemployed. These individuals and their families are \nstruggling to make ends meet during this holiday season.\n  At this time last year, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to put \nmore money into the pockets of working Americans. We cut payroll taxes \nfor workers--an effort that increased take-home pay for the average \nhousehold by almost $1,000 in 2011. This tax cut isn't just good for \nfamilies on a tight budget, it is good for our fragile economy. In New \nHampshire, the payroll tax cut has meant an extra $600 million in our \ncommunities.\n  There are some who want to allow this tax cut to expire at the end of \nthe year. But let's be clear. If the tax cut expires, this would mean \nthe average family would see their taxes increase by $1,000 next year. \nThis would mean taking $120 billion out of our Nation's economy, money \nthat would no longer be spent at our supermarkets, at our retailers, \nand at our gas stations. That doesn't make sense.\n\n  Independent economists have predicted that allowing this tax cut to \nexpire could cost our economy 400,000 jobs next year. Some have even \npredicted that the United States could face another recession if we \ndon't take action.\n  Members of this body have also suggested that this tax cut would \nstarve Social Security of needed revenue and endanger this bedrock \nprogram's solvency. With Americans relying so heavily on Social \nSecurity to meet basic needs, this is a serious charge and one we \nshould take seriously. However, the program's Chief Actuary has written \nthat this tax cut does not hurt Social Security's finances. Instead, \nthis proposal contains provisions to require that the Social Security \ntrust fund be made whole.\n  I recently supported Senator Casey's proposal to not only extend \npayroll tax cuts for employees but also to expand them to increase the \naverage family's take-home pay by an additional $500 next year. This \nproposal would have cut employer payroll taxes, making it easier for \nsmall businesses to keep current workers and hire new ones. That \nproposal was fully paid for with a 3-percent tax on people earning more \nthan $1 million in a year. Because of the way it was paid for, the \nlegislation was blocked. My friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, \nalso introduced a compromise plan that I supported. But again, \nunfortunately, it did not pass.\n  I think that particularly now, at this time of the year, at this \ncritical stage for our economy, everyone should agree on preventing tax \nincreases for working families. There are some competing ideas about \nthe best way to accomplish this, and I welcome that debate, but \nCongress simply cannot afford to saddle middle-class families with a \n$1,000 tax increase in the midst of an uneven recovery. It isn't right \nfor our small businesses, it isn't right for our communities, and it \nisn't right for the economy.\n  Time is running out to extend the payroll tax cut. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue I raised \nduring my maiden speech on the Senate floor in 1997; that is, the need \nto pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.\n  I am disappointed that we were unable to pass a balanced budget \namendment in 1997. I commend Senator Hatch for his efforts then. We got \nwithin one vote. We had 66 votes and we needed 67. Had we gotten that, \nwe\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nwouldn't be in this mess today. In 1997, our national debt was $5.4 \ntrillion. Today, it is an astonishing $15 trillion. Without immediate \naction, that number will continue to increase to a level that is even \nmore unsustainable.\n  Time and time again, the Federal Government has proven it is \nincapable of the fiscal discipline needed to spend within its means. \nTime and time again, the Federal Government has spent more money than \nwe brought in. It has led to the situation we currently face where we \nare borrowing more than 40 cents on every dollar we spend and where we \nare being threatened with further downgrades in our credit rating.\n  In fiscal year 2010, the government brought in slightly more than \n$2.2 trillion in revenue. At the same time we collected $2.2 trillion, \nwe spent $3.5 trillion. In other words, we overspent by $1.3 trillion. \nThat is $1,300 billion. That is an astonishing amount of spending, and \nit cannot be sustained. I encourage everybody to write these numbers \nout with all of the zeroes sometime and see what we are talking about. \nWe have a spending addiction that must be controlled. For years we have \ntried to hide it, disguise it, or ignore it. We have acted as if it is \nOK to keep spending money we don't have. We no longer have that option. \nThe world today is different from the world of 1997.\n  We have seen riots in other nations where their fiscal situations \nwere out of control. If we don't act now, we could see similar events \nin this country. We can either balance our budget or go broke--even \nmore broke than we already are.\n  Balancing the budget is not a revolutionary idea. Responsible \nfamilies balance the amount they spend with the amount they make or \nthey go bankrupt. Businesses balance the amount they spend with the \namount they bring in or they go bankrupt. Most States have amendments \nrequiring them to balance the amount they spend with their revenue. \nWyoming's Constitution requires a balanced budget each and every year, \nand they do it. If people in Washington understood budgeting the way \nWyoming does, we would be in a much better place right now. If \nfamilies, businesses, and States can balance their budgets, there is no \nreason the Federal Government cannot balance its budget.\n  There are two options the Senate is considering today, and I am \npleased there is consensus from both sides of the aisle that a balanced \nbudget amendment would help us. Although that is the case, there is no \ndoubt in my mind that the version introduced by Senator Hatch is far \nsuperior to the version introduced by Senator Udall.\n  The Republican balanced budget amendment gets to the heart of the \nproblem, which is the need to rein in out-of-control spending. The \nRepublican resolution requires that we get spending down to historical \nrevenue levels and forces us to make the tough choices about which \nprograms will no longer be necessary. It also prohibits Congress from \nraising taxes until a supermajority of Members support such a tax \nincrease. This is an important provision because the default solution \nfor our out-of-control spending should be cutting spending, not raising \ntaxes. This bill also goes into effect 5 years after ratification, \nwhich gives us the ability to transition to a balanced budget.\n  I have a penny solution bill out there, a 1-cent solution where we \ncut 1 percent from every dollar we spend for 7 years. At the end of 7 \nyears, the budget would balance. So it is not something that is \nundoable. We can balance the budget.\n  While I am pleased that my Democratic colleagues have a balanced \nbudget amendment, the alternative they offer does not address the heart \nof the problem. It does not include a spending cap to ensure that we \nmove spending to an acceptable level. It does not include a requirement \nfor a supermajority to raise taxes, which will allow proponents of tax \nincreases to more easily work to balance a budget on the backs of the \nAmerican taxpayers. And the American taxpayers are only 49 percent of \nthe people working right now. The American people are not the ones who \ncannot get spending under control. They should not see tax increases \nsimply because Congress can't do its job.\n  We need to pass the Hatch amendment, and we need to pass it now, \nbecause I must also remind my colleagues that passage of a strong \nbalanced budget amendment is the first step. If we pass a balanced \nbudget amendment, it still must be ratified by the States. Three-\nfourths of the States have to pass it for it to become a part of the \nConstitution. That will take time, and with a $15 trillion debt we \ndon't have a lot of time left. There is speculation that 2 years might \nbe the outside. This isn't going to balance for 5 years. Two will \ncreate some substantial cuts and tax increases.\n  Passage of the balanced budget amendment by three-fourths of the \nStates is a tough test. Because of the magnitude of what we are trying \nto do, it should be. However, we need to give the States this \nopportunity to force the Federal Government to come to grips with its \nfinances, as the State governments are required to do.\n  Why should we give the States the opportunity to ratify a balanced \nbudget amendment? Because I found that the best decisions are made \nclosest to the people. State governments are closer to the people than \nthe Federal Government and they are generally better at addressing the \nneeds of the people of their State. Giving the States the opportunity \nto ratify the amendment will bring the budget closer to the people and \nwould allow the American people to decide how they want Washington to \nspend their hard-earned money. Most of the American people get it and \nthey are asking us to get it and do a balanced budget amendment.\n  Amending our Constitution is an extraordinary measure. It is not \nsomething I take lightly. We are in an extraordinary time. We have a \nbudget deficit that is out of control and a national debt that is \nballooning to levels that are unsustainable. We need a balanced budget \namendment so we can begin to get our Nation's finances back in order.\n  I commend Senator Hatch for his bill and appreciate him offering it. \nI hope my colleagues will support it. It is essential for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are very few things on which Members \nof Congress agree, but one of the things that binds us and unites us is \nthe common oath we take to uphold and defend this document. This \ndocument is not just another resolution, another law; it is the \nConstitution of the United States. For more than 220 years this \ndocument has guided our Nation and inspired other nations toward \ndemocracy. I think it is fitting that we swear an oath to uphold and \ndefend it.\n  But I think we also have to look at this document not just with \nrespect but with humility, humility because we know the words contained \nhave managed to guide our Nation so successfully for so many decades \nand centuries. Those who are bold enough to suggest they would change \nthe wording of this document have to expect to have hard questions \nasked as to whether it is appropriate and whether what they are setting \nout to do is consistent with this great document and the needs of our \nNation.\n  I can recall when Senator Hatch chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and I was a member. There was a day when they asked me, as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, to give permission for three \nconstitutional amendments to be considered in the same day. I objected, \nwhich was my right. I said to Chairman Hatch at the time: You can call \ntwo constitutional amendments on Thursday but, call me old-fashioned, I \ndon't think we ought to amend the Constitution more than twice a day. \nThe point I was trying to make was to suggest to my colleagues to at \nleast have some humility and maybe even hesitancy to suggest they can \nchange for the better the wording of this great Constitution.\n  It has been changed, there is no question about it. From the moment \nit was written until a few years later, Thomas Jefferson called for the \nBill of Rights. Many say that was essential for the ratification of the \nConstitution. It included some basic rights that we now revere in this \ncountry. So the first package of amendments, the Bill of Rights, has \nbecome an integral part of the original document because they were \nadopted so quickly--added so quickly.\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  But in the 220 years since 1791, when the Bill of Rights was added--\nin the 220 years we have only amended this document 17 times and only \nfor the most serious of matters. Consider what our amendments have \ndone. They have ended the practice of slavery. They have established \nthe principle of equal protection. They have assured the right of women \nin America to vote, among other things. They have provided for \nsuccession in case of Presidential disability, and they have addressed \nsome of the most fundamental issues facing our Nation.\n  Now some Members of Congress believe we should enshrine in our \nConstitution their views of what the Federal budget should look like. \nThey want to radically reshape our constitutional framework in order to \nrelieve Congress of its political and moral responsibility to make \ntough choices about taxing and spending. They want to tie the hands of \nCongress on budget decisions and pass important decisions on to another \nbranch of government, our Federal judiciary.\n  That is not what the Founding Fathers intended. The Constitution \ngives the power of the purse expressly to Congress. Fulfilling this \nconstitutional duty carries some political risk, but we all signed up \nfor that job. Members of Congress should not try to change the \nConstitution to avoid their duty to make tough and important decisions.\n  These days, some in Congress would rather take a red pen to the \nConstitution than to reconsider an anti-tax pledge they have made to a \nWashington lobbyist named Grover Norquist. Mr. President, 40 Republican \nSenators, all of whom are cosponsors of this amendment, have taken a \npledge, a public oath to Grover Norquist when it comes to the issue of \ntaxes. I believe my colleagues who are indentured politically to Grover \nNorquist need to get their priorities right. Our oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution is much more important than any allegiance to \nany Washington lobbyist.\n  Congress has balanced the budget not just in my lifetime but in my \nterm of service. We ran a budget surplus in fiscal years 1998 through \n2001. There is nothing stopping us now from getting our fiscal house in \norder except a lack of political will. We simply do not need to go to \nthe extreme of amending the Constitution to get this job done.\n  It is also clear a balanced budget amendment proposal has many \nunanswered questions and concerns and it is our responsibility to ask \nthose questions. I held a hearing as chairman of the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary, well attended by Members on both sides \nof the aisle, with witnesses telling us the pros and cons of a balanced \nbudget amendment. That is the way the process should work. Now we come \nto the floor to consider two versions of a balanced budget amendment.\n  It is interesting, when the balanced budget amendment came before the \nHouse of Representatives, opposition to it was bipartisan. Even the \nRepublican chairmen of the House Rules Committee and the House Budget \nCommittee voted against the Republican version of the balanced budget \namendment brought up in the House.\n  A few weeks ago, when we held this hearing, witnesses told us why we \nshould have pause, if not reject, this notion of a balanced budget \namendment. First, it would cause harm to the economy. I cannot say it \nany better than Senator Conrad did moments ago. Our budget in \nWashington is designed to not only serve the needs of the nation but to \nhelp our economy get on track and stay on track. In fact, when things \ngo bad in our economy, as they have in the last several years, our \nbudget steps in with countercyclical measures such as unemployment \ncompensation to put our economy back on track. The balanced budget \namendment before us today is going to make that more difficult to do.\n  The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers told us what would have \nhappened with this balanced budget amendment if it had been in place \ntoday. They said such an amendment would double the unemployment rate \nin America, cause the gross domestic product to shrink by 17 percent, \nand destroy millions of jobs. That is something my Republican \ncolleagues will not acknowledge, and they should. If we cannot spend in \ntimes of recession, even when receipts are low, we fail to turn the \nrecession around and of course we leave many unemployed Americans with \nno help when they desperately need it.\n\n  There is also a provision in the Hatch-McConnell balanced budget \namendment that would increase the risk of default on our national debt \nby requiring a three-fifths vote in each House to raise the debt limit. \nI might tell my colleagues who follow this, only 3 of the last 11 debt \nceiling increases passed both Chambers by a three-fifths vote; 3 of the \nlast 11. If you enjoyed the debt limit standoff of a few months ago and \nthe threat of not only closing down our Government but closing down our \neconomy, you would enshrine it in the Constitution with the Republican \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  It always strikes me as odd, if not hypocritical, that Members come \nto the floor and give speeches about how much they support a war \neffort, or spending for a given issue, and then when it comes time to \nraise the debt limit, which is part of the bargain, they are nowhere to \nbe found. They want to be there for the press release saying, I am for \nthe war, but when the debt limit needs to be increased to pay for the \nwar they become fiscal conservatives and are nowhere to be found. I \nthink there is some political hypocrisy in that.\n  Another concern no one has answered that I commend to my colleagues \nwas exemplified by the testimony of Professor Alan Morrison of George \nWashington University Law School. He asked the basic question: Who is \ngoing to enforce this amendment? If in fact Congress does something in \nviolation of the amendment, who can sue? And which court would consider \nit? It is a valid question because ultimately this will end up in the \ncourts. The courts will have to make some rather unique decisions. What \nare the outlays and receipts of the United States? What was the gross \ndomestic product? These are issues which many in the court may find \nchallenging if not impossible to deal with on a timely basis. The \nlonger it takes to resolve those issues the more uncertainty there will \nbe about our Nation's economy and its economic future.\n  Do we want to put the courts in charge of budget decisions? Former \nSolicitor General and Judge Robert Bork said ``the result . . . would \nlikely be hundreds, if not thousands, of lawsuits around the country, \nmany of them on inconsistent theories and providing inconsistent \nresults.''\n  Those who support the amendment look for stability and certainty. My \nguarantee is turning this over to the Federal courts will give you \nneither.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service looked at balanced \nbudget amendment enforcement on August 3 and said:\n\n       The experience of State governments indicates that concern \n     over judicial involvement in budgeting is realistic. In some \n     States the judiciary has become involved with the operation \n     of various aspects of budgeting to impose budget balancing \n     remedies [like] requiring tax increases, limiting \n     expenditures generally or preventing implementation of \n     specific spending laws. The possibility that the Federal \n     courts could invoke such remedies prompts concern about the \n     potential such actions would have for causing a significant \n     shift in the balance of power among the branches of the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  Even former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was called in by my \nRepublican colleagues to testify at our hearing in support, conceded \n``the question of enforcement remains a challenge that should be \nthoughtfully considered.''\n  I might add, parenthetically: No kidding. Enforcement of this is \ncritical. How can the Senate consider passing a balanced budget \namendment without answering first the question of enforcement? It would \ncreate tremendous uncertainty.\n  I would say the balanced budget amendment that has been sponsored by \nall the Senate Republicans raises particular concerns. Under this \nproposal, spending would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic \nproduct each year, a level far below the Draconian budget suggested by \nCongressman Paul Ryan that would end Medicare as we know it.\n  The Senate Republican proposal enshrines the Republican philosophy in \nrequiring a two-thirds vote in each House on any bill that increases \ntaxes or revenue without any ability to waive that two-thirds \nrequirement, even in time of war.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n  The effect of these reforms would devastate programs such as Medicare \nand Social Security while giving constitutional protection to tax \nexpenditures currently enjoyed by corporations and the wealthy. This \nproposal is not sensible, it is not fair, it would not serve our \ncountry well.\n  In short, our hearing made it clear there has not been a balanced \nbudget amendment proposed that would actually be enforceable and that \nwould not cause great collateral damage to the economy.\n  I have served on several efforts, and continue to, in an effort to \nreduce spending, to find new revenue, and to balance our budget. I will \ntell you that it takes political will. This kind of approach, this idea \nthat somehow we can pass a constitutional amendment and be done with \nour responsibility is not only shortsighted, I think it is \ncounterproductive. I think it will make our situation worse instead of \nbetter. I thank Senator Mark Udall for his offering on his balanced \nbudget amendment. It is a better approach, and while I don't support a \nbalanced budget amendment, if I were to support any balanced budget \namendment it would be the Udall amendment. But I don't believe amending \nthe Constitution at this point in time is the right way to approach \nthis. I do not believe either amendment achieves it without creating \nterrific uncertainty in our future about enforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts to amend our Constitution. I \nurge them, instead, to show political courage and work hard right now \nin a bipartisan way to address our fiscal challenges. That is what the \nAmerican people expect of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nRepublican-offered balanced budget amendment, a measure I worked on \nwith Senators Toomey, Lee, Hatch, and Cornyn, and thank those Senators \nfor their leadership on the issue.\n  As Americans know, Washington has a spending problem. The Federal \nGovernment's fiscal position is unsustainable. It now borrows more than \n40 cents of every dollar it spends. Indeed, our debt has climbed to \nover $15 trillion and will continue to grow and threaten our economy \nand our jobs and our way of life unless we do something about it.\n  Opponents say Congress should do its job. Sure, it should, but it has \nnot. Events during the last 30 years have shown that Congress cannot be \ncounted on to make the tough choices necessary to control spending and \nto balance the budget. Here is a little history. When the Senate passed \na balanced budget amendment in 1982, that national debt was $1.1 \ntrillion. In 1986, when the Senate failed by one vote to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment, the national debt topped $2.1 trillion. By \n1997, when the Senate again failed by one vote, the national debt was \nover $5 trillion. Today the debt is over $15 trillion. So there is no \nevidence that Congress has been willing to or able to reduce the debt \nwithout the Constitution requiring it.\n\n  The Republican balanced budget amendment simply requires Congress to \ndo its job. It includes real reforms that would help the government \nlive within its means, including having the President submit a balanced \nbudget to Congress every year.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not etch rules into stone. Any of \nits requirements can be waived by a supermajority of the Congress; that \nis, if there is a real national consensus to do so. Let's remember we \nare in a crisis today because of deficit spending. Raising taxes and \ngetting deeper in debt have been far too easy for Congress.\n  The Republican balanced budget amendment contains two key enforcement \nmechanisms that Congress would have to abide by. First, Congress would \nhave to limit spending to 18 percent of the gross domestic product from \nthe preceding calendar year. The balanced budget amendment would also \nprohibit spending from exceeding total revenues in a given year. Why 18 \npercent? Well, if the goal is to balance the budget, the only way to \nsucceed is to limit the Federal spending to the level of revenue that \nthe economy is willing to bear.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's August Budget and \nEconomic Outlook, from 1991 to 2010--the most recent period of time--\nrevenues averaged 18 percent of gross domestic product, and that is why \nthat number is selected.\n  It is notable that the Democratic alternative does not contain a \nspending cap. It also contains a lower threshold of votes for waiving \nthe balanced budget amendment, which, of course, would make deficit \nspending much easier.\n  The second mechanism in the Republican balanced budget amendment is a \nprohibition on any bill that increases taxes from becoming law unless \napproved by two-thirds of a rollcall vote of Members in each Chamber. \nWhen Congress cannot get its hands on enough revenue for its spending \npriorities, the temptation is always to look for more revenue and raise \ntaxes. Well, it should be more difficult to take more money from the \nAmerican people and to increase the size of the Federal Government.\n  Moreover, raising taxes is not a productive solution to budget \ndeficits. Not only does projected revenue usually fail to materialize, \nhigher taxes discourage work, production, savings, and investment which \nall results in lower revenues in future years. So we cannot balance the \nbudget by raising taxes.\n  On the issue of tax increase restrictions, the Democratic alternative \nagain falls short. It does not contain a mechanism to make it more \ndifficult for Congress to raise taxes. In fact, it does the opposite. \nIt contains a provision that makes it more difficult to lower taxes \ncollected from American job creators.\n  Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will paint a \ndoomsday scenario that they say would result from the Republican \nbalanced budget amendment, one that would mean immediate changes and \ndraconian cuts. That is not accurate. As we know, Congress cannot amend \nthe Constitution. We can only propose an amendment for States to \nconsider in a ratification process that takes a long time. If it \npassed, the balanced budget amendment would not become effective until \n5 years after ratification by three-fourths of the States. So it is not \nlike we have some immediate concern that next year's budget is going to \nsuffer if the balanced budget amendment were to pass.\n  Let's not punt again on getting our spending under control. Let's not \nkeep kicking the can down the road. Let's put on some real constraints \nso Congress will have to do its job, the job the American people expect \nit to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Republican-offered \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Kyl in \nsupporting the balanced budget amendment that Senators Lee and Hatch \nhave crafted. I commend them for their hard work, and I particularly \nthank Senator Hatch for his principled leadership over the years in \nthis effort. In the mid-1990s he almost got us to a balanced budget \namendment to send to the States, and this time I hope he--showing his \nleadership again--will be successful.\n  Washington's runaway spending and crippling debt burden underscore \nthe need for us to have a balanced budget in this country. If \nWashington doesn't stop spending more than it takes in, I fear there \nwill be an economic collapse, and, perhaps more profoundly, it will \nthreaten the very foundation of our Nation--the freedom of individuals \nto thrive and to prosper.\n  There is plenty of evidence to show that the huge debt burden we have \nis already crippling the economy. There was a recent study done by \nrespected economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that shows that \nthe debt burden of 90 percent of the economy will reduce a country's \neconomic growth by 1 or 2 percentage points. Our gross debt right now \nis 100 percent of our economy. Growth this year is likely to be closer \nto 2 percent total, pretty weak growth. So 1 percent to 2 percent more \nwould mean a 50-percent or even a 100-percent growth increase in this \ncountry. This means over 1 million new jobs could be created right now \nif we didn't have these huge deficits building up annually to a record \ndebt that is now over $15 trillion.\n  It is unacceptable that we have the economic growth that we do \nbecause it\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nis keeping people from achieving the opportunities they seek at a time \nwhen there are almost 22 million Americans who are unemployed or \nunderemployed, and we need to do everything we can to give the economy \na shot in the arm. Part of it is getting our fiscal house in order and \nstopping this record deficit and debt. We should not condemn people to \nchronic unemployment through inaction in Washington.\n  However much lawmakers at times want to do the right thing, it seems \nas though the political system and the budget rules around here create \na bias for spending and deficits. When I left the post as Director of \nthe Office Management and Budget in the last Presidential \nadministration--that was in 2007--the budget deficit was $161 billion, \nwhich is about 12 percent of today's budget deficit, and I thought that \nwas way too high. In fact, that year I proposed, on behalf of the \nPresident, a budget that actually balanced over a 5-year period because \nat that time we were so concerned about growing deficits and debts. \nAgain, that was only 12 percent of today's deficit.\n\n  In that time, as OMB Director, I was convinced that we need to have a \ndiscipline in Washington to balance the budget because we need to have \nsome incentive to prioritize. Washington, again, seems to have this \nbias toward spending and deficits that I think can only be resolved \nthrough what 49 States have, which, again, is this power to be able to \ntell the elected representatives that we have to figure out how to \nprioritize; we have to figure out how, at the end of the day what every \nfamily in America does, what every business in America does, which is \nto figure out how not to spend more than we take in.\n  Study and experience led the Founders of our country to create the \nbest system of government ever devised: a Republic with enumerated \npowers. Similarly, study and experience should lead us to enact a \nbalanced budget amendment. The times demand it. We need to reverse this \nsystem's bias in favor of deficits and debts. We need a balanced budget \namendment in order to preserve the Founders' vision of a limited \ngovernment of enumerated powers.\n  But the fact is, Congress has not been able to get its spending under \ncontrol through any other means. Some have called for a far higher tax \nrate. In other words, instead of dealing with the spending that is \nincreasing dramatically--by the way, spending has gone up 21 percent \njust in the last three years. But instead of dealing with that, people \nsay: Why don't you just raise taxes to catch up with the spending? That \nway we would have a balanced budget through higher and higher revenues.\n  I guess what I would say is, Congress has a spending problem not a \nrevenue problem. The growth in the entitlement programs, of course, is \nthe long-term driver of this spending problem. The cost of these \nentitlements, along with interest on the debt, is projected to squeeze \nout the cost of every other Federal program within the next couple of \ndecades, leaving little to nothing for other government priorities.\n  People say, well, the revenues as a percent of our economy are \nrelatively low now, and that is true. Coming out of the recession, we \nhave not had the growth we had hoped for and that has resulted in lower \ntax revenues coming in.\n  Historically, tax revenues have been 18 percent of our economy. Today \nthey are lower than that and closer to 14.5 to 15 percent. Spending has \nbeen at about 20 percent of our economy historically since World War \nII. Today, that spending is over 24 percent of our economy.\n  What happens over the next several years, based on the Congressional \nBudget Office analysis, is the revenues begin to increase as a percent \nof the economy even if the 2001 and 2003 tax relief is not continued. \nIn that case, the revenues increase even more dramatically up to 21 \npercent or 22 percent of the economy.\n  So the fact is, the spending is on a trajectory to go up from a \nhistoric 20 percent to 24 percent now to 30 percent to 40 percent to 50 \npercent over the decades. We cannot catch that spending with enough \ntaxes. It simply cannot be done and have a viable economy. So we have \nto deal with the spending side of the ledger. Even if we do raise taxes \nto chase the trajectory, we will upset that balance between the Federal \nGovernment and a free, robust private sector that encourages innovation \nand gets people back to work.\n  If the Federal Government ends up taxing every dollar of earnings, we \nwill have taken away the space for Americans to pursue and enjoy the \nrewards of their hard work, risk-taking and innovation. The Founders \nmight have used another phrase to describe what a free economy \npromotes: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Today we are \ntalking about how we ensure that we have economic growth so that we can \nbring back the jobs, and that will not happen through the level of \ntaxation that would be required to catch up to the record levels of \nspending.\n  To address Washington's natural inclination toward taxing and \nspending, a successful balanced budget amendment needs to do more than \njust require the outlays be less or equal to receipts. Again, it should \ninclude a spending cap because of the problems I have talked about with \nregard to the projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice over the coming years and decades. It should also demand a \nsupermajority should Congress seek to enact antigrowth tax hikes.\n  I think this balanced budget amendment, crafted by Senators Hatch and \nLee, by doing that strikes a good balance. It also addresses the \nconcern about a balanced budget amendment limiting the Federal \nGovernment's ability to spend in a time of war. If there is a \ndeclaration of war against a nation-state, a majority vote in both \nHouses would allow for deficit spending. If the Armed Forces are \nengaged in a military conflict that has not been given a full \ndeclaration of war, a three-fifths vote in both Houses would allow for \ndeficit spending. This is in keeping with the intention of the \nFounders.\n  In Federalist 34, Alexander Hamilton drew a distinction between \nmonarchies and republics. He said, the chief source of expense in every \ngovernment was defense spending. But republics, Hamilton counseled, \nshould not use this to live beyond their means. He wrote:\n\n       There should be as great a disproportion between the \n     profusion and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its \n     domestic administration, and the frugality and economy which \n     in that particular become the modest simplicity of republican \n     government.\n\n  Washington has spent and overspent. This has led us away from that \nfrugality that was the intention of our Founders. A balanced budget is \nthe only way to get back to frugality and to that ``modest simplicity \nof republican government.'' And that is republican with a small ``r.''\n  If we don't restrain spending through a balanced budget amendment, we \nwill effectively inhibit and ultimately undermine the liberty of the \nAmericans. We will threaten the American dream, the hope that each \ngeneration is able to pass on to the next generation a better life so \nthat they are able to flourish and to meet, again, their achievements, \ntheir objectives in life through opportunity that can be created \nthrough a growing economy.\n  It is time for Congress to prioritize. It is time for Congress to \nmake tough decisions. We should do it with the discipline of a balanced \nbudget. Time has shown us there is a need for a requirement to make \nthose decisions.\n  My home State of Ohio has that discipline. In fact, over the past \nyear, Ohio has had to make some tough decisions to close a budget gap \nof about $8 billion. Here in Washington, we have a budget gap that is \nfar higher. This year the government will bring in about $2.2 trillion \nand spend about $3.7 trillion. This gap is huge and growing, and just \nas 49 States do, we need to discipline Washington to force Congress to \nmake these tough decisions to prioritize on behalf of the American \npeople so that we don't have this crippling effect on economic growth, \nso that we can begin to see the kind of robust recovery we hope for \ncoming out of the recession.\n  For all these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthe Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown of Ohio pertaining to the submission of S. \nRes. 347 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted \nResolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress cannot absolve itself of the \nresponsibility to balance the budget by passing a constitutional \namendment. Congress has an existing constitutional duty to control the \npurse. If Congress has the will to balance the budget, it can do so. If \nit does not have that will, no constitutional amendment can be a \nsubstitute.\n  We knew that in 1996, which I believe was the last time the Senate \nseriously evaluated a balanced budget amendment. While we did not pass \nthe balanced budget amendment, we did adopt budgets and policies that \ncreated the first surpluses in decades, enabling the United States to \nbegin to reduce its debt load. Unfortunately, that fiscal sensibility \nwas washed away by irresponsible, unfunded Bush tax cuts in 2001 and \n2003 and two unfunded wars. Once again, we find ourselves in a deep \nfiscal hole.\n  We can and must dig ourselves out of it, as we did in the 1990s, by \ntaking a balanced approach, restoring revenues, and making sensible \nspending cuts. But that is not a constitutional question. That is a \npolitical one. Can we, as a Congress, pass the tough measures needed to \nrestore fiscal discipline?\n  I have proposed a seven-point plan for reducing the deficit. \nBipartisan commissions have proposed making spending cuts and \nincreasing revenues and realistic folks from all parts of the political \nspectrum agree Congress needs to address revenues, as well as spending, \nif we are to achieve real deficit reduction.\n  Congress needs to make tough choices and is failing to do so. One \nmore procedural promise--this time in the form of a constitutional \namendment--is not going to get the job done.\n  While the details of the two amendments before us differ in many \nrespects, there are real questions as to how either could be enforced.\n  For instance, the Udall amendment says:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  What would happen if Congress failed to adopt the implementing \nlegislation that lives up to the terms of the amendment? If it does not \nhave the will to make cuts and raise revenues, what makes people think \nCongress will be able to agree on implementing legislation?\n  The amendments raise far more questions than they answer. For \nexample, would a court be willing to hear a case alleging a failure by \nthe Congress to fulfill its duties or would a court treat such a \nchallenge as a political question that is beyond its reach? Who would \neven be able to bring a case alleging a violation? Who would the case \nbe brought against and what would the remedies be?\n  Could a judge nullify a budget or a law on the basis that it somehow \nviolated the amendment? Which appropriations bill pushed us over the \nlimit--the last one adopted?\n  Would a judge have the power to put the budget in balance by ordering \nspecific spending cuts? How would those cuts be identified and set? \nWould the judge be tasked with reviewing the entire Federal budget and \nthen making cuts? Would the judge be able to compel Congress to enact \ncuts? What would happen if Congress failed to comply with such an \norder? Does the judge make changes and substitute his or her priorities \nfor those of Congress?\n  These same questions could be asked about revenue increases as well. \nA judge cannot mandate revenue increases under the McConnell amendment. \nThe resolution, apparently, would allow judges to make spending cuts, \nhowever. But that dangerous shift of power to the judiciary arises only \nby implication in the McConnell resolution. What is explicit under \nMcConnell is that taxes and revenues can only be raised by a two-thirds \nvote. So even closing loopholes to end tax dodges and raise revenue \nwould require a supermajority. That is the opposite of a balanced \nbudget amendment provision. That makes it more difficult to balance the \nbudget.\n  The American people do not need new processes or hollow promises. \nThey do not need a constitutional amendment that raises more questions \nthan it answers. They need Congress and the President to do our jobs. A \nbalanced budget amendment will not force Congress and the President to \ndo anything, because it is, as a practical matter, unenforceable. And \nwhen it does not work, public cynicism would only deepen. It already is \nplenty deep. There is only one way to balance the budget. That is with \nthe willpower to make the hard choices. Those of us elected to public \noffice have that obligation now. And if we fail, we as individuals will \nbe judged by our own electorate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport one of the most important pieces of legislation that has come \nbefore this body in decades, Senate Joint Resolution 10, the Hatch-Lee \nbalanced budget amendment proposal.\n  The reason why I insist this is so important is because of a crisis \nwe are facing today. We have accumulated about $15 trillion in \nsovereign debt on behalf of the United States--$15 trillion. It works \nout to about $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. This \nis an amount of money that could represent an expensive car. It could \nrepresent a college education. It could represent all kinds of things. \nBut it represents ultimately debt that Congress has incurred, debt that \nCongress cannot afford to continue to incur at this same rate, which we \nare doing every day. We are adding to that debt at an unsustainable \nrate of about $1.5 trillion every single year.\n  Here is why that is so distressing to me. As the White House itself \nacknowledged a few months ago, we are now within about a decade, \nperhaps much less, of owing about $1 trillion a year just in interest \non our national debt. Currently we are paying a little over $200 \nbillion a year in interest. By the end of this decade, that number is \nlikely to rise to an astounding $1 trillion a year. We could reach that \nnumber much sooner than that. It could happen perhaps in half that \namount of time if interest rates suddenly started to climb, as they \neasily could do, particularly given the fact that we are about 350 \nbasis points below the historic average for yield rates on U.S. \nTreasury instruments, the means by which our governmental debt is \nfinanced.\n  We have to get this problem under control now, because if we wait \nuntil then, until we have to pay $1 trillion a year in interest on our \nnational debt, it will be too late to do anything. By waiting, by \npostponing the day of our accountability, we will have made a choice, a \ndevastating choice, that will prove to signal the downfall of the \ngreatest economy the world has ever known. We cannot allow that to \nhappen--not now, not on our watch, not when the stakes are this high.\n  If we have to make up that difference, the difference between the \n$200 billion a year we are paying now and the trillion a year we will \nhave to be paying in interest on our national debt a few years from \nnow, that money has to come from somewhere. That money is not something \nwe can expect simply to obtain through an increase in taxation.\n  Over the long haul, we have learned that our tax system is capable of \ngenerating a revenue stream equaling a little over 18 percent of all of \nthe revenue that moves through the American economy every single year--\na little over 18 percent of our gross domestic product. As this chart \nshows, that percentage remains relatively constant. It has remained \nthat way for many decades, going back to at least 1960. It averages out \na little over 18 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n  That remains true even when we go back 30 years or so when our top \nmarginal income tax rates were approaching 90 percent. The economy \nfinds a way to produce no more than a little over 18\\1/2\\ percent--a \nlittle over 18 percent of GDP. So we cannot just raise taxes at that \npoint in order to generate more revenue, because our income tax system, \nno matter how we tweak it, no matter how high we raise top marginal \nrates, is not capable of generating that much revenue. What we do when \nwe simply ratchet up those tax rates, if anything, is we shrink the \nsize of our economy. We chill economic growth to the point where we are \nactually generating less revenue, not more. So we cannot tax our way \nout of that problem, nor can we at that point simply borrow our way out \nof that problem. In other words, we cannot borrow an additional $800 \nbillion a year on top of the present-day $1.5 trillion a year we are \nborrowing, because if we did that, our interest rates would go up that \nmuch more. That would make our decision that much more crippling on our \neconomy.\n  There are a lot of reasons why this matters. My colleague from Ohio, \nMr. Portman, acknowledged a few minutes ago that this chills job growth \nwhen we have this much debt. It is also true that this impairs our \nability to fund every conceivable government program from defense to \nentitlements, such that if we wait in order to make the necessary \nchanges to the way we spend money in Washington, we will wait at our \nown peril. We will wait at the peril of those who have become dependent \non those very government programs that will have to have their budgets \nslashed immediately, abruptly, severely. We cannot afford to do that. \nThose who have become dependent on Social Security, on Medicare, on \nMedicaid, on other entitlement programs, on supplemental nutritional \nassistance, would be devastated if all of a sudden we cut off funding \nfor those programs, we had to slash those budgets by 30, 40, 50 percent \novernight. It is these abrupt changes that prove most difficult for \nour economy to absorb.\n\n  I have often said it is something that we can analogize to being on \ntop of a large building. Let's say our $15 trillion debt can be \ncompared to a 15-story building. If you need to get down off of that \nbuilding, you need to get to the ground floor. If you want to do it \nquickly, you could decide to jump. If you decide to jump, it is not the \nfall that will kill you, it is the abrupt halt at the end of that fall. \nSo you need to do something to cushion the fall, to slow it down a \nlittle bit so it can be accomplished gradually, so nobody gets hurt. \nThat is where the balanced budgeted amendment comes in. The Hatch-Lee \nbalanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 10, would bring \nabout severe, significant, systemic changes, but it would do so \ngradually so that the cuts, while significant over the long haul, are \nnot abrupt, so that the impact is not severe, other than avoiding the \nsevereness of the impact that would otherwise occur.\n  We have to get down from that 15-story building, from that $15 \ntrillion debt. We do that through a balanced budget amendment, one like \nSenate Joint Resolution 10, which contains a 5-year delayed \nimplementation clause. That would give us time to work out a phased-in \nglidepath toward balancing our budget. That is what we need do in order \nto protect and preserve our economic stability, our jobs market, and \nour ability within the Federal Government to fund everything from \ndefense to entitlements.\n  Those who ignore the need for this amendment ignore the fact that our \nspending continues to escalate. I want to talk about how much we have \nspent as a country as a percentage of our overall economy, as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product. Between the early 1790s and \nthe early 1930s, the Federal Government spent, on average, between 2 \nand 4 percent of gross domestic product every single year with only two \nnotable exceptions, once during the Civil War and the second time \nduring and in the immediate aftermath of World War I. With those two \nexceptions, Congress's spending was modest, between 2 and 4 percent of \nGDP.\n  That all started to change in the early 1930s when we reached the \ndouble digits during peacetime for the first time in our history. We \nhave, unfortunately, never retreated from that cycle. Federal spending \ntoday, as a percentage of GDP, stands close to 25 percent, meaning that \nfor every dollar that moves through the American economy, a quarter of \nthat goes to Washington, is sucked in by the Federal Government, and \ncannot move on and help to continue to stimulate the economy.\n  That pattern of increased Federal spending as a percentage of GDP is \nexpected to increase in the next few years. It is expected, based on \nthe data provided by the Congressional Budget Office, to reach 26.4 \npercent of GDP within the next 10 years, by 2021. Some say that figure \nis too optimistic and that it could actually be much higher than that, \nit could be significantly higher than 30 percent. At a minimum, we know \nit will be 26.4 percent or more unless we take pretty significant steps \nto control our spending.\n  So I find it interesting that many are saying we do not need to make \nchanges, that we can somehow have Congress do its job, that Congress \nneeds to follow the Constitution and do its job and balance its budget.\n  Let me tell you the problem with that. First of all, there is nothing \ncurrently in the Constitution that restricts Congress's power to borrow \nmoney. Clause 2 of article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives us \npower to do that, and we have done it. We have done it again and again \nand again. We have done it so many times in recent years that we have \nalmost lost track.\n  Congress first placed a statutory limit on the acquisition of new \nFederal debt in 1917, which was the Second Liberty Bond Act. Since \n1962, Congress has altered the debt limit through 74 separate measures, \nand has raised it 10 times since 2001, in the last 10 years.\n  Since 1990, the debt limit has been raised by a total of $10.1 \ntrillion. Nearly half of that increase has occurred in the last 4 \nyears, since late 2007. So this is not a situation in which we are \nseeing the normal growth of government spending, either in normal \nnumbers, in numbers adjusted for inflation, in numbers measured as a \npercentage of GDP. By any metric, the amount of Federal spending and \nthe amount of debt acquisition has grown exponentially, giving us this \nhockey stick-like curve in the acquisition of Federal debt.\n  We cannot continue this practice. We especially cannot continue it \ngiven the fact we know that the natural limit on our ability to receive \nrevenue through the income tax system is a little over 18 percent of \nGDP. So we have to have something in place that keeps us from spending \nmore than we take in. That cannot possibly by accomplished, in my \nopinion, without something that ups the ante, something that makes it \nstructurally more difficult on a permanent basis for Congress to engage \nin deficit spending and to spend more than 18 percent of GDP. That is \nwhy there are a few critical features in Senate Joint Resolution 10, \nthe Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment proposal, that I think any \nviable balanced budget amendment proposal ought to have. First, it \nneeds to apply to all spending. Second, it needs to cap spending at 18 \npercent of GDP. It also needs to require a supermajority vote in order \nto exceed that percentage of GDP spending limit in order to raise taxes \nor in order to raise the debt limit. Without these kinds of provisions, \nthis kind of redundant protection against the inexorable growth of \nFederal spending generally, and the inexorable growth of deficit \nspending in particular, our debt will crush the very programs we \npurport to be protecting.\n  Those who plot against this say we cannot limit spending to 18 \npercent of GDP or else we will hurt program X, Y or Z. While they are \nmaking this argument, it is in reckless disregard of the fact that \nthose same programs will be jeopardized if we continue to borrow \nrecklessly, without structural spending restraint or reform on the \nhorizon.\n  Others have argued we don't need this because somehow it is \nunenforceable. I am not quite sure what they mean. Perhaps they don't \nknow what a court would do with it. They are forgetting we have other \nprovisions in the Constitution that raise the vote threshold, which is \nessentially what the Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment does. In other \nwords, we have other provisions in the Constitution that are followed \nroutinely, without the need for litigation, just based on Members of \nCongress taking an oath to uphold the Constitution, as we are all \nrequired to do pursuant to article VI. Those are complied with every \nday.\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\n  For instance, we all know none of us will dispute the fact that it \ntakes a two-thirds supermajority vote in both Houses of Congress to \noverride a Presidential veto. It takes a two-thirds supermajority vote \nin both Houses of Congress to propose a constitutional amendment. It \ntakes a two-thirds supermajority vote in the Senate to ratify a treaty. \nWe don't dispute the fact that these vote thresholds exist. We don't \nhave to wait for the courts to intervene for us to enforce them within \nCongress. We follow them. That is what this would do.\n  This says that because Congress has the ability to destroy itself, \ndestroy the economy, destroy the very government we have created \nthrough reckless, indefinite, perpetual deficit spending, we must \nprotect Congress from itself--perhaps better said, we must protect \npeople from Congress by requiring that Congress approve any amount of \nmoney spent in excess of what Congress brings in or in excess of 18 \npercent of GDP or in excess of the debt limit by a supermajority vote. \nWe have to have that. It will be followed, and it is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  It is interesting that few, if any, of my colleagues will dispute the \nfact that Congress should balance its budget. There is perhaps a \ndifference of opinion--maybe even a widespread difference of opinion--\nas to how best we should try to close this gap, how best we should \nclose the gap between the money Congress brings in each year through \nthe tax system and the money it spends. There is widespread dispute \nabout where cuts need to be made. I think we all agree we need to \nbalance our budget.\n  That begs the question, if we all agree, as I think we all do, then \nwhy can't we agree we need to adopt a permanent structural mechanism \nthat will be embodied in the Constitution that will ensure that \nactually happens? This proposal remains agnostic as to where cuts will \nbe made. All it says is if we are going to spend more than we take in \nor more than 18 percent of GDP or raise taxes or the debt limit, we are \ngoing to do it by a supermajority vote. That is something the American \npeople support. In fact, 75 percent of the American people support the \nbasic principle that Congress should not, for example, spend more than \nit takes in each and every year.\n  That brings me to the question of why it is that we should support \nS.J. Res. 10, the Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment, and not another \nproposal--for example, S.J. Res. 24, which I might refer to \nalternatively as the ``Trojan horse'' balanced budget amendment or as \nthe ``do nothing'' amendment proposal, which purports to be a solution \nwhen, in fact, it is not, for one simple reason: It gives Congress \nunfettered discretion to exempt itself out of the budget balancing \nrequirement it contains. This would, in effect, I am certain, render \nthis amendment, were it to take effect, virtually a dead letter \nprovision.\n  We have seen what Congress does when it has the option of exempting \nitself out of statutory spending caps--in the pay-go rule, the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings Deficit Control Act, and in other statutory provisions \nsuch as this. Congress giveth and Congress taketh away. Congress has \nbecome a walking, breathing waiver unto itself. When Congress is given \nthe option of saying: I know we are supposed to balance the budget, but \nwe don't feel like it today, it ends up doing that. All Congress would \nhave to do under S.J. Res. 24--the ``do nothing'' amendment proposed--\nis simply acknowledge that the United States is involved in a military \nconflict, and by simple majority vote it can exempt itself out of these \nprovisions entirely.\n  By contrast, the Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment proposal \nacknowledges that in a time of war or military conflict, it may be \nnecessary to spend more than we take in. But in the case of an armed \nmilitary conflict, it requires a three-fifths supermajority vote, and \nin either a war or another armed military conflict, it specifically \nprovides that in that war or conflict, any overage, any amount spent \nabove and beyond what Congress brings in has to be limited to that \nrequired to prosecute that war or that military conflict effort. That \nis a huge difference. We can't simply give Congress the option of \ncomplying with a balanced budget amendment provision only when Congress \nfeels like it. This is a little akin to telling an alcoholic they have \nto give up drinking, while leaving an open container of whiskey on the \ntable and requiring that person to walk past that bottle or even to \ncarry it around every day. It doesn't work. You have to take it out of \nthe house. You certainly have to take it out of the possession of the \nrecovering alcoholic.\n  This is the challenge of our time--to figure out how to prevent \nCongress's chronic abuse of its own borrowing authority from collapsing \nunder its own weight, from bringing about the economic collapse of the \nUnited States of America.\n  We have to have these structural spending reform mechanisms because \nour government is run by imperfect people. Benjamin Franklin has often \nbeen quoted for a line that says: ``He'll cheat without scruple who can \nwithout fear.'' When looking at Congress today, we might say Congress \nwill spend more money than it has whenever it possibly can, whenever it \nhas the option of spending more.\n  As Madison said: ``If men were angels, no government would be \nnecessary. And if angels were to govern men, neither external nor \ninternal controls on government would be necessary.''\n  We are, as human beings, not angels, and our government isn't run by \nangels either. This is why we need the structural permanent spending \nreform mechanism. We cannot afford to accept a substitute, a cheap \nimitation, a ``Trojan horse'' balanced budget amendment such as S.J. \nRes. 24, because if we adopt something such as that, we will create the \nillusion to the American people that we are actually undertaking \nefforts to control our out-of-control deficit spending program when, in \nfact, we are doing nothing. Because it is always the case that we are \ninvolved in a military conflict somewhere. Congress will always be able \nto muster a simple majority, saying we cannot be expected to balance \nour budget because of that.\n  We have to draw that line in the sand and stand for those who support \neverything from defense to entitlements. We have to stand for our \nchildren and our grandchildren, those who will come after them, those \nwho are not yet old enough to vote, those who have not yet been born \nand whose parents have yet to meet. Those people are not here to vote \nagainst us as we spend their money.\n  This is a particularly pernicious form of taxation without \nrepresentation. We fought a war over two centuries ago over that \npractice, and we won that war. We should not subject our children, \ntheir children, and their grandchildren after them to that same \npractice. This is contrary to liberty, contrary to economic prosperity. \nWe cannot stand for it to occur anymore.\n  We have two choices. One choice involves supporting, passing, and \nsubmitting to the States for ratification of the Hatch-Lee balanced \nbudget amendment proposal, putting in some permanent restraint, at long \nlast, on Congress's self-destructive borrowing capacity.\n  The other option can take many forms. It can take the option of \nsupporting S.J. Res. 24, which doesn't solve the underlying problem, or \nit can take the form of doing nothing at all. If we do nothing, we have \nstill made a choice--a devastating choice--a choice that will inure to \nthe detriment of the American people and of the Federal programs that \nwe all rely on, the Federal programs that people rely on to keep them \nsafe, protect them from the ravages of nature, and protect them from \nthe conditions of poverty we seek to avoid in this country. It is, \nafter all, the objective of us all to seek a better, more prosperous, \nmore safe country, but we jeopardize all those interests the longer we \nallow this practice of perpetual deficit spending to continue.\n\n  At the end of the day, we have to face our own constituents. Those \nwho choose not to vote for the Hatch-Lee balanced budget amendment will \nhave to face their constituents and tell them why they were unwilling \nto stand for a proposition so basic as we should balance our budget.\n  There is no excuse, based on the fact that we cannot do this \novernight, because it has a delayed implementation clause. It will not \ntake effect until 5 years after it has been ratified by the States. In \nthe meantime, we will be able to set in motion a sequence of\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nevents, a series of implementing bills that will allow us to put \nourselves on a smooth glidepath toward balancing our budget. We will be \nable to do that. Those who vote against this cannot look their \nconstituents in the eye and tell them they did everything they could do \nto get our out-of-control spending habits or our out-of-control deficit \nspending habits under control.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to do this for themselves, for the \nprograms they want to save, and for their children and grandchildren. \nOur prosperity, our success as Americans, our survival as a nation, and \nthe success of our government requires nothing less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the balanced budget \namendment. It is obvious America's government is spending, taxing, and \nborrowing too much. That is why Congress should approve the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It was a good idea when Thomas \nJefferson supported it, and it is an even better idea today.\n\n  America is a great experiment in self-government. Self-government \nrequires self-control. Early thinkers about America's democracy worried \nabout the capacity of the government to borrow in a way that would \ncripple our freedom.\n  Children cannot vote, but the Congress of their parents can put our \nkids into debt. We should fight fiscal child abuse by ending such \nborrowing that hurts our kids' long-term economic future.\n  In recent days, we witnessed clear warning signs that the days of big \nborrowing are ending, not because Congress has changed its free-\nspending ways but because lenders are increasingly worried that they \nwill never be repaid. This summer, America lost its triple-A credit \nrating, according to Standard & Poor's. This loss of confidence mirrors \na crisis in Europe reflecting a collective judgment that Greece and \nIreland and Portugal and Spain and even Italy may not be able to repay \nthe amount of money they have borrowed. As Prime Minister Thatcher \nreportedly said, ``Eventually governments run out of other people's \nmoney.''\n  In this environment, it is important to show how we are different \nfrom Europe. If we approve the balanced budget amendment and cut \nspending, we will restore confidence in the Federal debt, in America's \neconomy, but most important, in the ideal of self-government.\n  America owes $15 trillion or about $40,000 for each new American \nborn. For their sake, we need to restrict the ability of the current \ngeneration to obligate young Americans to pay their debts.\n  Should this amendment fail, we will wound the long-term credit of the \nUnited States. More deeply, we will hurt the ideal of self-government \nand self-control that is the foundation of our freedom.\n\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  I would like to take this moment to talk about another issue; that \nis, we as Americans support freedom and democracy and the rights of all \npeoples. But, as Gaza taught us in 2006, free elections by themselves \ndo not make up a democracy. There are times when people are offered a \nchance to elect party leaders who offer them only one election to \naffirm a dictatorship. We can also learn from the year 1938 that the \ndangers of ignoring developments abroad are huge. Now, in the wake of \nthe Arab Spring, we turn away from that region at our own peril.\n  On November 28, the first stage of the Egyptian elections began, \nwhich will inaugurate a new electoral system forming a bicameral \nlegislature. This first stage determines about 30 percent of the 498 \nseats for the government's lower chamber, called the People's Assembly.\n  Before Egyptians arrived at the polls, protesters filled Tahrir \nSquare in Cairo. As a result, over 40 Egyptians were killed. Many are \nobjecting to the military's interference in the electoral process and \nthe decision to force elections well before secular parties had time to \nbuild their capacities. According to public polling and sources on the \nground, this will likely hand an electoral victory to the Muslim \nBrotherhood and more radical Islamist elements within the Egyptian \nsociety. Although elections will last until March of 2012, the \nprediction of a Muslim Brotherhood victory is already becoming a \nreality. Early data shows an alarming trend of Islamist domination of \nthe Egyptian Parliament.\n  On December 5, the High Electoral Commission announced that leaders \nof the Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Muslim \nBrotherhood, had received a plurality of 36 percent of the vote, while \nthe secular Egyptian Bloc had gained less than 12 percent. When we \ninclude the runoff elections, which took place last week, it appears \nthat the Muslim Brotherhood has won 73 out of 150 seats or 49 percent \nof the currently contested outcomes. This is the same party that led a \npre-election rally of 5,000 chanting ``one day we shall kill all the \nJews'' and ``Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Judgment Day is coming.''\n  While many expected the Brotherhood to do well, there were other \nsurprises. Salafist parties, made up of anti-Western hardliners who \nfollow a particularly radical version of Islam, are also faring \nparticularly well. Surpassing predictions, they received 24 percent of \nthe vote in the first round.\n  Importantly, these elections also included the so-called liberal \ndistricts of Cairo and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The \nweakness of liberal parties--namely, their inability to reach out to \nvoters effectively with a serious agenda--is now fully exposed. \nIslamists are taking full advantage of deeply rooted networks that \nextend from the mosques into Egypt's poor districts. Their grip in the \ntraditionally conservative areas of Alexandria proved particularly \ntight, and these areas are also home to a majority of the Coptic \nChristian community.\n  It is clear that if Islamist parties and candidates continue their \ncurrently won gains in other elections, they will capture 60 percent of \nthe national vote in Egypt. This will situate the new Egyptian \nParliament around deep ideological differences between Salafis, the \nMuslim Brotherhood, and liberal groups, making the Brotherhood the \npower brokers between Egyptian left and right.\n  What does this all mean? By January, the United States could face an \nEgypt defined by a hatred of Israel and many of the freedoms we hold \ndear--a freedom of expression, of women's rights, and the right to \npractice any religion. This Egypt counts Iran as a friend and poses a \nthreat to the Camp David Peace Accords, which have served as the \ncornerstone for Egypt's strategic position for 30 years.\n  Do we expect that an Islamist-led Egypt will prevent weapons from \narriving in the hands of Hamas? Will an Islamist-led Egypt help \npreserve a free South Sudan? Will an Islamist-led Egypt act to protect \nCoptic Christians who make up about 10 percent of Egypt? Will we see \ncontinued violence, as we saw on October 9 in Maspero, which killed 27 \ncivilians and injured hundreds? Will an Islamist-led Egypt do what we \nexpect with more than $1 billion of U.S. foreign assistance? Will they \ncontinue to share intelligence and to work against terrorism? These are \nall questions that may become critical issues for the national security \nof the United States very shortly.\n  All of this instantly prevents foreign investment and tourism that \nwould help the Egyptian economy. The IMF has forecasted a little over 1 \npercent growth for the Egyptian economy next year. They said inflation \nwill top 11 percent, while almost 12 percent of Egyptians will be out \nof work. Recently, the Egyptian pound traded at its lowest level \nagainst the dollar in 7 years.\n  This time last year the region was on the threshold of exciting \nchange, but today Egypt sits instead on the threshold of a very \ndangerous path.\n  The United States--and especially our State Department in \nparticular--should do what it can to keep Egypt attached to peace and \ngood relations with the West. The United States is now on the verge of \na historic defeat and reversal of American interests in Egypt. \nCurrently, if there is an Obama administration plan for handling a new \nIslamist Egypt that rejects peace with\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nIsrael and allies with Iran, I don't know it, and I don't know if \nanyone does. We must keep our finger on the pulse of this process. \nLiberal voices in Egypt must work to preserve the democratic goals of \nthe January revolution.\n\n  Recently, I had the privilege of meeting some of Egypt's best and \nbrightest young liberal leaders. They would like to build a free Egypt \nthat respects women's rights and religious minorities and the rule of \nlaw. I was encouraged in meeting with them but only hope that the \ncoming election is not like a 1930s election in Germany, where people \nin Egypt are given one choice--to affirm a dictatorship--and then that \nis the end.\n  If a radical Islamic government arises in Egypt--one that disavows \nthe Camp David Peace Accords and no longer acts as a stable strategic \npartner in the Middle East--then we will look back on the recent \nelection in Egypt and its successors in December and January as the \nturning point for a historic reversal of the United States.\n  My hope is that the State Department watches this very carefully. My \nhope is that we have a plan to make sure this critical country stays \nwithin the U.S. orbit. But my fear, given the recent elections in \nEgypt, is that we have already lost quite a bit of ground.\n  If current trends continue, then by the middle of next year we will \nhave a Muslim Brotherhood government in command of the Suez Canal, in \ncharge of Cairo--the second center of learning in the Arab world--along \nthe border of our Israeli allies, friendly to Hamas, friendly to Iran, \nand hostile to Europe and the United States. My hope is that over the \nholidays we will work very hard and diligently with our allies--and \nespecially liberal forces in Egypt--to make sure that reversal doesn't \nhappen.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill just passed by House Republicans \ntonight is a pointless, partisan exercise. The bill is dead on arrival. \nIt was dead before it got to the Senate. The Senate will not pass it. \nThe sooner we demonstrate that, the sooner we can begin serious \ndiscussions on how to keep taxes from going up on middle-class \nAmericans. Democrats were ready to vote tonight to prove that the bill \nwas DOA, dead on arrival. But I spoke to Minority Leader McConnell this \nevening, and he told me he will need more time. He will not be able to \nmake a decision until tomorrow morning on when to vote on the House-\npassed bill. I cannot set the vote without his approval at this time.\n  This is a 180-degree change in his position from just a few hours \nago. Just this morning, Senator McConnell said we should ``take up the \nHouse bill, pass it right here in the Senate, and send it to the \nPresident for signature without theatrics and without delay.'' That is \na direct quote. I repeat, he said we should vote on this bill ``without \ndelay.''\n  He is correct, and I can only wonder what happened in the last 8 \nhours to change his position so dramatically, so radically. As I said, \nwe already know this bill is dead. We need to begin real negotiations \non how to prevent a $1,000 tax hike on American families. The sooner we \nget this vote, the sooner those negotiations can begin in earnest.\n  I will speak with Senator McConnell again tomorrow to determine how \nsoon we can hold this vote--an exercise in futility. Work continues \ntoward finalizing an omnibus to fund the government for the rest of the \nyear. In the meantime we should not hold up this middle-class tax cut.\n  On January 1, every American worker will have less money. In fact, \n160 million American workers will have less money to spend on groceries \nand gas and rent unless Congress acts on their behalf.\n  T.S. Eliot said it about as good as I could figure a way to say it, \nwhen he said: ``Hurry up please, it's time.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8540-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a long-time friend \nand a hero to veterans and to those who believe in justice in Ohio: \nFrank Anderson, a long-time leader of paralyzed veterans in Ohio, who \npassed away last week from complications of an infection.\n  Frank was a friend and a trusted advocate. He always spoke eloquently \nabout issues facing veterans and people living with disabilities.\n  Confined to a wheelchair as a paraplegic for the overwhelming \nmajority of his adult life, Frank was soft spoken, yet larger than \nlife, with a commanding presence.\n  As a leader of the Buckeye Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans \nAssociation, he drove himself to veterans events across Ohio.\n  He spoke out against inequality in disability pay--and the barriers \nthat face disabled veterans, from health care to transit accessibility, \nto economic opportunity.\n  He was a strong advocate for the Americans with Disabilities Act. He \nfought to ensure housing was affordable and accessible for all \nAmericans.\n  He testified in front of Congress on issues facing veterans in rural \nareas and would return that night to Cleveland to fight for veterans in \ncities.\n  He would always do so the right way--prepared in facts and figures, \narmed with anecdotes and stories.\n  Born in Cleveland in 1953, Frank Anderson graduated from East Tech \nHigh in 1971.\n  In 1976, he left Bowling Green State University to enlist in the Ohio \nArmy National Guard's 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment.\n  In 1981, Frank was paralyzed after an 18-wheeler crashed into an Ohio \nNational Guard convoy he was traveling in. He recovered and rehabbed at \nwhat is now the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center in Cleveland, meeting \nother disabled veterans--hearing their stories, learning from them, all \nbecoming advocates charged with helping veterans.\n  While taking away his ability to walk for the rest of his life, the \nexperience strengthened his will to serve and to live his life on his \nterms.\n  He remained active in wheelchair sports--playing tennis, lifting \nweights, and throwing a discus and a javelin.\n  He became a longtime leader for all Americans with disabilities and \nbecame a trusted leader in the African-American community.\n  He embraced life's challenges. He made the world better for all of \nus--even dressing as Santa for children at the Cleveland Clinic's \nChildren's Hospital.\n  He traveled the country. He cooked his favorite seafood. He listened \nto his favorite old rhythm and blues music.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nFrank Anderson's obituary from the Cleveland Plain Dealer and a letter \nabout Frank's life from Bill Lawson, president of the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Dec. 8, 2011]\n\n                           (By Grant Segall)\n\n       East Cleveland.--Crashing into an Ohio National Guard \n     convoy, an 18-wheeler paralyzed Frank W. Anderson in 1981 and \n     inspired him to become a statewide leader for disabled \n     veterans.\n       Anderson, 58, died Tuesday, Dec. 6, at the Stokes Cleveland \n     VA Medical Center from complications of an infection.\n       ``He was a guiding light,'' said Ray Saikus, president of \n     the Joint Veterans Commission of Cuyahoga County, whose first \n     vice president was Anderson. ``He was well-versed, respectful \n     and assertive about issues.''\n       Among many roles, Anderson was government relations \n     director for the Paralyzed Veterans Association's Buckeye \n     Chapter. Buckeye President Carl Harris said, ``He was very \n     effective. He did his homework. We didn't just go in and say, \n     `Do something\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n     about this and figure it out.' We always had ideas on, `You \n     could do it this way and that way.' ''\n       Anderson spoke about many problems, from illegal parking in \n     spaces for the handicapped to inequities in disability pay. \n     ``There should be a standard rate for all veterans across the \n     U.S.,'' he told The Plain Dealer in 2008.\n       Despite paraplegia, he drove himself and wheeled his chair \n     to countless veterans' events. ``We do this in remembrance,'' \n     he said in 1993. ``We want our children to be proud of what \n     we did for this country.''\n       Anderson was born in Cleveland and graduated East Tech High \n     in 1971. In 1976, he left Bowling Green State University and \n     enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard's 107th Armored \n     Cavalry Regiment. He was on active duty in Michigan when \n     paralyzed. He was discharged the next year as a sergeant.\n       He joined the Paralyzed Veterans' Buckeye board in 1985, \n     then switched to a paid job in 1987 as the group's advocacy \n     director. He was also vice president of the Memorial Day \n     Association of Greater Cleveland and a commissioner of Ohio \n     Rehabilitation Services.\n       He belonged to the Governor's Council on People with \n     Disabilities, ADA Ohio Network, Maximum Accessible Housing of \n     Ohio, and Greater Cleveland RTA Citizens Advisory Board. As a \n     trustee of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, he took charge \n     of getting it a wheelchair lift.\n       Anderson often played Santa at what's now the Cleveland \n     Clinic Children's Hospital. He liked to cook seafood, travel \n     around the country and listen to music, especially old rhythm \n     and blues.\n       Frank William Anderson, 1953-2011.

We were informed by the Buckeye Chapter \n     that Frank passed away in the early morning hours of December \n     6, 2011.\n       Frank was the consummate advocate for people with \n     disabilities known throughout the greater Cleveland area and \n     Ohio as a vigorous and articulate spokesman on behalf of \n     disability rights.\n       For Frank no effort was too small nor challenge too large \n     if it would benefit the greater disability community and he \n     should be remembered as a leader in the fight to secure \n     passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. A mentor to \n     his fellow Chapter Government Relations Directors and the \n     2010 recipient of the Richard Fuller Outstanding Achievement \n     in Government Relations Award, Frank exemplified the active \n     member devoted to the goals of Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n       Frank leaves behind a community that is better for his \n     efforts. On behalf of all of PVA, we extend our deepest \n     sympathies to his many friends, colleagues, and most \n     specifically, his loving wife Joanne and family.\n       Once PVA executive offices receive pertinent memorial \n     service information from the Buckeye Chapter, we will forward \n     to you.

WEDDLE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand today to honor an exemplary \nKentuckian and patriot, Mr. Leo F. Weddle of Somerset, KY. Mr. Weddle \nis a veteran of the Korean war; he selflessly served our Nation as a \nmachine-gunner during that conflict.\n  In 1950, just 3 years after graduating high school, Leo decided to \nenlist in the Marines, an idea he had already given considerable \nthought to. Leo was inspired one day by the obvious pride and glamour \nthat was exhibited by a young marine in uniform whom Leo saw from the \nwindow of his Greyhound bus as Leo was traveling home to Somerset, KY, \nfrom his sister's house in Beaumont, TX. It was at that exact moment, \nsomewhere in a small Arkansas town, that Leo decided to enlist to serve \nhis country.\n  After his introduction into the Marine Corps, Leo spent the next \nseveral months enduring the rigors of boot camp in Parris Island, SC, \nand combat training at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, CA. When combat \ntraining concluded, Leo and his unit boarded the troopship USS General \nWilliam Weigel. Leo's unit eventually landed in Yokuska, Japan, after 2 \nweeks at sea.\n  On June 5, 1951, the day Leo arrived in Korea, he was immediately \ntransported to the front line for combat, where he joined George \nCompany, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Division, later nicknamed ``Bloody \nGeorge.'' Leo's unit was under heavy fire from the moment he arrived. \n``They had just lost a machine gunner and were asking for a \nvolunteer,'' he said. ``Fools really do rush in where angels fear to \ntread, and I volunteered for the position. I served as a machine gunner \nfor the duration of my time in Korea.''\n  On September 21, 1951, Leo was wounded by a mortar that killed two \nofficers and six enlisted men. Ironically, to Leo, the shell exploded \ncloser to him than any other person, but the shrapnel propelled from it \nthat hit him only left small pieces of metal in his legs and head. \nThose farther away were hit with larger pieces of metal that inflicted \nmore severe, even fatal injuries. Six decades later, Leo still has \nfragments of the mortar in has legs and forehead.\n  Today at 77 years of age, Leo feels blessed to be able to look back \non his wartime experiences as a veteran who has since lead a healthy \nand successful life. ``I recall vividly many images of the horrors of \nwar,'' Leo says, ``but I also remember my fellow Marines, courageous \nyoung men with whom I shared the most intense life-and-death \nexperiences most of us would ever face.''\n  Leo was so inspired by these experiences that he wrote a poem while \nhe was still in Korea to help him share the love and appreciation for \nAmerica he felt half a world away. Leo believes he may never have had \nthe opportunity to truly express these feelings had he not had the \nopportunity to serve his country in battle as he did.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in \nthanking Mr. Leo F. Weddle, a valiant Kentucky veteran, for his courage \nand selflessness in fighting to preserve our country's freedom. Mr. \nWeddle is an honorable man whose sacrifice and lifelong success serve \nas an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth. The \nCommonwealth Journal, a Somerset-area publication, recently published \nan article written by Mr. Weddle recounting his time as a U.S. marine. \nI ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Commonwealth Journal, November 11, 2011]\n\n                          A Veteran Remembers\n\n                           (By Leo F. Weddle)\n\n       In 1950, three years after my high-school graduation, the \n     Korean War was under way and I had given considerable thought \n     to joining the service. One beautiful autumn day I\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n     was riding a Greyhound bus from my sister's home in Beaumont, \n     Texas, to my hometown of Somerset, KY.\n       Somewhere along the way, in a small town in Arkansas, I saw \n     from the window a young Marine, resplendent in his dress blue \n     uniform. The glamour of that uniform and the obvious pride of \n     the man wearing it captivated me. At that moment I decided to \n     volunteer for the Marines, and I did so as soon as I arrived \n     in Somerset.\n       After my introduction into the Marine Corps, I endured \n     weeks of stress and intimidation in boot camp at Parris \n     Island, South Carolina, followed by combat training at Camp \n     Pendleton in Oceanside, California. After completing my \n     training, my unit boarded a troopship, the USS General \n     William Weigel, and after two weeks at sea, we landed in \n     Yokuska, Japan.\n       On June 5, 1951, I arrived in Korea and became a member of \n     George Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Division, later \n     nicknamed ``Bloody George.'' The day I arrived, I was \n     transported to the front line and immediately entered combat. \n     My unit was under heavy fire. They had just lost a machine \n     gunner and were asking for a volunteer. Fools really do rush \n     in where angels fear to tread, and I volunteered for the \n     position. I served as a machine gunner for the duration of my \n     time in Korea.\n       Minutes after I arrived on the line, a mortar shell hit a \n     few feet from me. Luckily, it turned out to be a dud. If it \n     had exploded, I would almost certainly have been killed on my \n     first day of battle. As it was, I was wounded by another \n     mortar a few months later, on September 21, 1951. We were on \n     Hill 751, which came to be known as ``Starvation Hill.''\n       For three days and three nights, the fighting was so \n     intense that our Korean supply carriers could only bring \n     ammunition. Food was a lower priority in this situation than \n     the much-needed ammo, so we had to make do with what we had \n     until the shelling diminished.\n       A friend of mine was hit, and I climbed out of my foxhole \n     to help him. While I was out of the foxhole, a mortar shell \n     came in. It killed two officers and wounded six enlisted men. \n     The irony of the situation was that the mortar landed closer \n     to me than to anyone else, but the explosion propelled \n     shrapnel that embedded only small pieces of metal in my legs \n     and head, while dispersing larger pieces to the men who were \n     killed or more seriously wounded.\n       The mind is a strange and wonderful thing. If I close my \n     eyes, even to this day, I can still see the dirt, debris and \n     shrapnel exploding as clearly as I could at the moment it \n     happened. Fifty-five years later, I still have small \n     fragments of that mortar in my legs and forehead. During the \n     months that I served in Korea, I saw great acts of courage by \n     my fellow Marines as they dealt with the brutality and mayhem \n     of war. I came to realize that heroism often involves \n     reacting to a situation in a way that seems to be most \n     expedient at a given moment.\n       I recall many images of the horrors of war, of course, but \n     I also remember my fellow Marines, courageous young men with \n     whom I shared the most intense life-and-death experiences \n     most of us would ever face.\n       While I was still in combat in Korea, I wrote the following \n     poem. My experiences there gave me a love and appreciation \n     for America that I might never have been able to express had \n     I not had the opportunity to serve my country in this way.\n       Today I am 77 years old and looking back on my own wartime \n     experiences from the vantage point of a healthy and \n     successful life. I hear the stories of today's young Marines \n     who are risking their bodies and lives for the same \n     principles that motivated me and my comrades in Korea so many \n     years ago. For any soldier or Marine who serves his country \n     in time of any war, I believe this poem expresses the love \n     and pride that he feels for his homeland, the United States.\n\n                           Mr. You and Mr. Me\n\n     What is America? I ask myself,\n     It is happiness, contentment, success and wealth,\n     With a touch of hardship, dirt and grime,\n     Mixed together with work and time,\n     Is Mr. You or Mr. Me?\n\n     America is a sweetheart, modest and dear,\n     It's high school and college, or a cheerleader's cheer.\n     It's a bright hello or a sad good-bye,\n     It's all these things and much more too,\n     That go into making the Red, White and Blue.\n\n     America is football, baseball and track,\n     Or just a little afternoon snack.\n     It's a drive in the country, a walk into town,\n     or just a policeman making his round.\n     It's a chocolate sundae or a picture show\n     That forms the pattern of this land we know.\n\n     It's Mom and Dad--Sister too,\n     And a little brother, or me and you.\n     It's Brooklyn and Jersey, the Dodgers and Phils,\n     Or a beautiful river with valleys and hills.\n     But it takes these things and the heavens above\n     To make our America, the land we love.\n\n     It's barefoot boys who skip school for fishing,\n     And pigtailed girls who tag along, wishing.\n     It's the old and the young, the brave and the true,\n     But mostly America is made up of you.\n     It's what you believe and what you can see\n     That count in this land of democracy.\n\n     The names of Washington, Lincoln and Jones,\n     The Tom Smiths, Dick Phillips, and Harry Malones\n     Are parts of America we see every day\n     As we walk along its crowded highway.\n     Yes, all of these things we daily see,\n     Until they are a part of you and me.\n\n     America is brown, yellow and white,\n     With a touch of red, it's quite a sight,\n     For we are a mixture from many lands\n     Who believe in liberty and freedom's stands,\n     And we back up this faith with blood and tears\n     Shed by patriots throughout the years.\n\n     It's soldiers, sailors, pilots, Marines,\n     Who make up our nation's fighting machines.\n     It's ``blood and guts'' when the time demands,\n     For freedom's cause we take our stands.\n     It's all America, just one big show,\n     Of the things we do and the things we know.\n\n     It's our faith in God to do His will,\n     Our belief that we have His protection still,\n     That makes America strong and free,\n     It's a wonderful place for you and me.\n     And though many places our feet may roam,\n     May they safely return us to our home,\n     America.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8542-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8542-S8543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TOM BIRCH\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor and privilege \nfor me to congratulate Thomas L. Birch, the legislative counsel and \nfounding director, of the National Child Abuse Coalition, for his \ndecades of service to children.\n  After more than 30 years as head of the coalition, Tom is retiring. \nMr. Birch established the National Child Abuse Coalition three decades \nago as a way to focus greater attention on the more than 700,000 \nchildren who are abused and neglected each year.\n  From his earliest days, Tom was inspired to make a difference in the \nlives of some of our most vulnerable children and families. His \ninterest was first peaked as a high school student working at a public \nhousing project in Stamford, CT. He noticed that not all kids had the \nsame opportunity and that not all children had the same start at life. \nHis experiences also demonstrated that with the right kind of support, \nwe could make a difference in these young lives. We could even the \nplaying field.\n  Tom continued on to college and became an attorney, but when he \nreached Washington, he brought with him that same passion to make a \ndifference. We all talk about how important children are to this \ncountry's future, but Tom felt you had to do more than just say that--\nhe had to act. He began his new job on Capitol Hill working for the \nchair of what we now call the HELP Committee, under Senator Walter \nMondale. In fact, the week Tom Birch started his work for the future \nVice President, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA, \nwas signed into law. He would continue advocating for children and the \nprevention of child abuse by working on the staffs of Senator Paul \nSimon and Congressman John Brademas.\n  When Tom ended his career as a Capitol Hill staffer he moved on but \ndidn't move away from his main mission in life: to continue to make a \ndifference for the most vulnerable children in the land. He formed a \ncoalition to focus attention on preventing the abuse and neglect of \nchildren. In 1981 the National Child Abuse Coalition was created under \nthe leadership of Mr. Birch. His pride and constant inspiration has \nbeen to shape the growth of CAPTA, and that, too, would be the mission \nof the coalition he founded.\n  Because of Tom Birch's efforts, more than 30 national member \norganizations, working through the coalition, have been able to \ncoordinate and strengthen their Federal advocacy on behalf of the \nmillions of vulnerable children. Through this time period Tom has \ncontributed to important developments, including the creation of \nchildren's trust funds across the States; the establishment of national \nchild abuse data; greater focus on community-based solutions, including \nthe community-based grants to prevent child abuse and neglect; and more \nrecently he and the coalition were an important voice of support for \nthe new home visitation program enacted by Congress in 2010.\n  Through his leadership the coalition has also served as an advocate \nin the appropriations process for CAPTA and similar programs such as \nthe Social Services Block Grant, SSBG, and the Promoting Safe and \nStable Families\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nProgram, PSSF. When opportunities have arisen he has worked to \nhighlight ways to strengthen programs such as Head Start and childcare \nto make sure the country took every opportunity to address child \nneglect and to prevent it.\n  Others have recognized Mr. Birch's contributions, including the \nAmerican Psychological Association, which honored him in 2003 with \ntheir Award for Distinguished Contribution to Child Advocacy. Later in \n2006 Casey Family Programs honored Tom again by giving him their \nLeadership Award.\n  I want to join the many others in recognizing Tom Birch. These days \nwe talk a great deal about lobbyists and special interests in \nWashington, DC, but there are certain groups of people here in \nWashington you don't hear about. They won't be featured on the evening \nnews or the front page of the newspaper. These are the men and women \nwho patiently and quietly walk these halls to tell the stories of \nvulnerable children. These people do it not to get rich or to promote \nthe fortunes of the powerful; they work on behalf of our most \nvulnerable. Tom is one of these people, an unsung hero who has made a \ntrue difference for vulnerable children. It has been a job well done \nfor Tom. I hope his retirement is successful and rewarding in every way \nhe wishes it to be, and I thank him very much for all the contributions \nhe has made to the lives of all the most vulnerable children all across \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8543-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, in Texas, football and team loyalty is \na key part of our identity. Today, I know that Baylor University \nstudents, alumni, and fans--known as the Baylor Nation--are bursting \nwith pride over the first Bear to win the Heisman Trophy. Robert \nGriffin III was named the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner for his incredible \naccomplishments on the football field. Baylor finished this season \nranked No. 15 nationally with a 9 to 3 record which included impressive \nvictories over nationally ranked TCU, Oklahoma, and Texas. While Baylor \nand Big 12 fans have witnessed Griffin's football prowess, many more \nAmerican sports fans will have the opportunity to watch him lead the \nBears in the Valero Alamo Bowl on December 29, 2011.\n  But it is not only his football talent that makes Robert such a \nremarkable young man. RG3, as he is known to his friends and fans, is \nthe consummate student-athlete. An honor roll student at Baylor, he \ngraduated with a degree in political science in only 3 years with a \n3.67 GPA. While he was leading the Bears this year on the gridiron, he \nwas studying for his master's degree in communications, and he has \nindicated that he would like to attend law school as well.\n  Robert's career at Baylor balances academics and athletics and should \nserve as a role model for other aspiring young athletes. The discipline \nto succeed was instilled in him at a very early age by his parents, \nRobert, Jr., and Jacqueline Griffin, both Army noncommissioned \nofficers, who laid the groundwork for his strong work ethic. A graduate \nof Copperas Cove High School just outside Ft. Hood, Robert was a three-\nsport star athlete--he still owns Texas' High School State records for \nthe 110-meter and 300-meter hurdles--and a top student.\n  Throughout his career at Baylor, Robert set 52 school records in \npassing, rushing, and total offense. He has thrown for an incredible \n10,070 yards, and 77 touchdowns, while rushing for 2,220 yards and 32 \ntouchdowns. During his impressive 2011 Heisman winning season, Robert \npassed for almost 4,000 yards and 36 touchdowns, while rushing for 655 \nyards and 7 touchdowns. He also earned the Davey O'Brien Award, \npresented annually to the best NCAA quarterback.\n  On Saturday, December 10, 2011, Robert Griffin III was recognized as \nthe greatest college football player of the year. The Heisman Trophy is \nthe most prestigious and coveted award in college sports, and no one is \nmore deserving of this honor than Robert Griffin III.\n  Congratulations to Robert Griffin III on an incredible season; to his \nfamily, who provided the foundation for his abilities; to his teammates \nand the entire Baylor Nation. This is truly a storybook ending to a \ntremendous season.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on December 10, the most prestigious \nsports fraternity in the country welcomed its newest member, Baylor \nUniversity's Robert Griffin III, as the 77th winner of the Heisman \nMemorial Trophy. Griffin is Baylor's first recipient of the Heisman \nTrophy and the first player from the school to be named a finalist for \nthe award since quarterback Don Trull finished fourth in 1963. The son \nof two retired U.S. Army sergeants, Griffin led the 15th ranked Baylor \nBears to a 9 to 3 record and their second straight bowl appearance. The \nBig 12 Offensive Player of the Year has energized the football program \nand helped to end Baylor's 16-year absence from bowl games.\n  Hailing from Copperas Cove, TX, Griffin put up spectacular numbers, \ncompleting 72 percent of his passes for 3,998 yards with 36 touchdown \npasses. He also led the Nation in passing efficiency with a rating of \n192.3, which broke the single-season Football Bowl Series record. On \ntop of his impressive passing statistics, Griffin averaged 4.0 yards \nper carry for 644 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground. Although \nGriffin is only a junior, he holds 46 of Baylor's career offensive \nrecords including passing yards, passing touchdowns, and rushing \ntouchdowns by a quarterback. While leading Baylor to one of its \ngreatest seasons in history, he helped accomplish other important \nfirsts for the program. After winning a combined 4 games in November \nduring their first 15 seasons in the Big 12, Griffin guided the Bears \nto a perfect 4 to 0 record in the same month, with 3 of the wins \nagainst rivals Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech. The late-season victory \nover Oklahoma marked the first time in school history that Baylor was \nable to defeat the mighty Sooners.\n  Robert Griffin's skills are not limited to the football field. In \naddition to being an All-American in the 400-meter hurdles, Griffin is \nalso a model student. He completed his undergraduate work in 3 years \nwith a 3.67 GPA, earning a bachelor's degree in political science, and \nis currently working on a master's degree in communications. Griffin \nalso plans to earn a law degree. I applaud his commitment to excellence \nin both academics and athletics.\n  Today, I join with my colleagues, and Robert's friends and family, \nincluding his parents, Robert Jr. and Jacqueline Griffin, in \ncelebrating this fine achievement. Robert Griffin joins a special class \nof Texas athletes who are also Heisman Trophy winners: TCU's Davey \nO'Brien, SMU's Doak Walker, Texas A's John David Crow, the University \nof Houston's Andre Ware, and the University of Texas's Earl Campbell \nand Ricky Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8543-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8543-S8544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THE LONG FAMILY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Long \nfamily for earning the distinction of 2011's Arkansas Farm Family of \nthe Year.\n  This honor reflects Heath and Betsy Long's dedication to farming and \nthe importance of agriculture as Arkansas's No. 1 industry. As owners \nof Long Planting Company, a rice, soybean, and wheat operation of more \nthan 2,200 acres of land, the couple has taken advantage of technology \nand improved farming efficiency while expanding their farm.\n  Heath has devoted his life to farming, spending his childhood on the \nfarm and earning a degree in agriculture from Arkansas State \nUniversity. As a fourth-generation farmer, his commitment to the \nagriculture industry has helped his farm as well as other farms within \nthe State, as he serves as the vice president of the Arkansas County \nFarm Bureau board of directors and a member of the Arkansas and USA \nrice councils.\n  The Arkansas Farm Bureau's program honors farm families across the\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nState for their outstanding work both on their farms and in their \ncommunities. This recognition is a reflection of the contribution to \nagriculture at the community and State level and its implications for \nimproved farm practices and management. The Longs are well deserving of \nthis honor.\n  I congratulate Heath and Betsy and their daughters, Shelby and \nSydney, for their outstanding achievements in agriculture and ask my \nfellow colleagues to join me in honoring them for this accomplishment. \nI wish them continued success in their future endeavors and look \nforward to the contributions they will offer in the future to Arkansas \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8544-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE RISKA\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nreflect on the career of the executive director of the Delaware Nature \nSociety, Michael E. Riska. Mike is retiring this year after serving as \nexecutive director for 28 wonderful years spent opening the minds and \nhearts of Delawareans young and old to the splendor of our natural \nworld.\n  Mike Riska attended West Chester University and earned a bachelor of \nscience with a double major in biology and physical education. He also \nearned his master's in education in Natural Science from the University \nof Delaware. He is a certified teacher in biology, general science, \nhealth, and physical education.\n  Truly devoted to educating students in the natural sciences, Mike \nbegan his career as a teacher at the Tatnall School in Greenville, DE. \nHe taught science to students in the first through eighth grades and \ntaught eight 5-week upper-school marine ecology courses based on \nSanibel Island, FL.\n  Mike took his love of science and education to the Delaware Nature \nSociety in 1969, where he started as a part-time instructor and youth \nprograms director. He was part of the initiative to transform the H.B. \nDuPont Farm into a learning environment for students across Delaware. \nFor my first job, as a seventh grader, I was hired by Mike to assist \nother Delaware youngsters in building the trails that would soon become \nAshland Nature Center. Every year thousands of students, including my \nown children, attend summer camps and class field trips at the Ashland \nNature Center, where they learn about nature, ecology, and \nconservation.\n  Mike Riska was appointed to executive director of the Delaware Nature \nSociety in 1984, just the third person to serve in this capacity. With \nMike at the helm, the Delaware Nature Society earned record donations \nfor furthering its mission of fostering understanding, appreciation, \nand enjoyment of the natural world through education. The society also \nworked to preserve ecologically significant areas and advocate \nstewardship and conservation of natural resources.\n  Mike has been recognized with several awards, including the Nature \nConservancy Lifetime Conservation Achievement Award in 1997, an \nExceptional Leadership Award from the Association of Nature Center \nAdministrators' Board of Directors in 1999, and the 1999 President's \nAward of Association of Nature Center Administrators for dedication and \nservice to the nature center profession. The Association of Nature \nCenter Administrators recognized him as the recipient of its 2002 \nLeadership Award.\n  Mike has worked closely with several other Delaware nature \nconservancy organizations and is admired and respected by his peers. \nAndrew Manus, director of conservation programs of the Delaware Chapter \nof the Nature Conservancy, said:\n\n       Let me add my voice of congratulations to others who have \n     benefitted from the years of dedicated service that Mike \n     Riska has brought to conservation in Delaware. The Delaware \n     Nature Society has been well served by his leadership, as has \n     the greater conservation community in Delaware. Mike's \n     thoughtful advocacy for the natural world in Delaware will be \n     his endearing legacy for us all to enjoy.\n\n  Roger L. Jones, State director of the Delaware Chapter of the Nature \nConservancy, stated:\n\n       Mike Riska's legacy is very simple--he instilled a passion \n     for nature and a boundless commitment for protecting our \n     environment within thousands of people in Delaware.\n\n  Lorraine Fleming, 2005 Delaware Audubon Conservation Award recipient, \nsaid:\n\n       Natural science and environmental education is Mike Riska's \n     first love. It has been the foundation for his visionary \n     leadership of the Delaware Nature Society over 28 years as \n     executive director and before that as assistant director. \n     Recognition and cultivation of staff and volunteers is Mike's \n     natural strength. While he is always quick to give credit to \n     his staff members and the society's large cadre of \n     volunteers, the overall direction and support for DNS' \n     accomplishments has consistently come from Mike. Mike's \n     legacy is an enduring preeminent Delaware environmental \n     organization that is nationally renowned among nature \n     centers.\n\n  Mr. President, today I honor Mike Riska's legacy and accomplishments \nat the Delaware Nature Society. It is an honor to call him my first \nboss, a fellow advocate, and my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8544-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       KATHERINE BOMKAMP AND WVU\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President. I wish to recognize Katherine \nBomkamp, a promising sophomore at West Virginia University, WVU, who \ninvented a new prosthesis that reduces phantom pain for amputees, \nincluding many returning veterans. Last month, she was in New York City \nbeing honored by Glamour magazine as one of its ``21 Amazing Young \nWomen of 2011,'' to celebrate the 21st anniversary of its Women of the \nYear awards.\n  At the age of 16, following frequent visits to Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center while her father was stationed at the Pentagon with the \nU.S. Air Force, Katherine conceptualized the ``pain free socket,'' a \nprosthetic device that combats the phantom limb pain experienced by 80 \npercent of amputees. After two-and-a-half years of research, Katherine \nis now at West Virginia University, where the WVU Entrepreneurship \nCenter is helping her obtain a patent for the device and find funding \nto make it available for injured veterans and other patients. The WVU \nEntrepreneurship Center is playing an important role in helping \nKatherine commercialize the ``pain free socket.'' It is a great example \nof how America's research universities are supporting innovative \nentrepreneurs, whose ideas are vital to economic growth today.\n  Ms. Bomkamp didn't just sit on the sidelines and feel sorrow for the \nafflicted men and women she encountered at Walter Reed. She listened to \ntheir stories and learned that many amputees experienced phantom pain, \nthe feeling of pain in an absent limb.\n  By researching the topic, Katherine found that no medications have \nbeen approved for specifically treating phantom pain. Instead, many \namputees are prescribed antipsychotics and barbiturates, treatments \nthat can be expensive and highly addictive.\n  For a 10th-grade science project, Katherine decided to leap into \naction. She created the ``Pain Free Socket,'' incorporating thermal \nbiofeedback into prosthetics to eliminate phantom pain in amputees. \nPhantom pain is caused by the brain continuing to send signals and \ncommands to the limb. Bomkamp's device would help force the brain to \nfocus on the heat produced through thermal biofeedback, rather than \nsending signals to the nonexistent limb.\n  Katherine Bomkamp deserves our praise and educational enrichment. She \nwas the first WVU student to be inducted into the National Museum of \nEducation's National Gallery for America's Young Inventors. Now that \nshe is one of the ``21 Amazing Young Women of 2011,'' the sky is the \nlimit for what she might achieve.\n  Success stories such as this one show us that academic and student \ninnovation are alive and well at universities such as WVU, and promise \na brighter future for all Americans. It is essential that as we in \nCongress review our budget priorities, even in the midst of today's \nfinancial pressures, we continue--or even expand--our support of higher \neducation and students like Katherine Bomkamp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8544-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8544-S8545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD L.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1984. A bill to establish a commission to develop a national \nstrategy and recommendations for reducing fatalities resulting from \nchild abuse and neglect; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year more than 6 million children in \nthe United States are reported as victims of child abuse and neglect. \nTragically, at least 1,700 of those children lose their lives--most \nunder the age of four. Maltreatment deaths are preventable and it is \nour duty to fight for those who are too young to defend and speak for \nthemselves.\n  Currently, the United States does not have a comprehensive strategy \nfor addressing child abuse fatalities. We also lack a national standard \nfor reporting these fatalities, leaving many of these deaths to be \nlargely underreported. That is why today I am introducing the Protect \nOur Kids Act, which will establish the Commission to Eliminate Child \nAbuse and Neglect Fatalities.\n  This commission will be comprised of a variety of professionals with \ndiverse experience and perspectives. They will develop a national \nstrategy for reducing child abuse and neglect fatalities, and provide \ncomprehensive recommendations for all levels of government. They will \nanalyze the effectiveness of existing programs designed to prevent or \nidentify maltreatment deaths and learn more about what works and what \ndoesn't. Child abuse fatalities are not isolated to one part of our \ncountry or another.\n  Once the commission completes their, work they will submit a report \nwith their findings to Congress and the report will be publicly \navailable. The loss of just one child to abuse is one child too many. I \nwould like to thank my colleague, Senator Collins, for working with me \non this bipartisan bill to protect our Nation's children. A number of \norganizations have been integral to the development of the legislation \nand have endorsed it, including the National Coalition to End Child \nAbuse Deaths whose members include the National Association of Social \nWorkers, NASW, the National Center for the Review and Prevention of \nChild Deaths, NCRPCD, National Children's Alliance, NCA, Every Child \nMatters Education Fund, ECMEF, and the National District Attorney's \nAssociation, NDAA.\n  I look forward to our continued progress in developing a more \neffective approach to improving child welfare and ask all of my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Kerry in \nintroducing the Protect Our Kids Act, to create a commission with the \ngoal of eliminating child abuse fatalities. The effort to address child \nabuse transcends ideological and partisan lines. This is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. This is an American issue. One that we \ncan't wish away, but that we must face head on and work to eradicate. \nEarlier this year, Senator Kerry and I introduced a resolution \nrecognizing April as Child Abuse Prevention Month. The Protect Our Kids \nAct further represents our commitment to put an end to child abuse in \nthe United States.\n  Child abuse fatalities are preventable; yet, approximately 1,770 \nchildren are reported as dying from child abuse each year, and many \nexperts believe the actual number may be significantly higher. This \nlegislation would establish a commission to develop a comprehensive \nnational strategy for reducing child abuse fatalities. The commission \nwill include a variety of professionals with expertise in areas such as \nchild welfare advocacy, child development, pediatrics, medical \nexamining, social work, law enforcement and education.\n  Through new research, hearings and the use and coordination of \nexisting information, the commission will provide a report with their \nrecommendations. In order to develop a comprehensive strategy, the \ncommission must consider several questions including what is the extent \nto which incidents of child abuse and neglect fatalities are increasing \nin number, how to develop a system to track and record incidents, and \nwhat models exist for preventing child maltreatment deaths.\n  Increased understanding of maltreatment deaths can lead to \nimprovement in agency systems and practices to protect children and \nprevent child abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is imperative that we \ntake action to capitalize on the commission's findings. This \nlegislation requires the commission's report to be submitted to \nrelevant Federal agencies and Congressional committees. All agencies \nwith recommendations that fall under their jurisdiction must then \nsubmit their reaction and plans to address such recommendations to \nCongress within 6 months.\n  Approximately 6 million kids are reported to be abused or neglected \neach year.

Res. 347\n\n       Whereas 40 years ago, with the passage of the National \n     Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778), the \n     leaders of the United States came together to set the country \n     on a concerted course to conquer cancer through research;\n       Whereas the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 led \n     to the establishment of the National Cancer Program, which \n     significantly expanded the authorities and responsibilities \n     of the National Cancer Institute, a component of the National \n     Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent the leading cause of \n     death for people in the United States under the age of 85, \n     and the second leading cause of death for people in the \n     United States overall;\n       Whereas cancer touches everyone, either through a direct, \n     personal diagnosis or indirectly through the diagnosis of a \n     family member or friend;\n       Whereas, in 2011, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States, with more than \n     1,500,000 people in the United States expected to be \n     diagnosed with cancer each year;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health estimated the \n     overall cost of cancer to be greater than $260,000,000,000 in \n     2010 alone;\n       Whereas approximately 1 out of every 3 women and 1 out of \n     every 2 men will develop cancer in their lifetimes, and more \n     than 570,000 people in the United States will die from cancer \n     this year, which is more than 1 person every minute and \n     nearly 1 out of every 4 deaths;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to cancer \n     research and biomedical science has enabled more than \n     12,000,000 people in the United States to survive cancer, 15 \n     percent of whom were diagnosed 20 or more years ago, and has \n     resulted in extraordinary progress being made against cancer, \n     including--\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\n       (1) an increase in the average 5-year survival rate for all \n     cancers combined to 68 percent for adults and 80 percent for \n     children and adolescents, up from 50 percent and 52 percent, \n     respectively, in 1971;\n       (2) average 5-year survival rates for breast and prostate \n     cancers exceeding 90 percent;\n       (3) a decline in mortality due to colorectal cancer and \n     prostate cancer; and\n       (4) from 1990 to 2007, a decline in the death rate from all \n     cancers combined of 22 percent for men and 14 percent for \n     women, resulting in nearly 900,000 fewer deaths during that \n     period;\n\n       Whereas the driving force behind this progress has been \n     support for the National Cancer Institute and its parent \n     agency, the National Institutes of Health, which funds the \n     work of more than 325,000 researchers and research personnel \n     at more than 3,000 universities, medical schools, medical \n     centers, teaching hospitals, small businesses, and research \n     institutions in every State;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to cancer \n     research has yielded substantial returns in both research \n     advances and lives saved, and it is estimated that every 1 \n     percent decline in cancer mortality saves the economy of the \n     United States $500,000,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas advancements in understanding the causes and \n     mechanisms of cancer and improvements in the detection, \n     diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer have led to \n     cures for many types of cancers and have converted other \n     types of cancers into manageable chronic conditions;\n       Whereas continued support for clinical trials to evaluate \n     the efficacy and therapeutic benefit of promising treatments \n     for cancer is essential for translating new knowledge and \n     discoveries into tangible benefits for patients, especially \n     because all standard cancer therapies began as clinical \n     trials;\n       Whereas, despite the significant progress that has been \n     made in treating many cancers, there remain those cancers for \n     which the mortality rate is extraordinarily high, including \n     pancreatic, liver, lung, multiple myeloma, ovarian, \n     esophageal, stomach, and brain cancers, which have a 5-year \n     survival rate of less than 50 percent;\n       Whereas research advances concerning uncommon cancers, \n     which pose unique treatment challenges, provide an \n     opportunity for understanding the general properties of human \n     cancers and curing uncommon cancers as well as more common \n     cancers;\n       Whereas crucial developments have been achieved in cancer \n     research that could provide breakthroughs necessary to \n     address the increasing incidence of, and reduce deaths caused \n     by, many forms of cancer;\n       Whereas research into the effect of certain forms of cancer \n     on different population groups offers a significant \n     opportunity to lessen the burden of the disease, because many \n     population groups across the country suffer \n     disproportionately from certain forms of cancer; and\n       Whereas a sustained commitment to the research of the \n     National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer \n     Institute is necessary to improve the entire spectrum of \n     patient care, from cancer prevention, early detection, and \n     diagnosis, to treatment and long-term survivorship, and to \n     prevent research advances from being stalled or delayed: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the National Cancer \n     Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778); and\n       (2) celebrates and reaffirms the commitment embodied in the \n     National Cancer Act of 1971, specifically, that support for \n     cancer research continues to be a national priority to \n     address the scope of this pressing public health concern.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to submit a bipartisan \nresolution recognizing the 40th anniversary of the National Cancer Act \nof 1971--supported by 33 Democrats and 11 Republicans.\n  A special thank-you to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry and Kansas \nSenator Jerry Moran for their leadership on this issue.\n  It is unfortunate but likely true that we each know someone who has \nbeen affected by cancer. We know a survivor. We remember a victim. We \nknow cancer affects not just the patient but the parents, the family, \nthe friends, and the loved ones.\n  This year more than 1.5 million Americans are expected to be \ndiagnosed with cancer. One out of every three women, one out of every \ntwo men will develop some form of cancer in their lifetimes.\n  More than half a million Americans die from cancer year after year \nafter year, in any 1 year. More than one person every minute and nearly \none out of every four deaths is from cancer.\n  We also know that behind the statistics there are thousands of people \nrepresenting thousands of friends, families, and loved ones, with \nribbons, donations, and races for the cure.\n  These are the stories that motivate us to fight harder and to fight \nwith one voice. It is also a story of a nation's commitment to cancer \nresearch. There is interest in dealing with environmental causes. There \nis great interest in dealing with cures and prevention and all that we \nshould as a nation and usually do know what to do.\n  Forty years ago, Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts, as chairman \nof the Health Subcommittee, forged a bipartisan consensus and public \ndemand to bolster investments in cancer research.\n  He held hearings. He worked with leading public health advocates and \neconomists who understood the need for bipartisanship on such an urgent \nnational need. His work, along with Jacob Javits, a Republican Senator \nfrom New York, led to the framework of the National Cancer Act.\n  When it was clear President Nixon would only sign the act into law if \nKennedy's name were not on it, Kennedy backed off.\n  The goal was to put cancer research into a new era of discovery, and \nthat is what the National Cancer Act did. It established a national \ncancer program, which expanded the authority and the responsibilities \nof the National Cancer Institute, and its parent agency, the National \nInstitutes of Health. The National Cancer Institute is, by far, the \nbiggest of the two dozen or so National Institutes of Health.\n  Today, 12 million cancer survivors are alive because of the advances \nin the way we prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat cancer. Because of \nthe investments by the NCI, the National Cancer Institute, and the \nNational Institutes of Health, critical cancer research is being \nconducted in hospitals and foundations and communities and in all kinds \nof centers everywhere and in our universities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of more than 100 \ncancer research institutions, physicians, and researchers who have \nendorsed this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      National Cancer Act 40th Anniversary Resolution Endorsements\n\n       American Association for Cancer Research; Dana-Farber \n     Cancer Institute; LiveStrong; Duke Cancer Institute; \n     Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center; American Cancer \n     Society Cancer Action Network; Gary D.

It includes scientists and physicians working \ntogether on cancer research everywhere from the James in Columbus, to \nCase and UH and the clinic in Cleveland.\n  Ohio's universities and medical schools, teaching hospitals, \nCincinnati Children's Research, small businesses, and other research \ninstitutions help bring cutting-edge cancer research to urban cities \nand small towns alike.\n  For the last 40 years, our Nation's commitment to cancer research has \nseen a tremendous return on investment in the millions of lives and the \nbillions of dollars saved.\n  We have increased survival rates. We have advanced understanding of \nthe diseases and the tools needed to cure them. We have better \nunderstood the connection between environmental factors and public \nhealth and diseases. We have realized the importance of prevention. We \nalso know challenges remain--from finding more treatments to learning \nmore and carrying out prevention better than we have, from dealing with \nenvironmental factors that we know cause large numbers of cancers and \nreducing costs for patients, to reducing disease burdens for different \npopulation groups.\n  Today's bipartisan cancer resolution on the 40th anniversary of the \nNational Cancer Act reaffirms a commitment to address this national \npriority, to make sure cancer is a thing of the past.\n  Senator Kennedy said in those days, 40 years ago, when his \nlegislation began to move forward:\n\n       There are few better investments in our future than the \n     investment we make in health research.\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, earlier today, I submitted a resolution \nwith my colleagues from Ohio and Massachusetts, Senators Brown and \nKerry, to recognize the 40th anniversary of the signing of the National \nCancer Act of 1971 and to reaffirm our Nation's strong, bipartisan \ncommitment to cancer research and the more than 12 million cancer \nsurvivors alive today because of that research.\n  This commitment to cancer research is supported by 40 Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle who cosponsored this resolution. Additionally, \nthis resolution is endorsed by more than 105 cancer institutes and \nhospitals, medical schools, and patient groups, including the \nUniversity of Kansas Cancer Center.\n  Forty years ago this month, President Nixon signed the National \nCancer Act into law. The creation of this law marked a turning point in \nour Nation's efforts to prevent and cure cancer and set in motion a \ncoordinated and focused approach to cancer research.\n  The return on our commitment to cancer research is measured in lives \nsaved, a better quality of life for cancer survivors, and an enormous \neconomic benefit to our country and world.\n  Since the National Cancer Act became law in 1971, the 5-year survival \nrate for all cancers combined has risen consistently--this rate is now \nat 68 percent for adults and 80 percent for children and adolescents, \nup from 50 percent and 52 percent, respectively, in 1971.\n  It is estimated that every one percent decline in cancer mortality \nsaves the U.S. economy $500 billion annually.\n  Our country has made significant progress in combating this \ndevastating disease, but more work remains. This year, more than 1.5 \nmillion Americans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer. Of those \nindividuals, many will face a very serious, life-changing diagnosis.\n  Today, I am proud to help submit a resolution that reaffirms our \nsustained, strong commitment to cancer research that will help improve \nthe entire spectrum of care for patients, from prevention to early \ndetection and diagnosis, to treatment and long-term survivorship, and \nmost importantly--cures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/13/senate-section/article/S8551-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1459.
