Mr. President, last night the House of Representatives \nproved what we have known for quite a while: Speaker Boehner's plan to \nraise taxes on 25 million middle-class taxpayers while handing out \n$50,000 bonuses to millionaires and billionaires was dead on arrival. \nWe said that yesterday. We knew the so-called Plan B was no plan at \nall. It couldn't pass the Senate. It turns out it couldn't pass the \nHouse either. It is too bad Speaker Boehner wasted 1 week on this \nfutile political stunt, and that is all we can call it.\n  But at least now House Republicans have gotten the message loudly and \nclearly that any comprehensive solution to the looming fiscal cliff \nwill need to be a bipartisan solution. No comprehensive agreement can \npass either Chamber without both Democratic and Republican votes, which \nmeans any solution will have to ask the most fortunate among us to pay \na little more to reduce the deficit and ensure partisanship doesn't \ntake the Nation to the brink of default.\n  Nothing that has passed the House of Representatives fits that test--\nnothing. A few days ago President Obama and Speaker Boehner appeared \npoised to strike a grand bargain, but we have heard that before. \nInstead of making hard choices of compromise, as President Obama has \nbeen willing to do, the Speaker retreated to his corner and resorted to \npolitical stunts, but that stunt fell flat.\n  It is time for the Speaker and all Republicans to return to the \nnegotiating table. We have never left. It is time for Republicans to \nwork with us to find the middle ground. That is the only hope of \naverting the devastating impacts of the fiscal cliff. The fiscal cliff \nneeds to be avoided.\n  In the meantime, the Speaker should bring the middle-class tax cut \npassed by the Senate 5 months ago to the floor of the House for a vote. \nWe know it will pass. All he has to do is let Democrats vote with some \nRepublicans and it will pass. The clock is ticking until the Nation \ngoes over the fiscal cliff and taxes go up for every family in America. \nBut there is still time for the Speaker to hit the brakes and avoid \nthat cliff. We don't need the ``Thelma and Louise'' projection over \nthat cliff.\n  The Senate-passed bill would protect 98 percent of families and 97 \npercent of small businesses from crippling tax hikes while President \nObama and the Speaker work toward a compromise agreement. That \nagreement should be comprehensive. If Republicans truly want to ensure \nAmerican families' taxes don't go up on January 1, they should simply \npass the Senate bill. The only reason Speaker Boehner hasn't brought \nour bill to the floor sooner is\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nhe knows it will pass. He worked for a day or two seeing if he could \nbring that up so it wouldn't pass. That didn't work either.\n  Americans are not fooled by the Speaker's phony procedural excuses \nfor failing to bring this solution to a vote. They are tired of \nexcuses. They expect action.\n  Let me be very plain. There is nothing preventing the Speaker from \ntaking up our bill and giving middle-class families certainty. I say to \nmy friend, the Speaker: This isn't a game. It isn't about scoring \npolitical points or putting wins on the board. There will be very \nserious consequences for millions of families if Congress fails to \ncompromise, and there will be very serious consequences for our country \nif Congress fails to compromise.\n  It is time for the Speaker to return to the negotiating table ready \nto compromise, and it is time for the House--especially House \nRepublicans--to remember what is at stake.\n  I repeat, the $250,000 program would pass overwhelmingly in the \nHouse. It is up to the Speaker to let that vote occur.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8324-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8324-S8325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DAY AFTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, most people, of course, are focused on \nwhat happened last night over in the House. I would like to focus on \nthe press conference that congressional Democrats held just a few hours \nearlier.\n  Here were the leaders of the Democratic Party in the Senate--other \nthan the President, these are the folks with the greatest \nresponsibility for protecting the American people from a massive tax \nhike coming in January--and what did they do? They stood in front of \nthe cameras and laughed. They laughed. They giggled at a bunch of bad \njokes and told the American people they didn't plan to do anything this \nweek--nothing, absolutely nothing.\n  Democrats in the House vowed they wouldn't vote for this bill, the \nmajority leader vowed he would ignore it if it made it out of the House \nand landed in the Senate, and the President vowed he would veto it if \nit made it out of the Senate.\n  So Democrats spent literally all day yesterday defeating a bill that \nwould make current tax rates permanent for more than 99 percent of \nAmericans, and they laughed about it. Ten days to go until the fiscal \ncliff, and they laughed about it.\n  I don't know if anybody has looked at a calendar lately, but we are \nabout out of time here, folks. This isn't funny. People's livelihoods \nare at stake. The U.S. economy is at stake. Millions upon millions of \nfamilies are counting on us to do something.\n  Look, it is the President's job--it is his job to find a solution \nthat can pass the Congress. He is the only one who can do it. This \nisn't John Boehner's problem to solve. He has done his part. He has \nbent over backward.\n  Mr. President: How about rallying your party around a solution. How \nabout getting Democrats to support something.\n  I have said it many times before: We simply cannot solve the problems \nwe face unless and until the President of the United States either \nfinds the will or develops the ability--the ability--to lead. This is a \nmoment that calls for Presidential leadership. That is the way out of \nthis. It is that simple.\n  Does anybody wonder why we keep going from crisis to crisis around \nhere? Does anybody notice a pattern? This doesn't have to be a crisis. \nThis was an opportunity, but once again the President ignored it. He \nwent out and held rallies and gave partisan speeches even after he had \nalready been reelected.\n  As I said yesterday, I think it is obvious at this point the \nPresident wants to go off the cliff. But I know most of the American \npeople don't want that. Today, I am going to make an offer. With 10 \ndays to go, we have an obligation to act on something--something that \ncan pass the House and the Senate. If the President won't propose it, \nif Senate Democrats won't propose it, I will.\n  Earlier this year, the House passed a bill that extends current rates \non everyone for 1 year, with instructions for expedited comprehensive \ntax reform by next year. We could bring up this House-passed bill.\n  If the majority leader has a plan that can get 60 votes in the \nSenate, break through the disarray in his own caucus and build \nbipartisan support, offer that as an amendment and then let's vote. \nLet's vote on amendments from all sides, and then let's go to \nconference with the House of Representatives. They have already passed \na bill--one I support--to prevent a tax hike on all Americans and \nreform the Tax Code. Why don't we take it up here? Let's get this done.\n  It is called legislating. That is what we used to do in Congress. \nDemocrats may be popping champagne corks today about bringing down Plan \nB, but all their efforts to do so yesterday will not protect a single \ntaxpayer from a massive tax hike in just a few weeks. The American \npeople are waiting. Surely, we can do better than this. Let's do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if this weren't such a serious situation we \nface ourselves, it would be laughable.\n  Can anyone imagine saying we should defeat a bill we have already \ndefeated? We voted on the proposal at the same time we voted to pass \nthat protecting middle-class Americans. That passed the Senate--one to \ngive the richest of the rich a continuation of the tax breaks they get. \nAs I indicated, the proposal they had for about another $50,000 for \neach of them was defeated here. It was defeated in the Senate.\n  So my friend--and he is my friend--the Republican leader is \nstruggling to find a way to blame Democrats, and it is a struggle, \ntrying to blame us for the failure of the House to pass the Speaker's \nbill. The House is led by the Republicans. Their narrowed margin will \nbe better for the country after the first of the year, but right now he \ncontrols the House by a wide margin.\n  I have served in the House. The Speaker is all powerful in the House. \nTo blame us for the travesty that took place over there is pretty \nincredible. As I tried to say in my remarks, couldn't we at least \nprotect the middle class?\n  My friend complains the President hasn't done enough. He put forward \na proposal that has received criticism from Democrats because he was \ntoo generous with Speaker Boehner. But the President believes, as he \nsaid several times, both sides might have to make hard choices.\n  The President released a balanced $2.4 trillion program. That is \npretty good. It would alleviate the fiscal cliff, it would allow the \nSGR to continue so doctors get paid and patients have a doctor to go \nto. It extended unemployment benefits for people who are desperate.\n  It is true that there is a crisis here, but it is because the House \nRepublicans refuse to pass the Senate-passed tax bill. It is because \nthe Republicans in the House are fighting among themselves.\n  The Republican leader seeks to pass the House-passed bill, but we \nhave already turned that bill down. The real answer lies in the \nSpeaker, who controls the House of Representatives, talking to the \nPresident and working things out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All I was suggesting to my friend the majority leader \nis that you have the tax bill that originated in the House. It came \nover to the Senate. If our friends in the majority don't like that \nversion of it, they could call it up, amend it, and see if there is a \nmajority in the Senate for something.\n  It seems to me that the time for finger-pointing is about over. The \nAmerican people are not particularly interested in what originated here \nor there or who is doing what; they are interested in getting a result. \nI was trying to be helpful in suggesting that you have a tax bill that \ncame over from the House. You have a majority here. You could take it \nup, offer amendments, and see if there is something that could achieve \na majority of the Senate rather than just complaining because the House \ndid not pass something yesterday. That is not going to solve the \nproblem. Somehow, some way, we need to find a way forward, and I hope \nwe can in the coming week.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can too, but this is really quite \nremarkable. I am told that Members from this body went and talked to \nthe Republican caucus yesterday saying: Send us your plan B, and the \nDemocrats will take care of it and send you back something you will \nlike better.\n  We can all see what has happened in the press. I like John Boehner, \nbut gee whiz, I mean, this is a pretty big political battering he is \ntaking. What he should do is allow a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives on a bipartisan bill. It will pass. Democrats will vote \nfor it. Some Republicans will vote for it. That is what we are supposed \nto do. But he is trying to pass everything with that majority he has \nthat cannot agree on anything among themselves. Bring in the Democrats. \nThat is what the country was set up for. Our Founding Fathers set it up \nthat way. But he wants some other method where everything is done by \nthe slim majority they have.\n  This is absolutely incredible. We believe the Speaker should be \nconcerned. I am confident he is, but maybe he is more concerned, as \nsome have said, about his election to be returned as Speaker. He should \nbe more concerned about what is going to happen to the country. If he \nshowed leadership and walked out there and said: This is the right \nthing for the country, we are all going to vote on this, Democrats will \nvote for it and enough Republicans will vote for it to pass something \nthat will take us away from that fiscal cliff. But this brinkmanship \nand this silliness that is going on over there you would not do in an \neighth grade government election.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I add that the time for finger-pointing \nis gradually running out. The American people know we have a President, \nthey know we have a Senate, and they know we have a House. They are \nanxiously awaiting whether we are going to solve this problem before \nthe end of the year.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 4310, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4310) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \n     strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of December 18, \n2012.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be up to 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees prior to a vote on adoption \nof the conference report.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am pleased to bring to the Senate, along with Senator \nMcCain, the conference report on H.R. 4310, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. This conference report, which \nwas signed by all 26 Senate conferees, all the members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, contains many provisions that are of critical \nimportance to our troops. This will be the 51st consecutive year in \nwhich a national defense authorization act will be enacted into law.\n  I thank my dear friend Senator McCain, our ranking minority member, \nfor all that he did to bring us to this conclusion and for the years of \ngreat leadership on our committee. I have been lucky to have Senator \nMcCain as a partner. I know both of us are grateful to the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Buck McKeon \nand Adam Smith, for their hard work on reconciling the many differences \nbetween the House and Senate bill and for helping to produce a solid \nbill to support the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  The conference report contains many important provisions that will \nimprove the quality of life for our men and women in uniform. It will \nprovide needed support and assistance to our troops who are deployed. \nIt will make the investments we need to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n  First and foremost, the bill authorizes a 1.7-percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for all members of the uniformed services, consistent \nwith the President's request.\n  The conference report contains strong additional sanctions on Iran. \nThe Iran sanctions provisions will designate certain persons in Iran's \nenergy, port, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors as entities of \nproliferation concern, subjecting many more transactions with such \nentities to sanctions. It will impose sanctions on persons selling or \nsupplying or diverting to Iran a defined list of materials relevant to \nthe aforementioned sectors, to certain Iranian specially designated \nnationals and blocked persons, or to be used in connection with certain \nIranian military programs.\n  It is going to impose sanctions on any insurance or reinsurance \nprovider or underwriter that knowingly provides underwriting service, \ninsurance, or reinsurance for activities for which sanctions have been \nimposed to any person in the energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sector \nin Iran.\n  It will designate the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting and its \npresident as human rights abusers for their broadcasting of forced \nconfessions and show trials, blocking their assets and preventing other \nentities from doing business with them and banning any travel to the \nUnited States.\n  The administration requested three modifications. In particular, one \nwas additional time to implement the provision following enactment; the \nsecond was additional time between waiver renewals; and third was a \nmodification of the exceptions clause from nondesignated Iranian \n``financial institutions'' in the Senate-passed version to a broader \nterm that would have incorporated nondesignated Iranian ``persons.'' \nThat conference report provides two of the three modifications--the \nadditional time requested. It does not make a change in terms of the \nexceptions clause.\n  The conference report contains a few provisions addressing detainee \nissues. These provisions extend existing limitations on the transfer or \nrelease of Gitmo detainees for another year. We did not adopt the \npermanent limitations in the House bill. We also provided new \nflexibility for dealing with detainees who cooperate with U.S. \nintelligence and law enforcement authorities pursuant to pretrial \nagreements.\n  The report establishes new congressional notification requirements \nfor military detainees held on naval vessels and for third-country \nnationals who are released from military detention in Afghanistan, but \nthe report does not place any conditions or limitations on such \ntransfers.\n  The conference report does not include the Senate language regarding \nmilitary detention inside the United States. The House conferees would \nsimply not accept this provision. Instead, we included a provision that \nsays and states the following:\n\n       Nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force, \n     (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) or the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law \n     112-81) shall be construed to deny the availability of the \n     writ of habeas corpus or to deny any Constitutional rights in \n     a court ordained or established by or under Article III of \n     the Constitution to any person inside the United States who \n     would be entitled to the availability of such writ or such \n     rights in the absence of such laws.\n\n  The provision in the fiscal year 2012 act, which is referred to in \nthe language I just read--it is already law--that section in the 2012 \nact is section 1021. That section said the following:\n  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or \nauthorities relating to the detention of\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nUnited States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or \nany other persons who are captured or arrested inside the United \nStates. The language in this conference report reflects my view that \nCongress did not restrict or deny anyone's Constitutional rights in \neither the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force or the Fiscal \nYear 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The Statement of Managers \naccompanying this conference report points out that ``constitutional \nrights may not be restricted or denied by statute.''\n  On the Alternative Fuel provision, the conference report does not \ninclude a provision of the House-passed bill that would have prohibited \nfiscal year 2013 funding for the production or purchase of alternative \nfuel if the cost of producing or purchasing the alternative fuel \nexceeds the cost of traditional fossil fuel.\n  The conference report does contain a provision that limits DOD's \nfiscal year 2013 Defense Production Act--DPA--funding for the \nconstruction of a biofuel refinery until--that is the key word--the DOD \nreceives the promised contributions from the Departments of Energy and \nAgriculture for the same purpose. We do not limit Phase I of the DPA \nproject, nor does the conference report limit the use of FY12 funds for \nbiofuel refinery construction.\n  On ``cyber,'' the conference report requires the Secretary of Defense \nto create a process requiring defense contractors that use or possess \nclassified or sensitive DOD information to report successful cyber \npenetrations of their networks or information systems. Additionally, if \nthe Department is concerned about a particular event and feels the need \nto determine what DOD information may have been lost from such \npenetration, the provision would authorize DOD to conduct its own \nforensic analysis, upon request, and subject to limitations.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has a special interest in this area of \ncyber security. This provision in the Defense authorization bill \nrepresents a major breakthrough in the Nation's need to protect cyber--\nour information systems and cyber security.\n  There are a lot of other sensitive areas where we are threatened with \ncyber attacks, such as financial, police, transportation sectors, which \nobviously we could not touch; they are not within our jurisdiction. \nThey need similar action.\n  The conference report provides that the Secretary of Defense will \nevaluate, by the end of 2013, at least three possible future missile \ndefense interceptor deployment locations in the United States--at least \ntwo of which would be on the East Coast--and then to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement for the locations evaluated. It would \nalso require the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to prepare a \ncontingency plan for deployment of an additional interceptor site in \ncase the President decides to proceed with such a deployment. However, \nit does not mandate or authorize deployment of any missile defense \nsite, and does not require the Defense Department to submit a \ndeployment plan to Congress.\n  For Afghanistan, the conference report includes a sense of Congress \nin support of the President's plan for the transition of lead \nresponsibility for security to the Afghan security forces in 2013 and \nthe drawdown of most U.S. forces by no later than the end of 2014. \nSpecifically, the sense of Congress provides in part that the President \nshould seek to ``. . . take all possible steps to end such operations \nat the earliest possible date consistent with a safe and orderly draw \ndown of United States troops in Afghanistan.''\n  The conference report also calls for an independent assessment of the \nsize and structure requirements of the Afghan National Security Forces \nnecessary for those forces to be able to ensure that their country will \nnot again serve as a safe-haven for terrorists that threaten \nAfghanistan, the region, and the world.\n  On TRICARE, the conference report establishes modestly increased \ncost-sharing rates under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program for \nfiscal year 2013 in statute, and in fiscal years 2014 through 2022, \nlimits any annual increases in pharmacy copayments to increases in \nretiree cost of living adjustments. The Administration's proposal would \nhave tripled beneficiary copayment rates over the next 10 years.\n  The conference report also requires the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct a 5-year pilot program to refill prescription maintenance \nmedications for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries through TRICARE's \nnational mail-order pharmacy program, resulting in savings to the \ngovernment of $1.1 billion over the next decade.\n  Regarding Air Force force structure, the conferees adopted language \nestablishing a commission, which would consist of eight members, four \nappointed by the President and four appointed by leadership of the \nCommittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. The Commission would be required to report to the \nCongress by February 1, 2014, in time to inform congressional action on \nthe fiscal year 2015 budget request, on an Air Force force structure \nthat would, among other things, meet the current and anticipated \nrequirement of the combatant commanders while achieving an appropriate \nbalance between the regular and reserve components of the Air Force, \ntaking advantage of the unique strengths and capabilities of each.\n  The conference report would provide that during fiscal year 2013, the \nAir Force would be required to maintain the alternative force structure \nproposed by the Air Force on November 2, 2012, after Congress clearly \nindicated it would reject the original plan. We modified the November \nplan to add an additional 32 fixed-wing, intra-theater airlift aircraft \n(C-27s and/or C-130s) beyond the number proposed by the Secretary. This \naddition will help us provide sufficient aircraft to meet the Army's \nfixed-wing, direct support/time sensitive airlift mission requirements.\n  Once again, I want to thank Senator McCain. As I said before, I have \nbeen honored, pleased, and lucky to have Senator McCain as my partner \nin leading the Armed Services Committee. I know how indebted we both \nare to our staffs as well as to all of the members who work so well \ntogether on a bipartisan basis.\n  Our majority and minority staffs were led by Rick Debobes and Ann \nSauer. They have done amazing work on this bill. They did a month's \nworth of work in weeks. They did a week's worth of work in days, and \nthey did a day's worth of work in hours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a full list of the \nmajority and minority staff, who gave so much of themselves and their \nfamilies, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Richard D.

I would note that the committee's chief clerk Chris Cowert \nwill be retiring at the end of this year after completing more than 41 \nyears on the committee staff. She has been a\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\ndriving force behind the staff support of the annual Defense \nAuthorization Act, and she will be sorely missed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nKentucky on the floor. I understand he seeks recognition for 10 \nminutes, and I ask that he be recognized at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill because I \nbelieve it contains language that would allow American citizens to be \ndetained without trial. The other side has argued that is not true, \nthat they will be eligible for their constitutional rights if they get \ninto an article III court or a constitutional court. But here is the \nrub: They have to be eligible. Who decides whether someone is eligible \nfor the court? It is an arbitrary decision, and this is what this \ndebate has been over. Don't let the wool be pulled over your eyes that \neveryone has protection and they will get a trial by jury if accused of \na crime.\n  We had protection in this bill. We passed an amendment that \nspecifically said: If you are an American citizen or here legally in \nthe country, you will get a trial by jury. It was explicitly stated and \nit has been removed in the conference committee. It has been removed \nbecause they want the ability to hold American citizens without trial \nin our country. This is so fundamentally wrong and goes against \neverything we stand for as a country that it cannot go unnoticed and \nshould be pointed out.\n  Proponents of indefinite detention without trial say that an \naccusation alone is sufficient, that these crimes are so heinous that \ntrials are unnecessary. They will show us pictures of foreigners in \nforeign dress from foreign lands and say that is what this debate is \nabout. It is untrue. This debate is about American citizens accused of \ncrimes in the United States.\n  Make no mistake that the faces of terrorism include awful people who \nshould be punished to the full extent of the law. The same portrait of \nevil could be drawn of domestic terrorists, domestic terror, and \ndomestic violence. One could parade pictures of Charles Manson, Timothy \nMcVeigh--the Oklahoma bomber--Jeffrey Dahmer, and people would cry out \nthat they don't deserve a trial either. Most Americans understand at \nsome level that when someone is accused of a crime in our country, they \nget a trial by a jury of their peers. No matter how heinous the crime \nis or how awful they are, we give them a trial. This bill takes away \nthat right and says if someone thinks a person is dangerous, we will \nhold that person without a trial. It is an abomination. It should not \nstand. Most Americans understand that if someone is accused of a crime, \nit does not make them guilty of a crime. They will still get their day \nin court.\n  Some here may not care when they determine that they are going to \ndetain Ahmed or Yousef or Ibrahim. Many innocent Americans are named \nAhmed or Yousef or Ibrahim. Many Americans are named Saul or David or \nIsaac. Is our memory so short that we don't understand the danger of \nallowing detention without trial? Is our memory so short that we don't \nunderstand the havoc that bias and bigotry can do when unrestrained by \nthe law? Trial by jury is our last defense against tyranny and our last \ndefense against oppression. We have locked up Arabs, Jews, and the \nJapanese.\n  Do we not want to retain our right to trial by jury? Do we want to \nallow the whims of government to come forward and lock up whom they \nplease without being tried? In our not-too-distant past Americans named \nOzaki, Ichiro, or Yuki were indefinitely detained by the tens of \nthousands without trial or accusation. Will America only begin to \nregret our loss of trial by jury when the people have names such as \nSmith and Jones? Mark my words: This is about people named Smith and \nJones or people named David, Saul, Isaac, Ahmed, Yousef, or Ibrahim. \nThis is about all Americans and whether they will have due process and \nthe protections of the law.\n  We are told these people are so evil and so dangerous that we cannot \nallow trials. Trial by jury is who we are. Trial by jury is that \nshining beacon on a hill that people around the world wish to emulate. \nIt is why people came here. It is why we are exceptional as a people. \nIt is not the color of our skin; it is our ideas, it is the right to \ntrial by jury that is looked to as a beacon of hope for people around \nthe world, and we are willing to discard it out of fear. It is a shame \nto scrap the very rights that make us exceptional as a people.\n  Proponents of indefinite detention will argue that we are a good \npeople and we will never unjustly detain people. I don't dispute their \nintentions or impute bad motives to them, but what I will say is \nremember what Madison said. Madison said if a government were comprised \nof angels, we would not need the chains of the Constitution. We would \nnot need to bind our representatives and restrain them from doing bad \nthings to good people. If all men in government were angels, we would \nnot need the rules. All men in the government are not angels now and \nnever will be. There is always the danger that some day someone will be \nelected who will take the rights away from the Japanese, Jews, or \nArabs. It happened once. We are told by these people who believe in \nindefinite detention that the battle is everywhere. If the battle is \neverywhere, our liberties are nowhere. If the battle is without end, \nwhen will they return our liberties? When will our rights be restored \nif the battle has no end and the battlefield is limitless and the war \nis endless? When will our rights be restored? It is not a temporary or \nlimited suspension of our right to trial by jury but an unlimited, \nunbounded relinquishment of the right to trial by jury without length \nor duration.\n  We are told that limiting the right to trial by jury is justified \nunder the law of war. Am I the only one uncomfortable applying the law \nof war to American citizens accused of crimes in the United States? Is \nthe law of war a euphemism for martial law? What is the law of war \nexcept for something to go around the Constitution? It is an \nextraordinary circumstance that might happen in a battlefield somewhere \nelse but should not happen in the United States. Every American accused \nof a crime, no matter how heinous, should get their day in court and a \ntrial by a jury of their peers. These are not idle questions.\n  I believe the defense of the Bill of Rights trumps the concerns for \nspeedy passage even of a bill which I generally support. Sixty-seven \nSenators voted just a few weeks ago to include a provision in this bill \nthat says we have a right to a trial by jury. It was plucked out in \nsecret in conference despite the wishes of two-thirds of the Senators \nin this body--Republican and Democrat--who were concerned about \nprotecting the right to a jury trial.\n  Many Senators say: Well, we tried and we lost. They outmaneuvered us; \nthey were sneakier than we were. I disagree that we give up. I think \nthe time is now. I think we make a statement. The fight is today. The \nsubject is too dear. If a majority today were to stand and say: The \nright to trial by jury is important enough to delay the Defense \nauthorization bill for 2 weeks, I think it would be an important \nmessage to send.\n  So today I stand and urge a ``no'' vote on what I consider to be a \ntravesty of justice.\n  Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is flat out \nwrong. There is no such language in the bill which denies the right to \ntrial by jury. I think those are the same kinds of charges against last \nyear's bill. We are trying to keep up with the false charges that the \nSenator makes, so we put language in this year's bill which says \nnothing in last year's bill does or could be implied to do any such \nthing as the Senator from Kentucky is charging. We have language in \nthis year's bill and nothing from last year's bill. That was the same \ncharge he made against last year's bill, shall be construed to deny the \navailability of the writ of habeas corpus or deny any constitutional \nrights in a court ordained or established under article III of the \nConstitution to any person inside the United States.\n  Then he makes a totally outlandish charge that they were \noutmaneuvered and they were sneakier than we were. Where does that come \nfrom? What is the basis for that kind of a charge\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nagainst Senator McCain and me? We have put language in this bill which \nmakes it absolutely clear that nothing we have adopted here in this \nSenate does anything like what the Senator from Kentucky said--denying \nthe people the right to jury trial.\n  I totally reject his argument. He does not quote any language in this \nbill that does what he says this bill does. The Senator from Kentucky \nactually started his statement by saying this bill has language which \nwill deny a trial by jury. What language and what page? It makes the \nallegation and sort of lets it sit there. Well, it is flat out wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the authors and \nmanagers of the bill in the House with coming up with a very good bill \nfor our military which will have pay raises and trying to increase our \ndefenses.\n  I don't mind saying that I think we are at war. I know the Presiding \nOfficer believes that. How long does the war last? I don't know. I \ncannot tell anyone. Am I supposed to know that? Can we not fight it \nunless we know the date it ends? America, is it part of the \nbattlefield? Tell me. Where do you think they want to hit us the most? \nWhat do you think al-Qaida would like to do more than anything else? \nThey would like to come here and destroy the building I am speaking in. \nThe only reason they cannot get here yet is because we are fighting \nthem over there.\n  We are gathering good intelligence. We are taking the war home to \nthem. Our intelligence agencies, our FBI, our military, our CIA are all \nover the world tracking these crazy people so they cannot get here. So \nto suggest that I cannot tell when the war ends, therefore we have to \nturn it into a crime, is dangerous and absurd.\n  Did they know when Germany, Berlin, or Tokyo was going to fall? What \nhappened to the German saboteurs who landed in Long Island during World \nWar II? They were captured by the FBI and turned over to the military. \nWhat happened to the American citizens who were helping the German \nsaboteurs? They were held as enemy combatants.\n  To my good friend from Kentucky, I don't doubt his passion or \nsincerity; I doubt his judgment on these issues.\n  The Supreme Court has spoken three different times. Less than 6 or 7 \nyears ago an American citizen was caught helping the Taliban in \nAfghanistan and they said we could hold one of our own as an enemy \ncombatant until the hostilities cease, and that is a hard time to \nfigure out.\n  Let's get this right. If an American citizen helping the Taliban in \nAfghanistan kills our soldiers, can be captured and held as an enemy \ncombatant according to the Supreme Court, what kind of world would we \nlive in if the al-Qaida collaborator American citizen attacked us here, \ntrying to kill us in our own homeland, to say: That doesn't count. The \nAmerican citizen is no longer at war because we are in America; we have \nto read them their rights and give them a lawyer and we can't hold them \nfor military intelligence-gathering purposes.\n  My good friend doesn't understand that in fighting a war, the goal is \nto win the war; it is to defeat the enemy. In fighting a crime, the \ngoal is designed to hold somebody accountable for an illegal wrong. I \nhave been a military lawyer for 30 years. He may not understand the law \nof war, but I do and the Supreme Court does. The Supreme Court has said \nin World War II and in this war, if an American citizen collaborates \nwith the enemy, they will be given due process under the law of war. A \nFederal judge will hear the claim: I am wrongly held. I am not part of \nal-Qaida or the Taliban. That is the only time one could be held as an \nenemy combatant. In helping al-Qaida or the Taliban, one has to be \ninvolved in a plot or an act. If a Federal judge agrees with the \ngovernment that, yes, in fact, there is evidence to suggest an American \ncitizen is helping the Taliban or al-Qaida, I think most Americans \nwould say it is reasonable to hold that person to find out what they \nknow about this attack and future attacks.\n  Can my colleagues imagine what would happen in this country if three \npeople were running up the Capitol steps to blow up the Capitol and one \nof them survived who was an American citizen and we couldn't hold them \nand question them by asking: Where did you train? Is there any other \nattack planned? What do you know? Whom did you work with? That we would \nhave to say, within hours or a day or two, here is your lawyer and you \nhave a right to remain silent? Can we imagine what would have happened \nin World War II if the American citizens who helped the Nazis--if we \nturned that into a common crime.\n  The difference between me and the Senator from Kentucky is that I \nbelieve with all my heart and soul that the al-Qaida, Taliban groups \nare at war with us and are trying to come to our homeland. I know they \nare trying to find American citizens who would help them, and they \nwill. There has never been a war in America where somebody within the \nAmerican citizen community did not collaborate with the enemy. That is \nhappening today. When that day comes and we capture that person, I want \nas an option the ability to hold them as an enemy combatant, as we did \nin other wars. They will get their day in court, but they will not be \nread their rights or given a lawyer on the spot because that would stop \nintelligence gathering.\n  To the managers of this bill, to the men and women of the House who \nsent it over here, thank God they chose a balance between due process \nand common sense.\n  All I will say is that the way we found bin Laden was not through \ntorture. I am offended by that, as are Senator McCain and Senator \nLevin. The way we tracked down bin Laden is we had people held at Gitmo \nfor years under the law of war. We don't try them or let them go. When \nwe capture somebody on the battlefield, we don't hold a trial; we hold \nthe prisoner to try to gather intelligence and keep them off the \nbattlefield. Through that process, over years, the Bush administration \nand the Obama administration put together the puzzle about bin Laden. \nIt wasn't because of waterboarding; it was because this country had \navailable to it the law of war detention that allows us to hold people \nand get to know them over time and make sure they could not go back to \nthe fight and good questioning and good interrogation techniques led to \nfinding bin Laden. What the Senator from Kentucky is saying is it would \nnot be available to us as a nation if an American citizen were involved \nin attacking us on the homeland. What an absurd result, that if an \nAmerican citizen joined al-Qaida to kill everybody in this room, for \nsome unknown reason, we would turn that into a crime rather than an act \nof war.\n  If a person collaborates with al-Qaida or the Taliban, two things can \nhappen to them: They can get killed or they can get captured. Most \nlikely they will get a trial one day and nobody is restricting their \ntrial rights. What Senator Levin said is true. There is nothing in here \nrestricting the right of trial. What is in here is giving us the option \nto hold someone as an enemy combatant so we don't have to Mirandize \nthem and turn an act of war into a crime.\n  I am afraid it will not be long before this is tested in reality. The \nenemy is afoot. They are trying to penetrate our homeland. They are \nseeking aid and comfort from Americans within our own country who are \ngoing to side with the enemy, unfortunately. When that day comes, I \nwish to make sure we have the ability in this war, as in every other \nwar, to hold them and to gather intelligence--not to torture them but \nto make sure we are safe as a nation. Due process, yes. Under the law \nof war, it must be so. If we turn this war into a crime, we are going \nto regret it. If my colleagues don't believe we are at war, then I \ncannot disagree more. I cannot tell my colleagues when the war ends, \nbut I will tell them how it ends. This is how it is going to end: We \nare going to win and they are going to lose because we can't afford to \nlose.\n  Between now and when that day comes, we are going to take the fight \nto them. If we find an American citizen helping the enemy overseas--\nthis President ordered the killing by drone of al-Awlaki, an American \ncitizen overseas--I believe it was Yemen--and the President said: I \nhave ample evidence he is now assisting al-Qaida overseas to attack \nAmerican targets and I am going to take him out. Well done, Mr. \nPresident. Well done, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\n  If most of us agree we can kill an American citizen helping al-Qaida \nkill us overseas, we can't capture an American citizen helping al-Qaida \nhere at home and hold him for questioning under the law of war, what an \nabsurd result.\n  I not only am going to vote for this bill, I am going to celebrate \nthe fact we have done nothing to stop the right to trial. As Senator \nLevin said, there is not one thing in this bill that restricts a \nperson's right to a trial. What we do have in this bill is the \nrecognition we are at war and we retain as an option that has not been \nused--there is no American citizen in detention--but there may be a \nneed for that one day and we retain that right under this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question, briefly?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under the scenario as envisioned by the argument made by \nthe Senator from Kentucky that if an American citizen is overseas, as \nal-Awlaki was in Yemen, and we took a drone and killed him, which was a \ndecision made by the President of the United States----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Good decision, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But if al-Awlaki had been in the United States of \nAmerica, a citizen engaged in the same activities that justified him \nbeing killed, then Mr. al-Awlaki would have been entitled to his \nMiranda rights, a trial by jury, habeas corpus, all that as if he were \ntreated as an American citizen. I don't think many people would quite \nunderstand that distinction of geography.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It makes no sense, I say to the Senator. He would be \nentitled to a habeas hearing if he were caught in the United States, \nbut he would be held under the law of war because the allegation is not \nthat he was committing a crime but that he was collaborating with the \nenemy.\n  So, yes, we could have a scenario, according to the view of the \nSenator from Kentucky, that we could kill somebody--an American citizen \noverseas helping the enemy kill our troops--but if they joined with al-\nQaida here at home, all of a sudden we have to give them a lawyer and \nread them their rights and we can't hold them under the law of war \ndetention to find out what they know about an impending attack. That \nmakes absolutely no sense. The Supreme Court has rejected that kind of \nthinking.\n  I hope that day never comes, but I can tell my colleagues this: I \ndon't know when the war is over, he is right about that, but I know \nthis: As long as I am in the Senate, we are going to fight it and we \nare going to fight it as a war, not a crime.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further, there is every \nindication in the Middle East and around the world that we see that al-\nQaida is on the way back, far from being defeated.\n  I just wish to make an additional comment to my friend, Senator \nLevin, the chairman, whom I have had the honor of bringing these bills \nto the floor with and working together with for 25 years. I was tempted \nto leave it unresponded to, but a statement the Senator from Kentucky \nmade: They were sneakier than we were--I have to say to the chairman, I \ndon't think the chairman has ever conducted our committee and our \ndeliberations and our work on the floor and in conference in any way as \nbeing sneaky. I categorically reject that kind of comment, and I don't \nthink it is worthy of the performance the Senator from Michigan has \nprovided to this committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much thank my dear friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. The only one thing I will \nadd to this subject before we vote--the Senator from Arkansas seeks to \nspeak and we will run out of time soon--is that a provision which is in \nour bill, which both the ranking member and myself voted for, which was \nstricken, one of the arguments against it was made by the ACLU. Our \nfriend from Kentucky talks about something in this bill which denies \nthe right to jury trial and the proof he gives for that is something \nthat is not in the bill, which is--it violates logic, to begin with, \nbut putting that aside--one of the arguments against keeping it in the \nbill was made by the American Civil Liberties Union and surely they \nbelieve people's rights to trial and jury trial should not be denied.\n  So the allegations made by the Senator from Kentucky are wrong. There \nis absolutely no substantiation for them, including the one which was \njust referred to by Senator McCain. But the statement he makes that \nthere is language in this bill--here is the bill. Where is the Senator \nfrom Kentucky? What page of the bill is he referring to that contains \nthe language he says denies people the right to trial? It is simply not \nthere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will try to keep my remarks to about 5 \nminutes, although I would first like to thank Senators Levin and McCain \nfor their leadership on this legislation. They truly set the tone, and \nthey have been good role models for the entire Senate on how \nlegislation should be conducted. So I wish to thank both of them. I \nthink many of my colleagues feel the very same way; that we appreciate \nhow they have handled the national defense authorization bill. It has \nbeen a massive undertaking and sometimes, as we know, we have a lot of \ngridlock around here, but because of the way they have handled it, they \nhave been able to get this bill to this point.\n  I am not going to object to this bill at all. At one point I thought \nabout it because I am so upset--in fact, my staff has even said livid, \nand I have been livid--about how one item has been handled by the Air \nForce; that is, as we all know, about 10 months ago the Air Force came \nout with a proposed force restructure and that included taking an A-10 \nunit away from the Arkansas National Guard that is based in Fort Smith, \nAR.\n  Understandably, when something such as that happens, we have \nquestions. So, 10 months ago, I started asking: Why are you doing this? \nGive me your analysis. Tell me how much money you are going to save. \nAre you aware you have Fort Chaffee right off the end of the runway--\nand I will talk about this in just a minute. Are you aware that this \njust went through BRAC, that they had F-16s there and now they have A-\n10s, and the BRAC commission has gone through this process and they \nsaid this is the best place; we can have A-10s right here in Fort \nSmith, AR.\n  So we basically got stonewalled. They wouldn't tell us any of their \nanalysis. They wouldn't tell us how much it is costing or saving. They \nbasically stonewalled not just my office but the whole Congress, as far \nas I know. I have talked to people all over this place on the Senate \nside and the House side. They never got any numbers. Finally, just in \nthe last few weeks, in talking to members of the Air Force who have \nstars on their shoulders, they have told me there was no business \nanalysis. There was no base-by-base analysis. Basically, what this \nboils down to is we need to make some cuts and more or less your number \ncame up, and they go back to the one flying mission per State. We can \ntalk about that more if we want to.\n  But the problem is we are in a budget environment where we are having \ndownward pressure on military spending, and we know that. We are going \nto have to make military cuts not just this year but in the outyears. \nThere is no doubt about it. The U.S. Air Force should always count the \ncost. They should always make a determination on how much these things \ncost and how much they save. They did not do that here.\n\n  They should also know we are going to have a smaller force in the \nfuture. So as we wean out some units--and it is going to happen; it is \ngoing to be painful; people are not going to like it--you should keep \nthe best units you have, the strongest units you have. And the 188th at \nFort Smith, AR, is the best unit in the system. I say that objectively \nbecause there are numbers to back that up. It is the cheapest to \noperate. Even though it went through the transition from F-16s to A-10s \njust a few years ago, they have already deployed twice. They have \ndeployed twice. One reason they got extended in a deployment was \nbecause another A-10 unit was not ready.\n  What this does is it puts those pilots--those men and women in \nuniform, who just got back from Afghanistan--\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nthey get off the plane, they are being hugged by their spouses and \ntheir children and their communities, and basically the Air Force is \ngiving them a pink slip.\n  The ultimate slap in the face happened this week when the National \nGuard Bureau had the audacity to contact the 188th Flying Wing at Fort \nSmith and say: Hey, by the way, could you deploy one more time? There \nis another unit that is not ready. Can you deploy one more time? It is \nastonishing that the Air Force would do this.\n  We had a commission in there. The commission did not survive. I have \ntalked about that with several of my colleagues who were on the \nconference. Even though this wing has had more nautical miles of \nmilitary training than any other unit in the Air National Guard, even \nthough it is closer in proximity to its flying range, its bombing range \nthan any other unit--it is the best setup in all of North America to \nhave the 188th where it is located at Fort Smith and at Fort Chaffee, \nwhich is basically the Army National Guard's national training center \nright there--they love to train with A-10s; we are talking about close \nair support vehicles here--I do not think the Air Force took that into \nconsideration for 1 minute. I think they made an arbitrary decision \nhere. I do not think it is in our national interests. I do not think it \nis in the interests of our national security. I am putting people on \nnotice that this fight is not over. I understand about the down \npressure. I get all that stuff. But this fight is not over. I am not \ngoing to object to this bill today. I am going to vote for its \nadoption.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \ngreat leadership.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his \nenormous contributions to the deliberations and work of our committee. \nI understand the frustration he feels, and we have promised, as Senator \nLevin and I have promised a number of Members on both sides of the \nCapitol, we will have extensive hearings on this whole issue of Guard-\nAir Force relationships and force structure for the 21st century. We \nappreciate his commitment to his outstanding members of the Guard.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the fiscal year 2013 National \nDefense Authorization Act conference report. This will be the 51st \nconsecutive year the Congress will pass legislation authorizing the \nbudget of the Department of Defense and supporting our men and women in \nuniform.\n  I thank the members of the Armed Services Committee for their hard \nwork, especially my colleague and friend, Senator Carl Levin. Carl and \nI have worked together for many years on this committee, the last 6 as \nchairman and ranking member. In that time, Carl has demonstrated a \nthoughtful approach to defense oversight and legislating. His genial \ndisposition--which I believe complements my own temperament well--masks \nresolute support for a strong national defense and a tenacious will \nensure that defense dollars are wisely spent. Carl, you are a trusted \npartner and a patriot.\n  This conference report is the product of 10 months of legislative \neffort, including 53 hearings on the full range of national security \npriorities. After marking up the President's defense budget request in \nMay, the committee unanimously reported a bill to the Senate on June 4. \nSix months to the day later, the full Senate passed the bill 98 to 0. \nIn a hopeful sign of the return of regular order to the Chamber, we \npassed the bill after 33 hours of debate and an open process that \nresulted in 397 amendments filed, of which 143 were included in the \nSenate-passed bill.\n  Our use of an open amendment process on the Senate floor demonstrated \nthat when it comes to addressing national defense, the Senate can still \nwork together in a bipartisan manner. However, before we engage in too \nmuch self-congratulation, we should ask ourselves why we are concluding \nthe most important annual authorization bill 3 months after the fiscal \nyear began, and why we have yet to enact a single appropriations bill \nfor any Department or agency of government. The Congress has been \ncaught in so many political impasses of late that we have effectively \nabrogated our responsibility to provide for the timely authorization \nand appropriation of Federal programs. The result is increased cost, \ndecreased efficiency, and our willful enabling of dysfunction in \ngovernment. We can and must do better.\n  The Defense authorization conference report before the Senate \nprovides for the continued readiness of our Armed Forces and the well-\nbeing of servicemembers and their families. It authorizes pay and \nbenefits, research and development, weapons procurement, and military \nconstruction projects, and contains provisions designed to improve \nacquisition and contracting. It also provides the resources, training, \nequipment, and authorities necessary for our military to continue \nsupporting the Afghanistan National Security Forces as they assume \nincreased responsibility throughout Afghanistan.\n  This conference report also contains tough sanctions aimed at curbing \nIran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Iran continues its reckless ways in \npursuit of a nuclear weapon. Just recently, the IAEA confirmed that \nIran is expected to double the number of centrifuges at its underground \nenrichment site to 1,400. One provision in this report, originally \nsponsored by Senators Kirk and Menendez, designates Iran's energy, \nshipping, and ship-building sectors as entities of proliferation \nconcern, subjecting many transactions with these entities to sanction. \nIt would impose sanctions on persons supplying to Iran certain listed \nmaterials relevant to these sectors, to certain Iranian Specially \nDesignated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or to be used in connection \nwith certain Iranian military programs. Finally, it would designate the \nIranian state broadcasting company as a human rights abuser for airing \nforced confessions and show trials; preventing other entities from \ndoing business with it; and banning any travel to the United States.\n  This conference report also contains a provision that authorizes an \nincrease of up to 1,000 marines for the Marine Corps Embassy Security \nGroup. The tragic events in Benghazi on September 11 demonstrate that \nthe security environment facing our diplomatic corps is as dangerous as \never. This provision will provide for the end-strength and resources \nnecessary to support an increase in Marine Corps security at locations \nidentified by the Secretary of State to be at risk of terrorist attack. \nSuch an increase was also recommended by the Accountability Review \nBoard--the independent panel convened by Secretary Clinton to \ninvestigate the events surrounding the Benghazi attack.\n  The murder of innocents continues in Syria, with over 40,000 people \nmurdered by the Assad regime. This conference report contains a \nprovision that requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \nsubmit a comprehensive report identifying the limited military \nactivities that could deny or degrade the ability of the Assad regime \nto use air power against civilians and opposition groups. This \nprovision explicitly notes that it neither authorizes the use of \nmilitary force nor serves as a declaration of war against Syria.\n  In the area of military personnel, the conference report provides a \n1.7-percent pay raise for servicemembers, and over 30 types of \nincentives aimed at strengthening enlistment and retention programs. It \nreinforces Department of Defense programs to prevent sexual assault and \nwill improve the care and management of wounded warriors and those \ntransitioning to civilian life after military service.\n  The report also recognizes that, in an era of fiscal austerity, the \nDepartment of Defense must reduce costs wherever possible, including \nforce structure by, for example, approving nearly all of the fiscal \nyear 2013 increment of the President's proposed reduction of 123,900 \nmilitary personnel over the next 5 years. But it also requires a \nsimilar reduction in civilian and contractor personnel over that same \ntime period.\n  In addition, the report acknowledges a revised plan by the Air Force \nto reduce its force structure and retire or divest military aircraft in \norder to respond to defense budget cuts proposed by the administration. \nWhile my State of Arizona fared better than many States, the Air \nForce's plan includes a cost-saving proposal to convert the manning of \nan A-10 Warthog training\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nsquadron based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson from the \nactive component to the Reserve, resulting in a decrease of \napproximately 130 personnel assigned to the base. I support the need \nfor the military services to find ways to reduce costs and realize that \nwe all will have to bear the burden of the impact of reduced defense \nspending.\n  Despite modest improvements in recent defense acquisitions, the \nDepartment has much work to do to improve its ability to identify and \nreduce waste. This conference report contains a number of provisions \nintended to improve oversight on defense contracting, including helping \nto detect and prevent human trafficking in government contracting. \nThere are also provisions that would help ensure that the Department \nbecomes fully auditable by 2017, as required under law, while improving \nprocurement of the business systems it needs to become auditable. Other \nprovisions help reform how the Federal Government conducts procurement \nduring contingency operations and help ensure that certain \nwhistleblowers who identify waste, fraud, and abuse are protected. The \nconference report also increases transparency into shipbuilding \nprograms, including Ford Class aircraft carriers and Littoral Combat \nShips.\n  Another important provision in this report addresses cybersecurity, \nby requiring consultation with Congress if a decision is made to \nestablish U.S. Cyber Command as a unified command and that defense \ncontractors notify the Department of Defense of any network intrusions.\n  Still another provision in the report requires that, following a \ndecision by the President to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit to Congress his assessment \nof the risk of that force reduction to our mission and security \ninterests.\n  This report also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to \nCongress a report on the investment plan and resources needed to carry \nout the U.S. strategy in Asia. I remain uncertain that the Department's \nplan for the realignment of U.S. military forces in the Asia Pacific \nRegion is adequately supported by budgets and resources in future \nyears. The Center for Strategic and International Studies released a \nreport in August 2012 that raised concerns about whether the plans and \nstrategy proposed by the Department earlier this year are adequately \nsupported by budgets and resources in future years.\n  Another provision helps protect the Navy's rich tradition of vessel \nnaming. The name the Navy selects for a vessel should not be tarnished \nin any way by controversy. Unfortunately, controversy has surrounded \nsome of the Navy's recent vessel-naming choices. This bill, therefore, \nsets forth appropriate and necessary standards, grounded in historical \npractice, to guide the Secretary of the Navy's decisions on future \nvessel naming, and requires that the Secretary seek the approval of the \ncongressional defense committees before announcing or assigning a \nvessel's name.\n  A particularly important provision gives priority to the Forest \nService and Coast Guard to acquire surplus Air Force aircraft, allowing \nthe Forest Service to strengthen its fire suppression capability.\n  This conference report also directs the Secretary of Defense to \ndesignate assignment of military officers as instructors on the faculty \nof West Point, the Naval Academy or the Air Force Academy as the \nequivalent of a joint duty assignment to satisfy joint duty \nrequirements.\n  Finally, this report extends for another year important prohibitions \nand restrictions on the transfer and release of military detainees from \nGuantanamo, and the construction or modification of facilities in the \nU.S. to house them. It also establishes congressional notification \nrequirements for military detainees held on naval vessels and for the \nrelease of third-country nationals held in military detention in \nAfghanistan. In addition, it clearly affirms that nothing in last \nyear's defense authorization bill or the 2001 Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force restricts or denies a person's existing habeas corpus \nrights or any other constitutional right.\n  As we look forward to Christmas, I remind my fellow Members to \nremember the beneficiaries of this legislation--the men and women of \nour Armed Forces, who serve our Nation bravely and selflessly. Passing \nthis conference report is the very least we can do for so many who are \nwilling to give all they have to defend our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the conference report of the \nFiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the ``small but mighty'' Senate Armed \nServices Committee Republican staff, who have worked tirelessly and \neffectively in support of me and our members. These loyal staff \nmembers, many of whom have served on the committee staff for many \nyears, deserve our sincere appreciation for their dedication to \nnational security. They are Adam Barker, Pablo Carrillo, Chris Brose, \nLauren Davis, Church Hutton, Daniel Lerner, Greg Lilly, Elizabeth \nLopez, Lucian Niemeyer, Bryan Parker, Ann Elise Sauer, and Diana \nTabler.\n  Mr. President, again, with great reluctance, I thank our staff who \nhave done such a wonderful job. They really have done great. As I say, \nI am very reluctant to admit it, but we could not have gotten here \nwithout their hard work on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                           Alternative Fuels\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for the purposes \nof a colloquy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Senator Levin and Senator Hagan are here today to talk \nabout the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes funds \nfor our troops. This is an important piece of legislation and I have \nalways supported making sure that our military has the equipment, \nresources and effective policies it needs to perform its missions.\n  Mr. President, during floor consideration of the defense \nauthorization bill, the Senate took two important votes regarding \nalternative fuels, signifying that we stood with our military leaders. \nWe eliminated two provisions that would have severely limited the \nDepartment of Defense's ability to invest in alternative fuels.\n  Both votes were bipartisan, and my friend and colleague Senator Hagan \nsponsored one of those amendments. I commend Senator Hagan's leadership \nand her hard work on this issue.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Senator Murray. I was proud to stand with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support efforts across the \nfederal government that will help provide our military with the \nstrategic advantages it needs to remain atop the world's powers.\n  A critical component to achieving this goal is to ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense is not solely dependent on one fuel source.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense is committed to addressing \nthis critical national security risk, and is taking a joint approach to \ndo so. In August 2011, the Secretaries of the Departments of \nAgriculture, Energy, and Navy signed a memorandum of understanding to \ninvest $170 million each to spur the production of advanced aviation \nand marine biofuels under the Defense Production Act.\n  This joint MOU also requires substantial investment from the private \nsector, with at least a 1-to-1 match.\n  Our senior military leaders understand that programs such as this MOU \nare critical to national security. In July, the Secretary of the Navy, \nthe Chief of Naval Operations, and the Marine Corps Commandant \nexpressed their concern to Chairman Levin:\n\n       ``The demand for fuel in theater means we depend on \n     vulnerable supply lines, the protection of which puts lives \n     at risk. Our potential adversaries both on land and at sea \n     understand this critical vulnerability and seek to exploit \n     it.''\n\n  Given the importance of this MOU to our national security, I was \ndisappointed when an amendment was adopted by one vote during the \nSenate Armed Services Committee mark-up that would prevent the Navy \nfrom participating further in the MOU. When the bill was considered on \nthe Senate floor, I, along with a group of my colleagues, offered an \namendment to strike this provision.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased when my amendment passed in a bipartisan \nmanner with 54 votes. I believe it sent an important message to \nconferees.\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n  However, I was very disappointed to see that although the conference \nreport does not prohibit further involvement in the MOU by DOD, it does \nrestrict the Department's participation in construction of alternative \nfuel refineries until the other agencies contribute matching funds.\n  However, I have been assured by Chairman Levin that the conference \ncommittee intends for this restriction to only apply to fiscal year \n2013 funds. It would not constrain fiscal year 2012 funds in any way. I \nask Chairman Levin, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, that is correct. The language does not apply to \nfiscal year 2012 funds. We should all expect the agencies involved to \nadhere to the framework set forth in last year's memorandum of \nunderstanding.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Chairman Levin. I appreciate his continued \nsupport on this issue. Ensuring that our military leaders have the \nflexibility they need to invest in alternative fuels is important to \nour national security. I look forward to continuing to work with the \nChairman on this important issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of the \nchairman, Senator Levin, and the ranking member, Senator McCain, on the \nfiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act conference \nagreement this whole year.\n  They have crafted reasonable, responsible compromises in many areas \nof defense policy. I appreciate that the conferees were able to begin \nrebalancing our force even as we continue to wind down our presence in \nAfghanistan.\n  The men and women in uniform, as well as their families, appreciate \nthat even in this tough fiscal environment the bill would authorize a \n1.7 percent across-the-board pay raise.\n  I also want to acknowledge that Conferees retained my amendment \nimplementing visa bans and asset freezes against those supporting the \nM23 rebels in Congo.\n  But there are also several deeply troubling provisions that I must \npoint out. The first issue goes to fundamental questions about basic \nconstitutional protections. Last year I voted against the Defense \nAuthorization bill because the bill included several troubling \nprovisions relating to the treatment and custody of detainees. These \nprovisions make it harder for the government to fight terrorism and are \ninconsistent with America's commitment to our Constitution and \nfundamental human rights.\n  This legislation--for the first time in American history--requires \nthe military to take custody of detainees in the United States.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller strongly objected to this military \ncustody requirement. In a letter to the Senate last year, Director \nMueller said the bill would, quote, ``inhibit our ability to convince \ncovered arrestees to cooperate immediately, and provide critical \nintelligence.''\n  Director Mueller concluded that this provision ``introduces a \nsubstantial element of uncertainty as to what procedures are to be \nfollowed in the course of a terrorism investigation in the United \nStates.''\n  Last year's bill also included a provision that could be interpreted \nto authorize the indefinite detention--without charge or trial--of \nAmerican citizens in the United States.\n  And the bill included restrictions that would make it virtually \nimpossible to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which our most \nsenior defense and intelligence officials have told us is a recruitment \ntool for Al Qaeda.\n  I was hopeful that this year the Defense Authorization bill would \nundo some of the damage done by last year's bill. Unfortunately, that \nis not the case.\n  I am troubled that the conference report does not include the \nFeinstein-Paul amendment, which passed the Senate by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 67-29.\n  This amendment would have prohibited the indefinite detention of \nAmerican citizens and lawful permanent residents apprehended in the \nU.S. unless this detention is expressly authorized by Congress.\n  This amendment would have made it clear that last year's Defense \nAuthorization bill--as well as the authorization to use military force \nthat Congress passed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks--did not \nauthorize indefinite detention of Americans in the United States.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that is consistent with our \nConstitution and fundamental human rights. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment \nof the Constitution provides simply that ``no person shall be deprived \nof life, liberty, or property without due process of law.''\n  But the conference report struck the Feinstein-Paul amendment. \nInstead, the conference report includes a provision stating that the \nuse of force authorization and last year's Defense Authorization bill \nshould not be construed to deny the right to challenge their detention \nin court--the legal term is habeas corpus--to individuals detained in \nthe U.S. who would otherwise have this right.\n  This provision is essentially meaningless. The Supreme Court has \nalready held that anyone in the custody of our government has the right \nto habeas corpus.\n  This provision would not prohibit long-term detention of American \ncitizens without trial. Without the Feinstein-Paul amendment, it \nremains unclear whether indefinite detention is permitted.\n  I also continue to oppose provisions in the conference report that \nlimit the administration's ability to close the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility.\n  Like last year's Defense Authorization bill, this legislation \nprovides that no detainee held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to \nthe United States, even for the purpose of holding him for the rest of \nhis life in a federal super-maximum security facility.\n  And like last year's bill, this legislation provides that the \ngovernment may not construct or modify any facility in the United \nStates for the purpose of holding a Guantanamo Bay detainee.\n  The Obama administration has threatened to veto the conference report \nbecause of these provisions. Here is what the administration says: \n``Since these restrictions have been on the books, they have limited \nthe Executive's ability to manage military operations in an ongoing \narmed conflict, harmed the country's diplomatic relations with allies \nand counterterrorism partners, and provided no benefit whatsoever to \nour national security.''\n  I agree. I continue to believe that closing Guantanamo is an \nimportant national security priority for our Nation.\n  And I am joined by many national security and military leaders, who \nsay that closing Guantanamo will make us safer. Among them: General \nColin Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nSecretary of State; Former Republican Secretaries of State James Baker, \nHenry Kissinger, and Condoleezza Rice; Former Defense Secretary Robert \nGates; Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff; and dozens of other retired admirals and generals.\n  Retired Admiral Don Guter was the Navy Judge Advocate General at the \nPentagon on 9/11. Listen to what he said just a few weeks ago: ``I want \njustice. But Guantanamo has not provided that justice and has not made \nus safer. . . . Guantanamo remains a recruiting tool for terrorists and \nwill remain so until that prison is shuttered.''\n  I also received a letter from dozens of human rights and religious \norganizations pointing out that many people around the world view \nGuantanamo as a symbol of America's retreat from our traditional role \nas a human-rights champion.\n  These detainee provisions are not just bad human rights and national \nsecurity policy. They are completely unnecessary. Look at the track \nrecord. Since 9/11, our counterterrorism professionals have prevented \nanother terrorist attack in the United States.\n  And more than 400 terrorists have successfully been prosecuted and \nconvicted in federal court and are now being safely held in federal \nprisons. A few of the terrorists who have been convicted in federal \ncourt and are serving long prison sentences: Umar Faruk Abulmutallab, \nthe Underwear Bomber; Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 WTC \nbombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheikh; 20th 9/11 \nhijacker Zacarias Moussaoui; and Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber.\n  Unfortunately, the provisions in this conference report limit the \nflexibility\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nof the administration to respond to terrorism in the most effective \nway. And they do so in a way that calls into question our commitment to \nour Constitution and human rights.\n  I am also concerned with the message this conference report sends to \nthe millions of Americans who feel strongly that our gun laws need to \nbe reformed after the mass murder in Newtown, CT.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has considered and passed a steady \nstream of legislation that has weakened the gun laws on the books.\n  For example, Congress passed a law to end the Reagan-era ban on \nloaded guns in National Parks; passed a law to require Amtrak to allow \nguns to be transported on their trains even though Amtrak determined \nafter 9/11 that this was too risky; and passed a number of \nappropriations riders that made it harder for law enforcement agencies \nto enforce gun laws. I opposed these efforts, but they became law.\n  Things need to be different now. The growing toll of daily shootings \nin communities across the nation and the murder of twenty children at \nSandy Hook Elementary School have caused Americans to say enough with \nthe constant efforts to roll back gun laws.\n  It's time for a new conversation on how to best protect America's \nchildren from gun violence. That conversation is now underway with the \nVice President's task force.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report contains a provision that yet \nagain weakens gun laws currently on the books. It grants Federal \nconcealed carry privileges to thousands of individuals even though the \nlaws of my State and other States may not permit these individuals to \ncarry concealed weapons.\n  While this provision was added before the Newtown tragedy, and while \nthere may be legitimate reasons behind it, I am troubled that this is \nthe first gun-related legislation that Congress will pass after the \nNewtown shooting.\n  I would much prefer that Congress's first response to Newtown be a \nmore balanced approach that reflects the recommendations of the Vice \nPresident's task force. Congress should not continue voting to weaken \ngun laws while the Vice President's task force is doing its work.\n  There is another issue in this conference agreement that is very \ntroubling, and that concerns the Navy's energy requirements for the \nfuture. The Department of Defense is an enormous consumer of energy, \nespecially fuel for the Navy's global fleet. Every time the price of a \nbarrel of oil increases by $1, the Navy's total fuel costs increase by \n$31 million.\n  For our men and women in uniform, energy policy is about security and \nbudgets. That's why Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus is focused on \nshifting Navy's energy consumption to fifty percent renewable fuels by \n2020.\n  But the Defense Department's goal is compromised with this conference \nreport.\n  We voted here in the Senate, on an amendment I was proud to co-\nsponsor, to ensure that the military has all the tools it needs to \ninvest in technologies that will reduce fuel costs and enhance \nstrategic capabilities.\n  I was glad to see that the conference committee preserved the Navy's \nfull ability to buy biofuels in the future. But then the conferees \nadopted provisions that undermine that goal.\n  One provision will effectively end a joint project between the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of \nAgriculture to build a refinery for biofuels.\n  It is unfortunate that this language was included in the conference \nreport because this provision was not originally included in the House- \nor Senate-passed versions of the bill.\n  In fact, Senator Hagan sponsored an amendment, which I co-sponsored, \nthat specifically removed a similar provision from the bill. Senator \nHagan's amendment was adopted on the Senate floor by a vote of 54 to \n41.\n  And as the House-passed defense bill also supported the joint \nproject, it was surprising to see that the conference committee added a \nnew provision to severely limit the biofuels partnership.\n  This new provision is in direct opposition to the bills supported by \na majority of Members in both chambers and I am disappointed to see \nthat the conference committee went against the wishes of the Senate and \nincluded it.\n  Finally, I must also mention the bill's impact on my home state of \nIllinois on a particular issue. I appreciate Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain working with the Illinois and Iowa delegation on a \nbipartisan basis to require an Army plan to sustain Rock Island \nArsenal, and all the other aspects of our nation's organic industrial \nbase. Prior Army planning had not included long-term workload plans to \nsustain the arsenals. I look forward to working with the Committee and \nthe Army as this is implemented next year.\n  This development notwithstanding, I am concerned about a provision in \nthe bill retained in conference that could require arbitrary cuts to \nthe civilian workforce not supported by the Department's strategy. I \nco-sponsored Senator Cardin's amendment to repeal this provision, which \nunfortunately did not pass on the Senate floor. The House version \ncontained no similar provision and conferees kept much of the original \nlanguage. I will continue to work with the Defense Department and the \nCommittee to ensure that the flexibility in this provision is used to \nensure strategy-driven planning for the civilian workforce.\n  As I stated up front, the conference report makes a number of \ncritical, responsible decisions that provide our men and women in \nuniform with the resources and policy authorities they need to provide \nfor our common defense.\n  Nonetheless, its fundamental weaknesses in detainee policy and other \nareas mean that I am regretfully unable to support passage of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On November 28, 2012, the Senate overwhelmingly passed my \nlegislation, the Dale Long Public Safety Officers Benefits Improvement \nAct of 2012 as an amendment to the bill the Senate will likely pass \ntoday, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.\n  At that time, by a margin of 85 to 11, the Senate sent a strong \nmessage of support to the men and women across America who serve their \nfellow citizens as public safety officers. The Senate made clear that \nthis important policy, in place since 1976, is worthy of our continued \nattention and our efforts to make it better for those it is intended to \nbenefit. I thank the 85 Senators who voted in favor of my amendment on \nNovember 28, and for standing with first responders across the United \nStates.\n  As the Senate gives its consideration to final approval of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, I want to take a few moments to \ndiscuss what my amendment contains, and the intent behind the various \nprovisions within it. Before I do, however, in light of the terrible \ntragedy in Newtown, CT that occurred on December 14, let me take a \nmoment to recognize the first responders of Newtown and all who \nanswered the call on that terrible day. In the midst of such incredible \nsadness, let us recognize the men and women who answered that call, who \nput the well-being of schoolchildren, teachers, and staff ahead of \ntheir own safety and entered that school to face the unknown and do \nwhatever they could to help. And let us recognize those who stood \nbravely to render medical aid and give comfort to others amidst \nunspeakable violence and sorrow.\n  In recent days, a quote by the late children's educator and minister \nFred Rogers has been shared widely among Americans searching for some \nlight within the darkness of what occurred in Newtown. In the \nquotation, he recalls how in the face of something frightening, his \nmother used to tell him, ``Look for the helpers. You will always find \npeople who are helping''. He said then that he was comforted ``by \nrealizing that there are still so many helpers--so many caring people \nin the world.'' His words exemplify our nation's first responders. I \nknow that this tragedy affects them just as deeply as it affects all of \nus and in some ways that are difficult for us to fully understand. But \nthe dedication and bravery of these men and women is something that I \nwant to acknowledge and commend. It is their determination and the \nactions of first responders across the country every day that serve as \nthe foundation and inspiration for the Federal policy we strengthen for \nthem today.\n  The centerpiece of my amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct is a measure to fill a gap in the\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nPublic Safety Officers Benefits, PSOB, law, which was exposed following \nthe tragic death of a decorated emergency medical technician who served \nthe community of Bennington, VT. Dale Long was killed in the line of \nduty in a traffic accident while responding to an emergency call. When \nhis surviving family members looked in to filing a claim with the PSOB \noffice at the Justice Department, they learned that a technicality made \nit impossible for the PSOB office to review Dale Long's claim.\n  Under the PSOB law, in order for an emergency medical technician \nserving the public to be covered, he or she must be part of a public \nagency, as defined in the law. In Vermont, and elsewhere in the United \nStates, particularly in rural areas, there are ambulance companies that \ndo not have a formalized relationship with a state or municipal \ngovernment, and therefore are not considered a public agency under the \nlaw. This technicality meant that Dale Long, and others like him across \nthe country who serve their communities as part of a private, non-\nprofit rescue company, subject to the same risks and stresses, did not \nhave the security of coverage under the PSOB program. Dale Long's \ntragedy exposed this gap, and I introduced legislation to fix it.\n  Mr. Long worked for the Bennington Rescue Squad, a private, non-\nprofit entity serving Bennington, VT. The Bennington Rescue Squad has \nbeen serving the people of Bennington, VT since 1963, and provides \nparamedic 911 services to that community. It is an integral part of the \npublic safety infrastructure of Bennington, Vermont. Similarly situated \nmen and women who serve others as a part of private, non-profit rescue \nsquads should be placed in the same position that all other EMTs, \nfirefighters, and police officers are relative to the PSOB program. \nToday, after nearly three years of work in Congress, and through the \ntireless advocacy of so many in the public safety community like the \nAmerican Ambulance Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nInternational Association of Firefighters, and many others, I expect \nthat this measure will be enacted. This is their law.\n  The other provisions in this legislation were developed around the \nprovision I drafted to support Dale Long's survivors and all who may \nfind themselves in similar circumstances. In cooperation with House \nJudiciary Chairman Lamar Smith, I assembled a host of other measures to \nmake the PSOB program more equitable, and more efficient for the \nfamilies of our fallen first responders and those first responders who \nhave been permanently disabled in the line of duty.\n  Before describing those measures, and the intent behind them, it is \nimportant to consider the overarching intent behind the original \nenactment of the PSOB law. In 1976, Congress enacted the Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits Act in order to accomplish several policy goals. \nFirst, Congress sought to provide uniformity to a disparate system for \nfirst responder benefits across the country and to ensure that \nirrespective of the benefits provided in a state, all first responders, \nregardless of where they lived, would benefit from meaningful \nassistance. In doing so, Congress also intended to ensure that the \nFederal PSOB benefit was to be provided in addition to any other death \nor disability benefits that may be provided by a state. This policy was \naffirmed by the Supreme Court in the 1986 case of Rose v. Arkansas \nState Police. There, in affirming Congress' intent to protect the \nFederal benefit from reduction by the provision of a state benefit, the \nCourt identified that Congress wished to address the inadequacy of \ndeath benefits paid to first responders in some states.\n  At the time of the original law's enactment, Congress also believed \nand intended that a uniform Federal benefit, irrespective of and immune \nfrom reduction by any state benefit, would encourage recruitment and \nretention of qualified public safety officers. The United States Court \nof Federal Claims, in upholding the award of a PSOB benefit that had \nbeen wrongly denied, wrote in Demutiis v. United States: ``Recognizing \nthe extraordinary risks incurred by officers in serving the public, \nCongress provided for these death benefits not only as a matter of \nequity, but also to promote the recruitment and retention of safety \nofficers as part of the national fight against crime.'' This incentive, \ncentral to congressional policy, is only meaningful and effective when \nthe process for providing these benefits is efficient and free from \nunnecessary delay or dispute.\n  Congress sought with the law to recognize the very real risks that \npublic safety officers face on a daily basis--whether fighting a fire, \napprehending a criminal, or providing lifesaving medical assistance \nduring an emergency situation.\n  The House Judiciary Committee, in its report at the time of PSOB's \noriginal enactment, noted that there was a moral component to this \nprogram as well. Then, the House Judiciary Committee characterized the \noriginal Act as Congress' ``recognition of society's moral obligation \nto compensate the families of those individuals who daily risk their \nlives to preserve peace and to protect our lives and property.'' I \nagreed then, and I believe now as strongly as ever that supporting our \nfirst responders is the right thing to do.\n  The passage of this amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2013 will add efficiencies to claims processing and \nexpand benefits available under the program, and will further and \nreaffirm Congress' original intent.\n  This legislation, which the House of Representatives has approved, \nand which the Senate now considers, makes several important changes to \nthe broader PSOB law, including the Hometown Heroes law, which I was \nproud to author in 2003. I will take a moment now to discuss those \nprovisions.\n  The hometown heroes law makes first responders who have died as the \nresult of a heart attack or stroke in the line of duty, or within a \ndiscrete time period following the period while the first responder was \non duty, eligible for a death or disability benefit under the PSOB law. \nThe amendment we consider strengthens this law. It does so by adding to \nthe list of qualifying health incidents ``vascular rupture,'' thus \nbroadening coverage under the hometown heroes law. Under current law, \nin order to be eligible for a benefit, an officer must have suffered a \nheart attack or stroke. There are, unfortunately, cases on hold within \nthe PSOB office that are not being processed due to the presence of a \nvascular rupture, which is nevertheless a health event consistent with \nthe type of stressful activity associated with the work that first \nresponders do every day.\n  The hometown heroes statute recognizes those situations where an \nofficer engages in ``nonroutine, stressful or strenuous physical'' \nactivity. This definition and its implementing regulations have been \nthe source of concern for many in the first responder community. \n``Nonroutine, stressful or strenuous'' activity is defined in the law \nto exclude ``actions of a clerical, administrative, or nonmanual \nnature.'' Thus the law contains a very limited universe of activities \nthat are expressly excluded from the hometown heroes definition or what \ntype of activity is covered. As author of the hometown heroes law, it \nwas my intent to make sure that those first responders, who suffer a \ncatastrophic health event while on duty or shortly following a period \nof duty, were covered. No one should doubt the stresses encountered \nevery day by our first responders. If we know one thing about the work \nthat our first responders do, it is that it is unpredictable and is \nvery difficult to characterize as routine. Congress intended that the \nlanguage delineating the type of activity that would give rise to \nhometown heroes claim be construed broadly and the addition of \n``vascular rupture'' to the list of qualifying health events \nunderscores that intent.\n  In 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine the \nDepartment of Justice implementation of the hometown heroes law. This \nhearing followed many calls from the first responder community to \nprovide oversight on its implementation. I believe this hearing helped \nto move the needed regulations along, and served to remind relevant \nofficials that this undertaking and policy was important to the \nlegislative branch. It served to reaffirm that at bottom Congress was \nseeking\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nwith this law to benefit first responders and that ambiguities should \nbe resolved in favor of the claimant consistent with the overarching \ncongressional policy.\n  Congress did not intend for lawyers at the Department of Justice to \nargue with claimants over the meaning of ``nonroutine, stressful or \nstrenuous physical'' activity. Anyone who has served as a public safety \nofficer knows that there is nothing ``routine'' about the work. From \nresponding to an emergency scene to render assistance, performing a \ntraffic stop that can go very wrong in an instant, maintaining custody \nof inmates, or engaging in a training or fitness exercise, \n``nonroutine, stressful or strenuous physical'' activities are \nexpressed clearly in the statute, and Congress understood, and \nintended, that the vast majority of line-of-duty work in which first \nresponders engage is ``nonroutine, stressful or strenuous physical'' \nactivity. As the statute makes abundantly clear, with its limited \nexceptions, activities that would be considered routine, and not \nstressful or strenuous physical activity, consist generally of clerical \nor administrative activities. Indeed, given the Hometown Heroes \nstatutory presumption, which directs PSOB fact finders to presume that \na heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture is an injury sustained in \nthe line of duty for purposes of a PSOB benefit, Congress made the \njudgment and intends for such claims to be weighted heavily in favor of \nproviding the benefit.\n  Under the law, the presumption in favor of the benefit may only be \novercome when PSOB fact finders are presented with evidence that \nfactors other than duty-related activities led to a stroke, heart \nattack, or vascular rupture. The legislation we consider today refines \nthe existing statutory standard to emphasize that the ``mere presence'' \nof cardiovascular risk factors in a fallen first responder is not \nenough to overcome this presumption. That is, simply because a public \nsafety officer who suffers a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture \nmay have had present risk factors or other indicators of the presence \nof cardiovascular disease, that is not enough to overcome the strong \npresumption in favor of eligibility. Nothing in this legislation or the \nrefinement to the Hometown Heroes law should be construed as a \ndeparture from this presumption. Indeed, the intent of this provision \nis to clarify that the burden to overcome the presumption is a heavy \none. As Congress recognized in 2003 with the enactment of the hometown \nheroes law and its statutory presumption, serving as a first responder \npresents physical and psychological challenges unlike any other \noccupation in civil society.\n  In order to expedite claims processing for first responders and to \nreduce administrative costs within the PSOB office, the legislation we \nconsider contains a measure to include a ``medical or claims examiner'' \nwithin the definition of hearing examiner. If enacted, this measure, \none resource for the fact finder, is to be used carefully and limited \nto those instances where the fact finder determines that a ``medical \n[or claims] examiner'' within a medical specialty or subspecialty may \nprovide in-person examinations or record reviews to gain greater \ninsight regarding a claim. In turn, that examiner will submit a report \nto the fact finder for consideration. Nothing in this measure, or the \nHouse Report's analysis of the companion bill H.R.4018, should be \nconstrued to remove the discretion of the fact finder. The fact finder \nmust weigh the totality of the evidence, including reports of \nindependent treating physicians whose experience and expertise \nregarding an officer's medical history and current condition are \ninvaluable for a greater understanding of the case.\n  The legislation further amends the PSOB statute to clarify and \nrestate existing practice and procedure that PSOB payments shall be \nmade ``only upon determination by the Bureau that the facts legally \nwarrant payments.'' Without question the Bureau has the duty to \nresponsibly administer the PSOB program according to the law and \nregulations. Concurrent with this duty is the Bureau's responsibility \nto survivors: the Bureau must use its best and appropriate efforts to \nensure that, where the facts warrant payment, claimants shall receive \nthe benefit.\n  This means nothing more than that it is the PSOB office, the Bureau \nof Justice Assistance, as the entity responsible for administering PSOB \nclaims, which is charged to make determinations on claims. This does \nnot approve or compel PSOB fact finders to abdicate to legal counsel \ntheir responsibilities to decide claims. The claims process itself in \nmost instances should be sufficient for PSOB fact finders to make the \ndetermination required, on the facts presented, under the law. This \nprovision is not an invitation in any way, absent evidence of fraud, to \nsubject claims to unnecessary, protracted legal or medical review. Nor \nshould this provision be construed to alter the well-established \nstandard of review applicable to the claims process, that where the \nfacts of a case ``more likely than not'' warrant payment of a claim, \nthe benefit should be approved. This is a crucial aspect of the \nadministration of the PSOB benefit. And I would take a moment to \nrespectfully disagree with language contained in the House Judiciary \nCommittee's report on the legislation we pass today. Language in the \nHouse Report to accompany H.R.4018, which appears to require the \nDepartment of Justice `` to objectively test or verify each material \nfactual assertion made and obtain relevant information beyond what \nclaimants may provide'' in order to discharge its legal duty, is \ninconsistent with the intent of the PSOB law. I would note my strong \ndisagreement with this language, which fails to appreciate Congress' \noriginal intent in enacting this law and should therefore be rejected.\n  When Congress enacted this law in 1976, it did not intend then, and \ndoes not today, that this benefit program be an adversarial proceeding \nfor the families of fallen public safety officers or those public \nsafety officers who have suffered a career-ending disability in the \nline of duty. While the PSOB program has been amended many times over \nthe years to expand coverage to survivors and the public safety \ncommunity, in too many ways the program has become administratively \nmore complex and cumbersome for families to receive the benefits due \nthem. The hearing record for the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nexamination of this program on October 4, 2007 is replete with \ntestimony concerning the frustrations and unnecessary challenges too \nmany surviving families have faced. Should it be enacted, the \nlegislation we consider today and this statement reaffirm the original \npurpose of the PSOB law which, in its simplicity and true to Congress' \nintent, clearly directed that in any case in which the Bureau of \nJustice Assistance determines that a public safety officer has died of \na personal injury in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit.\n  Federal officials, who administer the PSOB program, like all Federal \nofficials involved with providing financial assistance, are under both \nan ethical and a legal duty to administer PSOB benefits in a manner \nconsistent with the controlling law and regulations. Nothing in this \nlegislation subjects Federal or contract employees determining PSOB \nclaims to any greater liability or penalties than are currently \napplicable to other government employees. As Chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, with oversight responsibilities over the \nDepartment of Justice, I have confidence that the men and women of the \nJustice Department who administer PSOB claims execute their \nresponsibilities with the highest level of integrity, and will continue \nto do so in the future with the discretion that the law provides. \nJustice Department officials should be confident that the good work \nthat they do relative to this program, even where the process of review \nmay question their judgment or conclusions, is subject to a law that \ngives them the freedom to exercise their discretion fairly and \nimpartially. The operative standard for claims evaluation under the \nPSOB law is one of ``more likely than not'', and this standard by its \nterms allows ample room for PSOB fact finders to exercise broad \ndiscretion. Indeed, it is worth recognizing that the courts have \nreversed the denial of PSOB benefits on at least eight occasions. I am \naware of no instance, however, where the approval of a PSOB benefit was \noverturned or determined to have been in error.\n  Let me conclude with a few general points about this important \nprogram. Congress enacted this law in 1976 because it recognized then, \nas we do now,\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nthat the welfare of America's public safety officers, and their \nfamilies, is worthy of our support. Congress has acted over the last 36 \nyears on several occasions to expand the law. The PSOB program was \ndesigned with that overarching principle in mind, and the Department of \nJustice, in administering the program, must make every effort to ensure \nthat the families of fallen officers and those disabled are provided \nwith the benefit to which they are entitled under the law in an \nefficient manner.\n  As the Department of Justice moves forward to implement the \nimprovements that Congress considers today, I look forward to working \nwith officials within the Department's Office of Justice Programs as \nthey carry out their work. And I look forward to seeing these measures \nput into practice swiftly and with the best interests in mind of the \nmen and woman across the country who serve all of us every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8336-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8336-S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AIR FORCE STRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the National Defense \nAuthorization bill and how it will impact the structure of the Air \nForce moving forward.\n  Of particular concern to me and my constituents is the Pittsburgh Air \nReserve Station, home of the 911th Airlift Wing located outside \nPittsburgh. In its FY13 request, the Air Force proposed the retirement \nof the installation's C-130 fleet and, by connection, the closure of \n911th. I have worked closely with the Pennsylvania delegation to fight \nagainst this proposed closure and I would in particular like to thank \nSenator Toomey and Congressmen Murphy, Doyle and Critz for all of their \nwork on this critical issue.\n  We all fought so hard against this proposed closure because we \nbelieve that the Air Force proposal did not reflect a thorough analysis \nof the merits of the 911th Airlift Wing, nor its associated cost \nsavings. In its FY13 Force Structure proposal, the Air Force did not \nprovide any analysis on how the closure of the 911th would impact the \nlocal community. The lack of transparency associated with the Air \nForce's initial proposal and infrastructure changes around the country \nis extremely troubling. This is why I supported the freeze and the \nestablishment of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air \nForce as mandated by the FY13 NDAA reported out of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  The 911th is a very efficient and cost effective unit installation \nthat is truly part of the proudly patriotic community in the Pittsburgh \narea. Its aircraft maintenance program has resulted in an increase of \naircraft availability days while saving the Pentagon more than $42 \nmillion over the last five years. Additionally, the Pentagon pays only \n$20,000 to lease more than 100 acres for the Wing, which is a small sum \nwhen compared to the parallel costs at other bases and installations. \nFinally and perhaps most importantly, an incredibly skilled and \nexperienced workforce is employed at the 911th installation, a \nsignificant and irreplaceable resource for the Air Force. It would be a \nterrible waste of taxpayer dollars if this installation were to close \nat this critical time.\n  I am disappointed in the conferees for removing language that we \nvoted on here in the Senate which would have frozen any infrastructure \nchanges within the Air Force in FY13. I think that this decision was \nmisguided and wrong.\n  But I understand that the bill also requires the Air Force to \nmaintain an additional combination of 32 C-130s and C-27s. I strongly \nbelieve that the 911th is a prime candidate for a new mission that is \ncommensurate with the decades long experience of its workforce and \nsupport from the community. On its merits and in the interests of the \ntaxpayer, a sustainable mission should be instituted at the 911th. I \nthink we are in a very strong position to make that case and I look \nforward to working closely with the Air Force to protect this critical \ninstallation.\n  It is in our National interests that our best citizens are able to \ncontinue serving their country. In Pittsburgh, some of these citizens \nhave served our country proudly for generations. We should do all we \ncan to support this tradition of service because it makes economic \nsense and is in our best national security interests.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the conference \nreport for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 \nwhich we will vote on later today.\n  I will vote yes on this bill as I did on last year's bill even though \nnothing in it effectively addresses indefinite military detention, \nwhich 67 Members of this body are now on record opposing.\n  My colleagues will recall that I introduced, with a large bipartisan \ngroup of cosponsors, an amendment that provided that U.S. citizens and \nlawful permanent residents who are apprehended on U.S. soil cannot be \ndetained indefinitely, without charge or trial. The Senate passed this \namendment by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 67 to 29. I am saddened \nand disappointed that this detention amendment was dropped in \nconference. I don't understand why we could not ensure that, at the \nvery least, American citizens and green card holders cannot be held \nindefinitely without charge or trial. As I have said over the past few \ndays, to me this is a no-brainer and is a real missed opportunity.\n  The main reason I support this bill is because it authorizes $640.7 \nbillion for fiscal year 2013 for the Department of Defense.\n  This funding ensures our troops deployed around the world--especially \nthose in Afghanistan--have the equipment, resources, and training they \nneed to defend this Nation. For example, the Defense bill fully funds \nthe President's budget request of $5.7 billion to build the capacity of \nthe Afghan National Security Forces so those forces can take over for \nU.S. forces and take the security lead throughout Afghanistan by 2014.\n  The Defense authorization bill will also provide the resources \nnecessary to support our defense strategies and allow our military to \nmodernize equipment worn out after 11 years of war in the difficult \nbattlefield environments of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Such resources include investments in our Global Hawk unmanned \naircraft, which provide critical intelligence, surveillance and \nreconnaissance information. These aircraft have also provided crucial \nsupport for disaster response efforts, including for rescue workers in \nthe wake of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster in Japan.\n  To increase diplomatic security around the world and so that we learn \nfrom the mistakes that took the lives of four Americans in Benghazi, \nthis bill requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to \nincrease--by up to 1,000--the number of marines in the Marine Corps \nsecurity guard program to be able to deploy them to troubled facilities \nto protect our personnel abroad.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate overwhelmingly passed, on a 67 to 29 vote, \nthe amendment to ban the indefinite detention of U.S. persons--citizens \nand green card holders--without charge or trial.\n  The amendment would have updated the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which \nclearly states:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  The amendment would have built on the Non-Detention Act of 1971 so \nthat it applies to not just U.S. citizens but also to green card \nholders. It would have provided that no military authorization allows \nindefinite detention of U.S. citizens and green card holders \napprehended inside the United States.\n  The detention amendment stated:\n\n       An authorization to use military force, a declaration of \n     war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the \n     detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful \n     permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the \n     United States unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes \n     such detention.\n\n  Unfortunately, as soon as the amendment passed, the language was \nmisrepresented by critics on the left as well as proponents of \nindefinite military detention on the right, particularly after a \nhandful of Senators who previously opposed this effort switched their \nvote at the last minute.\n  Make no mistake, the amendment is not a Trojan horse designed to \nsurreptitiously authorize indefinite detention in the United States. \nThe text of the amendment is clear, and the legal experts I consulted \non the amendment agree.\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\n  For example, Stephen Vladeck of American University, a law professor \nwho has litigated military detention issues in the Supreme Court and an \nexpert on national security law, testified this year before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on S. 2003, the Due Process Guarantee Act, which is \nalmost identical to the detention amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill. Professor Vladeck reviewed the statements of \nsupport for the amendment by Senators Carl Levin and Lindsey Graham--\nboth of whom advocated indefinite military detention powers in the \npast.\n  Professor Vladeck wrote:\n\n       The Graham/Levin colloquy sought to cast [the Feinstein] \n     language as doing exactly the opposite of what it says, i.e., \n     as confirming that U.S. citizens can be detained even within \n     the territorial United States pursuant to the logic of the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Hamdi [v. Rumsfeld].\n\n  Professor Vladeck concluded that Senators Levin and Graham were \n``exactly wrong'' because ``the plain text of the bill is simply \nirreconcilable with that understanding.''\n  In another article, Vladeck and Georgetown Law Professor Marty \nLederman, another expert on military detention and national security, \nwrote:\n\n       If it were to be enacted, the amendment would ensure that a \n     future president could not construe the September 18, 2001 \n     Authorization for Use of Force (AUMF), the FY2012 NDAA, or \n     any comparable statute to authorize the military detention of \n     citizens and LPRs [lawful permanent residents] apprehended \n     within the United States.\n\n  I agree with these law professors--with whom I worked, in fact, on \nthe drafting of my bill and amendment. It is true the courts have \npreviously reached ambiguous and conflicting decisions regarding \nwhether U.S. persons apprehended on American soil may be subject to \nindefinite detention under the laws of war. However, far from adding to \nthis ambiguity, I am confident this amendment would bring much-needed \nclarification to this area of the law.\n  The Feinstein detention amendment would have updated the Non-\nDetention Act of 1971 which Congress passed to repudiate the shameful \nJapanese-American internment experience during World War II. That 1971 \nlandmark legislation, which liberal critics of the detention amendment \nhave made no effort to overturn, protected only U.S. citizens from \ndetention. In contrast, the amendment broadens protections from \nindefinite detention, protecting both green card holders, called \n``lawful permanent residents'', as well as citizens.\n  At a time when civil liberties are under attack, we should not let \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good. As Professors Lederman and \nVladeck note, ``The new Feinstein amendment . . . does protect the vast \nmajority of persons in the United States from noncriminal detention \nwithout express statutory authorization . . . .''\n  As I said during the floor debate on the amendment, I would support \nextending the protections in the amendment to all persons in the United \nStates, whether lawfully or unlawfully present, but so far we have \nlacked sufficient support in the Senate to do this. Most Republican \ncosponsors of the bill said they would not support the legislation if \nit went that far.\n  Other critics misrepresent the language of the amendment by charging \nthat it could be read to imply there is an authorization to \nindefinitely detain illegal immigrants and legal visitors in the United \nStates. In doing this, they ignore the language in paragraph 3 that \nexplicitly prevents such an interpretation. Paragraph 3 of the \namendment clarifies that the text to be added to the Non-Detention Act \nof 1971 ``shall not be construed to authorize the detention of a \ncitizen of the United States, a lawful permanent resident of the United \nStates, or any other person who is apprehended in the United States.'' \nAgain, don't take my word for it. Professors Lederman and Vladeck say \nthat the amendment ``would do nothing of the sort.''\n  The bottom line: Indefinite military detention is incompatible with \nour values, and this amendment would have been a major step forward to \nmake sure we never return to the dark chapter of American history when \nwe detained Japanese-American citizens out of fear during World War II.\n  Mr. President, some have pointed to section 1029 of the conference \nreport and said that it accomplishes what the Feinstein amendment would \nhave done. That is not true.\n  The amendment offered by Congressman Gohmert regarding habeas corpus, \nwhich is now section 1029 of the underlying conference report, does \nnothing except restate that constitutional rights to file a habeas \nclaim can't be denied.\n  Consider the exact text of this section, which reads:\n\n       SEC. 1029. RIGHTS UNAFFECTED.\n       Nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force or \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 \n     shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of \n     habeas corpus or to deny any Constitutional rights in a court \n     ordained or established by or under Article III of the \n     Constitution to any person inside the United States who would \n     be entitled to the availability of such writ or to such \n     rights in the absence of such laws.\n\n  This provision doesn't do anything to add to the rights of \nindividuals inside the United States, such as citizens, because the \nwrit of habeas corpus is a constitutional right to appear before a \njudge to challenge the legality of an individual's incarceration.\n  During the colonial period, habeas corpus was understood as a writ \navailable to a prisoner, ordering his jailer to appear with the \nprisoner before a court of general jurisdiction and to justify the \nconfinement.\n  In the Constitution, after enumerating the powers of Congress, the \ndrafters inserted language guaranteeing the right to habeas when they \nstated, ``The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \nsuspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public \nSafety may require it.''\n  So habeas is a constitutional right that already applies to all \nindividuals found in the United States, and habeas rights even extend \nto noncitizen detainees held in Guantanamo, who have never even set \nfoot in the United States.\n  This was the issue before the Supreme Court in the case of Rasul v. \nBush, 2004 where, in a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice John Paul \nStevens, the Court found that noncitizen detainees at Guantanamo had \nhabeas corpus rights. Justice Stevens also wrote that the right to \nhabeas corpus is not dependent on citizenship status. The detainees \nwere therefore free to bring a habeas claim challenging their detention \nas unconstitutional.\n  Because the Constitution already grants this right explicitly--\nlegislation purporting to grant this right is ineffective and simply \nempty words, meant to make lawmakers feel good but not actually adding \nanything to the rights of the American people.\n  The question is not whether Americans still have constitutional \nrights to habeas. Of course that right and others that are guaranteed \nby the Constitution remain in place. Rather, the question is, Should \nthe military be allowed to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens in the \nfirst place? Should we allow the military to patrol our streets and \npick up citizens? I believe the answer to that question--both here in \nthe Senate and across the Nation--is a resounding no.\n  So I will continue to work to correct the flaws of the Fiscal Year \n2012 National Defense Authorization Act, and I look forward to the \ncontinued support of the 67 of my colleagues who voted for the \nFeinstein amendment this year.\n  I am confident that eventually we will build the support for this \namendment that we need on the House side too. Therefore, it is only a \nmatter of time before we prevail. The Feinstein detention amendment is \nwhat the American people want, and it would guarantee the fundamental \nliberty that they deserve.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, last August Congress \nenacted, with broad bipartisan support, the Iran Threat Reduction and \nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012, a comprehensive sanctions bill I \ncoauthored. That legislation, blending various measures introduced by \nmy colleagues with new ideas developed by the Banking Committee, \nimposed a range of tough new sanctions on the Government of Iran and \nthose who do business with it. This was done to tighten further the \nsqueeze on Iran's major revenue sources, and force its leaders finally \nto come clean on Iran's illicit nuclear program. The third major piece \nof Iran sanctions legislation to be enacted in the last 2 years, it \nfollowed the Banking Committee's Comprehensive\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nIran Sanctions and Divestment Act in July of 2010, and the sanctions \nimposed on Iran's oil purchases 1 year ago. Those combined sanctions \nhave had a powerful effect on Iran's economy, reducing its oil revenues \nby up to $5 billion per month, and causing the value of its currency to \nplummet.\n  The Defense Authorization conference report being considered today \nincludes a set of additional measures aimed at Iran which broaden and \ndeepen U.S. sanctions against its shipping, energy, shipbuilding and \nmilitary sectors, and those who deal with entities in these sectors. \nThey also require new sanctions against those supplying Iran certain \nstrategic materials, and expand the sanctions net to those who provide \nIran certain financial or insurance services.\n  All of these new sanctions, and those provided for in our legislation \nin August which will come online soon, will be implemented at a \nsensitive time, as the U.S. and our P5+1 allies prepare for what \nPresident Obama has described as a renewed push to develop a negotiated \nsolution to this problem. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran is the \nmost pressing foreign policy challenge we face, and we must continue to \ndo all we can--politically, economically, and diplomatically--to avoid \nthat result. In the coming months, it will become clear whether Iran \nwill be willing finally to change course, and agree to the terms of the \ninternational community to bring an end to its illicit nuclear program, \nallow for intrusive international inspections of its nuclear sites and \nactivities, and stop its continued support for terrorism and abuses of \nhuman rights. Given Iran's track record, there is considerable reason \nto be skeptical. But the President continues to press to resolve these \nissues diplomatically if possible, and if that can be done it is \nobviously preferable to any military alternative. Isolated \ndiplomatically, economically, and otherwise, Iran must understand that \nthe patience of the international community is fast running out. Iran's \nleaders can end the repression against their people, come clean on \ntheir nuclear program, suspend enrichment, and stop supporting \nterrorists around the globe, or they can continue to face sustained \nmultilateral economic and diplomatic pressure and deepen their \ninternational isolation.\n  Let me say a final word about the process. The new measures contained \nin this bill were offered as a Senate floor amendment, and did not come \nthrough the Banking Committee. My view has always been that any \ninnovative legislative ideas that may help force Iran to engage in \nsuccessful negotiations are worthy of serious consideration. Even so, \nin negotiating these provisions in a hurried conference committee \nprocess, procedural objections raised by House Ways and Means Committee \nmajority staff because of the way the new provisions were offered \nprompted them to insist on inserting certain exceptions related to \nimport restrictions on certain goods. While I regret that these \nexceptions were added by the conferees, and think they may need to be \naddressed in future legislation, they cannot be allowed to weaken or \nundermine implementation of these sanctions or of the broader sanctions \nregime already in place. Our staff worked hard, on a bipartisan basis, \nto ensure that the final version preserves all of the President's very \npowerful sanctions tools provided for under the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, and does not undermine that authority in any way. \nI am concerned that as we forward on sanctions an approach which is \ninattentive to these existing authorities might actually \nunintentionally undermine them.\n  As we all recognize, economic sanctions are not an end--they are a \nmeans to an end--to apply enough pressure to secure agreement from \nIran's leaders to fully, completely and verifiably abandon their \nillicit nuclear activities. The Banking Committee will continue to \nassertively oversee the President's implementation of the comprehensive \nsanctions regime, and do all we can to provide all the tools he needs \nto resolve these issues with Iran.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Pryor for his \ntremendous contribution to this bill and to this body. The fight he is \nwaging here is the correct fight. This was not done well by the Air \nForce, to put it mildly. We froze it. They amended it. We have some \nproblems with the amendment, but we had to reach a compromise with the \nHouse, which favored their modified bill, and there are some rough \nedges to it.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has very eloquently pointed out one of \nthose rough edges. We put in this place in this bill a commission to \ntry to avoid these kinds of problems in the future. That does not help \nthis year. I wish it could. But, nonetheless, it is because of the \nefforts of the Senator from Arkansas and others, who pointed out the \ndefects in the process this year, that we have been able to, hopefully, \navoid a repetition of this in the future. I thank him for the many \ncontributions he has made to this bill. His fight for his home State is \npassionate and effective, and I commend him for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back our time, if we have any remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a Senator, I have no greater \nresponsibility than to work to ensure our Nation's security. Our Armed \nForces must have the tools they need to keep our country safe. That is \nwhy I support the vast majority of the provisions in the National \nDefense Authorization Act and why I supported the bill that passed the \nSenate. I particularly note provisions that increase pay and benefits \nfor our servicemembers and retirees, ensure a drawdown of our troops in \nAfghanistan, allow female servicemembers access to basic health \nservices if they are victims of sexual assault, and limit the annual \nincreases in TRICARE prescription drug premiums. All of these \nprovisions I support and believe are important.\n  I oppose this bill because I do not believe it adequately reflects \nour principles. I believe we can do a better job of protecting our \nnational security without compromising important values than what is \ncontained in this legislation.\n  This Nation has long been a beacon of liberty and a champion of \nrights throughout the world. Yet since 9/11, in the name of security, \nwe have repeatedly betrayed our highest values. The\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\npast administration believed it could eavesdrop on Americans without a \nwarrant or court order. It utilized interrogation techniques long \nconsidered immoral, ineffective, and illegal, regardless of laws and \ntreaties. And, it intentionally sought to put detainees beyond the rule \nof law. Thankfully, the current administration has ended the worst \nabuses of these practices, despite the efforts of some of my colleagues \nto stymie these efforts.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the conference report continues \nus on a dangerous path of sacrificing long-held principles.\n  To begin, this bill fails to make clear that under no circumstance \ncan an American citizen be detained indefinitely without trial. When \nthe bill was considered in the Senate, I was proud to join 66 of my \ncolleagues in supporting an amendment, authored by Senator Feinstein, \nwhich sought to clarify that the law does not authorize the President \nto indefinitely detain an American seized in the United States and \nindefinitely detain them without charges and without due process. I am \nheartened that President Obama has made clear he will not attempt to \nexercise such power, but I am greatly disappointed that the conference \nreport omitted this language.\n  Moreover, the bill would make it much more difficult to close the \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay. There simply is no compelling \nreason to keep the facility open and not to bring these detainees to \nmaximum security facilities within the United States. The detention \ncenter has been, and continues to be, a stain on our Nation's honor. I \nagree with former Secretary of State Colin Powell who said ``we have \nshaken the belief that the world had in America's justice system by \nkeeping [the detention center at Guantanamo Bay] open. We don't need it \nand it's causing us far more damage than any good we get for it.''\n  In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Bush administration declared \na broad and open-ended ``war on terror.'' I have always considered this \na flawed description of the challenge that confronted us after the 9/11 \nattacks. After all, ``terror'' is an endlessly broad and vague term. \nAnd a ``war on terror'' is a war that can never end, because terrorism \nand terrorists will always be with us. Because of the never-ending \nnature of this so-called ``war on terror,'' it offers a rationale for \nrestricting civil liberties indefinitely. This is not healthy for our \ndemocracy or for our ability to inspire other countries to abide by \ndemocratic principles.\n  We will not overcome terrorism with secret prisons, with torture, \nwith degrading treatment, with individuals denied basic rights. Rather, \nwe shall overcome it by staying true to our highest values and by \ninsisting on legal safeguards that are the very basis of our system of \ngovernment and freedom.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate voted, by voice vote, to \napprove the conference report to accompany H.R. 4310, the National \nDefense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013. As it always \ndoes, the NDAA included a number of important provisions, including \ncritical authorizations for our troops in uniform, for essential \ndefense programs to promote and protect our national security both at \nhome and abroad, and for important programs that keep ours the greatest \nmilitary in the world.\n  The conference report approved today also includes two important \nprovisions which I was proud to support. The Dale Long Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits Improvements Act will fill a gap in existing law and \nextend the Federal Public Safety Officers/Benefits program to \nparamedics and emergency medical technicians who work or volunteer for \nnonprofit ambulance services, and their families, when they are \ndisabled or killed in the line of duty. And important measures relating \nto Department of Defense law enforcement officers are also included.\n  While I am pleased this conference report includes important elements \nsuch as these, I remain deeply concerned about several troubling \nprovisions that remain in the law relating to the indefinite detention \nof individuals without charge or trial and the conference report drops \nthe Senate amendment we adopted to protect against abuses. The \nindefinite detention and mandatory detention provisions that were \nenacted in last year's defense authorization bill undermine our \nNation's fundamental principles of due process and civil liberties, and \nI have worked to eliminate or fix these flawed provisions.\n  Earlier this month, during debate on the Senate bill, we took a \npositive step toward fixing these flawed provisions by adopting an \namendment offered by Senator Feinstein that I supported to clarify that \nour government cannot detain indefinitely any citizen or legal \npermanent resident apprehended in the United States. More than two-\nthirds of the Senate voted in favor of this amendment, and I viewed \nthis as a constructive part of our efforts to undo some of the damage \nfrom last year's NDAA. During the Senate debate on the detention \nprovisions this year, I stated again my belief that the vital \nprotections of our Constitution extend to all persons here in the \nUnited States, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. \nNonetheless, I voted for this amendment to affirm that indefinite \ndetention has no place in our justice system.\n  Inexplicably, however, the Feinstein amendment was stripped from the \nfinal bill during conference negotiations between the House and Senate. \nDespite such broad Senate support for the Feinstein amendment, the \nconference report no longer expressly reaffirms that U.S. citizens and \nlegal permanent residents in America cannot be detained indefinitely \nwithout charge or trial. Instead, we are left with the status quo of \nrestrictions and prohibitions on the transfer of detainees that leaves \nus no closer to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo once and \nfor all.\n  I have repeatedly said that I am fundamentally opposed to indefinite \ndetention without charge or trial. I fought against the Bush \nadministration policies that led to the current situation, with \nindefinite detention as the de facto policy. I opposed President \nObama's executive order in March 2011 that contemplated indefinite \ndetention, and I helped lead the efforts against the detention-related \nprovisions in last year's NDAA. A policy of indefinite detention has no \nplace in the justice system of any democracy--let alone the greatest \ndemocracy in the world.\n  The American justice system is the envy of the world, and a regime of \nindefinite detention diminishes the credibility of this great Nation \naround the globe, particularly when we criticize other governments for \nengaging in such conduct, and as new governments in the midst of \nestablishing legal systems look to us as a model of justice. Indefinite \ndetention contradicts the most basic principles of law that I have \npledged to uphold since my years as a prosecutor and in our senatorial \noath to defend the Constitution. That is why I have opposed and will \ncontinue to oppose indefinite detention.\n  In addition to failing to rectify the indefinite detention provisions \nfrom last year's NDAA in the conference report, I also continue to be \ndeeply disturbed by the mandatory military detention provisions that \nwere included in last year's NDAA through Section 1022. In the fight \nagainst al Qaeda and other terrorist threats, we should give our \nintelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals all the tools \nthey need. These limitations abandon our full arsenal of powers. I \nremain concerned that the mandatory military detention requirements are \noverly broad and threaten core constitutional principles. Once \nsacrificed, our treasured constitutional protections are not easily \nrestored. After all, the policy directive of this President can be \nundone by a future administration.\n  I find the detention provisions enacted through last year's NDAA and \nthe failure to fix them this year deeply troublesome. I am also \nconcerned about the extension of overly burdensome restrictions and \nconditions on the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo, even those who \nhave already been found to have had no connection to terrorism. These \nprovisions do not represent Vermont values, they do not represent \nAmerican values, and they have no place in this world. As a result of \nthe failure of the conferees to seriously address these fundamental \nwrongdoings and support the principles of our Constitution, I am unable \nto support final passage of this year's NDAA. Moving forward, as I did \nlast year, I hope to foster a broader discussion about these issues and \nwork to\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nmake concrete changes to protect American values and champion the rule \nof law. We need a bipartisan effort to guarantee that the United States \nremains the model for the rule of law to the world.\n  There is one additional provision that has been excluded from this \nconference report that is of concern to me and a number of Senators and \nCongressmen. Both the House and Senate approved in their defense \nauthorization bills language to freeze Air National Guard and Air Force \nReserve manpower and force structure in the wake of the Air Force's \nannounced intention to disproportionately target the National Guard as \nit prepared for Budget Control Act cuts. I joined Senator Graham, \nRepresentative Hunter and Representative Walz in leading a letter to \nthe conferees signed by 87 members of Congress in support of continuing \nthe freeze and preserving the National Commission on the Structure of \nthe Air Force which was included in the Senate-passed Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I was surprised to see that the conferees rewrote these provisions, \ninstead adopting in this conference report an Air Force proposal that \nhad been neither reviewed nor debated by either chamber. While the \nfinal conference report does preserve the National Commission on the \nStructure of the Air Force, I believe it does not go far enough to \nprotect the fundamental needs and strength of our Air National Guard.\n  I will continue to work with others here in Congress who believe, as \nI do, that the Guard represents much of what is best about our \ncountry's military.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8340-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to raise a point of order against a \nvery small segment of this bill, and I wish to yield myself some time \nto discuss that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the critical sections \nof that act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the motion to waive.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nPennsylvania wishes to speak. I just need to essentially object to his \npoint of order. I do this because although I know he is indeed well \nintentioned--Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. This is an \nimportant precedent that could be set, and I would like Members not to \ntalk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If Members would please take their \nconversations out of the Chamber if they wish to talk. If not, could \nthey be quiet.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want them to more than be quiet. We are talking about \na precedent in the Senate, so I would like, please, if Senators could \ntake their conversations either in the back or off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. OK. If Senators could be quiet and \nlisten, and if you must talk, could you do it off the floor.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the reason I am so insistent is, No. 1, \nthe decorum of the Senate; and No. 2, this is a dangerous precedent. If \nthis point of order is sustained, it will mean $3.4 billion of urgent \ndisaster relief in this supplemental has to be offset in future \nappropriations bills. This will mean real consequences this year.\n  Now, in a $1 trillion budget and the way we talk about money $3.4 \nbillion might not seem like a lot, but it does mean a lot in disaster \nassistance, and it does mean a lot to the Appropriations Committee. \nThis is a $3.4 billion unspecified cut that will go to domestic \nprograms for fiscal year 2013.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues we are in a 6-month CR now, so this \nmeans right in the middle of a CR, until March, we have to take out an \nadditional $3.4 billion. This will have a terrible impact on domestic \nprograms, and it is a dangerous precedent. We have never offset \ndisaster assistance, and I urge the adoption of my position.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from New York whose community is suffering, \nand he has done an able job in helping to manage this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania. He didn't try to knock out the whole thing and we \nappreciate that. Having said that, I urge any of my colleagues in \ndisaster areas to think very carefully before they vote for this. This \nwill be the first time ever when a disaster is declared that we have \noffset money for it. That will mean that disaster money will be much \nless readily available in the future. The precedent is an awful one. It \nis something that goes against 100 years of Democrats, Republicans--\nnorth, east, south, and west--voting to, when one area has trouble, \nsend the money, without spending months and months and months fighting \nabout whether to cut this or cut that or raise these taxes or do this \nor that to offset.\n  I would say we had this fight when Irene came about, and 19 of our \ncolleagues came to the wisdom that it was a bad idea to offset it, and \nwe didn't.\n  So I urge and plead with my colleagues, on this quick notice to \nreverse 100 years of decisionmaking and start invoking offsets for \ndisaster, which this is--it is mitigation. We have always done \nmitigation. It means that instead of rebuilding in the floodplain, we \nbuild in a different place nearby. It means instead of putting all of \nthese machines that are flooded in the basement, we put them on the \nthird floor. It means if there is a beach that is not protected, we \nbuild a berm. That is mitigation. It is all related to protecting from \na disaster and not making the same mistake of building in a floodplain \nor not protecting in a subway or whatever.\n  We have always done it. We have never offset mitigation, and it has \nbeen in every disaster relief. So I plead with my colleagues to think \ntwice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I have a different plea for my colleagues; \nthat is, to sustain this budget point of order, acknowledging that it \ndoes not cut one dime of spending from this supplemental. If my budget \npoint of order is sustained, every single dime, if it were eventually \npassed--every dime that is allocated for future mitigation would, in \nfact, be spent for future mitigation.\n  The question before us is, when we are running trillion-dollar \ndeficits, must we add another $60 billion on top of that deficit?\n  So what I have done is I have looked at this bill, and there are many \nparts that are not directly in aid of any of the victims of Sandy.\n  Look, my State was hit by that storm, not nearly as bad as New York \nand New Jersey and Connecticut and some others. But there are real \nvictims of this storm, there are genuine needs, and we need to fund \nthose needs. I am in favor of making sure we do fund the needs that we \nhave. But we have a category of spending that is going for construction \nfor years to come to mitigate against dangers of future storms in \nfuture years and future decades. That might be very wise, that might be \nvery appropriate spending, but it is not an emergency.\n  This is not sandbags around someone's house who is in danger of a \nstorm. That kind of infrastructure spending is the kind of spending we \ndo routinely, but we plan for it and we budget it. If it is, indeed, \nthe priority that many people--probably, including myself--believe it \nis, then it ought to be weighed in competition with the other pressing \nneeds, and we ought to plan for it and budget for it. That is all I am \nasking.\n  So this budget point of order does not cut one dime of spending from \nthis bill. It simply says the $3.4 billion that is identified for the \nconstruction of future mitigation projects would count toward the \ndiscretionary spending caps we have in place. Unfortunately, our \ndeficit would grow if all else stays the same, but at least not by that \n$3.4 billion. That part would eventually have to be offset with some \nmodest restraint on discretionary spending at some point.\n  But I would stress that there is not a dime that will be cut from \nthis bill by virtue of this point of order, and it would establish that \ngoing forward, hopefully, when we are doing long-term construction \nprojects for future mitigation, we would consider them in the context \nof the infrastructure spending that they are.\n  So for that reason, Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e)(1) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\npoint of order against the emergency designation in the appropriation \nfor the Army Corps of Engineers, ``Construction,'' contained in title 4 \nof the substitute amendment. And I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of that act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n34. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The emergency designation is removed.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. On Thursday, December 20, 2012, my \nfather, Claude Bruce Brown, passed away. Growing up, my relationship \nwith my Dad was a complicated one. As we both matured, our \nrelationship, respect and love for each other also matured. He was a \ngood man with a big heart. Our family--my wife Gail, and my daughters \nAyla and Arianna--are thankful to his wife, Peggy, her family and for \ntheir unwavering love for him during his difficult final days. I will \nmiss my father's guidance and his sense of humor.\n  As a result of my father's passing, I am departing Washington so that \nwe can be together and mourn together as a family. Unfortunately, that \nmeans that on Friday, December 21, 2012, I am not present in Senate for \nthree rollcall votes. In my nearly 3 years of service in the Senate, I \nhave only missed one vote, and I want to be clear about how I would \nhave voted on the measures that are before the Senate today.\n  I strongly support the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 4310, the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill, and I would have voted aye in \nfavor of its passage. Providing the necessary resources to our men and \nwomen in uniform is critical, and as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I applaud the authors of this legislation for their \nwork on this measure. It contains many provisions that I believe are \nimportant to both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the security of \nour Nation.\n  Additionally, I would have supported the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe Reid substitute amendment No. 3395 to H.R. 1, the vehicle for the \nHurricane Sandy emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Hurricane \nSandy had a major impact on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and had a \nterrible toll on New York and New Jersey especially.\n  Finally, on the motion to waive the Budget Act point of order on a \nsmall portion of that disaster response bill that did not pertain to \nresponding to the impacts of Hurricane Sandy, I would have voted no. I \nbelieve that funding for infrastructure improvements to mitigate the \nimpacts of future storms is critical, but should be fully offset in the \nfuture. This is consistent with all of the new spending efforts that \nare considered under the bipartisan budget controls currently in \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the hour is late and there are \nMembers who want to go home. We have been through an emotional roller \ncoaster here in the Senate, as has the Nation. One week ago we saw this \nterrible, horrific shooting in Connecticut. While the Nation mourned \nwhat happened there, we mourn here in the Senate because of the passing \nof Senator Inouye. Yet the work of Senator Inouye went on through the \nurgent supplemental.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from New York for helping with the \nmanagement of this bill, as well as the Senator from Vermont and \nSenator Landrieu, the chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, who \nhave all done good work.\n\n\n                               Dan Inouye\n\n  We Senators know we are only as good as our staff. As the Inouye era \ngoes through its transition, I would like to thank the Inouye staff \nfirst of all for everything they have done on this bill. I thank the \nInouye staff for all they did in staffing for truly one of the great \nicons in the Senate. Now, do not think the Inouye staff is going to go \naway under Barbara Mikulski. I want to publicly thank them on behalf of \nall of the Senate that they held their own emotions in control so we \ncould move forward with the Senate business. That is what professional \nstaff is. They are the highest and the best of the best. I think the \nSenate owes them a debt of gratitude. I will lean on them to be back \nhere on Thursday to move this bill in regular order.\n  I want to just end today's proceedings by saying God bless Senator \nInouye and all that he meant to America, and God bless the staff, who \nhas helped him be one of the greatest Senators in American history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that we all will miss \nSenator Inouye. He was one of the most loved people who have ever \nserved in this Senate. But I also want to say that we have passed on \nnow and will take the bill in its entirety later. But because of the \nleadership of Senator Mikulski and many others working together, we now \nhave a start on the supplemental appropriation.\n  We have worked in the Senate together to accommodate the concerns of \nmany on our side about that bill. We have now had a say. I think there \nwill be overwhelming support now for going forward. I think that is due \nto the ability of Senator Mikulski to step to the plate and become the \nfirst woman chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the history of \nthe Senate.\n  She has already shown the leadership that will continue in her tenure \nas chairman. I have worked with her as the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee this last year on appropriations. She has been chair, and \nI have been the ranking member. I will say that every time we have had \na disagreement, it has been worked out, and we have passed our bills, \nour legislation. That is what is going to happen next year as she \nbecomes the chairman of Appropriations. I think it is a good day for \nthe Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I would like to congratulate \nSenator Mikulski on a fine first day on the floor as chair of \nAppropriations. We are all excited about it on both sides of the aisle \nand expect great things of that committee next year. Perhaps there will \nbe a change--we will get appropriations bills done, get them on the \nfloor, and move them under her leadership.\n  I also want to thank Senator Landrieu, who is not here, who really \nhelped out as well, as well as Senator Murray and Senator Feinstein. I \nthank them very much.\n  I also thank the staff, which really is professional. In England, \nthey are a civil service. It is the highest calling, it is \nprofessional, and it works hard no matter who is in charge. They do a \ngreat job. You are our English civil service, which is a very high \ncompliment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Chair will announce that following the invoking of cloture on \nSenate amendment No. 3395, the motion to commit fell, being \ninconsistent with cloture.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n            Tribute To Navy Commander Jeffrey A. Bennett II\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Navy CDR Jeffrey \nA. Bennett II. Commander Bennett served as a military fellow in my \noffice since December of last year. He brought to public service the \nsame passion and honor he brought to military service.\n  Commander Bennett is a 1992 US Naval Academy graduate who was \nnominated for the academy by the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Carl Levin, several years ago.\n  He came to my office after a tour serving as captain of the USS \nStockdale, an Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer. I know he \nwas an excellent captain, indeed, I have personally observed Commander \nBennett's abilities. I am very impressed. He has a good strategic grasp \nof America's challenges, while also mastering the details necessary to \nfully grasp military budget and financial issues, among other matters \nthat we deal with.\n  His command of defense authorization and appropriations legislation \nfrom both the House of Representatives and the Senate has been \nexceptional. He consistently puts in late nights and long weekends \nstudying the details of legislation affecting programs that are vital \nto our national defense and the State of Alabama.\n  More importantly, Jeff possesses excellent judgment. I have valued \nhis judgment and insight on global issues as well as the more rigorous \nand detailed issues that come up in the Senate. I can say without \nhesitation, he has fulfilled the high reputation that the Navy \nFellowship Program has earned in every way. He has been a tremendous \nresource to my office. He is a man of integrity, who puts his country \nfirst. He is committed to serving America in whatever role he is given. \nAll the while, he carries out his duties with exceptional grace, \ncollegiality, and positive spirit. I am exceedingly impressed with \nJeff, both as a person, an officer, and a staff member.\n  His time in my office has gone too quickly. We will miss the force of \nhis fine mind, his hard work, and his positive approach to all \nchallenges. The Navy most surely has an unusually talented and valuable \nofficer in Commander Bennett.\n  Commander Bennett has served my office with honor and distinction, \ntruly personifying the qualities of a U.S. naval officer.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank his wonderful wife Heather and \nhis children Grace and Jay. As is the case with all our military \nfamilies, we know that Commander Bennett's service is one supported and \nshared by the whole family. He is, indeed, a great family man.\n  I look forward to following his bright career and continuing service \nto God and country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 5949\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \ncloture having been invoked, at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 510, H.R. 5949; that the \nonly first-degree amendments in order to the bill be the following: \nLeahy, Merkley, Paul, Wyden; that there be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the proponents and opponents on each amendment; that \nthere be up to 5 hours of debate on the bill equally divided between \nthe proponents and opponents; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments in the \norder listed; that there be no amendments in order to any of the \namendments prior to the votes; that upon disposition of the amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage \nof the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nmodified--I reluctantly do this--to set a 60-affirmative-vote threshold \non each of the amendments and passage of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                       Intelligence Authorization\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, both sides are working to pass the \nintelligence authorization bill for 2013.\n  I voted against this legislation when it was marked up in committee. \nI objected to it here on the floor last month. But I am able to support \nit at this time.\n  The bill has a number of valuable provisions in it, and I thank \nChairwoman Feinstein and Vice Chairman Chambliss for making the changes \nin the bill to address my concerns.\n  The changes Senators Feinstein and Chambliss have made would remove a \nnumber of provisions that were intended to reduce unauthorized \ndisclosures of classified information, of course, known as leaks.\n  I objected to these provisions because, in my view, they would have \nharmed first amendment rights, led to less informed public debate about \nnational security issues, and undermined the due process rights of \nintelligence agency employees, without actually enhancing national \nsecurity.\n  I am going to take a few minutes to explain my views on this so that \nthose who are not on the Intelligence Committee and who have not heard \nthis issue addressed before will understand what the debate was about \nand what I believe has been accomplished.\n  I certainly agree with Senators that unauthorized disclosure of \nnational security information, known as leaks, is a serious problem. \nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive information can jeopardize \nlegitimate military and intelligence operations, and even put lives at \nrisk. So I do believe it is appropriate for Congress to look for ways \nto help the executive branch protect information that intelligence \nagencies want to keep secret, as long as Congress is careful not to do \nmore harm than good.\n  Personally, I have spent more than 4 years working on the legislation \nto increase the criminal penalty for those who are convicted of \ndeliberately exposing covert agents, and I was pleased that, with the \nhelp of Senators on both sides of the aisle, that legislation was \nfinally signed into law in 2010. So I am all for the Congress \nrecognizing that leaks are a serious problem and for doing things to \nshow the men and women of the U.S. intelligence community that the \nseriousness of this issue is recognized in this body.\n  It is important for Congress to remember, however, that not \neverything\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nthat is done in the name of stopping leaks is necessarily wise policy. \nIn particular, I think Congress ought to be extremely skeptical of any \nantileak legislation that threatens to encroach on the freedom of the \npress or that reduces access to information that the public has a right \nto know.\n  A number of Senators may be aware that my father was a journalist who \nreported on national security issues. Among other books, he wrote what \nhas been called the definitive account of the Bay of Pigs invasion, as \nwell as an authoritative account of how the United States came to build \nand use the first atomic bomb. Accounts such as these are vital to the \npublic's understanding of national security issues. Without transparent \nand informed public debate on foreign policy and national security \ntopics, American voters are ill-equipped to elect the policymakers who \nmake important decisions in these areas.\n  Congress too would be much less effective in its oversight if Members \ndid not have access to informed press accounts on foreign policy and \nnational security topics. And while many Members of Congress do not \nlike to admit it, Members often rely on the press to inform them about \nproblems that congressional overseers have not discovered on their own. \nI have been on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 12 years now, and \nI can recall numerous specific instances where I found out about \nserious government wrongdoing--such as the NSA's warrantless \nwiretapping program or the CIA's coercive interrogation program--only \nas a result of disclosures by the press.\n  With all of this in mind, I was particularly concerned about sections \n505 and 506 of this bill because both of them would have limited the \nflow of unclassified information to the press and to the public. \nSection 505, as passed by the Intelligence Committee, would have \nprohibited any government employee with a top secret, compartmented \nsecurity clearance from ``entering into any contract or other binding \nagreement'' with ``the media'' to provide ``analysis or commentary'' \nconcerning intelligence activities for a full year after that employee \nleft the government.\n  That provision would clearly have led to less-informed public debate \non national security issues. News organizations often rely on former \ngovernment officials to help explain complex stories or events, and I \nthink it entirely appropriate for former officials to help educate the \npublic in this fashion.\n  I am also concerned that prohibiting individuals from providing \ncommentary could be an unconstitutional encroachment on free speech. \nFor example, if a retired CIA Director wishes to publish an op-ed \ncommenting on a public policy debate, I see no reason to ban that \nperson from doing so even if they have been retired less than a year. \nThis provision also would have said that retired officials who comment \nin the media would not be able to serve on advisory boards for the \nintelligence community, which I believe would have deprived the \ncommunity of valuable knowledge and advice.\n  Section 506 would also have led to a less informed debate on national \nsecurity issues by prohibiting nearly all intelligence agency employees \nfrom providing briefings to the press, unless those employees gave \ntheir names and provided the briefings on the record.\n  It seems to me that authorized unclassified background briefings from \nintelligence agency analysts and experts are a useful way to help \ninform the press and the public about a wide variety of issues, and \nthere will often be good reasons to withhold the full names of the \nexperts giving those briefings. I have seen no evidence that making it \nharder for the intelligence agencies to provide these briefings will \nbenefit national security in any way. So I see no reason to limit the \nflow of information in this manner.\n  The third provision I thought was troubling was section 511, which \nwould have required the Director of National Intelligence to establish \nan administrative process under which he or she and the heads of the \nvarious intelligence agencies would have had the authority to take away \npension rights from an intelligence agency employee or a former \nemployee. That could be done if the DNI or the agency head determined \nthat the employee knowingly violated his or her nondisclosure agreement \nand disclosed classified information.\n  I have been concerned that the Director of National Intelligence \nhimself said this provision would not be a significant deterrence to \nleaks, and that it would neither help protect national sensitive \nsecurity information nor make it easier to identify and publish actual \nleakers.\n  Beyond these concerns about the provision's effectiveness, I have \nalso been concerned that giving intelligence agency heads broad new \nauthority to take away the pensions of individuals who have not been \nformerly convicted of any wrongdoing could pose serious problems for \nthe due process rights of intelligence professionals, particularly when \nthe agency heads themselves have not told Congress how they would \ninterpret and implement the authority.\n  As many of my colleagues will guess, I was especially concerned about \nthe rights of whistleblowers who report waste, fraud, and abuse to the \nCongress or the inspector general. I have outlined these due process \nconcerns in more detail in the committee report that accompanies this \nbill.\n  I would just note for a moment that I was particularly concerned that \nsection 511 would have created a special avenue of punishment that only \napplied to accused leakers who worked for an intelligence agency at \nsome point in their career. There are literally thousands of employees \nat the Department of Defense, State, and Justice, as well as the White \nHouse, who have access to sensitive national security information. I do \nnot see a clear justification for singling out intelligence community \nemployees when there is no apparent evidence these employees are \nresponsible for a disproportionate number of leaks.\n  For what it is worth, Robert Litt, the general counsel for the \nDirector of National Intelligence told the American Bar Association \nlast month that in his view these proposals, ``really would not have \nany deterrent impact or punitive impact on leaks, and might in fact \nhave an adverse impact on the free flow of information to the American \npeople.''\n  In summary, I am grateful to the chair of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Feinstein, and vice chairman, Senator Chambliss, for responding \nto the concerns that I have outlined by removing nearly all of the \nantileak provisions from this legislation. The provision that remains \nwould require the executive branch to notify the Congress when they \nclassify information to disclose it to the press.\n  I believe this provision will lead to more informed public debate by \nmaking it clear to Members of Congress whether particular press reports \nare based on authorized but unattributed disclosures that we can \nrespond to as we see fit, and unauthorized leaks that would not be \nresponsible for us to confirm or deny. So I believe that particular \nprovision is useful, and I commend the chair and vice chairman for \nincluding it.\n  In summary, I think we all understand that in these important \nintelligence debates--and I remember when the Presiding Officer was on \nthe committee and doing good work--we always understood that it came \ndown to striking a balance. There is something of a constitutional \nteeter-totter where on one side we have protecting collective security, \nand on the other said we have the public's right to know and the \nindividual liberties of the American people.\n  As written, as reported by the committee, I believe that legislation \nwould have seriously put out of balance the constitutional ``teeter.'' \nI think it would have harmed legitimate first amendment rights. I think \nit would have done damage to the public's right to know. I believe it \nwould have discouraged the ability to ensure that we had a thorough and \nadequate discussion of issues that are so important for the American \npeople, as the American people look to the Congress of the United \nStates, and particularly this body, to strike the appropriate balance, \nthe right balance, between protecting our country at a time when there \nare serious threats and, on the other hand, protecting our individual \nliberties and protecting the public's right to know.\n  With the changes the Chair, Senator Feinstein, and the vice chair \nhave accepted, I believe this legislation now\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nstrikes the right balance. With both sides working on an agreement to \nimprove the intelligence authorization bill for 2013 by unanimous \nconsent, it is my hope that legislation will be approved by unanimous \nconsent shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, President Obama made a statement within \nthe last hour or so. He called on Congress to act to avoid the fiscal \ncliff.\n  We know last night the House was unable to bring forward a bill that \nwould deal with the fiscal cliff. Previously, they passed a bill that \nwould have solved that problem and put us on the right path, but they \ndid not pass another bill last night.\n  The Senate has not acted. There has been a lot of criticism of the \nHouse, that the House failed to pass legislation last night. However, \nthe Senate has passed no legislation.\n  The President made a little speech this afternoon, and I take it as a \nserious statement. But previously he made a speech on his budget plan. \nIt sounded good. It had a lot of things in it that sounded good. I \nbelieve Congressman Ryan, the budget chairman in the House, sent it to \nthe Congressional Budget Office and asked that they score it. A score \nmeans they analyze how much taxes are going to be raised--exactly how \nmuch--how much spending is going to be increased or reduced, and then \nthey lay out an analysis, called a score, of what that proposal \nactually will do. That is what how we are supposed to consider budgets \nhere.\n  So they sent the President's previous speech over to the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office said: You \ncannot score a speech. Sorry. Well, you cannot score a speech.\n  We are about to come back in next week. Maybe they will try to finish \nThursday, maybe go into Friday. But we do not need to have a serious \nmatter involving more than $1 trillion of the U.S. taxpayer's money \ndropped on the Senate next Thursday without us being able to read it \nand analyze it and having it scored. We can't be expected to \nrubberstamp it like the old Soviet Politburo, the Duma, where leaders \nwould put out the word to the members they would all vote just like \nthat, 445 to 5 or something like that. And they called themselves a \ndemocracy.\n  We do not need that in the Senate. We, each Senator, represent \nindividual Americans, millions of them. They expect us to know what we \nare voting on. Secret meetings and secret talks between just the \nSpeaker and the President is not a good process. I do not know what is \ngoing on in these talks. I am the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. I am just one Member of Congress who has a role in this \nprocess. Many others have a lot bigger role than I have, but none of us \nknow what is going on in these secret meetings. But each Senator has an \nequal vote. Each Senator has an equal responsibility to represent their \nconstituents.\n  So I am uneasy about this process. So I will just say this: Nobody \nshould criticize the House of Representatives for not producing \nlegislation last night until they have passed their own proposal. The \nSenate has had just as much time as the House to lay out a plan. Months \nago the House laid out a 10-year budget plan that would put America on \na sound financial course.\n  Everybody can have different views on it, but it is a comprehensive \nplan that would start reducing our deficits and put us on a good long-\nterm course. It has been complimented by people on both sides of the \naisle. Meanwhile, the Senate has produced nothing. We have gone 3 years \nwithout a budget. We have not had a serious and broad debate about the \nfinancial challenges of America. Senator Conrad had a number of very \nimportant hearings with witnesses 2 years ago in the Budget Committee. \nWe talked about the issues. No bill was brought forth in committee that \nwas actually marked up. That was a decision made by the Democratic \nleadership. They decided not to bring forth a budget. It was \ncalculated. They never brought one forward despite the fact the law \nrequires one. The United States Code requires a budget be brought up by \nApril 1. They decided not to do so and would take the criticism from \npeople like me. They took their lumps and never brought a budget \nforward.\n  Now for 3 years, they never produced a concurrent budget, but they \nhave had great fun attacking Congressman Ryan in the House, who passed \na budget, a comprehensive, historic budget that would change the debt \ncourse of America--never having produced anything. But we have had a \nnumber of speeches, a lot of speeches, a lot of outlines, a lot of \nproposals and schemes and plans, difficult to score, and never finally \nreaching fruition so that they could actually be considered by this \nbody.\n  So I guess what I would conclude with is to say I am glad the \nPresident discussed the budget problem in a little speech this \nafternoon. He has an entire Treasury Department. He has a Director at \nthe Office and Management and Budget overseeing hundreds of budget \nexperts. They have more than enough capability to produce detailed \nfinancial plans and make these plans public. He could make his detailed \nplan public today. Presumably, he would not have made a speech today if \nsomeone in the OMB or the White House or the Treasury Department had \nnot approved the outline of his plan. At the very least, that outline \nought to be placed in print for everyone to see.\n  Senator Reid should bring it up on the floor. It should be sent to \nthe Congressional Budget Office to be scored. It should be analyzed. \nThey should do that long before the Senate meets next Thursday. It \nshould have been done a month ago.\n  I do find it odd--think about this--that the President has not laid \nout a plan since the election over a month ago. He won the election. He \nsaid certain things he wants to see in a plan, higher taxes and more \nspending. Indeed, he had some spending cuts. He said: My plan cuts \nspending. But he has failed to note and acknowledge that the plan, as \nreportedly laid out by Secretary of Treasury Geithner in closed \nmeetings, had far more spending increases than spending cuts. So the \nPresident's proposal as laid out by Secretary Geithner, on net, \nincreases spending. It increases spending, it does not reduce spending.\n  It has some reductions of spending in it, but spending increases \noverwhelm the spending reductions. So it is not right, is it, for the \nPresident of the United States to say: I have a plan to cut spending. \nHe has been meeting in secret with Boehner, so we have to base this on \nreports, but this is what it appears to do.\n  I believe Senator Reid would serve the President well if he called \nhim up and said: Let's get that fiscal cliff proposal over here and \nhave your team meet with my staff, and we will publish it on Saturday. \nCongress can begin to look at it, and maybe we can beat this January 1 \ndeadline and not go over the cliff. That would be my suggestion as to \nhow we should proceed, and every Senator should have as much time as \npossible to study it. It should be made available to the House because \nthey would ultimately also be called on to vote on it. Everyone should \nsee it as soon as possible. That is the way government should be run.\n  I have written an op-ed, printed in the Wall Street Journal and \nelsewhere, that says America would really be better off had we used the \nlegitimate committee process of the Senate to address this problem. The \nPresident can advocate for his views, the Republicans can advocate for \ntheir views, and the Democratic Senators can advocate for their views. \nWe would actually have votes, and some of them would be tough votes, \nbut we can begin to see where we stand, where the votes are.\n  If somebody wants to raise taxes and it gets voted down and somebody \nwants to cut taxes and it gets voted down--those votes happen over a \nperiod of time, and the numbers are all out there for everyone to see. \nAt that point, it is much easier to tell your constituents: I have \ntruly fought for the things I believe.\n  Now, I think it is best for America that we reach a compromise. That \nwould be better than this process by which the whole Senate sits while \nthe Speaker of the House and the President of the United States meet to \ndevelop a plan that we are presumably expected to, like the old \nCommunist Duma, ratify at the eleventh hour without time to actually \nstudy it, with no real input. That is how this government, this Senate, \nwas meant to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden).

Mr. President, I have spent time on the Senate floor this \nweek talking about the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to \naddress Hurricane Sandy. But today I remind the Congress of another \nimpending disaster. Unlike Sandy, but exactly like the fiscal cliff \ncrisis, this is a man-made disaster that can and must be averted by \nDecember 31. Unfortunately, this calamity has been artificially created \nand forced upon us by forces of stalemate and obstruction in the House \nof Representatives. This disaster involves the Farm Bill and what \nhappens on the first of January if the House continues to hold the \nSenate-passed Farm Bill hostage.\n  The American people have heard again and again about the fiscal \ncliff. Today, once again, I am talking about the ``dairy cliff'' that \nawaits us if the House continues to block action on the Farm Bill. A \nfull six months have passed since the Senate approved a strong Farm \nBill with bipartisan support. We came together in the Senate and passed \na 5-year Farm Bill that contains some of the most significant reforms \nin agricultural policy in a generation, while providing $23 billion in \nreal deficit reduction.\n  After we passed the Senate Farm Bill, the House Agriculture Committee \nheld a markup of their bill in July and passed a bipartisan bill out of \nCommittee. Regrettably, that is where their work ended. The leadership \nin the House has refused to even bring their bill to the floor for \ndebate, something that has not happened in the past 50 years.\n  Inaction by the House caused the Farm Bill to expire on September 30, \nterminating authorizations for a long list of important programs that \nbenefit farmers, rural communities, consumers, and the 16 million \nAmericans whose jobs depend on agriculture. Chairwoman Stabenow was on \nthe floor earlier this week to point out the fact that is has been 80 \ndays since the Farm Bill expired. That is 80 days that our farm \nfamilies and small businesses have been waiting and holding their \nbreath. This is artificially generating untold uncertainty that is \ncosting farmers, consumers and our entire economy in very real and \nhighly unpredictable ways. This not only is unprecedented, it is \nlegislative malpractice. It threatens great harm to the Nation and the \nAmerican people. And it is wrong. Yet the Nation, including Vermont \ndairy farmers, incredibly enough are now on the verge of plunging over \nthe dairy cliff.\n  By failing to even consider a Farm Bill, the House leadership has \ndriven us straight to the edge of this dairy cliff and now is refusing \nto turn the wheel or put a foot on the brake. This is a pointless and \ndangerous game of chicken, dragging all Americans along for the ride.\n  On January 1--a mere 11 days from now--the final shoe will drop when \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture will be required to implement what \nis known as ``permanent law'' for our Nation's dairy industry. The \nSecretary of Agriculture and his staff have been--quite literally--\ndusting off old paper files and mimeographed notes from the 1940s and \n50s to review the Agricultural Act of 1949. Without a new Farm Bill, on \nJanuary 1 the Nation will be forced to revert to the parity pricing \nthat was part of that long-ago law that was passed a few short years \nafter the end of World War II.\n  The House's inaction on its own version of the Farm Bill, and its \nobstruction of the Senate bill--a Senate bill that saves taxpayers $23 \nbillion--will force the Secretary of Agriculture to implement a law \nfrom the middle of the last century. This archaic law will force the \nFederal Government to spend billions of dollars to buy and store dairy \nproducts to help raise the price of fluid milk for dairy farmers. The \nSecretary will have to keep spending until he is able to raise the \nprice of fluid milk by 60 or 70 percent. This is pointless and wasteful \nFederal spending. And it is even worse than that. Taking those products \noff the market will drive up consumer prices--prices that struggling \nfamilies must pay, from coast to coast, just to put food on the table--\nas early as next month. And that's not the end of this needless waste. \nThe Department of Agriculture then will have to pay still more \ntaxpayers' dollars to store all of these dairy products.\n  So rather than pass the Senate Farm Bill that saves $23 billion, the \nHouse is choosing to put the Secretary of Agriculture on a path to \nhaving to spend billions of dollars on dairy products, paying to store \nthose products, and driving the price of milk through the ceiling for \nconsumers. This is not even to mention the effects this could have on \nworld prices and the harm it will cause for the vulnerable millions \nworldwide who rely on dairy products for their basic nutrition. That, \nin summary, is what the dairy cliff is all about.\n  Every 5 years for the last 60 years, Congress has passed a Farm Bill. \nNever before has the Farm Bill expired like this. And now on January 1 \nwe will implement market-distorting dairy policy so old that 49 current \nmembers of the Senate--including the Chairwoman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee--were not even born when it was signed into law \nby then-President Harry Truman.\n  Market chaos will erupt if we do not divert from this disastrous, \nreckless, needless, man-made path. Chaos, from the fact that farmers \nwill be pressed to increase production at this inflated price, and \nchaos as we see an influx of imported dairy products as processors in \nother countries would divert products to the U.S. It is a rollercoaster \nof milk prices that, in the end, will benefit no one and hurt everyone. \nIt is the kind of rollercoaster of dairy prices that the reforms we \nincluded in the Farm Bill are designed to address. As milk floods the \nmarket, the USDA will have to buy even more milk to keep up. Economists \nat the USDA say that implementation of permanent law for dairy would \ncost at least $12 to $15 billion per year. That does not include the \ncost of storing these dairy products. The USDA may not have enough \nstorage space, and once USDA fills every warehouse at its storage \nfacility in Kansas City, it will have to bring the rest to Washington \nand fill every closet at the Department of Agriculture's sprawling \nSouth Building with cheddar cheese and powdered milk.\n  The effects of these purchases will reverberate throughout the \neconomy, and time is running out. The cascade of damage will be felt by \nour farmers, our food processors, our grocery stores, and by American \nconsumers and taxpayers. It will also be felt by the 16 million \nAmericans with jobs in agriculture. All at a time when they can least \nafford it.\n  Farmers in Vermont are very concerned that we are headed over this \ndairy cliff, and inaction on the Farm Bill has left the Nation's dairy \nfarmers with no safety net, since the Milk Income Loss Contract Program \nexpired on September 30.\n  The House of Representatives is not giving our farmers, and \nespecially our dairy farmers, a fair deal. We have been sent here to do \na job, and it is not asking too much that Congress pass a five year \nFarm Bill, and on time. We heard Senator Stabenow speaking earlier this \nweek about the agricultural disaster programs that have expired, in a \nyear when we have experienced record droughts, terrible freezes, and \nthen historic damage to farms as Hurricane Sandy stormed through the \nGarden State.\n  Also at stake are eight important energy programs that have expired \nand programs to support America's organic farmers, specialty crop \nproducers and beginning farmers. Close to my heart\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nas well are the vital international food assistance programs that serve \nas a core component of U.S. efforts to fight global hunger. These have \nexpired as well.\n  In all, there are 37 programs that have expired, for absolutely no \nreason. Inaction on the Farm Bill by the House of Representatives is \nthe perfect example of gridlock in Washington that so frustrates the \nAmerican people. It threatens our economy. It threatens farmers. It \nharms the most vulnerable among us. And it is entirely pointless and \navoidable.\n  For all their talk of cutting Federal spending and reducing the cost \nof entitlements, House leaders and the obstructive caucus to which they \nare catering, by blocking the Farm Bill are poised--by themselves--to \nincrease the Federal deficit by at least $12 to $15 billion in 2013 \nalone. Let me say that again: these obstructionists in the House are \nthreatening to drive up the deficit by $12 to $15 billion. While \nstalling and delaying work on the Farm Bill, saying they want further, \ndraconian cuts in food assistance for the families across this land who \nare struggling the most, House leaders are about to drive us over this \ndairy cliff and exponentially increase government spending, hit \nconsumers hard, and destroy the fragile economic gains we have made. \nThis is not what the American people and our farmers deserve. Let's do \nwhat is right and pass the Senate Farm Bill into law--without further \ndelay and without the political posturing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8347-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARGE VAN HOOVE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize with great appreciation \none of my longest-serving and loyal staffers, Marge Van Hoove. It is \nhard to imagine that this day would come, but she has earned a restful \nretirement from public service.\n  In January 1987, I had just been elected to serve my first term in \nthe U.S. Senate, when Marge asked to work with me. Even before this \nmeeting, she had been involved in my prior campaigns. Marge's 25 years \nof service in my Las Vegas office unlocks many wonderful memories.\n  Marge has always been the first to arrive and last to leave. She \nnever missed a deadline and was always ready with her quick wit. One \nnight, I phoned the office and asked her why she was there so late. She \nresponded, ``Because you are calling me so late.'' Her unyielding \ndedication to give each task her best is exemplary.\n  Ms. Van Hoove was the matriarch of my Las Vegas office. She trained \nstaffers and made sure the office ran properly. As the manager of the \nfront desk and scheduling, she saw the process evolve from a pen and \npaper operation to the modern electronic process that exists today. She \nalso made sure the office maintained the highest level of integrity and \nethical standards. She would joke, ``I'm not going to the Federal \nprison in Lompoc for anybody.''\n  Despite Marge's many responsibilities, she never forgot a single \nassignment. No matter what task was assigned to her, she would see it \nthrough to its successful completion. Marge never had a sick day until \nher recent health battles. And even during that difficult time, she \nworked from home and always staying abreast of all office business.\n  Marge has a wonderful, engaging sense of humor and accompanied with a \nmemorable laugh. She would pick out quirks among staff and with good \nnature poke fun at them. She also knew every member of my security \ndetail by name and would charm them during their State visits. To her, \neveryone was, ``Jose'' or ``Lucille.'' She would always say, ``Ok, \nJose'' or ``Here's the deal, Lucille.''\n  Marge was not only a leader in my office, but a woman of great faith \nand strength at home. She was born in Santa Fe, NM, but grew up in the \nSan Francisco area, which explains her adoration for the San Francisco \nGiants and 49ers. She was married to her husband John Van Hoove for 33 \nyears, and they raised two sons John Jr. and Steve. Marge is a proud \ngrandmother of three grandchildren.\n  Marge's departure into retirement leaves behind a void, but I know \nthat she has instilled many of her strong values and tireless work \nethic into the staff she trained. Marge's country western music and \ncowgirl boots will be out of sight, but she will not be out of the \nminds of those she worked with. Landra and I will miss our forever \nfriend, Marge, and extend to her our heartfelt love.\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to say goodbye to my friend, \nSenator Daniel K. Inouye. This week in the Senate, we lost a colleague, \na mentor, and a compass, and what is more our country lost one of the \ngreatest heroes of the ``Greatest Generation''.\n  We are a Nation that still holds its heroes dear, and that is why it \nis so hard to say goodbye to Danny.\n  I can think of no place more fitting to say one last ``Aloha'' than \nat the very center of this Nation's Capitol Building as Danny rested \nunder the Dome yesterday, which is the symbol of freedom to the entire \nworld and the very freedom he gave so much of himself to protect.\n  And protect it he did. Danny stood up and fought the racial \nstereotypes that would have kept Japanese Americans from joining their \nfriends and brothers in World War II. His service in France and Italy, \nincluding his heroic battle in Tuscany which earned him our highest \nmilitary honor, helped fight the spread of evil and hate and religious \npersecution. In Congress, Danny kept a constant vigil in the service of \nthe people of Hawaii, making sure our 50th State was as well \nrepresented as any of the original 13.\n  As we have gathered to honor him over the past 2 days here in \nWashington and will continue to gather over this weekend in Hawaii, to \nthank him, and to say a final farewell, we will be a Congress united. \nNot conservatives or liberals, Democrats or Republicans, 99 percent or \n1 percent. We stand together just as Danny saw us all: as Americans.\n  Danny was a friend. Quick with a word of advice or encouragement, \nloyal to his friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in \nDanny's passing we lost a man who could bridge any divide. We lost a \nman who led in his platoon, in his caucus, and in his beloved home \nState of Hawaii.\n  Danny will be missed by this body and by his friends on both sides of \nthe aisle. But it is my hope his spirit will remain with us, and help \nensure that the next generation of heroes has the same freedoms he held \nso dear. We will never stop fighting to protect them, Danny. Mahalo and \nAloha.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8347-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8347-S8354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a few days, the Senate will no longer \nbenefit from the service of a member who has left an indelible mark on \nnational security policy and on the Senate. Senator Joe Lieberman has \nbeen my colleague and friend for more than two decades. We have shared \ntriumphs and challenges, agreed and disagreed with one another, and \neach of us has served as a member of a committee the other chaired.\n  One challenge we have shared is the need to strengthen our nation's \nmanufacturing sector, the economic backbone of our two states and \nindeed of the nation. Senator Lieberman has served as chairman of the \nSenate Manufacturing Caucus, which has benefitted greatly from his \nenergy and leadership. He has been a dedicated supporter of the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, which helps U.S. manufacturers \nstrengthen and grow in the face of international competition. In this \nwork, Senator Lieberman has been an ally of Michigan working families.\n  Of course, Senator Lieberman and I have worked together on the Armed \nServices Committee, where he has been an active, thoughtful, principled \nand energetic member and subcommittee chairman. Senator Lieberman \njoined the committee in 1993, and from the start, he made an impact. He \nwas the author of what came to be known as the Lieberman Amendment to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, directing \nthe Department of Defense to conduct a Quadrennial Defense Review. This \nreview has become an integral part of our nation's defense planning, \nencouraging the Pentagon, Congress and all who contribute to defense \nstrategy to confront tough questions about strategy, capabilities and \nresources.\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n  Over several years as chairman or ranking member of the Airland \nSubcommittee, Senator Lieberman has played an influential role in \noversight of important modernization programs. His constant attention \nand leadership has helped the Army push through the challenges of \nacquiring and fielding the truly networked tactical force our nation \nneeds, and of modernizing its helicopter force. He has provided close \noversight of aircraft programs such as the F/A-18E and F, F-22, F-35 \nJoint Strike Fighter and the new KC-46 aerial refueling tanker.\n  Of course, the committee has grappled with a number of difficult \npolicy questions over the last two decades, from the need to repeal \n``don't ask, don't tell'' to the conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Senator Lieberman was the original sponsor of the legislation \nthat repealed ``don't ask, don't tell'' and he played an important role \nin shepherding this legislation through the Armed Services Committee \nand the Senate. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Senator Lieberman \non these issues, it's impossible to doubt his thoughtfulness and his \ndedication to finding the right solutions for our nation.\n  Senator Lieberman is my chairman on the Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee. I'm privileged to chair that committee's \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, where a small but incredibly \ntalented and dedicated staff has made immense contributions to consumer \nprotections, government oversight and our defenses against financial \nwrongdoing. I am deeply grateful for Senator Lieberman's support for \nour subcommittee's work.\n  We also have worked closely on the committee's efforts to protect \nAmericans from potentially catastrophic releases from chemical \nfacilities. I was a co-sponsor on legislation he authored with Senator \nCollins to address that threat, and I am thankful for his leadership in \nputting in place these vital protective standards. Senator Lieberman's \nwork has also included badly needed reform of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster; \nimproving our cybersecurity protections; and improving our defenses \nagainst disease pandemics.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is also \nwhere Senator Lieberman has accomplished what is likely his most \nlasting work: reform of our homeland security and intelligence \ncommunities in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n  Reforms of this scope by necessity have many authors, but certainly \nSenator Lieberman's role was at the forefront. His leadership was \ninstrumental in passage of legislation creating the Department of \nHomeland Security, and in achieving vital reforms to the structure and \npractices of our intelligence agencies in the wake of the 9-11 attacks. \nThese were sweeping, once-in-a-generation reforms, and Senator \nLieberman was tireless in his advocacy for them.\n  In these and so many other ways, Senator Lieberman leaves an \nimportant and lasting legacy as he prepares to leave the Senate. He is \na trustworthy confidant and I shall miss him. Barbara and I wish Joe \nand Hadassah every happiness as they embark on their next adventure \ntogether.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. President, it is an unfortunate reality that the number of people \nin Washington working for bipartisan solutions is significantly smaller \nthan the number of people claiming to do so or proclaiming the need to \ndo so. Nearly everyone seeks the ``bipartisan'' label; fewer wear it \ncomfortably or practice bipartisanship regularly.\n  That is one reason I am sad to see Olympia Snowe leave the Senate. \nOver three terms, Senator Snowe has represented the people of Maine \nwith intelligence and, yes, moderation. Here's how Time magazine put it \nin 2006, in naming Senator Snowe one of the nation's 10 best senators: \n``Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan \npoint scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every \npolicy debate in Washington.'' And I've been lucky to observe her work \nin those debates.\n  Start with her work on the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee, where she has served both as chairman and ranking member. As \na member of the committee, I have appreciated her dedicated advocacy \nfor small business. She has worked hard to support SBA's Microloan \nprogram and programs for women owned businesses. She has helped improve \nSBA's trade and export finance programs; elevated the SBAs Office of \nInternational Trade and add export finance specialists to the SBA's \ntrade and counseling programs; and established the State Export \nPromotion Grant Program, designed to increase the number of small \nbusinesses that export goods and services.\n  Senator Snowe also has been an enthusiastic supporter of our nation's \nmanufacturers. As a former co-chair of the Senate Task Force on \nManufacturing, she has worked to strengthen programs such as the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, which helps American manufacturers \nresearch and develop new technologies, increase efficiency, improve \nsupply chains and out-innovate our overseas competitors. American \nworkers from Maine to Michigan and beyond are better off for her \nsupport of this vital sector of the American economy.\n  Beyond manufacturing, our states are linked in another way: the \nhistorical lighthouses that dot our shores. I was pleased that Senator \nSnowe joined me in offering the National Lighthouse Stewardship Act, \nwhich would help local governments or nonprofit groups preserve these \nprized structures for the appreciation of generations to follow.\n  I was also fortunate to serve with her on the Armed Service \nCommittee, where she served as Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee. She \nwas a strong advocate for the men and women of the Navy and Marine \nCorps, and worked diligently to ensure that the Department of the Navy \nhad the people and hardware the Navy needs to defend our nation's \ninterests.\n  On these and other issues, Senator Snowe has worked across party \nlines for the good of her constituents and our nation. But I can think \nof no issue that better demonstrates her ability to reach beyond \npartisan interest than one of the most controversial issues of our time \ntogether here: the Iraq war.\n  I worked with Senator Snowe and a bipartisan group of senators who \nbelieved the status quo in Iraq was no longer acceptable and who worked \ntogether to chart a new course.\n  We joined together to advance our collective view that the primary \npurpose of United States strategy in Iraq should be to pressure the \nIraqi political leadership to make the compromises necessary to end the \nviolence in Iraq while accelerating the training of Iraqi troops to \ntake responsibility for their own security.\n  We made clear that the open-ended commitment of U.S. forces to Iraq \nwas over, thereby undermining the al Qaeda narrative that we were there \nas occupiers and signaling to the people and Government of Iraq that \nthe time for political reconciliation had come.\n  As Senator Snowe rightly pointed out at the time, ``The Iraq \ngovernment needs to understand that our commitment is not infinite. \nAmericans are losing patience with the failure of the leadership in \nBaghdad to end the sectarian violence and move toward national \nreconciliation.'' She continued, ``It is imperative that Congress \nunderstands the importance of placing the future of Iraq's independence \nin the hands of those who should want it most--the Iraqi people and \ntheir government.''\n  As members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator \nSnowe and I also worked as part of the Committee's effort to \ninvestigate the misuse of pre-war Iraq intelligence by policymakers.\n  Senator Snowe's support for the investigation and its findings, in \nthe face of strong criticism from some in her own party, was important \nto bring transparency to the decision to go to war in Iraq and will \nhelp to ensure the American public is not similarly misled in the \nfuture.\n  Senator Snowe recently took another principled stand, in what will \nlikely be her last vote as a member of the Intelligence Committee, when \nshe was the only Republican member to vote to adopt the Committee's \nreport on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. That report \ndefinitively shows that torture is not effective in eliciting \nintelligence and will hopefully significantly influence how our nation \ndeals\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nwith the detention and interrogation of those we capture in the future.\n  Olympia Snowe's service has been of enormous benefit to the people of \nher state. She is rightly respected in this chamber, and around this \ncountry, as a leader who has not just talked a good game when it comes \nto bipartisanship, but has followed words with action, often at the \ncost of no little political discomfort for her. To the very end of her \ntenure here, she has fought, as she put it just last week on this, ``to \nreturn this institution to its highest calling of governing through \nconsensus.''\n  I want to thank her for the many ways in which she has supported \nprograms important to Michigan, and for the thoughtful approach she has \nbrought to the many challenges we have faced together. As she returns \nto Maine, I wish Olympia and Jock every success in whatever endeavors \nmay come. And I hope we can take to heart Senator Snowe's wise words as \nwe seek to answer the challenges before us.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, I want to give my thanks to Senator Scott Brown, who \nleaves the Senate at the end of this session. I have not had the \nprivilege of working with Senator Brown for as long as I have worked \nwith many of the other Senators who are concluding their service here. \nBut I am grateful for his work as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and for his support for some of the important reforms that \nhelped put a cop back on the beat on Wall Street.\n  Scott's road to the Senate was not easy. Like all too many American \nchildren, he was the victim of abuse by those who were obligated to \ncare for him. Senator Brown overcame great odds to become a United \nStates Senator--odds that had little to do with politics. He is an \nexample of our power to achieve despite great challenges, and we can \nall learn from that example.\n  Senator Brown was one of a handful of members who crossed party lines \nto support the Dodd-Frank Act, which provided vital reforms of the \nfinancial sector in order to help prevent a repeat of the financial \ncrisis that crippled our economy. He and I disagreed on several \nimportant provisions of the act, and we disagree in many ways on how it \ncan best be implemented. But his vote was very important to its \npassage.\n  As a servicemember for more than three decades, including a \ndeployment to Afghanistan, Senator Brown has brought a valuable \nperspective to the Armed Services Committee. He has spoken eloquently \nof the need to honor our Nation's solemn obligation to our troops, our \nveterans and our families. He has advocated for the National Guard and \nsupported significant policy changes that are important for our \nservicemembers, such as supporting victims of rape or incest and repeal \nof ``don't ask, don't tell.'' I thank him for his contributions to the \ncommittee's important work in fulfilling its obligation to \nservicemembers and their families.\n\n\n                              Daniel Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, now that the 112th Congress will soon be coming to a \nclose, the Senate will be able to take a moment to acknowledge and \nexpress our appreciation to those members who will be retiring when the \ngavel brings an end to the current session. One member who has had a \ngreat impact on so many of us on a personal basis is Daniel Akaka.\n  Danny, as I have come to know him, has been one of the strongest and \nmost loyal parts of our Senate Prayer Breakfast. That regular gathering \nthat many of us attend gives us an opportunity to come together to \nshare our faith and discuss the difference it has made in our daily \nlives.\n  No one has played a more important role in those weekly meetings than \nDanny. His faith has brought him through some very difficult situations \nin his life and it has also helped him to pursue policies and programs \nthat have made a difference in more lives than we will ever know.\n  When Danny was in the House he was the song leader. His understanding \nof the importance of music helped him to better express his faith. He \nled our singing of our hymns by providing us with the history of each \nsong as he explained the meaning of the words that were used to bring \nits message to life. His faith also showed itself with his work on a \nsailing ship that helped to bring missionaries around the Pacific to \nshare their faith with those who might otherwise have never heard such \nstories.\n  Danny is a veteran of World War II. His experience during the war \ngave him an understanding of the sacrifices our veterans made during \ntheir service and the importance of ensuring that we as a nation take \ngood care of them and address their medical needs.\n  That is why one of Danny's great accomplishments here in the Senate \nhas been his efforts on behalf of his fellow veterans. Whenever an \nimportant bill was taken up and passed, Danny immediately got to work, \ntrying to determine the impact each bill would have on our veterans and \nhow any negative impacts could be addressed and reversed. Just as we \nowe our veterans a great debt of gratitude for their service, veterans \neverywhere have a special place in their hearts for everything Danny \nhas done over the years to protect and preserve the benefits they have \nearned with their service.\n  In addition to his great faith and his concern for our Nation's \nveterans, Danny also brought to the Senate his love of Hawaii and its \ngreat culture and history. It was a gift he shared with us over the \nyears that increased our awareness of Hawaii's past and the great \ntraditions of his home State.\n  Through the years Danny has made a reputation for himself here in the \nSenate as a careful, thoughtful legislator who works quietly but \neffectively. The good work he has done on a number of issues has had an \nimpact that will continue to be felt for many years to come.\n  Thank you, Danny, for your service both here in the Senate and in our \narmed forces. You can be very proud of all you have achieved. You have \nrepresented your State very well. Thank you most of all for your \nfriendship and for sharing your faith and the impact it has had on your \nlife. You will be missed and not just by those of us in the Senate who \nhave enjoyed having a chance to come to know you. You have been a great \nfriend to our Nation's veterans, too, and they will always remember \nyour commitment to them.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, now that the 112th Congress is coming to a close, the \nSenate will have an opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of those \nSenators who will be returning home at the end of this session of the \nSenate. One Senator I know I will miss in the days to come is Senator \nScott Brown.\n  Looking back it is hard to believe that Scott has only been a member \nof the Senate for about 3 years. He has had an impact on our day to day \ndeliberations over those years that far outweighs the time he has been \na Member of the Senate. That speaks volumes about his ability to make \nthe best use of his resources so that he could have an impact on those \nissues that concern the people of his home state.\n  When Scott was elected to the Senate he became the first Republican \nSenator from Massachusetts to have made it here in more than 30 years. \nFor me, that is proof of the kind of candidate Scott was and the \neffectiveness of the campaign he ran.\n  His success in what was a very difficult race proved that Scott is a \nnatural politician. He has a remarkable ability to grasp the core of \nthe issues before the Senate and determine their possible impact on the \npeople back home. He understands the people back home and he knows how \nthey think and how they feel about the issues before the Senate. \nEqually important, Scott is able to explain those issues in simple, \neasily understood statements that stick in the minds of the people who \nhear him. He has a way with words that helps to win people over.\n  When Scott came to the Senate people were not sure what to expect. \nWas he going to tend to follow one Party or the other exclusively? No. \nScott took up each issue individually, measuring them all with the \nyardstick of his principles and his determination to be an effective \nrepresentative of the people of Massachusetts who sent him to \nWashington. It was not going to be easy, but Scott proved himself to be \nwell up to the task.\n  As soon as he arrived, Scott found himself in the thick of a number \nof legislative battles. He took on each issue carefully and \nthoughtfully which thoroughly confused all those who thought they had \nScott all figured out. Scott\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nproved to be an independent individual who was determined to do \neverything he could to make a difference in Massachusetts and in \nWashington. He soon proved he was able to do all of that and so much \nmore.\n  For 3 years, Scott has been an important addition to the day to day \nlife of the Senate. I have no doubt we have not heard that last from \nhim. He only needs to take a moment to see what he is interested in \ntaking on in the next chapter of his life. He has a wealth of talent \nand ability and more importantly, he genuinely cares about the future \nof our Nation and all of the people who make up his home State and our \nNation. There is a lot of opportunity out there for Scott and I know he \nwill take full advantage of it.\n  Thanks, Scott, for your service. Thanks for working so hard to get \nhere, and once you did, thank you for never doubting in your ability to \nmake a difference. You have helped to make changes both here and back \nhome in more ways than you will ever know. Thank you, too, for your \nfriendship. For 3 years you have been a strong and powerful advocate \nfor the future of Massachusetts and you can be very proud of all you \nhave achieved during your time in the Senate.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. President, it is a tradition in the Senate to take a moment at \nthe end of the session to express our appreciation for the service of \nthose Senators who will be retiring at the end of the year. This year \nit seems that we have quite a few retiring Senators who will be greatly \nmissed because of the important role they have played in our leadership \non both sides of the aisle. Such a Senator is Jon Kyl. I know we will \nmiss him, his willingness to work with all of his colleagues, and his \nunderstanding of the issues and the need for us to come together to \naddress them.\n  Jon Kyl may very well be one of the smartest individuals I have ever \nmet. More importantly, he is not just highly intelligent, he also has \nan abundance of wisdom. That means he not only knows what is right--he \ndoes it! Putting knowledge into action is always the toughest part of \nthe equation.\n  Here in the Senate, Jon has taken on a combination of assignments \nthat most members would have found impossible. Jon not only served as \nour Party ``Whip'', but he also helped to direct our efforts with his \ngreat understanding of the many details that form such an important \npart of every issue we take up in the Senate.\n  Jon has been such a great asset for our party because his focus is on \nthe details of every issue that comes before the Senate. That is why, \nmore often than not, when a complex matter is up for our consideration, \nmany of us want to know what Jon thinks and what his recommendation \nwould be. His insights have always been an important part of many of \nhis colleagues' consideration of what each of us should do to further \nthe interests of the people of our home States.\n  One thing everyone who has spent some time with Jon knows about him \nis his great love for NASCAR. In fact it is more than just an \nappreciation--I don't think there are many who understand it with the \ndepth that he does. He not only knows the stats, but he has a great \nfeel for how each race played out, the strategy that was employed and \nthe significance of the results. The way he describes ``how the game is \nplayed,'' the rules, and the key players in every race is enough to get \nanyone interested in attending the next event. NASCAR ought to make him \ntheir ambassador. He would increase interest in it right away. He had \ndone a lot to make me a fan, too!\n  Politically, Jon is a staunch conservative. In fact, I am sure if you \nlook up ``staunch conservative'' in a reference book it will refer you \nto their article about Jon. Jon's great talent makes him the perfect \nexample of what a conservative is, and his knowledge serves to \nhighlight the positions and issues that are important to all \nconservatives.\n  Something else that we have all come to know and appreciate about Jon \nis the strength of his faith and his belief in the importance of the \nfamily. One of his first considerations when we took up any legislation \nwas how will this affect our Nation's families? It was that important \nto him. I can not imagine a better starting point for our discussions \nand deliberations.\n  Thank you, Jon, for your willingness to serve. You have made a \ndifference in more ways than you will ever know. In the months to come, \nI will miss seeing you around the Capitol building. I will also miss \nhaving the benefit of your advice and counsel--though I intend to keep \nyour number handy. What I will miss the most, however, is your \nfriendship. Keep in touch with us. We will always appreciate hearing \nfrom you.\n\n\n                               Jim DeMint\n\n  Mr. President, one of our traditions here in the Senate is to take a \nmoment as the current session of Congress draws to a close to \nacknowledge and express our appreciation for the service of all those \nmembers who will be leaving when the gavel brings to a close the 112th \nsession of Congress. I know we will miss them all--especially those \nlike Jim DeMint who have played such an important role in the work we \ndo every day in committee and on the floor.\n  I know I wasn't the only one who was surprised to learn that Jim \nDeMint was leaving the Senate to become the president of the Heritage \nFoundation. It is a great opportunity for him, and I know he will make \nthe most of it in the years to come. We will miss him, though, because \nin a short time he had become an important voice in the Senate for the \nissues that meant a great deal to him.\n  Looking back, I have no doubt that Jim learned at an early age that \nthe law is a great teacher and by coming to Washington to help draft \nour laws he could help to teach people all across the Nation what it \nmeans to be a citizen. He could also help to ensure that our government \nresponds more fully and substantively to the needs of the people of our \nNation. I think that is what most interests him about the Heritage \nFoundation--the knowledge that it will be another opportunity and \nprovide him with a different platform from which he can continue to \nhave an impact on those issues that mean so very much to him.\n  Over the years I have come to know Jim as he has taken his place as \none of a very few who have been known as the conscience of the Senate. \nHe is an individual of strong principles and core values and he brings \nhis sense of direction to the work of the Senate every day.\n  As I have watched him in action, I have seen his ability to bring our \nattention both carefully and forcefully to the flaws in the legislative \nmatters we had taken up for deliberations. In everything we did, Jim \nwould take a close look at the wording of each clause and every \nproposed amendment and make it clear to us the reasons why he believed \nsomething needed to be changed. Then as we began our debate, he would \nthen present his points with greater clarity and substance as he made \nclear his strong opposition to or support for the issue that was before \nus.\n  His views on how the Senate functions and how we could make it more \neffective and more efficient are clearly presented and strongly \nespoused in his books. I have no doubt that Jim's books could change \nthe Senate if we could get every one of our colleagues to read them, \nconsider them and then put some of his ideas into practice.\n  Thank you, Jim, for your willingness to serve and for all you have \nhelped us to accomplish during your time in the Senate. You have \npresented us with some strong, bold ideas about our future as a nation \nand I have no doubt they will continue to have an impact on the Senate \nfor a long time to come. Thanks for sharing them with us.\n  The new adventure you will now begin with the Heritage Foundation \nsounds like a challenge you will fully enjoy. I know we will continue \nto hear from you in your new post and we are looking forward to it. You \nhave an important viewpoint to bring to our deliberations and it would \nbe missed if you didn't continue to make your thoughts and concerns \nknown. We will be watching and listening for your comments and \nsuggestions in the days to come. Good luck and keep in touch!\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, now that the 112th Congress is coming to a close, we \nhave an opportunity to acknowledge and express our appreciation for the \nservice of our fellow Senators who will be retiring at the end of the \nyear. Herb Kohl, one of those who will be returning home when the gavel \nbrings to a close the current session of Congress,\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\nwill be missed, for he has been very active and involved in the day-to-\nday work of the Senate for many years.\n  My first contact with Herb came about when I found out that he had a \nranch in Wyoming. I shouldn't have been surprised. As I have had a \nchance to come to know him, it seemed pretty clear that he had a lot of \nWyoming in him. He is a gentleman and a gentle man in every sense of \nthose words. He says what he means and he means what he says. For him, \nthose words aren't cliches, they are an indication of the way he lives \nhis life.\n  I know I am not the only one who thought that about Herb. That is why \nhe has a well-earned reputation for being a calm, thoughtful \nlegislator. He has a knack for taking on a problem, giving it his full \nattention, and then working with members on both sides of the aisle to \ndevelop a workable solution to solve it. That is why he has been so \nsuccessful on a number of issues.\n  Herb's ability to patiently pursue an agenda, and then focus on a \nsolution that would receive the support necessary to pass, has been a \nhallmark of his service. Never one to seek out public attention for his \nefforts, he has been rewarded with something far more important the \nknowledge that he has done a good job. His commitment to the future of \nhis home State and our Nation has made it possible for him to have an \nimpact on several issues of great importance to people from every \ncorner of the United States.\n  Herb has been such a successful legislator in part because of his \nsmall business background. He understands better than most the \nimportant role our businesses play in our local, State and national \neconomies. He is a man of vision who put his great talents into action \nwhen he helped to take the family business to the next level. His \nsuccess in that effort helped to put him on a path that made it \npossible for him to do some things that a lot of us only dream about.\n  One of those great dreams he was able to make come true was his \nownership of a professional sports team, the Milwaukee Bucks. There had \nbeen some speculation that the team might be bought and moved out of \nMilwaukee. Herb made sure that wouldn't happen. He bought the team and \nkept them in Milwaukee, and the people of Wisconsin appreciated his \nefforts to keep the home team--at home.\n  None of that would have been possible if not for Herb's ability to \norganize his time so that he could make the best use of that precious \ncommodity. That has been one of his greatest assets in the Senate, too. \nBack home, his constituents know that he is a thoughtful person who is \ninterested in them and is always on the watch for those things he can \ndo as their Senator to make their day-to-day lives better.\n  His constituents have greatly appreciated his work in Washington on \ntheir behalf, and that is why they returned him time after time so he \ncould keep doing such a good job of representing them. Herb has \ncompiled an important record that he should be proud of because it \nreflects his commitment to the future of his home State and our Nation.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. President, at the end of each session of Congress, as is our \ntradition, we take a moment to express our appreciation and acknowledge \nthe many contributions each retiring Senator has made to the day-to-day \nwork of the Senate. We will miss them when the gavel brings to a close \nthe 112th Congress--especially Senators like Ben Nelson who have made \nan important difference during their service.\n  Since he is from Nebraska, Ben is a neighbor to my home State of \nWyoming and he understands more than most the inherent problems and \nchallenges faced by rural America. The people of Wyoming, Nebraska and \nthe West have taken on a rugged way of life and it shows itself in \ntheir independence, their unique spirit and their great love of their \ncommunity and their country.\n  Ben's upbringing and his ties to his State of Nebraska gave him an \nimportant understanding of the issues that surround our rural way of \nlife. He took an active role in the Senate's work on agriculture and \nenergy issues because he understands how great a concern they are back \nhome.\n  Ben learned at an early age that he could make a difference if he \nworked hard and dedicated himself to the people of his State. It was a \nplan of action he put into everything he has ever done in life.\n  It helped him to make a successful run for governor, after which he \ndecided to run for the Senate. He knew it wouldn't be easy, and it \nwasn't, but when the votes were counted he had won an important Senate \nseat and was headed here to represent his beloved home State.\n  Soon after he began his Senate career he cast a vote to lower \neveryone's taxes. That took courage. In the years since then, he has \nshown that he has a lot of that important quality in abundance.\n  Since we are neighbors and share an appreciation and understanding of \nrural America and our unique way of life, it shouldn't come as a \nsurprise that we have a great deal in common. We both love our great \noutdoors and there are places in Nebraska that are almost as beautiful \nas Wyoming.\n  We both love to hunt, and Ben has had some very interesting \nopportunities to pursue his hobby all over the world. My hunting has \nall taken place in Wyoming. Because of our love of hunting and my great \naffection for fishing, Ben and I co-chaired the Sportsmen's Caucus. We \nhave also worked together on a number of issues related to the great \noutdoors. They are matters that mean a lot to us and to our \nconstituents back home.\n  Thanks, Ben, for your service and for your determination to make the \nposition of your constituents known here in Washington. You have made a \ndifference in many ways and you can be very proud of your legacy of \nservice. Thanks, too, for your friendship. I have enjoyed coming to \nknow you. Whatever you have planned for the future, I hope you continue \nto enjoy the great adventure of your life.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, as we have all learned, it doesn't always take a \nlifetime of service to make a difference, especially here in the \nSenate. Jim Webb is one of those unique individuals who had an impact \nhere although he only served for one term before deciding to retire. I \nknow I will miss him and his great support for our Nation's military \nand his heartfelt concern for our Nation's veterans.\n  As I have had the opportunity to come to know Jim a little better, it \nis clear that he is a man of strong convictions. As we say in the West, \nhe is someone who means what he says and says what he means. He walks \nhis talk.\n  When he first arrived in Washington he made it clear he wasn't going \nto be someone who could be taken for granted, especially when it came \nto those things in which he strongly believed. He put his home State of \nVirginia first and he was going to work hard to ensure that the \nconcerns of the people back home were heard--and heard clearly--\nwhenever an issue was taken up that was going to have an impact on \nthem.\n  A Vietnam veteran himself, he had a great interest in national \nsecurity issues. His determination to make a difference in that area \nbecame very clear right from the start. Serving on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee he worked very hard to ensure that our veterans were \nable to access the benefits they had earned with their service.\n  Jim is a good writer and he has several books to his credit. They \nhave received a great deal of notice and one of his stories has been \nmade into a movie.\n  I know I join with many of my colleagues in wishing him all the best \nas he returns to Virginia. I don't know what his next great adventure \nwill be, but I do know his skills and talents will provide him with a \nnumber of opportunities to choose from in which he can continue to play \nan active part in his State.\n  Thank you, Jim, for your willingness to serve--not only here in the \nSenate but in our Nation's military. The recognition you earned with \nyour efforts will continue to inspire others. Because of you our \nNation's veterans have had a champion in committee and a warrior on the \nSenate floor who did everything you possibly could to ensure our \nveterans would never have to settle for anything less than the best. \nThey have earned that and so much more with their service, their many \nsacrifices on our behalf and their unsurpassed love for our country.\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. President, at the close of each session of Congress, the Senate \nhas traditionally taken a moment to express our appreciation for the \nservice those who are retiring have provided to the people of their \nhome State and our Nation. It gives us an opportunity to acknowledge \nthe contributions that every Senator makes to the day to day operations \nof the Congress and the work they have been a part of as we have worked \ntogether to craft the laws that govern the Nation.\n  Over the years I have learned a great deal about how the Senate works \nand how to be an effective representative for the people of my home \nState from one of the best, Jeff Bingaman. He has compiled quite a \nrecord that he can be very proud of, and he has done it quietly, almost \nbehind the scenes as he has shown himself to be ``a workhorse and not a \nshowhorse.''\n  For those of us from the West, that is quite a compliment. In a \nnutshell, it means that someone is a lot more concerned with getting \nresults than in getting the credit. It proves the old saying that you \ncan get just about anything done if you don't care who gets the credit \nfor it.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate, I had always believed in the \nimportance of getting acquainted with how things work by taking a close \nlook at how the people who were getting the results I was equally \ncommitted to achieving were doing it. Using that as my standard, one \nSenator who caught my attention quickly was Jeff Bingaman.\n  Jeff is a fellow Westerner and he knows and understands the issues \nthat are so important to the people back home. As I watched him in \naction, I could quickly see why he was a success story here. He had a \nreputation for his ability to work with both sides of the aisle to get \nthe results the people of his home State had sent him here to achieve. \nHe had an understanding of the ramifications of the legislation we were \nworking on that was second to none. Taken together, all of that had \nhelped to make him an important ally in any legislative battle that \nneeded to be won.\n  As I got to know him, I looked to him for his leadership on the \nissues that were on the minds of the people back home in Wyoming. He \nwas taking the lead on a number of them as he worked to increase the \nawareness of our colleagues about matters like open spaces, water and \nthe future of our energy industry.\n  Over the years, Jeff has been a mentor to me. I have learned a great \ndeal from him from our work together on Western issues and from our \nservice on the task groups we both worked on. Jeff has an ability to \nsummarize a difficult issue simply so that it can be understood on a \nnumber of levels by those of us who come from backgrounds that are \nquite different from Jeff's and all our Western colleagues. He was then \nable to propose commonsense solutions that not only made sense to our \nfellow Senators, but were also able to obtain the support they needed \nto be considered and passed by the Senate.\n  That would have never been possible if not for one of Jeff's great \ngifts--his ability to find common ground in the midst of some sharp \ndisagreements. He knows how to take the views of all concerned into \naccount and then develop a plan of action taking a variety of \nviewpoints into consideration. Somehow he had a knack for finding a way \nto make it all work.\n  None of that should have surprised us. After all, Jeff has one \ncredential on his resume that not everyone has the persistence and \ndetermination to acquire. Jeff was active in Boy Scouts at a young age \nand with a lot of hard work and determined effort, he was able to reach \nthe rank of Eagle.\n  Some people might be surprised that I mention Jeff's Eagle, a great \nachievement that he was able to attain so many years ago. I have found \nthat the Eagle speaks volumes about the strength of someone's character \nas they grew up. It proves that they were focused on more important \nthings--like setting goals and then planning a course of action to \nreach them--one by one. There is no more valuable skill to have in the \npursuit of a career and the development of a life than that.\n  During his service in the Senate, Jeff has compiled a record of which \nhe can be very proud--as proud as the people of New Mexico are proud of \nhim. That is why they kept sending him back to the Senate. It is also \nwhy his record of service will continue to receive the notice it \ndeserves as the issues he has worked so hard on will have an impact on \nthe West and the Nation for many years to come.\n  I don't know what Jeff's plans are for the future, but I feel certain \nwe haven't heard the last from him. I hope he will continue to keep in \ntouch with all of our Western delegations. I am certain we could all \nuse a little New Mexico wisdom from time to time on the issues that \ncome before us that are of such great concern to the West and rural \ncommunities all across the country.\n  Thank you, Jeff, for your service to New Mexico and to the United \nStates. We appreciate your willingness to come to Washington to ensure \nthe concerns of your State were heard and that they received the \nattention they deserve. Thanks most of all for your friendship over the \nyears. I have learned a great deal from you and about you and I know \nthe lessons I have learned from you about the Senate and our Committee \nstructure will continue to make me a more effective advocate for \nWyoming and the West. Whatever the next chapter of your life holds in \nstore, I know you will give it your best--just as you have done with \nevery other great adventure in your life.\n\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. President, now that the campaigns are over, the elections have \nbeen held, and the Senate is winding down its current session, I \nappreciate having this opportunity to express my great appreciation to \nthose Senators who have had a great impact on me and our work together \nin the Senate. Such an individual is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has had \na remarkable career as the Senator from the great State of Texas.\n  Senator Hutchison and I go back quite a way--in fact, we go back to \nthe days before I was elected to the Senate. That was when I had just \nbeat the odds and managed to receive the nomination of my party to the \nSenate. A great part of the reason for my success had to do with the \nsupport I received from my family and the enthusiasm we put into \neverything we did that year. It really had an impact throughout the \nState during the primary season. Now that the primary was over, \nhowever, the real battle was about to begin.\n  I knew, as soon as I was nominated, that I had a problem. I was \nrunning against a very strong candidate, a woman with a wealth of \nexperience in politics who had already waged and won a statewide race. \nI had no doubts that we could still win, but I wasn't kidding myself \nthat it would be easy, either.\n  Fortunately, I had a secret weapon--Kay Bailey Hutchison. She agreed \nto come to Wyoming and campaign with me. That was a tremendous blessing \nbecause she had a natural feel for politics and she more than made up \nfor my lack of experience in running a statewide campaign. She gave me \na lot of good advice and we took it all. Then we set out on the \ncampaign trail and that is where she really proved to be an asset.\n  Each stop we made Senator Hutchison showed that she was a natural \npolitician. People responded to her and the way she spoke during our \nevents. She made it clear that she was a hard worker who said what she \nmeant and meant what she said. Her Texas style played well in Wyoming \nand it really made a difference for me.\n  Then, when I came to Washington to begin my work in the Senate, I \nwatched her take on some pretty difficult issues. She had a talent for \nseeing the best solutions to those complicated problems and that helped \nher to make a difference in her home State and here in Washington.\n  What most impressed me was her ability to see a problem as it was \ndeveloping and then formulate a strategy to deal with it before it \nbecame any more difficult. She was very focused on the needs of her \nhome State and what she could do here in the Senate to make sure that \nthe issues of most concern to the people of Texas were addressed.\n  Back home, Senator Hutchison has always been concerned about our \nyoung people and what she could do to ensure they realize they can be \nanything they want to be if they are willing to work hard to succeed. \nThat is why the young women of Texas look up\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nto her and see her as a model of what they can also hope to someday \nachieve. That led her to publish a collection of stories about \nsuccessful women. Senator Hutchison knows that a good biography is more \nthan a source of inspiration, it is a very specific ``how to'' manual \nthat young women all across the country can look to for inspiration, \nguidance and direction on how they can hope to achieve the same kind of \nsuccess in their own lives.\n  Senator Hutchison has a remarkable family and I know that she is very \nproud of them. Not too long ago, she and her husband decided to adopt a \nchild. They wound up adopting not one, but two children who are blessed \nto have two such special parents. It's just another example of the way \nSenator Hutchison has been reaching out to help those who need her in \nso many ways over the years.\n  Senator Hutchison has blazed a trail in so many ways during her \ncareer in public service. She was the first woman ever elected to the \nSenate from Texas, and during her service she has helped young women \nall across her home State of Texas to realize that there are no limits \nto their future. They can be anything they want to be if they are \nwilling to do whatever it takes to succeed, just as Senator Hutchison \nhas done. She is not just a role model, she is an example of what is \npossible for everyone to achieve.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the work of the Senate for the current \nsession of Congress begins to wind down, it is good to take a moment to \nacknowledge and express our appreciation to our friends and colleagues \nwho will be retiring when the final gavel brings to a close the 112th \nSession of Congress. One friend I know I will miss in the months to \ncome is Kent Conrad.\n  Kent is a hard worker, a Senator who is fully focused on the needs of \nhis home State and the work that needs to be done to address the issues \nof concern to his constituents. He is a Senator who will always be \nknown as a serious and thoughtful legislator who has a good sense of \nhow today's problems will affect tomorrow's bottom line if we don't act \nnow to bring our economic policies under control.\n  Throughout his career, Kent has never been one to look for the most \npopular way of doing things. He was more concerned with finding the \nmost productive way of doing things. He knows that what looks like a \ngood idea in the short term doesn't always lead to producing the kind \nof long term results we must have if we are to strengthen our economy \nand put the Nation back to work. He has a great sense of what needs to \nbe done now to ensure our children and grandchildren will have the same \nadvantages that we had. That means never putting off until tomorrow \nwhat we ought to be doing today to ensure those issues are addressed. \nIn fact, when Kent announced his decision to retire he made mention of \nthat fact and how his time would be better spent working instead of \ncampaigning.\n  Kent has been a part of the Senate for four terms--and I am on my \nthird. Over the years I have enjoyed having a chance to come to know \nhim and his wife. They are a very special couple and they are equally \ncommitted to each other and to the future of our Nation. Their shared \ndetermination to make this a better country for all of us has helped to \nmake them a team that has left their mark on the Nation's capital.\n  I have had a chance to travel with them both and Diana and I have \nenjoyed the time we spent together. Kent has a tremendous sense of \nhumor and he has a very interesting outlook on the world. He knows more \nabout the legislation we take up on the Senate Floor than almost anyone \nelse and his understanding of how our bills are written and the impact \nthey will have on our future and our children's future make him someone \nyou would want to be on your side when the battles begin to rage in \nCommittee or on the Floor.\n  Kent is pretty easy to work with and I have enjoyed the opportunities \nwe have had to tackle some pretty difficult issues together. That sense \nof humor of his has helped him out on a number of occasions when the \ngoing got tough. I know, because I have seen him in action as we worked \ntogether on several bills. I also co-chaired a Caucus with him.\n  As the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Kent has really revealed his \nleadership abilities. The Budget Committee provided him with a platform \nthat made it possible for him to speak out on issues that were of great \ninterest and concern to him. He has been a very effective Chairman and \nhe has left a legacy of hard work and positive results that will \nprovide all those who follow him with a good road map to follow that \nhas already proven to be effective.\n  The main thing I think I will always remember about Kent, however, is \nthe way he prepares for his presentations. I don't think there has ever \nbeen, nor will there ever be a Senator who is always so well prepared.\n  Kent and I both appreciate the power of a well designed chart or \ngraph. If you really want me to understand how the policy or program \nyou are offering will affect my home State of Wyoming and the Nation as \na whole, show me the data in pictures not words. Kent makes a regular \nhabit of doing that, and he does it better than just about anyone else.\n  I know that we will be hearing more from Kent in the months to come. \nI don't think he views his retirement as an opportunity to stop \nworking, I think he sees it as a chance to take on something new, some \ngreat and challenging new adventure in his life. I don't know what he \nhas planned, but I am looking forward to seeing him take it on day by \nday.\n  Kent has been a friend to so many of us over the years and I know he \nwill be missed. We appreciate his service, we thank him for the way he \nhandled the gavel in his Committee, but most of all we thank him for \nhis friendship, for his love of the Senate and his determination to \nmake the country a better place for us all--both current and future \ngenerations. Kent has been an effective Senator for his home State and \nin so many ways he has succeeded in helping to make North Dakota and \nour Nation a better place to live.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at the end of each Congress the Senate has a \ncustom of taking a moment to express our appreciation to those members \nwho will be returning home when the gavel brings the current session to \na close. This tradition provides us with an opportunity to acknowledge \neach Senator's efforts and take note of the difference they have made \nboth back home and here in Washington, DC.\n  One Senator I know I will miss in the months to come is Senator \nRichard Lugar. He has had a great influence on my service here in the \nSenate. During his six terms of service in the Senate, I know I'm not \nthe only one who learned a great deal from him about how to be the kind \nof legislator that gets results.\n  I was fortunate to have had someone like Senator Lugar reach out to \nserve as a mentor to me. When I first arrived, my experience in the \nWyoming State Legislature had taught me to enter the legislative \nbattles slowly, taking the time to learn from the seasoned veterans how \nto be an effective advocate for my home State and the people back home. \nSenator Lugar proved to be a good choice for me to observe as I tried \nto pick up on his way of doing things on the floor and in his \nCommittee.\n  I soon learned that Senator Lugar had a style all his own. His \ndemeanor of being quiet and calm in his dealings with other members and \nthe thoughtful presentations he made on the Senate floor made it clear \nthat he always had a strategy in mind as we took up those issues that \nmeant a great deal to him.\n  I shouldn't have been surprised he had such a good understanding of \nthe right way to do things here. It's an indication of one of his great \nachievements--he's a fellow Eagle Scout. That great training he \nreceived in his younger days never left him. His years in the Boy \nScouts prepared him for the challenges he had taken on over the years \nand it taught him the importance of teamwork--bipartisan teamwork--in \ntaking on the issues that were of such great concern to the people of \nhis State. His experience with the Scouts taught him a great deal about \nlife and the importance of holding on to the principles and values that \nhelped to make him a leader back home and here in the Senate.\n  Another aspect of our lives that we have in common is our service as\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nmayor. There are few jobs quite as difficult as that and I have a great \ndeal of respect for anyone who takes on that challenge.\n  I served as mayor of Gillette, Wyoming during a difficult time in its \nhistory. Senator Lugar served as mayor of Indianapolis. He brought \nquite a few good proposals with him and that helped to make it possible \nfor him to do some pretty remarkable things. One accomplishment that \nstands out was his consolidation of the city and the surrounding \ncounty. That helped to make the government work better for the people \nof the area. His proposals received a great deal of attention and that \ngot his administration noticed. It soon led him to bring his unique \nbrand of leadership to the National League of Cities, where he served \nas its president.\n  After such a string of successes, it was only natural that he then \nbring his vision for the future of our Nation to the United States \nSenate. For six terms he has been a strong voice for the people of his \nhome State on a long list of issues that were of great concern to them. \nHe has been a leader in both the areas of foreign affairs and \nagriculture. He has been a great friend of rural America as he has \nworked to ensure that the programs and policies that work so well in \nurban areas also benefit rural States and communities like those in his \nhome State and mine. He has compiled a legacy during his service in the \nSenate that should make him very proud.\n  Now Senator Lugar will be returning to his beloved home State. Those \nare his roots and it represents the kind of experiences that helped to \nform him over the years. It was a life that made him what he is today--\nstrong, independent and committed to doing what is right.\n  Now that this chapter of Senator Lugar's life has come to a close, \nanother will soon begin. That is just as it should be for we will miss \nhis leadership on a long list of issues. I hope we continue to hear \nfrom him with his thoughtful ideas on the direction we need to follow \nto turn our economy around.\n  I know I join with our colleagues in thanking Senator Lugar for his \nservice, for the leadership he has provided on more issues than I could \never list in this short reflection on his many years in the Senate, and \nmost of all, for his friendship. That was a great gift that meant a \ngreat deal to us all.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it has long been a Senate tradition to take \na moment as the current session of Congress draws to a close to express \nour appreciation and acknowledge the many contributions each retiring \nSenator has made to our legislative deliberations both on the Floor and \nin committee. We will miss them when the gavel brings to a close the \n112th Congress--especially senators like Olympia Snowe who have made an \nimportant difference during their service.\n  With Olympia's retirement Maine has lost a very powerful and \neffective legislator and our Nation's small business community has lost \nthe support of a great champion. Throughout her service in the Senate \nOlympia has shown her great understanding of our economy and her \ncommitment to keeping our small businesses strong and vibrant. She \nknows that our small businesses are truly the backbone of our \neconomies--on the local, State and national level and everything we can \ndo to keep them going strong will have the greatest impact on our \nefforts to keep our American dream alive and available to the people of \nour great Nation.\n  Olympia has very strong roots in Maine and she has an in depth \nunderstanding of the priorities of the people of her home State and \nwhat they expect her to work on here in Washington. That is why she has \na well deserved reputation for being a thoughtful and careful \nlegislator, one who looks closely at all the details of a bill before \nmaking her decision, based on its merits.\n  I don't think I've ever met a Senator who was a more avid reader than \nOlympia. Whenever the Senate takes up an issue, she is always looking \nfor more materials to read that will help her develop creative and \ninnovative solutions to our Nation's problems.\n  Then, when the matter comes up for our review in Committee or on the \nfloor, she has at the ready several articles that will drive home and \nanchor the point she is making. No one is better at researching an \nissue than Olympia and then, when the matter is up for debate, making \nit clear what she believes to be the best way to tackle the problem. No \nmatter the topic, it's always a plus to have her on your side.\n  In the years to come, I will always remember Olympia's dedication and \nfirm resolve to get things done. As we worked together on several \nissues, it was clear she had a wealth of knowledge about how each \nprovision of a bill would play out. She brought some very good ideas to \nthe process and her input helped to make each bill better.\n  Olympia had always been known as a powerful and effective speaker. \nSomeone with the ability to not only present her position with clarity \nand precision, but who could also persuade others to her point of view \nwith her common sense approach to problem solving. Those skills and so \nmany more helped her to make a difference throughout her home State of \nMaine during her career in public service. In the end, that is why she \nwas so successful in the politics of her home State. The people of \nMaine know Olympia and they appreciate her efforts on their behalf. \nOver the years Olympia has compiled a record of success of which she \ncan truly be proud.\n  I know I join with the people of Maine in telling Olympia how much we \nappreciate her willingness to serve. She could have followed so many \ndifferent career paths, but she was determined to make Maine a better \nplace for our children and our grandchildren. Thanks, too, for her \nfriendship and her support on the issues on which we worked together. \nOlympia is an individual of great strength and firm convictions and \nwill be missed in the months to come.\n  I don't know what the Senator has planned for the next great \nadventure in her life, but whatever it is I am certain we haven't heard \nthe last from her. We will always be pleased to hear her thoughts about \nthe issues we have before us here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8354-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8354-S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING WARREN B. RUDMAN\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of an \nextraordinary man, an exceptional public servant, and a dear friend, \nSenator Warren B. Rudman. As the U.S. Senate, the people of New \nHampshire, and the entire Nation mourn his loss, I wish to add my voice \nto the chorus of tributes that continue to reverberate from every \ncorner of the country in commemoration of a man whose contributions to \nour Nation and our world are as numerous as they are invaluable. I also \nwant to express my heartfelt condolences to his wife Margaret his \ndaughters, Laura and Debra, and his entire family at this most \ndifficult of times.\n  With a Senate that is profoundly dysfunctional and in an era when \nbipartisanship and compromise are both seemingly lost arts, we recall \nwith tremendous admiration the intelligence and exemplary judgment of a \ndistinguished and iconic legislator whose paramount purpose was to rise \nabove and beyond the din of partisanship to effectively serve the \ncitizens of New Hampshire and the people of our great Nation.\n  The child of immigrants, Warren grew up in his beloved Granite State. \nAnd from an early age, he was instilled with New England's hallmark \nsense of independence and frugality and its spirit of grit and tenacity \nqualities which he first brought to bear during his heroic service as \ncombat platoon leader and company commander in the Korean war, \nrightfully earning him the Bronze Star.\n  Returning from the horrors of war, Warren emerged with a renewed \ncommitment to duty and service, this time in the public sphere, where \nhe applied himself to delivering justice for the people of New \nHampshire as their attorney general. His colleagues would later recall \nthat he was one of the finest public servants to ever grace that office \nand that all who followed aspired to the example he established.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today to declare, like so many of my \ncolleagues have, that those sentiments ring true for Warren's service \nin the U.S. Senate as well. Indeed, he was an exemplary\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nand consummate public servant, thoroughly understanding that the very \nessence of good governance was problemsolving and that as an elected \nofficial he was entrusted with a responsibility to work across the \naisle to accomplish the business of the Nation.\n  In fact, all one has to do is look to his signature piece of \nlegislation, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act, to witness \nthat fact. This bipartisan piece of legislation brought under control \nthe Nation's ballooning deficits and directly contributed to the \neconomic prosperity and growth that is so fondly associated with the \n1990s. In that light, we can look to Warren with grateful eyes because \nin bringing to bear his credibility, his intellect, and his experience, \nhe pursued a course that was not necessarily expedient but that was \nultimately right. A longtime fiscal visionary, he was a leader whose \nvoice we should heed today.\n  But that spirit of integrity, decency, and honor was a mainstay of \nWarren's character, and those principles were ingrained into the \nunwavering set of beliefs which remained with him throughout his \nlifetime. They guided him during the Keating 5 investigation, informed \nhim during the Iran-Contra deliberations, and inspired him in seeing \nthrough the Supreme Court nomination of his good friend from New \nHampshire and exceptional jurist, Supreme Court Justice David Souter. \nIndeed, they were the ever-present and indispensable tenets that both \nfirmly grounded him in his Granite State roots while also spurring him \nto the legislative heights that became the capstones of his landmark \ntenure in public service.\n  That is why I will forever admire Warren's passionate, unvarnished, \nand classic straightforward approach, which helped build consensus \nthroughout his time in the U.S. Senate and which served the country so \nwell. While I missed serving with him in the Senate by 1 year, I had \nthe privilege of working with him on bicameral basis as a Member of the \nU.S. House of Representative, and during that time and through those \nexperiences, my husband Jock and I were fortunate enough to become \nfriends with Warren. In fact, he had a tremendous affection for Maine, \nowning a home on beautiful Bailey Island and while we know his heart \nforever belongs to New Hampshire, we are still proud to consider him an \nhonorary Mainer.\n  Undoubtedly, though, Warren was a man ahead of his time. From \nchampioning the watershed legislation which reduced our deficit, to \nhelping found the bipartisan Concord Coalition, which offers serious \nsolutions for our Nation's significant fiscal challenges, Warren's is a \nlegacy that Jock and I are proud to carry forward by serving on the \nboard of advisors at University of New Hampshire's Warren B. Rudman \nCenter for Justice, Leadership, and Public Policy. And as students \nacross the country continue to learn about Senator Rudman, we take \ngreat pride in knowing that history will remember him as a statesman of \nthe highest caliber who served America and his beloved New Hampshire \nwith unsurpassed distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8355-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECT OUR KIDS ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year more than 6 million children in \nthe United States are reported as victims of child abuse and neglect. \nTragically, more than 1,500 of those children lose their lives most \nunder the age of four. Many of these deaths are preventable and we must \nfight for those who are too young to defend and speak for themselves.\n  The United States currently does not have a comprehensive strategy to \naddress child abuse fatalities, or a national standard for \nclassification and reporting of those deaths. This leaves many child \nabuse fatalities to be underreported, which becomes an additional \nhindrance in addressing the root causes.\n  I am pleased to work with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, \nSenator Collins, and a number of advocacy and child welfare experts to \nintroduce the Protect Our Kids Act of 2012. This legislation will \nestablish the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect \nFatalities.\n  The commission will be comprised of a variety of professionals with \ndiverse experience and perspectives. They will be charged with \ndeveloping a national strategy for reducing child abuse and neglect \nfatalities, and provide comprehensive recommendations for all levels of \ngovernment. It will analyze the effectiveness of existing programs \ndesigned to prevent or identify maltreatment deaths and learn more \nabout what works and what doesn't. Child abuse fatalities are a \nnational crisis that requires a collective solution. Once the \ncommission completes their work any relevant agency will report to \nCongress regarding their response to the commission recommendations.\n  The loss of just one child to abuse is one child too many. I \nappreciate the work of a number of organizations that have been \nintegral to the development of the legislation and have endorsed it, \nincluding the National Coalition to End Child Abuse Deaths, whose \nmembers include the National Association of Social Workers, NASW; the \nNational Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths, NCRPCD, \nNational Children's Alliance, NCA; Every Child Matters Education Fund, \nECMEF; and the National District Attorney's Association (NDAA).\n  I look forward to our continued progress in developing a more \neffective approach to improving child welfare. I thank Chairman Baucus \nand Senator Collins for their leadership on this important issue and I \nask all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8355-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8355-S8356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2838, Coast \nGuard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012, which we sent to the \nPresident late last week. This important bill provides authorization \nfor all of the programs and missions of the United States Coast Guard, \nalong with provisions important to the maritime industry.\n  One important provision in the bill addresses the tonnage situation \nof the vessel Aqueos Acadian. The system of tonnage measurement, though \narcane and complicated, is vital to the operation and economics of any \nvessel. In the case of the Aqueos Acadian, its original configuration \nin 1973 was certified in Coast Guard documentation to be 274 gross \nregistered tons, GRT, which is the official domestic tonnage \nmeasurement. Later, the vessel had an addition of a closed-in shelter \ndeck, which increased its domestic tonnage, as well as its \ninternational tonnage, which is measured differently than domestic \ntonnage under the International Tonnage Convention, ITC, rules. Later \nstill, the modifications that increased the tonnage measurements were \nremoved, and the vessel's official documents were issued by the Coast \nGuard and ABS to reflect that its GRT had been reduced to 275, almost \nexactly the original tonnage.\n  Vessels with greater than 300 GRT have safety and manning \nrequirements much more complicated than vessels at or below 300 GRT. At \nthe time of the certification of the down-sizing modifications, the ITC \ntonnage was not reduced because the Coast Guard's ability to reduce \ninternational tonnage administratively is either extremely arcane or \nnon-existent--even if the vessel's tonnage has in fact been reduced.\n  When Aqueos Corporation in Louisiana purchased the vessel, its \nofficial documents reflected that the GRT had been reduced to below 300 \nGRT. Relying on those Coast Guard and ABS issued documents, the company \nsought Coast Guard administrative help to reduce the international \ntonnage commensurate with the GRT. The Coast Guard bill includes \nlanguage that allows the company to keep operating the vessel under its \ncurrent documentation and allows time to complete the tonnage-reducing \nmodifications that were not done by the previous owners of the vessel \nbut that the Coast Guard has said must be done. Unfortunately, the ITC \ntonnage reduction remains incomplete. The provision does not restore \nthe vessel's ITC tonnage to that of the GRT. This second step would \nafford to the vessel the same result that other vessels in the Aqueos \nAcadian's class have, through a previous legislative grandfather \nprovision, that allows those vessels' GRT and ITC tonnage to be the \nsame. This second step would not give the vessel a competitive \nadvantage relative to other vessels in the Acadian's class; rather, \nwithout it the company is at a competitive disadvantage with those \nother\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nvessels. As time goes by, the vessel is losing out on potentially \nmillions of dollars of domestic and international work.\n  It is not yet clear whether such an administrative solution can be \nachieved. I understand the concern addressed by the ITC about vessels \nhaving substantially changed size, and I agree that a larger vessel \nshould be regulated at a larger tonnage. Unfortunately, the way that \nthe ITC addresses this situation is to forever assign a vessel a higher \ntonnage even if tonnage has been actually reduced. This vessel should \nbe recognized to its lower tonnage and should not be forced into a \nregime that does not recognize its circumstance. I believe we should \nseek additional legislative language that would correct the \ninternational tonnage problem, but in the interim I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Coast Guard and encourage the agency to \ndevelop an administrative solution to this situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8356-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8356-S8357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PASSAGE OF THE RUSSIA AND MOLDOVA JACKSON-VANIK REPEAL ACT\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Congress for \npassing an important piece of legislation--the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of \nLaw and Accountability Act incorporated into the Russia and Moldova \nJackson-Vanik Repeal Act of 2012. As a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I must note it is one of the most important pieces of \nforeign policy legislation dealing with human rights we have taken up \nin recent years. In particular, I want to commend my colleague, Senator \nCardin, for his work on the Magnitsky Act. Bringing Russia into the \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO, is a good thing. The WTO is a rules-\nbased organization that will create a level playing field for U.S. \ncompanies that want to export their products to Russia.\n  As committed as we are to strengthening trade links between the \nUnited States and Russia, we must be even more dedicated to promoting \nthe rule of law and protecting the brave Russian individuals and \norganizations fighting for democracy and human rights. This is why the \nMagnitsky Act is so important. In the year following Mr. Putin's return \nto the Presidency, he has built on his repressive record by instituting \nlaws that crack down on freedom of expression, assembly, and \nassociation. A new law makes it easier for the state to accuse a person \nof treason and members of a female rock band have been jailed for \ncriticizing Mr. Putin. These measures are designed to strike back at a \nrapidly increasing segment of Russian society demanding an end to \ncorruption, oppression, and calling for genuine democratic governance, \nhuman rights, and the rule of law.\n  The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act is named \nafter a man who witnessed the deep-seated rot that is a major part of \nRussia's governance today and decided to expose it to the public. For \nthose who might be unfamiliar with the case, Mr. Magnitsky was an \naccountant with Hermitage Capitol Management, which had publicly \ndisclosed several instances of alleged Russian Government and corporate \ncorruption related to state-run industries. The company's founder, Bill \nBrowder, was expelled from Russia by government bureaucrats who viewed \nhim as a threat. In 2007, Russian authorities raided Hermitage's \noffices and subsequently accused the firm of tax evasion and owing \nhundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes. Mr. Magnitsky \ninvestigated these charges and discovered that it was the police who \nhad provided seized tax records to Russian criminal elements who then \nfalsified documents and received a $230 million rebate from the Russian \ntreasury--the largest in Russian history.\n  What is shocking is that when Mr. Magnitsky went to the Russian \nGovernment with the evidence he uncovered in 2008, he was the one \narrested and jailed. He was held 11 months without trial, became sick, \nand was denied medical treatment and visits by his family. Mr. \nMagnitsky was held in horrible conditions. According to his diary, \nRussian authorities reputedly pressured him to recant his accusations \nand instead accuse Hermitage of financial crimes. On November 16, 2009, \nMr. Magnitsky died in Russian custody. According to the head of the \nMoscow Helsinki Group, Ludmila Alekseeva, Magnitsky had died from \nbeatings and torture carried out by several officers of Russia's \nMinistry of Interior. Some people also point to the deliberate denial \nof medical care for his illnesses as a contributing factor to his \ndeath. In standing up for truth, justice, and the rule of law, Mr. \nMagnitsky gave the Russian people his life. To date, not one senior \ngovernment official has been held responsible for his death. Instead, \nin a gesture of mockery, last February the Russian police resubmitted a \ncriminal case against Mr. Magnitsky, making him the first Russian \ncitizen to be tried after his death.\n  The Magnitsky Act takes a measured and targeted approach to \nidentifying and dealing with those who are responsible for egregious \nhuman rights and antidemocratic activities throughout Russia. This bill \nallows the Secretary of State to identify and compile a list of people \nresponsible for the death of Magnitsky, engaged in its coverup, or \nhaving financially benefited from his death. The bill offers \nsignificant sanctions on those identified by the State Department. They \nare to be denied visas to the United States, have any assets in U.S. \njurisdiction frozen, and prevented from using the U.S. banking system.\n  For the record, as a cosponsor of this bill, I want to be absolutely \ncrystal clear on one particular point. While the death of Mr. Magnitsky \nis tragic, this bill is not reserved just for those complicit in his \ndeath. This legislation not only applies to those involved in the death \nof Mr. Magnitsky, but it also applies to those involved in, as the bill \nstates, ``extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of \nhuman rights committed against individuals seeking to expose illegal \nactivity carried out by officials of the Government of the Russian \nFederation; or to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote internationally \nrecognized human rights and freedoms, such as the freedoms of religion, \nexpression, association, and assembly and the rights to a fair trial \nand democratic elections, anywhere in the world.'' Further, anyone \nassisting those involved in the abuses described in the legislation \ncan, and should, be targeted.\n  During Senate debate my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator \nWicker, spoke eloquently about the ability to hold human rights abusers \naccountable and in particular cited the cases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky \nand Planton Lebedev--other recognized political prisoners. To quote my \nfriend from Arizona discussing the situation in Russia today:\n\n       This culture of impunity in Russia has been growing worse \n     and worse over many years. It has been deepened by the \n     increased surveillance and harassment of members of \n     opposition and civil society groups . . . by the continued \n     violent attacks on brave journalists who dare to publish the \n     truth about official corruption and other state crimes in \n     Russia today . . . and of course, by the continued detention \n     of numerous political prisoners, not least Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky and his associate Platon Lebedev, who remain \n     locked away but not forgotten.\n\n  The cases of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, both jailed because of \nMr. Putin's sanctioned theft and destruction of the oil company, Yukos \nOil, headed by Mr. Khodorkovsky, falls squarely within the parameters \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. Khodorkovsky, a businessman, was falsely accused of tax evasion \nand jailed in 2003 after engaging in politics and forcing a discussion \nof corruption in Russia. His close friend and business partner, Planton \nLebedev, was also jailed as part of the theft of Yukos Oil. Both are \nwidely considered political prisoners--in 2011 Amnesty International \ndeclared them political prisoners--and there have been numerous House \nand Senate resolutions that have highlighted Mr. Khodorkovsky's and Mr. \nLebedev's cases.\n  But they are not the only ones. Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev \nremain jailed but at least are still alive. One of the most horrific \nstories in the entire Yukos affair is the case of Vasily Alexanyan. \nWhile the Kremlin's dismantling of Yukos was well underway after Mr. \nKhodorkovsky's arrest in 2003, Mr. Alexanyan, a Harvard Law School \ngraduate and former Yukos general counsel, stepped up in March 2006 to \nassume the position of executive vice president of Yukos. At the time\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nthe company was being forced through a state-orchestrated bankruptcy \nprocess. Alexanyan's attempts to protect the company's rights in this \nprocess ran up against the hostility of government authorities. Mr. \nAlexanyan was jailed on April 6, 2006. He was held in horrible \nconditions during his pretrial detention in a freezing cell and \nsubjected to torture. The authorities knew he had HIV and a compromised \nimmune system. They attempted to make him give testimony against Mr. \nKhodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev and others at Yukos in exchange for better \ntreatment and medicine. He refused. The European Court of Human Rights \nrepeatedly issued interim measures to the Russian authorities \nrequesting medical care be provided to Alexanyan. The authorities did \nnot comply, leaving Alexanyan without antiretroviral treatment for \nalmost 2 years. Because of this state-sponsored torture, he died when \nhe was just 39 years old.\n  More than 50 criminal cases against Yukos executives, employees, and \nothers associated with Khodorkovsky or Yukos have been filed by Russian \nauthorities. The strategy of Russian investigators has involved \ninvestigating or prosecuting business partners, juniors, or even \nbystanders to obtain statements or court rulings that would produce \n``evidence'' and establish the ``facts'' they needed for their trumped \nup charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky and others connected with Yukos.\n  There is no question the continuing incarceration of Mr. Khodorkovsky \nand Mr. Lebedev is a human rights abuse. The European Court for Human \nRights ruled that violations of Mr. Khodorkovsky's fundamental human \nrights did occur in connection with his arrest and detention between \n2003 and 2005--including degrading prison conditions, inhuman and \ndegrading conditions in the courtroom throughout his first trial, \ndetention unjustified by compelling reasons outweighing the presumption \nof liberty, and unfair hearings reviewing his detention. The court has \nraised similar concerns with Mr. Lebedev.\n  Other cases are also clear cut, such as Anna Politkovskaya, the \nrenowned journalist and Kremlin critic, who was shot dead while \nentering her apartment building on October 7, 2006. Ms. Politkovskaya \nrose to prominence for her in-depth coverage of the war in Chechnya, \nexposing incidents of state-sponsored torture, mass executions, \nkidnappings, and war crimes. Four individuals initially accused of \nkilling Ms. Politkovskaya were found not guilty, and no light has been \nshed on the true architect of her murder. Her case would be captured by \nthis legislation if those responsible can be identified.\n  Let's not forget that we are demanding Russia abide by the \ninternational agreements that it has ratified and live up to the \nexpectations of the organizations it has joined. The Russian Federation \nis a member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and \nCo-operation in Europe, and the Council of Europe. It is also a party \nto the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights, the UN Convention against Corruption, and the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\n  This legislation is narrowly targeted to hold accountable specific \npersons for the most heinous of crimes and represents a core U.S. \nforeign policy value. It is also consistent with targeted sanctions the \nUnited States has imposed on other countries with major human rights \nconcerns.\n  This also strengthens the President's National Security Strategy \nannounced last May, PSD-10, by ``closing gaps'' in our legal system so \nour country does not inadvertently become a haven for human rights \nviolators. He enumerated grounds for denying admission to the United \nStates, and this legislation complements his initiative by providing a \nstatutory, legal guidelines for the administration.\n  This bill enjoys enormous bipartisan and bicameral support with a 365 \nto 43 vote in the House of Representatives and 92 votes in the Senate. \nIn short, there is consensus for this bill and an understanding of the \ntypes of cases that fall within the Magnitsky Act's parameters. In \nRussia, the Magnitsky Act will serve as a deterrent to those engaged in \noppression and provide a shield to millions of Russian activists \ndetermined to secure greater human rights and establish the rule of \nlaw. This bill gives hope to Russian civil society and to echo my \nfriend from Arizona's eloquent comment to Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. \nLebedev that ``they are not forgotten.'' Those in Russia who are \noppressed, intimidated, or suffering because they are seeking \ndemocracy, truth and justice should know they are not forgotten and \nyour spirit and determination inspire us.\n  The fact that certain Russian Government officials have lashed out \nagainst this law speaks to the powerful tool it can be in support of \ndemocracy and human rights in Russia. It is not enough to pass this \nlaw--the United States must now publically hold those accountable for \npersecuting Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev, and so many others in \nRussia. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nadministration to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8357-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8357-S8358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IMPROPER PAYMENTS ELIMINATION AND RECOVERY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this week, the Senate passed the Improper \nPayments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012, The IPERA \nImprovement Act or H.R. 4053. Earlier this month, the House passed the \nsame legislation, which builds on the Improper Payments Elimination and \nRecovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) by taking additional steps to identify and \nprevent improper payments by Federal agencies. I look forward to seeing \nthe President sign into law this important, bipartisan legislation.\n  The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of \n2012 goes beyond IPERA's goals for curbing agencies' improper payments \nwith three main concepts, including provisions that: expand \nrequirements and strengthen estimates for agencies' improper payments; \nmandate the establishment of a government-wide ``Do Not Pay'' program; \nand prevent payments to deceased individuals. As my colleagues know, \nimproper payments are payments made in error, such as payments made to \nthe wrong person or in the wrong amount. These kinds of preventable \nmistake unfortunately result in billions of lost taxpayer dollars every \nyear.\n  Although we have made great strides in curbing improper payments in \nthe past year, we still have a ways to go to improve transparency and \nmake agencies and agency leadership more accountable for better \nprotecting the taxpayer dollars we entrust to them. At a time of record \ndeficits, we need to be getting the most out of every dollar and cannot \nafford to waste more than a hundred billion annually. I will continue \nto work with my colleagues in Congress and the Administration to see \nthat these measures are enacted, and properly and efficiently \nimplemented.\n  The bipartisan legislation requires several important steps to curb \nFederal Government waste and fraud.\n  First, the bill requires agencies to strengthen the estimation of \nimproper payments. The legislation requires improved and more \nconsistent reporting of improper payment estimates by Federal agencies, \nbased on recommendations from the Department of Defense inspector \ngeneral and the Government Accountability Office. The legislation, for \nexample, would prevent agencies from relying only on voluntary \ndisclosure of improper payments by contractors, as well as require \nagencies to produce documentation to prove a payment was correct.\n  Second, the bill mandates the establishment of a government wide ``Do \nNot Pay'' program. Too often, Federal agencies make improper payments \nto individuals that could easily be identified as ineligible if \npayments were more routinely screened against Federal databases. \nUnfortunately, Federal agencies are not doing this basic eligibility \nscreening before payments are made. Through the initiative, before an \nagency could award a contract or grant, the agency would have to cross \ncheck against the ``Do Not Pay'' database, which will include a central \ncomprehensive database of individuals, contractors, and others who may \nbe ineligible to receive Federal funds, such as companies that are no \nlonger allowed to do work with the Federal Government because of a \nfraud conviction or similar reason.\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\n  The administration is currently establishing a ``Do Not Pay `` \nprogram based on the White House executive memorandum, Memorandum on \nEnhancing Payment Accuracy Through a ``Do Not Pay List.'' However, \nthere was no statutory mandate to proceed. The legislation establishes \nthe ``Do Not Pay'' program in law throughout the Federal Government \nunder a specific timetable.\n  Third, the legislation targets death fraud and improper payments to \ndeceased individuals. Improper payments include those made to \nindividuals who are deceased, and should therefore no longer be \neligible under program rules, yet still receive payments. For example, \nthe Office of Personnel Management Inspector General reported that $601 \nmillion in improper payments were made to Federal retirees found to \nhave already died. However, such payments to dead people were not \nunique to this one program. Improving the collection and use by Federal \nagencies of data on deceased beneficiaries will help curb hundreds of \nmillions, if not billions of dollars, in improper payments. The IPERA \nImprovement Act requires that the Office of Management and Budget, in \nconsultation with other agencies and stakeholders, determine a plan for \ncurbing improper payments to deceased individuals.\n  Finally, the legislation requires that the Office of Management and \nBudget report to Congress on the current efforts by agencies to recover \nimproper payments, including a listing of agencies that employ outside \ncontractors for recovery efforts, and their current levels and targets \nfor recoveries. This reporting can easily be done as part of the annual \nreport on improper payments currently conducted by the OMB.\n  I believe passage of the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery \nImprovement Act of 2012 represents an important step toward curbing \nwaste and fraud within the Federal Government. I look forward to \nworking with the administration and Federal agencies to implement the \nlegislation's provisions. I also look forward to working with my \ncongressional colleagues on additional steps during the next \nlegislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8358-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING OLIVIA CULPO, MISS UNIVERSE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to Olivia Culpo, a native of Cranston, RI, on being \ncrowned Miss Universe. After being crowned Miss Rhode Island USA in her \nfirst ever pageant competition last year, Olivia's rise to Miss \nUniverse has been nothing short of meteoric. In quick succession she \nbecame the first Rhode Islander to ever win the Miss USA competition, \nand is now the first Miss USA to win the Miss Universe pageant in over \na decade. She has made the people of our State very proud.\n  The Miss Universe title is an acknowledgement of Olivia's exceptional \nintelligence, talent, and compassion. She was recognized by the \nNational Honor Society for her academic excellence at Rhode Island's \nSt. Mary's Academy Bay View. She currently attends Boston University in \nneighboring Massachusetts, where she has made the dean's list every \nsemester.\n  In addition to excelling in her studies, Olivia is a talented and \ndedicated musician. From a young age, her love for music was cultivated \nby her proud parents, Peter and Susan Culpo, themselves musicians. She \ntook cello lessons from second grade on, and has since performed with \nthe Rhode Island Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, Rhode Island \nPhilharmonic Chamber Ensemble, Bay View Orchestra, and Rhode Island All \nState Orchestra. This self-described cellist nerd has also had the \nhonor of performing at Boston Symphony Hall and at Carnegie Hall in New \nYork City, and she completed a tour of England in 2010.\n  Olivia has already demonstrated a strong drive to make a difference \nin her community and her country. Earlier this year, I had the \nopportunity to meet with Olivia here in my Washington office, where she \nadvocated passionately for Federal support of ovarian cancer research. \nI share her deep concern about the terrible effects of cancer. She is a \nvaluable ally in the search for a cure.\n  Olivia has given the Ocean State something to be proud of. I am \ngrateful to Olivia Culpo for the example she sets for our children and \nfor being a stellar and faithful representative of the State of Rhode \nIsland on the world stage. I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8358-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8358-S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ANN MILLNER\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Nelson Mandela said, ``Education is \nthe most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.'' In \nUtah, Weber State University President Ann Millner has lead the charge \nto increase, improve and enhance higher education opportunities for \nanyone who has sought them. After 10 years of distinguished service she \nis stepping down from her post and I rise to honor her today.\n  Before being selected president of the university, Ann served Weber \nin a variety of capacities including vice president for university \nrelations, associate dean of continuing education, assistant vice \npresident for community partnerships and director of outreach education \nin the school of allied health services. President Millner brought with \nher a well-rounded resume of leadership in education gained at several \ndifferent universities. She served as education coordinator of the \nmedical technology program at Vanderbilt University, instructional \ndeveloper in medical technology at Thomas Jefferson University, a \nlecturer at the school of health professions, Southwest Texas State \nUniversity, and associate director of continuing education at the \nEdmonda campus of Gwynedd-Mercy College. Ann has given her career to \nthe pursuit of improving educational opportunities around the country \nand that motivation has been central to her administration at Weber.\n  In 2002, Ann was selected as president of the university from a pool \nof 55 possible candidates. Regent George Mantes said, ``In selecting a \npresident of Weber State University we looked for someone who could \nlead a university that serves over 17,000 students and who would also \nbe seen as a community leader for Northern Utah. We had terrific people \nto choose from and feel confident that in selecting Dr. Millner we have \nfound the right person to fill both of these important roles.'' Mr. \nMantes and the selection committee's confidence in President Millner \nhas paid off. Under her leadership Weber State University opened a new \ncampus in Davis and enrollment increased from 17,000 to 25,000. The \nuniversity has added a number of new programs, certificates, \nbaccalaureate and graduate degrees including seven masters degree \nprograms and countless online course work which all serve to both \nenhance and expand the educational opportunities offered to students. \nWeber has gained particular acclaim for its growing engineering \nComputer and Electronics Engineering Technology department, which \nfocuses on training students in the innovations and technologies of the \nfuture. In 2010 President Millner announced the ``Dream Weber \nProgram,'' one of the many scholarship and outreach programs her \nadministration developed to make higher education a possibility for \nthose who would otherwise not have the opportunity.\n  The new and upgraded facilities on Weber's campus stand as a powerful \nsymbol of the legacy President Millner leaves behind. In addition to an \nentire new campus in Weber, President Millner oversaw the construction \nof the Hurst Center for Lifelong Learning, a two-story facility \ndedicated to helping provide students with opportunities to continue \neducation. She also oversaw the opening of Wildcat Village, a \nresidential housing facility that serves over 500 students with a fun, \nlow-cost housing experience. She also oversaw the construction and \nopening of Elizabeth Hall, a state-of-the-art classroom building which \nfeatures multimedia capabilities, writing and tutoring centers and \nenough classroom space to offer more classes than any other building on \ncampus. These three buildings exemplify some of President Millner's \nmajor accomplishments during her presidency: to increase focus on \neducation as a lifelong pursuit, to increase educational opportunities \nand to enhance educational experiences with cutting-edge technologies \nand facilities.\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\n  President Millner brought with her a vision of the collaborative \nrelationship the university would have with the surrounding northern \nUtah community. In 2008, Weber State received the Carnegie Foundation's \nClassification for Community Engagement, an award recognizing the \ncollaboration ``between educational institutions and local, state, \nregional, national and local communities for the mutually beneficial \nexchange of knowledge and resources.'' Under her leadership, Weber \nState University also has taken part in the Utah Science, Technology \nand Research (USTAR) Initiative, which brings local businesses and \nindustries together with educational institutions to ``help \ncommercialize high potential inventions, enhance the climate for \ninnovation and entrepreneurism and stimulate the creation of local \nenterprises.'' The initiative provides students with the opportunity to \ngain first-hand business experience and has had a tremendous positive \nimpact on the regional economy.\n  In the statement announcing her resignation, Ann quoted William \nJames: ``The best use of life is to invest it in something that will \noutlast it.'' She followed by saying ``the work you are doing at this \nuniversity will long outlast our time here. Our students, their \nfamilies, and generations to come--all will be changed by what you are \ndoing and what the university will continue to do in the future!'' \nWhile Ann may have been addressing her remarks to the students, they \nare certainly just as applicable to her own efforts. Ann's tremendous \nvision and leadership has catapulted Weber State University to national \nrecognition and a growing reputation for educational excellence. Sharon \nand I thank her for her service and for the charge she has led to \nincrease the quality and reach of education within the great State of \nUtah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8359-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GORDON LEDERMAN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, included in the Department of \nDefense Authorization Act is bipartisan, bicameral legislation I co-\nsponsored titled ``The Interagency Personnel Rotation Act,'' which \nseeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal \nGovernment's national and homeland security operations by encouraging \nthe temporary rotation of certain homeland and national security \nemployees among the different agencies that have homeland security \nmissions.\n  Like the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which established the principle of \ninteragency rotation within our armed forces, this amendment will have \nthe effect of building trust and better communications among these \ndifferent agencies, thus enhancing their collective efforts to \nsafeguard our nation from the terrorist threat.\n  Much of the credit for crafting this bipartisan legislation goes to \nGordon Lederman, formerly Associate Staff Director and Chief Counsel \nfor National Security and Investigations on the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Gordon left my Committee staff earlier this year due to illness. \nHowever, this legislation will add to his record of enhancing the \nsecurity of our country, and especially of breaking down the barriers \nto greater cooperation and collaboration between agencies that must \nwork together to keep our country safe.\n  Thomas Jefferson once asked the question: ``What duty does a citizen \nowe to the government that secures the society in which he lives?'' \nAnswering his own question, Jefferson said: ``A nation that rests on \nthe will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its \ninstitutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public service \nshould feel an obligation to make that contribution.''\n  Gordon has selflessly answered Jefferson's centuries old call and has \nhad a distinguished career in public service dedicated to the security \nof our Nation.\n  Here are just a few highlights of Gordon's career.\n  In 2003, Gordon joined the 9/11 Commission staff and was responsible \nfor assessing the Intelligence Community's senior-level management \nstructure. His work included developing potential recommendations for \nintelligence reform modeled on the Goldwater-Nichols Act as well as \nexamining Congressional oversight.\n  After the 9/11 Commission released its report in July 2004, Gordon \nmoved to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee as a special bipartisan staff member. He served as the lead \ndrafter and negotiator of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which enacted the Commission's recommendations \nto create the Director of National Intelligence and National \nCounterterrorism Center.\n  Gordon also worked on the Committee's investigation into the flawed \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina at all levels of government.\n  In February 2006, Gordon joined the U.S. National Counterterrorism \nCenter to assist the Executive Branch in implementing the legislation \nhe helped author. His work included the Center's organizational \nstrategy and internal allocation of roles and responsibilities.\n  Gordon later returned to the Committee and was the lead investigator \nof the Committee's inquiry into the murders at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, \n2009, when Maj. Nidal Hasan--a psychiatrist trained by the U.S. Army at \ntaxpayer expense--entered the Soldier Readiness Processing Center with \ntwo loaded pistols and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 32.\n  Following a 14-month investigation, the Committee released its \nreport--``A Ticking Time Bomb: Counterterrorism Lessons from the U.S. \nGovernment's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack,'' of which Gordon \nwas the lead writer.\n  The report detailed flawed practices and communications, both within \nand between the FBI and Department of Defense, which allowed Hasan to \nremain in the military--and even be promoted--despite many warning \nsigns that he was becoming dangerous. The report also contained a \nseries of recommendations that, had they been in place, probably would \nhave led to Hasan's dismissal from the Army and prodded the FBI, which \nwas aware of Hasan's suspicious actions, into a more aggressive \ninvestigation of his growing violent Islamist radicalization.\n  My time in the Senate is drawing to a close. I have already given my \nfarewell address. However, I just wanted to take these few minutes to \nthank Gordon Lederman for the Interagency Personnel Rotation Act into \nlaw, and for his career long dedication to making our homeland more \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8359-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8359-S8360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN TURNER\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this month marks the retirement \nof Ms. Kathleen Turner after nearly 32 years in government service, \nspecifically working in various capacities in the intelligence \ncommunity. I commend her for her service to the Nation and wish her the \nvery best in her retirement.\n  Ms. Turner has had a varied and distinguished career, having worked \nin different positions and capacities within the intelligence \ncommunity. For most of that time, Kathleen worked where efforts and \nsuccesses are not always rewarded publicly. I am glad we can do so here \ntoday.\n  I have known Kathleen mostly in her capacity as the director of the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs for the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, a position she assumed in the summer of 2006. \nFor the last 6 years, Ms. Turner has had the sometimes unenviable job \nof representing the intelligence community on Capitol Hill and \nrepresenting Capitol Hill to the intelligence community.\n  Ms. Turner is the daughter of Robert and Beverly Turner, a television \nrepair shop owner and homemaker respectively, and was born and raised \nin the small suburban town of Pacific Palisades, in my State of \nCalifornia.\n  Kathleen is the fifth of seven children and she went to UCLA and \nmajored in political science and then came to the East Coast. I am \nwilling to forgive her for this lapse in judgment. Kathleen received a \nmaster's degree in international relations from the Johns Hopkins \nSchool of Advanced International Studies. When she completed her \nmaster's, she went right into the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  Ms. Turner started her professional career with DIA as an analyst of \nSoviet strategic forces. She served as the Intelligence Liaison Officer \nto the Strategic Defense Initiative Office, and later served as the \nSenior Analyst for\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\nRussia and Eurasia, managing all military intelligence analysis on \nthese regions. During the 1990s, Ms. Turner progressively served as \nDIA's Director of Human Resources, the Director of Administration, and \nthe manager of the DIA and General Defense Intelligence Program and \nbudget office. Starting in 2002, Ms. Turner served as DIA's Director of \nCongressional and Public Affairs.\n  In short, in her 24 years at DIA, Kathleen did and saw every aspect \nof intelligence work in one of the few intelligence agencies to perform \nevery kind of intelligence operation.\n  That, combined with her outgoing personality and ability to juggle \nmany tasks at once, made her a natural choice to join the Legislative \nAffairs Office for the first Director of National Intelligence, John \nNegroponte, in October 2005 as that office was standing up. She quickly \nbecame the DNI's Director of Legislative Affairs in July 2006. As \nDirector, she was responsible for the Office of the DNI's interactions \nwith the Congress, and informing the Office of the DNI seniors of \nCongressional interests and perspectives on intelligence matters. In \naddition, Ms. Turner provided policy guidance to all 16 intelligence \ncommunity legislative affairs offices.\n  I got to know Kathleen in the job when I became chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in January 2009, through numerous meetings with \nDNI Dennis Blair and then DNI Jim Clapper. She always had suggestions \nfor ways to work through problems, and could translate issues and \nperspectives between intelligence-speak and congressional-speak. \nKathleen could also work a room--she knew every Member on the committee \nand all of our staff, and knew what questions needed answers or what \npolicies were being proposed.\n  I must say, it is a good thing for Kathleen that she has retired from \nlegislative affairs, as the delay in reauthorizing FISA legislation \nnow, only 10 days from its expiration at the end of the year, would \nhave been keeping her up around the clock and adding one more time when \nCongress' special way of doing things caused stress and aggravation to \nall involved.\n  On a more personal note, Kathleen's most direct contribution to me \nwas her idea, which she then brought to fruition, to bring together a \ngroup of senior women in the intelligence community and me for a dinner \non November 7, 2011 at the Hay Adams Hotel. It was a hit. Since then, \nthe group has gotten together three more times, twice at my house and \nonce more at a restaurant, and we have really gotten to know each other \nand build a relationship beyond our meetings across the meeting or \nwitness table.\n  Throughout her career and travels around the world, I know Kathleen \nhas had the loving support of her husband, Bob Sparks, who is the son \nof a naval officer. Bob was educated at the Virginia Military Institute \nand then at the University of Virginia for law school. He currently \npractices law in Northern Virginia. With her retirement, Kathleen and \nBob look forward to spending more time together and on the water.\n  I am pleased to be able to thank Kathleen Turner for her service and \nwish her all the very best in all her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8360-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8360-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8360-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 925.

A bill to establish a commission to develop a national \nstrategy and recommendations for reducing fatalities resulting from \nchild abuse and neglect; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Nelson Mandela, the former president of \nSouth Africa, once said ``Safety and security don't just happen; they \nare the result of collective consensus and public investment. We owe \nour children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free \nof violence and fear.''\n  Today, I echo that call to protect our most vulnerable citizens as I \njoin Senators Kerry, Collins, Cardin, Shaheen, Snowe, and Conrad to \nintroduce the Protect Our Kids Act.\n  This important legislation establishes a special task force dedicated \nto reducing child abuse and neglect in America. Comprised of our \nNation's top child welfare administrators and researchers, law \nenforcement officers, and other dedicated experts, this task force \nwould study and evaluate federal, state, and private child welfare \nsystems and develop a comprehensive national strategy to prevent and \nreduce these tragic acts of violence.\n  Since 2002, more than 15,000 children have died due to abuse and \nneglect. This number is based on state-reported Child Protection \nServices data. But advocates predict the true number is far greater.\n  We don't have clear facts because currently, there is no national \nstandard for collecting data on these young victims. Many state child \nprotection agencies do not share vital data and statistics with other \nagencies, officials, or law enforcement.\n  Clearly, more must be done to better protect our Nation's children. \nMore must be done to protect them from the fear and terror of abuse, \nespecially when the threat to their safety often comes from those that \nshould cherish them the most.\n  We need to bring this issue out of the shadows. It starts by learning \nmore about the tragic deaths of these children, so that we can prevent \nthe senseless murders from happening again. That is what this task \nforce will do. They will study the issue and develop a national \nstrategy and recommendations for improvements throughout the child \nwelfare system.\n  According to Child Protection Services data, in Montana we reported \nzero fatalities from child abuse and neglect\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nlast year. While that of course sounds like good news, the story is \nmore complicated. We have heard of at least three child deaths related \nto abuse or neglect. Some abuse is going unreported. And there are \nclear gaps in data between the agencies and in the reporting. So I am \nurging my state to elevate the standards of protective services even \nhigher.\n  Child Protection Services needs to coordinate with other agencies. \nThey need to share data so we can have a clear picture of the full \nscope of the problem. Everyone needs to work together to make sure that \nall Montana kids are safe.\n  Our Nation must tackle this issue head on. We must embrace our \nresponsibility to protect our children. We need to provide them with \nsafe, nurturing environments and the support they need to thrive and \nsucceed in our society.\n  We need to make sure that kids have access to physical and mental \nhealth services, so they can grow into happy, productive adults. We \nneed to help children with mental illnesses by reducing the stigma \nsurrounding mental health services and ensuring that these young people \nknow there is a strong support network backing them up.\n  We should look at programs like home visits, which currently provide \nprofessional assistance, right at home, for more than 50,000 families \nacross our Nation, and see how they can be improved to do an even \nbetter job supporting vulnerable families.\n  We are blessed to live in the richest, most powerful country in the \nworld. We have to use every resource at our disposal to strengthen our \nlaws to ensure that all children are given a chance to succeed in life.\n  This bipartisan legislation we are introducing today is a step in the \nright direction to protect our kids.\n  I commend my colleagues Senators Kerry and Collins for their years of \ntireless work, fighting for the rights of our children. The House of \nRepresentatives has already acted on this legislation. Let us now join \ntogether and create a life free of violence and fear for our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Let us pass the Protect Our Kids Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 3708.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) duties collected on imports of citrus and citrus \n     products have ranged from $50,000,000 to $87,000,000 annually \n     since 2004, and are projected to increase, as United States \n     production declines due to the effects of huanglongbing (also \n     known as ``HLB'' or ``citrus greening disease'') and imports \n     increase in response to the shortfall in the United States;\n       (2) in cases involving other similarly situated \n     agricultural commodities, notably wool, the Federal \n     Government has chosen to divert a portion of the tariff \n     revenue collected on imported products to support efforts of \n     the domestic industry to address challenges facing the \n     industry;\n       (3) citrus and citrus products are a highly nutritious and \n     healthy part of a balanced diet;\n       (4) citrus production is an important part of the \n     agricultural economy in Florida, California, Arizona, and \n     Texas;\n       (5) in the most recent years preceding the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, citrus fruits have been produced on \n     900,000 acres, yielding 11,000,000 tons of citrus products \n     with a value at the farm of more than $3,200,000,000;\n       (6) the commercial citrus sector employs approximately \n     110,000 people and contributes approximately $13,500,000,000 \n     to the United States economy;\n       (7) the United States citrus industry has suffered billions \n     of dollars in damage from disease and pests, both domestic \n     and invasive, over the decade preceding the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, particularly from huanglongbing;\n       (8) huanglongbing threatens the entire United States citrus \n     industry because the disease kills citrus trees;\n       (9) as of the date of the enactment of this Act, there are \n     no cost effective or environmentally sound treatments \n     available to suppress or eradicate huanglongbing;\n       (10) United States citrus producers working with Federal \n     and State governments have devoted tens of millions of \n     dollars toward research and efforts to combat huanglongbing \n     and other diseases and pests, but more funding is needed to \n     develop and commercialize disease and pest solutions;\n       (11) although imports constitute an increasing share of the \n     United States market, importers of citrus products into the \n     United States do not directly fund production research in the \n     United States;\n       (12) disease and pest suppression technologies require \n     determinations of safety and solutions must be commercialized \n     before use by citrus producers;\n       (13) the complex processes involved in discovery and \n     commercialization of safe and effective pest and disease \n     suppression technologies are expensive and lengthy and the \n     need for the technologies is urgent; and\n       (14) research to develop solutions to suppress \n     huanglongbing, or other domestic and invasive pests and \n     diseases will benefit all citrus producers and consumers \n     around the world.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to authorize \n     the establishment of a trust to support scientific research, \n     technical assistance, and development activities to combat \n     citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and invasive, \n     harming the United States.\n       (c) Effect on Other Activities.--Nothing in this title \n     restricts the use of any funds for scientific research and \n     technical activities in the United States.\n\n\n           citrus disease research and development trust fund\n\n       Sec. 112.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce should insist that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China, which has \n     ownership interests in the companies that manufactured and \n     exported problematic drywall to the United States, facilitate \n     a meeting between the companies and representatives of the \n     United States Government on remedying homeowners that have \n     problematic drywall in their homes; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Commerce should insist that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China direct the \n     companies that manufactured and exported problematic drywall \n     to submit to jurisdiction in United States Federal Courts and \n     comply with any decisions issued by the Courts for homeowners \n     with problematic drywall.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The revised provisions shall \n     be treated as a rule promulgated by the Commission under \n     section 14(c) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 2063(c)), in lieu of the \n     prior version, effective 180 days after the Commission is \n     notified of the revision (or such later date as the \n     Commission considers appropriate), unless within 90 days \n     after receiving that notice the Commission determines that \n     the revised provisions do not adequately identify gypsum \n     board by manufacturer and month and year of manufacture, in \n     which case the Commission shall continue to enforce the prior \n     version.\n\n     SEC. 4. SULFUR CONTENT IN DRYWALL STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Rule on Sulfur Content in Drywall Required.--Except as \n     provided in subsection (c), not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission shall promulgate a final rule pertaining to \n     drywall manufactured or imported for use in the United States \n     that limits sulfur content to a level not associated with \n     elevated rates of corrosion in the home.\n       (b) Rule Making; Consumer Product Safety Standard.--A rule \n     under subsection (a)--\n       (1) shall be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of \n     title 5, United States Code; and\n       (2) shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule \n     promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).\n       (c) Exception.--\n       (1) Voluntary standard.--Subsection (a) shall not apply if \n     the Commission determines that--\n       (A) a voluntary standard pertaining to drywall manufactured \n     or imported for use in the United States limits sulfur \n     content to a level not associated with elevated rates of \n     corrosion in the home;\n       (B) such voluntary standard is or will be in effect not \n     later than two years after the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (C) such voluntary standard is developed by Subcommittee \n     C11.01 on Specifications and Test Methods for Gypsum Products \n     of ASTM International.\n       (2) Federal register.--Any determination made under \n     paragraph (1) shall be published in the Federal Register.\n       (d) Treatment of Voluntary Standard for Purposes of \n     Enforcement.--If the Commission determines that a voluntary \n     standard meets the conditions in subsection (c)(1), the \n     sulfur content limit in such voluntary standard shall be \n     treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under \n     section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) \n     beginning on the date that is the later of--\n       (1) 180 days after publication of the Commission's \n     determination under subsection (c); or\n       (2) the effective date contained in the voluntary standard.\n       (e) Revision of Voluntary Standard.--If the sulfur content \n     limit of a voluntary standard that met the conditions of \n     subsection (c)(1) is subsequently revised, the organization \n     responsible for the standard shall notify the Commission no \n     later than 60 days after final approval of the revision. The \n     sulfur content limit of the revised voluntary standard shall \n     become enforceable as a Commission rule promulgated under \n     section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2058), in lieu of the prior version, effective 180 days after \n     the Commission is notified of the revision (or such later \n     date as the Commission considers appropriate), unless within \n     90 days after receiving that notice the Commission determines \n     that the sulfur content limit of the revised voluntary \n     standard does not meet the requirements of subsection \n     (c)(1)(A), in which case the Commission shall continue to \n     enforce the prior version.\n       (f) Future Rulemaking.--The Commission, at any time \n     subsequent to publication of the consumer product safety rule \n     required by subsection (a) or a determination under \n     subsection (c), may initiate a rulemaking in accordance with \n     section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to modify the \n     sulfur content limit or to include any provision relating \n     only to the composition or characteristics of drywall that \n     the Commission determines is reasonably necessary to protect \n     public health or safety.

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY OF \n                   TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN LARGE FINANCIAL COMPANIES \n                   AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``covered institution'' means any bank holding \n     company having more than $500,000,000,000 in consolidated \n     assets; and\n       (2) the term ``economic benefit'' means the difference \n     between actual loans terms offered, debt or equity prices, or \n     asset values and a reasonable estimate of what such terms, \n     prices, or values might have been, as determined by examining \n     actual values of comparable transaction in the private \n     markets or by estimating the values of comparable \n     transactions priced to properly reflect associated risk.\n       (b) GAO Study.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States (in this section referred to as the ``Comptroller'') \n     shall conduct a study of covered institutions, such as--\n       (1) the favorable pricing of the debt of such institutions, \n     relative to their risk profile resulting from the perception \n     that such institutions will receive Government support in the \n     event of any financial stress;\n       (2) any favorable funding or economic treatment resulting \n     from an increase in the credit rating for covered \n     institutions, as a result of express, implied, or perceived \n     Government support;\n       (3) any economic benefit to covered institutions resulting \n     from the ownership of, or affiliation with, an insured \n     depository institution;\n       (4) any economic benefit resulting from the status of \n     covered institutions as a bank holding company, including \n     access to Federal deposit insurance and the discount window \n     of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (5) any economic benefit received through extraordinary \n     Government actions taken, such as--\n       (A) actions by the Department of the Treasury--\n       (i) under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, such \n     as--\n\n       (I) asset purchases by the United States Government;\n       (II) capital injections from the United States Government; \n     or\n       (III) housing programs; or\n\n       (ii) by the purchase of the mortgage backed securities of \n     the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal \n     Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (in this Act referred to as \n     ``government-sponsored enterprises''), in order to lower \n     interest rates, and the value of such securities in the \n     absence of such purchases;\n       (B) actions by the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System prior to the date of enactment of this Act, \n     such as--\n       (i) providing loans to financial institutions through the \n     Term Auction Facility; and\n       (ii) assistance through programs under section 13(3) of the \n     Federal Reserve Act prior to the date of enactment of this \n     Act, such as--\n\n       (I) lending through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility;\n       (II) securities lending to primary dealers through the \n     Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Securities \n     Lending Facility;\n       (III) lending to institutions through the Term Asset-Backed \n     Securities Loan Facility; or\n       (IV) purchasing assets through the Maiden Lane facility; \n     and\n\n       (C) actions by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     such as--\n       (i) guaranteeing debt or deposits through the Temporary \n     Liquidity Guarantee Program; or\n       (ii) pricing of assessments related to any such guarantees; \n     and\n       (6) any extraordinary assistance provided to American \n     Insurance Group, but ultimately received by one of the \n     covered institutions; and\n       (7) any Government actions that resulted in the payment or \n     nonpayment of credit default swap contracts entered into by a \n     covered institution.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller shall submit a report to Congress \n     detailing the findings of the Comptroller in the study \n     conducted under this Act. Such report shall be made \n     electronically available to the public, except that any \n     proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information shall be \n     redacted in any release to the public.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Greenberg, of New Jersey, to be a Judge of the \n     United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for the \n     term of fifteen years, vice a new position created by Public \n     Law 100-389, approved October 10, 2008.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the last four years, Senate \nRepublicans have chosen to depart dramatically from Senate traditions \nin their efforts to delay and obstruct President Obama's judicial \nnominations.\n  For example, until 2009, Senators deferred to the President and to \nhome State Senators on district court nominees. During the 8 years that \nGeorge W. Bush served as President, only 5 of his district court \nnominees received any opposition on the floor. In just 4 years, Senate \nRepublicans have voted against 39 of President Obama's district court \nnominees, and the Majority Leader has been forced to file cloture on 20 \nof them.\n  Federal district court judges are the trial court judges who hear \ncases from litigants across the country and preside over Federal \ncriminal trials, applying the law to facts and helping settle legal \ndisputes. They handle the vast majority of the caseload of the Federal \ncourts and are critical to making sure our Federal courts remain \navailable to provide a fair hearing for all Americans. Nominations to \nfill these critical positions, whether made by a Democratic or \nRepublican President, have always been considered with deference to the \nhome State Senators who know the nominees and their States best, and \nhave been confirmed quickly with that support. Never before in the 37 \nyears I have been in the Senate have I seen anything like what has \nhappened in the last 4 years. Never before in the Senate's history have \nwe seen district court nominees blocked for months and opposed for no \ngood reason. Many are needlessly stalled and then confirmed virtually \nunanimously with no explanation for the obstruction. Senate Republicans \nhave politicized even these traditionally non-partisan positions. This \nis harmful to our Federal courts and the American people.\n  Until 2009, Senators who filibustered circuit court nominees \ngenerally had reasons to do so, and were willing to explain those \nreasons. When Senate Democrats filibustered President Bush's \ncontroversial circuit court nominees, it was over substantive concerns \nabout the nominees' records and Republicans' disregard for the rights \nof Democratic Senators. When we opposed Janice Rogers Brown, it was \nbecause of her long record on the California Supreme Court of deciding \ncases based on extreme views, and having argued that Social Security \nwas unconstitutional. When we opposed Priscilla Owen, it was because \nher rulings on the Texas Supreme Court were so extreme that they drew \nthe condemnation of even the conservative judges on that court.\n  On the other hand, Senate Republicans have filibustered and delayed \nnearly all of President Obama's circuit court nominees even when those \nnominees have the support of their Republican home State Senators. Take \nthe examples of Judge Robert Bacharach and William Kayatta, two \nconsensus circuit nominees who have the support of their Republican \nhome State Senators. Both these nominees received the ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary's highest possible rating, that of \nunanimously ``Well Qualified.'' They have strong bipartisan support, \nand unimpeachable credentials, and there is no reason why they should \nnot have been confirmed months ago. Republicans continue to stall them \nwithout final confirmation votes approximately 8 months after they were \nconsidered and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The irony and dangerous new development is that neither of these \nnominees faces any real Republican opposition. Senator Coburn, one of \nJudge Bacharach's home State Senators, has said: ``[Judge Bacharach] \nhas no opposition in the Senate. .  .  . There's no reason why he \nshouldn't be confirmed.'' Still, Senate Republicans refuse to allow for \na vote on his nomination. The same also applies to Richard Taranto, who \nwas reported more than eight months ago to a vacancy on the Federal \nCircuit by voice vote and faces no Republican opposition. This also \napplies to William Kayatta of Maine, who was reported nearly eight \nmonths ago and has the support of his two home State Republican \nSenators.\n  It makes no sense for Senate Republicans to continue filibustering \nthese nominations, but it fits with their track record over the last 4 \nyears. Senate Republicans used to insist that the filibustering of \njudicial nominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not \nchanged but as soon as President Obama was elected they reversed course \nand filibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran \nof the Federal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported \nby Senator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. \nThey delayed his confirmation for 7 months. Senate Republicans then \nproceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee \nof this President, filibustering 10 of them. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 \nmonths. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to \nthe Sixth Circuit for 10 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Ray \nLohier of New York to the Second Circuit for 7 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Scott Matheson of Utah to the Tenth Circuit and \nJudge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 6 \nmonths. They delayed confirmation of Judge Andre Davis of Maryland to \nthe Fourth Circuit, Judge Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth \nCircuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker of West Virginia to the Fourth \nCircuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to the Ninth Circuit \nfor 5 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Adalberto Jordan of \nFlorida to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the \nEleventh Circuit, Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara \nKeenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of \nPennsylvania to the Third Circuit, Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey \nto the Third Circuit, Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second \nCircuit, and Judge Chris Droney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit \nfor 4 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Paul Watford of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the \nNinth Circuit, Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard \nLynch of New York to the Second Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of \nConnecticut to the Second Circuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio \nto the Federal Circuit for 3 months.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has reported that the\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\nmedian time circuit nominees have had to wait before a Senate vote has \nskyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees to 132 days for \nPresident Obama's. This is the result of Republican obstruction.\n  This unprecedented and meritless obstruction means that when the \nSenate adjourns, Senate Republicans will have blocked more than 40 of \nPresident Obama's circuit and district nominees from being confirmed.\n  This obstruction is also why a damagingly high level of judicial \nvacancies has persisted for over 3\\1/2\\ years. While such tactics are \nbad for the Senate, they are also bad for our Nation's overburdened \ncourts. Persistent vacancies force fewer judges to take on growing \ncaseloads, and make it harder for Americans to have access to justice. \nWhile they have delayed and obstructed, the number of judicial \nvacancies has been historically high and it has become more difficult \nfor our courts to provide speedy, quality justice for the American \npeople. In fact, five of the judicial nominees pending on the Senate \ncalendar on whom Republicans refuse to allow a vote would fill judicial \nemergency vacancies.\n  For almost 4 years now, ever since President Barack Obama took \noffice, we have heard the same spurious arguments from Senate \nRepublicans for why they refuse to help our Federal courts function. \nSenate Republicans claim that we have not confirmed more judges because \nPresident Obama has not made a sufficient number of nominations. It is \nSenate Republicans themselves, and their unwillingness to work with a \nPresident who has reached out to them to submit recommendations and to \nwork with him that has delayed many nominations.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has worked hard to solicit \nrecommendations from home State Senators, including those from the \nother party. This President has consistently selected qualified, \nmainstream nominees. For the judicial vacancies in States with two \nRepublican Senators, just 21 percent have a nominee. Four such \nvacancies exist in Texas--including three judicial emergency vacancies. \nThis has prompted a retired Federal judge in Hawaii to move to Texas to \nhelp the overburdened judges with their caseload. I urge Senate \nRepublicans to do a better job providing consensus recommendations and \nfulfilling their own constitutional responsibility to ``advise'' the \nPresident on nominations and work with President Obama to fill these \nvacancies.\n  At the end of each calendar year, Senate Republicans now deliberately \nrefuse to vote on several judicial nominees who could and should be \nconfirmed in order to consume additional time the following year \nconfirming these nominees. At the end of 2009, they left 10 nominations \non the Executive Calendar without a vote. Two of those nominations were \nreturned to the President, and it subsequently took 9 months for the \nSenate to take action on the other 8. This resulted in the lowest 1-\nyear confirmation total in at least 35 years. For the last 2 years, \nSenate Republicans left 19 nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar \nat the end of each year. It then took nearly half the following year \nfor the Senate to confirm these nominees. This year they are insisting \non leaving 11 judicial nominees without action and another 4 have had \nhearings but Senate Republicans refused to expedite their \nconsideration.\n  Senate Republicans claim that their delays and obstruction should be \nexcused because, despite their opposition, the Senate confirmed the \nPresident's two Supreme Court Justices. Senate Republicans ignore the \nfact that during President Bush's first 4 years 205 circuit and \ndistrict court nominees had been confirmed, and that judicial vacancies \nwere reduced to as low as 28. During his second term, vacancies were \nreduced to 34. Vacancies have stood at nearly or above for most of \nPresident Obama's first four years and will not dip below 60. Vacancies \nremain more than twice what they were at the end of President Bush's \nfirst term. The 173 judges that we have been able to confirm fall more \nthan 30 short of the total for President Bush's first term. Moreover, \nwhen the Senate confirmed two Justices during President Clinton's first \nterm and President George H.W. Bush's term, the Senate also confirmed \n200 and 192 circuit and district nominees, respectively. Their \nobstruction of needed confirmations cannot be justified on account of \nthe two Supreme Court vacancies.\n\n  Until 2009, when a judicial nominee had been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee with bipartisan support, they were generally \nconfirmed quickly. Until 2009, we observed regular order and usually \nconfirmed four to six nominees per week, and we cleared the Senate \nExecutive Calendar before long recesses. Until 2009, if a nominee was \nfilibustered, it was almost always because of a substantive issue with \nthe nominee's record. We know what has happened since 2009. The average \ndistrict nomination is stalled 4.3 times as long as it took to confirm \nthem during the Bush administration, and the average circuit court \nnomination is stalled on average 7.3 times as long as it took to \nconfirm them during the Bush administration. Nor has any other \nPresident's judicial nominees had to wait an average of over 100 days \nfor a Senate vote after being reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  No one is happier than I that a dozen district court nominees will be \nconfirmed during this lame duck session but that is hardly something \njustifying Republican chest beating. What it starkly demonstrates is \nthat they have been stalling consensus nominees for months without \ncause. All of these nominees could and should have been confirmed \nbefore the August recess and should have been at work administering \njustice for the American people. In most other years, like in 2008, \njudicial nominees, especially those who are qualified, consensus \nnominees with bipartisan support and the support of their home State \nSenators, are confirmed before the election recess. They are not \nstalled and not dragged over into a lame duck session after the \nelection. This is not success, unless you believe that perpetuating \nvacancies and forcing hardworking Americans to wait even longer to have \ntheir day in court is something of which to be proud.\n  Senate Republicans have also forced the Majority Leader to file \ncloture on 30 nominees, which is already more than 50 percent more \nnominees than had cloture filed during President Bush's 8 years in \noffice. Almost all of these 30 nominations were noncontroversial and \nwere ultimately confirmed overwhelmingly. Barely 80 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees have been confirmed, compared to \nalmost 90 percent of President George W. Bush's first term nominees.\n  While this is not even close to a full account of the precedents \nbroken in the last 4 years, the record is clear: Senate Republicans \nhave engaged in an unprecedented effort to obstruct President Obama's \njudicial nominations. Pretending it has not taken place is an insult to \nthe American people. The American people know better. Chief Justice \nRoberts, in his year-end Report on the Federal Judiciary in 2010 \npointed to the ``[P]ersistent problem [that] has developed in the \nprocess of filling judicial vacancies. . . . This has created acute \ndifficulties for some judicial districts. Sitting judges in those \ndistricts have been burdened with extraordinary caseloads. . . . There \nremains, however, an urgent need for the political branches to find a \nlong-term solution to this recurring problem.'' Despite bipartisan \ncalls to address the judicial vacancy crisis, Senate Republicans \ncontinued their obstruction of judicial confirmations.\n  Today, the Senate is finally being allowed to vote on 3 but only 3 of \nthe 14 judicial nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar.\n  Judge Malachy Mannion is nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania, where he currently serves as the Chief U.S. Magistrate \nJudge. He has been a Magistrate Judge in that District for over 10 \nyears, where he has presided over 104 cases that have gone to verdict \nor judgment. Prior to his appointment as a U.S. Magistrate Judge, Judge \nMannion served as Federal prosecutor for over 10 years, where he rose \nto become the Chief of the Office's Organized Crime Enforcement Task \nForce. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \ngave him its highest possible rating of ``Well Qualified.'' His \nnomination has the bipartisan support of his home State Senators. He \nwas approved by the Judiciary Committee 5 months ago by voice vote.\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\n  Matthew Brann is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He has \nbeen in private practice for over 2 decades, where he specializes in \ncomplex corporate and commercial transactions, real estate, probate, \nand estate planning. He has tried 20 cases to verdict, judgment, or \nfinal decision. He has the support of his home State Senators, and he \nwas voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote 5 months ago.\n  Judge Jon Tigar is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Judge \nTigar is currently a Superior Court Judge for Alameda County, where he \nhas presided over 175 cases that have gone to verdict or judgment. He \npreviously spent 10 years as a litigator in private practice at two \nprominent law firms in San Francisco. He earned his law degree from the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley. After law school, he clerked for \nthe Honorable Robert S. Vance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously gave him its highest possible rating of ``Well Qualified.'' \nHis nomination has the support of his home State Senators, and he was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee more than four months ago by voice \nvote.\n  After today's vote, there will still be 11 judicial nominees on the \nSenate Executive Calendar, 6 of whom were voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee before the August recess. There is no reason why we cannot \nconfirm all of them today. I have also been urging Republicans to \nexpedite consideration of the 4 judicial nominees who participated in \nhearings last Wednesday. That would lead to 11 more confirmations \nbefore the Senate adjourns to help address the judicial vacancies that \ncurrently exist in our Federal courts.\n  If we adjourn today without confirming these additional nominees, we \nwill leave those 11 vacancies and 5 emergency vacancies open for even \nlonger, and there will be at least 80 vacancies when President Obama \nbegins his second term. Recall that during President Bush's entire \nsecond term, the 4 years from January, 2005 through January, 2009, \nvacancies never exceeded 60. So far during President Obama's first 4 \nyears in office and as far into the future as we can see there have \nnever been less than 60 vacancies, and for much of that time many, many \nmore. This is a prescription for overburdened courts and a Federal \njustice system that does not serve the interests of the American \npeople.\n  I commend President Obama for nominating such a diverse group of \nqualified judges. In his first 4 years, President Obama has appointed \nas many women judges as President Bush did during his entire 8 years in \noffice. In just 4 years, President Obama has also nominated more \nAfrican Americans, more Asian Americans, and more openly gay Americans \nthan his predecessor did in 8 years. Americans can be proud of \nPresident Obama's efforts to increase diversity in the Federal \njudiciary and to ensure that it better reflects all Americans.\n  I hope that next year, and in the next 4 years, Senate Republicans \nwill end their misguided and harmful obstruction and work with us in a \nbipartisan manner to do what is right for the country.

Reg. 49079) in October 2001;\n       Whereas Hizballah was established in 1982 through the \n     direct sponsorship and support of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and continues to \n     receive training, weapons, and explosives, as well as \n     political, diplomatic, monetary, and organizational aid, from \n     Iran;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in multiple acts of \n     terrorism over the past 30 years, including the bombings in \n     Lebanon in 1983 of the United States Embassy, the United \n     States Marine barracks, and the French Army barracks, the \n     airline hijackings and the kidnapping of European, American, \n     and other Western hostages in the 1980s and 1990s, and \n     support of the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia that \n     killed 19 Americans in 1996;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     issued by the Department of State, ``Since at least 2004, \n     Hizballah has provided training to select Iraqi Shia \n     militants, including on the construction and use of \n     improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that can penetrate \n     heavily-armored vehicles.'';\n       Whereas, in 2007, a senior Hizballah operative, Ali Mussa \n     Daqduq, was captured in Iraq with detailed documents that \n     discussed tactics to attack Iraqi and coalition forces, and \n     has been directly implicated in a terrorist attack that \n     resulted in the murder of 5 members of the United States \n     Armed Forces;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in the terrorist \n     attacks in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the Israeli Embassy in \n     1992 and the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in 1994;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in acts of terrorism \n     and extrajudicial violence in Lebanon, including the \n     assassination of political opponents;\n       Whereas, in June 2011, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, an \n     international tribunal for the prosecution of those \n     responsible for the February 14, 2005, assassination of \n     former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, issued arrest \n     warrants against 4 senior Hizballah members, including its \n     top military commander, Mustafa Badr al-Din, identified as \n     the primary suspect in the assassination;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     issued by the Department of State, Hizballah is ``the likely \n     perpetrator'' of 2 bomb attacks that wounded United Nations \n     Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeepers in Lebanon \n     during 2011;\n       Whereas, according to the October 18, 2012, report of the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations to the United Nations \n     Security Council on the implementation of Security Council \n     Resolution 1559 (2004) (in this preamble referred to as the \n     ``October 18 Report''), ``The maintenance by Hizbullah of \n     sizeable sophisticated military capabilities outside the \n     control of the Government of Lebanon . . . creates an \n     atmosphere of intimidation in the country[,] . . . puts \n     Lebanon in violation of its obligations under Resolution 1559 \n     (2004)[,] and constitutes a threat to regional peace and \n     stability.'';\n       Whereas John Brennan, Assistant to the President for \n     Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, stated on October 26, \n     2012, that Hizballah's ``social and political activities must \n     not obscure [its] true nature or prevent us from seeing it \n     for what it is--an international terrorist organization \n     actively supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps - Quds Force'';\n       Whereas David Cohen, Under Secretary of the Treasury for \n     Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stated on August 10, \n     2012, ``Before al Qaeda's attack on the U.S. on September 11, \n     2001, Hizballah was responsible for killing more Americans in \n     terrorist attacks than any other terrorist group.'';\n       Whereas, according to a September 13, 2012, Department of \n     the Treasury press release, ``The last year has witnessed \n     Hizballah's most aggressive terrorist plotting outside the \n     Middle East since the 1990s.'';\n       Whereas, since 2011, Hizballah has been implicated in \n     thwarted terrorist plots in Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Thailand, and \n     elsewhere;\n       Whereas, on July 18, 2012, a suicide bomber attacked a bus \n     in Burgas, Bulgaria, murdering 5 Israeli tourists and the \n     Bulgarian bus driver in a terrorist attack that, according to \n     Mr. Brennan, ``bore the hallmarks of a Hizballah attack'';\n       Whereas Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \n     stated of the Burgas terrorist attack, ``We have \n     unquestionable, fully substantiated evidence that this was \n     done by Hizballah backed by Iran.'';\n       Whereas Bulgaria is a member of the European Union and a \n     member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas, according to the October 18 Report, ``There have \n     been credible reports suggesting involvement by Hizbullah and \n     other Lebanese political forces in support of the parties in \n     the conflict in Syria. . . . Such militant activities by \n     Hizbullah in Syria contradict and undermine the \n     disassociation policy of the Government of Lebanon, of which \n     Hizbullah is a coalition member.'';\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan stated, ``We have \n     seen Hizballah training militants in Yemen and Syria, where \n     it continues to provide material support to the regime of \n     Bashar al Assad, in part to preserve its weapon supply \n     lines.'';\n       Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the Department of the Treasury \n     designated Hizballah pursuant to Executive Order 13582 (76 \n     Fed. Reg. 52209), which targets those responsible for human \n     rights abuses in Syria, for providing support to the \n     Government of Syria;\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the Department of the Treasury, since \n     early 2011, Hizballah ``has provided training, advice and \n     extensive logistical support to the Government of Syria's \n     increasingly ruthless effort to fight against the \n     opposition'' and has ``directly trained Syrian government \n     personnel inside Syria and has facilitated the training of \n     Syrian forces by Iran's terrorism arm, the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps - Qods Force'';\n       Whereas, on September 13, 2012, the Department of the \n     Treasury designated the Secretary-General of Hizballah, Hasan \n     Nasrallah, for overseeing ``Hizballah's efforts to help the \n     Syrian regime's violent crackdown on the Syrian civilian \n     population'';\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan stated, ``Even in \n     Europe, many countries . . . have not yet designated \n     Hizballah as a terrorist organization. Nor has the European \n     Union. Let me be clear: failure to designate Hizballah as a \n     terrorist organization makes it harder to defend our \n     countries and protect our citizens. As a result, for example, \n     countries that have arrested Hizballah suspects for plotting \n     in Europe have been unable to prosecute them on terrorism \n     charges.''; and\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan called on the \n     European Union to designate Hizballah as a terrorist \n     organization, saying, ``European nations are our most \n     sophisticated and important counterterrorism partners, and \n     together we must make it clear that we will not tolerate \n     Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the governments of Europe and the European Union \n     to designate Hizballah as a terrorist organization so that \n     Hizballah cannot use the territories of the European Union \n     for fundraising, recruitment, financing, logistical support, \n     training, and propaganda;\n       (2) urges the governments of Europe and the European Union \n     to impose sanctions on Hizballah for providing material \n     support to Bashar al Assad's ongoing campaign of violent \n     repression against the people of Syria;\n       (3) expresses support for the Government of Bulgaria as it \n     conducts an investigation into the July 18, 2012, terrorist \n     attack in Burgas, and expresses hope that the investigation \n     can be successfully concluded and that the perpetrators can \n     be identified as quickly as possible;\n       (4) urges the President to provide all necessary \n     diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement support to the \n     Government of Bulgaria to investigate the July 18, 2012, \n     terrorist attack in Burgas;\n       (5) reaffirms support for the Government of Bulgaria by the \n     United States as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO), and urges the United States, NATO, and \n     the European Union to work with the Government of Bulgaria to \n     safeguard its territory and citizens from the threat of \n     terrorism; and\n       (6) urges the President to make available to European \n     allies and the European public information about Hizballah's \n     terrorist activities and material support to Bashar al \n     Assad's campaign of violence in Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/21/senate-section/article/S8380-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN-HOME MEDICARE COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. REID.
