Mr. President, as some of us predicted, problems are already \narising from the Senate's ratification of the New START treaty last \nDecember.\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nThe Russians just ratified it, and their interpretation of its meaning \nand obligation is different from ours. That is going to cause problems. \nI will also discuss this afternoon the President's fiscal year 2012 \nbudget in the areas of nuclear modernization and missile defense, both \nof which were closely tied to the Senate's support of the New START \ntreaty.\n  First, what the Russians are saying about the treaty. The Russian \nState Duma and the Federation Council, which is their counterpart to \nthe Senate, last week passed its Federal law on the New START treaty, \nand that is the Russian equivalent to our resolution of ratification. \nThat document demonstrates there is a significant divergence of views \nbetween the two countries on several key provisions and core principles \nof the New START treaty.\n  For example, Russian officials continue to assert, despite statements \nfrom the Obama administration and despite the Senate's legally binding \npositions to the contrary, that various treaty provisions, including in \nthe preamble, constrain U.S. military options regarding missile defense \nand conventional prompt global strike. Far from supporting the touted \n``reset'' in its relations, this lack of meeting of the minds is a \nticking time bomb for disruption of our relations.\n  First, regarding missile defense. The Senate unanimously adopted an \namendment to the resolution of ratification providing that the New \nStart preamble does not impose a legal obligation on the parties. The \nSenate's principal concern and rationale for this provision was the \nlanguage in the preamble linking offensive forces to missile defenses, \na clear attempt by the Russians to foreclose future qualitative and \nquantitative improvements to U.S. missile defense capabilities. \nContrary to the U.S. position, Russian officials have recently declared \nthat the preamble is an integral part of the treaty and is thus binding \non the parties. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated:\n\n       There are a few problems, one of the main ones being the \n     assertion contained in this [Senate floor] statement that the \n     correlation between strategic offensive and defensive \n     weapons, reflected in the treaty, is not legally binding for \n     the U.S. and Russia because it is stipulated in the preamble. \n     This thesis cannot be defended by lawyers.\n\n  Contradicting President Obama's December 18 letter on missile defense \nto Senators Reid and McConnell and the Senate's resolution of \nratification, Foreign Minister Lavrov further contends:\n\n       The content of the treaty unequivocally points to the \n     correlation between strategic offensive weapons and missile \n     defense, it is set out in the preamble, whereas the text of \n     the treaty contains an article that allows either party to \n     withdraw in the event of an emergency. We are convinced that \n     the implementation of the full-scale global missile defense \n     by the U.S. will be precisely such an emergency.\n\n  These statements stand in apparent contradiction to the resolution of \nratification adopted by the Senate.\n  On the point concerning the legality of the preamble, which includes \nthe unfortunate linkage between offensive arms and missile defense, the \nRussian Federal law on the New START ratification highlights the \nimportance that Russia attaches to the preamble and this linkage \nbetween missile defense and strategic offensive arms, and it introduces \na new issue: The possibility of ``understandings'' between the parties \nnot revealed to the Senate.\n  Here is what article 4, paragraph 1 of the Russian law says:\n\n       The provisions of the preamble of the New START treaty \n     shall have indisputable significance for the understanding of \n     the Parties intentions upon its signature, including the \n     content of the terms agreed between them and the \n     understandings without which the New START treaty would not \n     have been concluded. In this connection, they must be \n     considered in toto by the parties in the course of \n     implementing the New START treaty.\n\n  Because of these ``terms'' and ``understandings,'' article 4 goes on \nto state that the Russian Federation shall exercise its right to \nwithdraw from the treaty in the case of extraordinary events, including \nthe ``deployment by the United States of America, another state, or a \ngroup of states of a missile defense system capable of significantly \nreducing the effectiveness of the Russian Federation's strategic \nnuclear forces.''\n  So now the Russian Parliament is clearly on record that the \ndeployment of the U.S. national missile defenses or missile defense \ndeployments in conjunction with our NATO allies could be cause for \nRussian withdrawal from the treaty. Since Russia opposed the deployment \nof 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland, it is likely to oppose as \nwell the planned deployment of land-based SM-3 missiles in Romania and \nPoland capable of intercepting Iranian ICBMs.\n  This provision of the Russian law is fundamentally incompatible with \nthe U.S. understanding of the treaty and with current U.S. plans to \ndeploy these U.S. defenses in Europe and to deny U.S. national missile \ndefenses as the President affirmed to us in his December 18 letter. The \nadministration should immediately work to resolve this dispute with the \nRussians. Otherwise, the United States would be willfully perpetrating \na future collision course between Russia and the United States.\n  I am sending a letter to Assistant Secretary of State Rose \nGottemoeller which raises this issue and asks for clarification of the \nassertion that there were understandings between the negotiators not \nreflected in the public record.\n  The President will have to decide whether to exchange the instruments \nof ratification with the Russian Federation with this discrepancy \nextant--and the others that I will briefly touch on. I am not aware of \na bilateral treaty that is entered into force where such a divergence \nof views existed. Perhaps there is clarification on these matters in \nsome secret cable or in another part of the classified negotiating \nrecord. The administration's stubborn refusal to share these materials \nwith the Senate has denied Senators the answer.\n  Part of the Corker-Lieberman amendment to the treaty also requires \nthe administration to communicate to Russia at the time of the exchange \nof instruments of ratification that it is the policy of the United \nStates to continue development and deployment of U.S. missile defense \nsystems, including qualitative and quantitative improvements to such \nsystems. I urge the administration to consult with the Senate to ensure \nthat our intent is accurately conveyed before exchanging this policy \nstatement and the instruments of ratification.\n\n  The resolution of ratification also makes clear that missile defense \nwill not be on the table in any future treaty. Understanding No. 1 \nmakes clear that no limits on U.S. missile defenses can be achieved \nthrough the New START treaty, including the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission it creates, without the advice and consent of the Senate \nwhich, if I have anything today about it, will not be forthcoming.\n  There is also declaration No. 1 which states:\n\n       Further limitations on the missile defense capabilities of \n     the United States are not in the national security interests \n     of the United States, and the LeMieux amendment, which made \n     it the policy of the United States not to include defensive \n     missile systems in any negotiations with Russia on tactical \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  The administration might have created the impression with Russia that \nthe United States would discuss missile defense, whether in the \nTauscher-Rybakov track of secretive side negotiations--the full extent \nof which the administration is hiding from Congress--or by agreeing to \nthe preamble language, or article V, section III, in contravention of \nsection 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 Defense authorization bill.\n  With regard to Under Secretary Tauscher's side negotiations, I note \nthat the Russians know more about the U.S. position and these \nnegotiations than the Senate does, which brings to mind again article 4 \nof the Russian Federal law on ratification which states that the \n``provisions of the preamble of the New START treaty shall have \nindisputable significance for the understanding of the Parties' \nintentions . . . including the content of the terms agreed between them \nand the understandings without which the New START treaty would not \nhave been concluded.''\n  What understandings are these? Is this referring to something beyond \nthe text of the treaty and the preamble? Unfortunately, the Senate is \nunaware of such understandings because we have been denied access to \nthe negotiating record.\n  There is the potential here for a major confrontation between the \nSenate and the administration if the administration does not \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nmake a full disclosure to the Senate on these matters. The Senate's \naction in the resolution of ratification should also make clear that it \nwill not accept any further linkage between offensive nuclear \nreductions. I am pleased to note a recent product of the Arms Control \nAssociation, called ``Strategic Missile Defense: A Threat to Future \nNuclear Arms Reductions,'' that seems to agree with my point. In its \nrecent analysis, this group correctly observed that the United States \nwill continue to require exempting strategic missile defense from \ntreaties.\n  Now, while the Arms Control Association seems to believe this is a \nmistake, I am pleased the Senate sent a message so unmistakable that \neven the arms control community comprehended it. The administration \nwill have an opportunity to prove whether its statements of support for \nmissile defense, including the President's December 18 letter, were \nmere rhetoric or actual policy, beginning when it submits the fiscal \nyear 2012 budget request. Initial press reports hint that the Defense \nDepartment is anticipating yet another reduction in funding for missile \ndefense programs over the next 5 years, despite funding plans that are \nalready about $4 billion below what was envisioned by the last \nadministration for fiscal years 2010 through 2013. This is \ninconceivable given the funding shortfalls increasingly apparent in the \nPresident's own plans for improving U.S. missile defenses as well as \nfour phases of the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in \nEurope. It appears that elements of the administration's phased \nadaptive approach for missile defense are already falling behind, and \nthe President's budgets for missile defense have almost guaranteed the \natrophy and obsolescence of the only national missile defense system we \nnow have.\n  If these reports are accurate, it would belie the President's \ncommitment to missile defense, which was central to Senate support for \nthe New START treaty, and suggests the Senate was misled during its \nconsideration of the treaty.\n  With regard to Conventional Prompt Global Strike--remember, this is \nthe concept where U.S. intercontinental range missiles could substitute \na conventional warhead for a nuclear warhead for prompt delivery to a \nplace far away on the globe in a time of emergency--Senators' concerns \nwere not limited to missile defense, as I said. We also talked about \nthis Prompt Global Strike issue in connection with the START treaty. \nReferencing this capability, Foreign Minister Lavrov told the Russian \nDuma:\n\n       The [U.S.] Senate's resolution claims that the treaty does \n     not apply to new kinds of nonnuclear strategic weapons that \n     could be developed in the future. But this is not true.\n\n  Then he also stated:\n\n       We find unacceptable the unilateral American interpretation \n     of the treaty, according to which future strategic range \n     systems with non-nuclear warheads not meeting the parameters \n     stated in the treaty shall not be regarded as new types of \n     strategic offensive weapons covered by the treaty.\n\n  Likewise, Russian Federal law states in article 2, paragraph 7:\n\n       The question of the applicability of the provisions of the \n     New START treaty to any new kind of strategic-range offensive \n     arms should be resolved within the framework of the Bilateral \n     Consultative Commission . . . prior to the deployment of such \n     new kind of strategic-range offensive arms.\n\n  Hence, Russia is rejecting the U.S. understanding on strategic range \nnonnuclear weapons systems contained in the Senate's resolution of \nratification, which states:\n\n       . . . nothing in the New START treaty prohibits deployments \n     of strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems.\n\n  In other words, conventional Prompt Global Strike.\n  The President must make this fact plain to both Russia and the Senate \nwhen he provides the report on the conventional Prompt Global Strike \nsystems to the Senate prior to entry into force of the treaty. It mocks \nthe very idea of a U.S.-Russian arms control pact if such a \ndisagreement--Russia's rejection of a formally adopted U.S. \nunderstanding--is allowed to stand.\n  Let me mention telemetry. In response to Senators who raised concerns \nabout the inadequacy of the verification and telemetry provisions in \nNew START, the administration essentially said: Not to worry; the \ntreaty permits each side to exchange telemetry on up to five tests per \nyear. As could have been expected when the administration capitulated \nto Russian demands concerning telemetry, the Russian Federal law now \nprohibits ``providing to the United States of America telemetric \ninformation about the launches of new types of intercontinental \nballistic missiles and submarine ballistic missiles.'' That is exactly \nwhat treaty opponents predicted. As a result, we will know less about \nnew Russian systems than under the previous START verification regime.\n  At the very least, Russia's action in its federal law to deny the \nUnited States telemetry on this future missile development will place \ngreater burdens on our national technical means to monitor the \ndevelopment of new Russian ballistic missiles. The denial of telemetry \nfrom new delivery systems poses a material risk by aiding Russia's \npotential for breakout from the treaty limits, which is, of course, a \ncentral concern of the Senate in conditions Nos. 2 and 4 of the \nresolution of ratification.\n  Finally, the Russian Foreign Minister seems to have taken aim at the \nSenate's condition that negotiations begin within a year to address the \ndisparity in tactical nuclear weapons between Russia and the United \nStates. In noting the imbalance in conventional forces, plans to deploy \nweapons in space, and U.S. global missile defense plans, Russian \nMinister Lavrov stated:\n\n       It is possible to hold future negotiations only with due \n     account of all these factors and after the fulfillment of the \n     New START.\n\n  Clearly, Russia is not interested in beginning such negotiations \nanytime soon.\n  The Foreign Minister has proven correct those Senators who cautioned \nthat after this treaty was ratified, the United States would lose \nwhatever leverage it had to address nonstrategic nuclear weapons. \nAssistant Secretary Gottemoeller appears to take seriously the Senate's \ninstruction in this regard, even referring to it as her ``marching \norders.'' I trust she views equally the Senate's ``marching orders'' \nthat a subsequent treaty not deal with U.S. missile defenses.\n  I am not aware of an example where the United States has ratified a \nbilateral treaty in the face of clear evidence that there is no meeting \nof the minds on key treaty terms. While New START was under Senate \nconsideration, administration officials continually spoke about how \ncritical the treaty was to ``reset'' relations with Russia and how the \ncompleted treaty manifestly improved relations between the two \ncountries. This can be the case, however, only if the parties actually \nagree on the fundamentals of the treaty's meaning.\n  Now let me speak to the anticipated 2012 budget for nuclear \nmodernization.\n  The Senate, in condition 9 of the resolution, linked its support for \nthe New START treaty on a clear commitment to ``ensuring the safety, \nreliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.'' This commitment \nrequires full funding to ensure a robust Stockpile Stewardship Program, \na modernized nuclear weapons production capability, and the development \nof new nuclear delivery systems to replace the aging nuclear triad of \nbombers, submarines, and ICBMs.\n  If in a given year funding fails to meet the 10-year plan or required \nlevels of resources are greater than the 10-year plan, the President is \nrequired by condition 9 to submit a report on how the administration \nwill remedy the shortfall, the project requiring funds and the level \nthat is required, the impact of the shortfall on nuclear readiness, and \nwhether it is in the national interest to remain a party to the treaty. \nWe must codify the requirement to provide an annual update to section \n1251, requiring the administration to annually provide updated \nassessment of the levels of funding required to maintain and modernize \nthe stockpile. And the administration has agreed this is necessary.\n  As it currently stands, the administration's proposed 10-year budget \nfor nuclear weapons activities, as promised in the update to the \nsection 1251 report, takes a critical first step toward nuclear weapon \nsustainment and modernization. It proposes an $85 billion budget for \nweapons activities over 10\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\nyears, from 2011 through 2020, and describes the critical near-term \nrequirements of at least $7 billion in 2011 and $7.6 billion in 2012.\n  To be successful, the modernization program must have the complete \nbacking of the President, the Armed Services Committees and the \nAppropriations Committees, as well as the full House and Senate. These \nbudget requests will allow the laboratories and plants responsible for \nnuclear weapons to begin a slow recovery from the neglect that has been \ncrippling their ability to address real issues as our current stockpile \nages. The administration must, however, continue to review and revise \nits estimates for the modernization program and follow through on its \ncommitments to obtain this funding from the Congress.\n  This modernization program must address the past, the present, and \nthe future of our nuclear weapons complex. For example, the Stockpile \nSurveillance Program evaluates the current condition of our aging \nstock. This program has been seriously underfunded in recent years, \nresulting in a decreased confidence in our nuclear weapons. This is not \nmy assessment but, rather, the assessment of some of the premier \nauthorities on nuclear weapons--the Directors of the nuclear weapons \nlaboratories. It is likewise the conclusion of the bipartisan \nCongressional Commission on the U.S. Strategic Posture.\n  Likewise, budget requests must allow for the continuation of current \nlife extension programs, including the W-76, which is currently in \nproduction, the B-61, which is rapidly nearing its end of life but \ncontinues to be required for both strategic and tactical roles, and the \nW-78, which will require a very extensive and challenging life \nextension to correct aging issues and incorporate higher standards for \nsafety and security. These three planned programs will likely not be \ncompleted until the end of the 2020 decade. As it stands, there does \nnot appear to be capacity in the complex to insert the long-range \nstrike option warhead production in the next decade, which will be \nneeded to replace our current W-80 warheads and air-launched cruise \nmissiles. As we are the only nuclear weapons state without a nuclear \nweapons production capability, restoring the health of our current \nweapons is critically important.\n  Finally, the balanced program must prepare us for the future by \nimproving the quality of our facilities, many of which are Cold War- \nand even Manhattan Project-era facilities. Design and engineering \ndevelopment of the chemistry and metallurgy replacement nuclear \nfacility and the uranium processing facility should be accelerated to \nthe extent possible, construction estimates should be properly \nevaluated, and completion of these facilities should be aggressively \npursued for their completion by 2020. This is another so-called \nmarching order for the administration. It is difficult to overstate the \nimportance of these facilities to our future national security.\n  The opportunity exists to push these programs forward. For example, \nthe recent exchange of letters between the Senate appropriations \nleaders and the President shows that the commitment must be bipartisan \nand must include both Congress and the administration. Notably, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee leaders, Senators Inouye and Cochran, \nand the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee leaders, Senators \nFeinstein and Alexander, stated on December 16, 2010, that ``funding \nfor nuclear modernization and the National Nuclear Security Agency's \nproposed budgets should be considered defense spending, as it is \ncritical to national security.'' And they state that ``this represents \na long-term commitment by each of us, as modernization of our nuclear \narsenal will require a sustained effort.''\n  The President responded on December 20, 2010, with a commitment to \nsupport the $85 billion budget, and he also committed to an annual \nupdate to the section 1251 report. Here is what he said:\n\n       I recognize that nuclear modernization requires investment \n     for the long term, in addition to this one-year budget \n     increase. That is my commitment to Congress.\n\n  It must be our commitment to hold the President to his word and to \nlikewise provide our full support for nuclear weapon modernization.\n  Finally, on nuclear delivery systems and the President's commitment \nto missile defense, first, we expect to see significant funding for the \nnext-generation nuclear ballistic missile submarine and follow-on heavy \nbomber, which the administration now seems to support, although it has \nnot yet confirmed that the United States intends the bomber to be \ncapable of a nuclear standoff mission, as well as a final decision that \nthe follow-on to the air-launched cruise missile will be nuclear \ncapable.\n  Finally, we expect to see greater clarity with respect to the \nadministration's intention to maintain the ICBM leg of the triad after \nthe Minuteman III reaches the end of its life.\n  I expect the administration's commitment to these delivered platforms \nto become increasingly evident in the Defense Department's 2012 budget \nrequest as promised in the update to the section 1251 report. \nModernization of the delivery platforms must parallel the commitment to \nthe nuclear weapons. To continue to use Ms. Gottemoeller's formulation, \nthis is another ``marching order'' from the Senate for the \nadministration.\n  The President made clear his commitment to missile defense during the \ncourse of the Senate's consideration of the New START treaty, as I \nmentioned before. In his December 18 letter to Senators Reid and \nMcConnell, he wrote:\n\n       As long as I am President, and as long as Congress provides \n     the necessary funding, the United States will continue to \n     develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect the \n     United States, our deployed forces, and our allies and \n     partners.\n\n  The President reiterated what the Senate made clear in the resolution \nof ratification--that the New START treaty places no limitations on the \ndevelopment and deployment of our missile defense programs--and he \nstated that he ``will take every action available to me to support the \ndeployment of all four phases'' of the planned missile defense \ndeployments in Europe. The Secretary of Defense also indicated during a \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing on December 17 that the \nDepartment was looking at an increase in missile defense funding for \nfiscal year 2012.\n  As I said before, however, initial press reports hint that the \nDepartment of Defense is anticipating a reduction for missile defense \nprograms over the next 5 years. Any cut to the missile defense budget \nwould be especially shocking in light of President Obama's commitments \nto the Senate. Likewise, it would be absolutely indefensible in view of \nSecretary Gates's recent comment that North Korea was within 5 years of \nbeing able to strike the United States with an intercontinental \nballistic missile and that ``with North Korea's continuing development \nof nuclear weapons . . . North Korea is becoming a direct threat to the \nUnited States.''\n  Indeed, the recent discovery of a clandestine enrichment site in \nNorth Korea raises significant concern about our ability to estimate \nthe pace at which that country is developing nuclear and ballistic \nmissile capabilities--and should make us think twice as well about our \nestimate of Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\n\n  Also troubling are recent statements by senior military officials, \nincluding the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific and the Director \nfor Naval Intelligence, suggesting China's anti-ship ballistic \nmissiles, designed to target U.S. aircraft carriers, are now nearly \noperational. This new anti-ship ballistic missile, combined with \nBeijing's current and growing arsenal of short and medium-range \nballistic missiles, threatens to alter the strategic balance in Asia by \npotentially grounding Pacific-based U.S. air forces and sinking U.S. \nships out to a range of 1,000 nautical miles--not to mention the \nability to strike U.S. allies and friends in the region.\n  The Russian Parliament provided its interpretation of the treaty and \npreamble in its Federal Law on Ratification, and it is clearly at odds \nwith the Senate's resolution of ratification in several key respects, \nincluding missile defense and conventional prompt global strike. To say \nthat their interpretation is not legally binding on the United States \nis to miss the point, which is, as many of us said during debate over \nNew START, that because\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nthere is no meeting of the minds on these matters, the potential for \ndisputes and increasing tension between the two sides is likely. What \nwas to serve as a vehicle for ``reset'' may, in fact, serve to promote \nincreasing discord.\n  In fact, the first indication of this may have occurred last week, \nwhen the U.S. and its NATO partners met with Russia to find common \nground on missile defense cooperation. In advance of that meeting, the \nRussian President threatened ``either we agree to certain principles \nwith NATO, or we fail to agree, and then in the future we are forced to \nadopt an entire series of unpleasant decisions concerning the \ndeployment of an offensive nuclear missile group.'' If this is the \nlanguage of reset, I wonder what the tone might have been had we not \nagreed to New START? As it turns out, Russia appears to have rejected \nthe NATO approach.\n  Mr. President, we will watch carefully to ensure the administration \nfulfills its 10-year commitment to nuclear modernization, starting with \nthe fiscal year 2012 budget request, and that nuclear reductions called \nfor under the New START treaty do not outpace the commitment to \nmodernization.\n  We must make certain, too, the administration modernizes our national \nmissile defense system to stay ahead of increasing threats; provides \nthe necessary direction and funding to ensure full, timely deployment \nof missile defense assets in Europe to address the growing Iranian \nthreat; and directs the Missile Defense Agency to develop defensive \ncountermeasures to the anti-ship ballistic missile capability of China. \nFinally, we must resurrect the Reagan vision of defensive missile \ndefense capabilities based in space, which is the only truly effective \nmeans for protecting the Nation and its deployed forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator \nKyl, who is this body's premier student of the nuclear strategic \nposture of the United States. I served and have served as chairman of \nthat subcommittee of Armed Services. I share his concern. I am thankful \nthat he is here and is keeping up with these matters year after year. \nMost of us would rather not talk about them, but they represent the \nserious responsibilities of a great nation that must be able to defend \nitself, to be able to live freely and prosperously. So I thank the \nSenator for his remarks, and I value his friendship and enjoy following \nhis leadership.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report that--our \nCongressional Budget Office's leadership is selected by the majority in \nthe Congress, the Democratic majority--that report showed our deficit \nfor this year, which will end September 30, will be $1.5 trillion. That \nis the largest deficit the Nation has ever had. The last 2 years have \nbeen $1.3 trillion and $1.4 trillion. This year's deficit is projected \nto come in at $1.5 trillion. We complained--I have--that President Bush \nspent more money than he should have, but his highest deficit was one-\nthird of that, or $460 billion. So we are at unprecedented levels of \nannual deficit and debt. Our gross debt, the total United States debt, \ninternal and external, will equal, by the end of the year, 100 percent \nof GDP. Annual interest payments--we borrow money; people loan us their \nmoney, and we give them Treasury bills and bonds in exchange, and we \npay them interest on the debt. The amount of interest we pay will rise \nto $750 billion by the end of this decade. That means a 1-year interest \npayment will cost us nearly as much as 20 years of current highway \nconstruction spending. We spend about $40 billion a year, for example, \non Federal highway expenditures. We are talking about interest payments \ngoing from $180 billion or so a couple of years ago to $750 billion, \nand our debt will triple in that time--from $5 trillion to over $15 \ntrillion.\n  The total amount of interest we expect to pay between now and the end \nof the decade is $5.5 trillion in interest, which is enough money to \nfund our entire government for 18 months.\n  The situation is so serious that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan warned very recently that we may face a bond market crisis in \nthe next 2 to 3 years. He said it is a little better than a 50-50 \nchance that it won't happen, but not much better. That was his comment.\n  CBO Director Doug Elmendorf testified last week before the Budget \nCommittee, where I am ranking member, that we were entering \n``unfamiliar territory for all developed nations over the last several \ndecades.'' He is talking about financially, debt.\n  Analysts for Standard and Poors stated that ``absent a credible plan, \nthe rating on the U.S. Federal Government will come under pressure''--\nin other words, the rating on our debt, which is AAA. If that happens, \nour interest rate, as I have been suggesting, will go up, because if \nour ratings go down, people will demand higher interest before loaning \nus money. The International Monetary Fund urged the United States to \ntake much stronger action. This is on the Washington Post business page \nof a few days ago:\n\n       U.S. Must Reduce Deficit, IMF Warns.\n\n  They are not perfect, but they claim to be the conscience of the \nworld and warn profligate nations to get their houses in order before \nit creates systemic problems for other nations. It says:\n\n       European countries have begun a pointed dialog with their \n     residents about what government can and cannot afford. Moves \n     to cut public salaries, trim services, and curb public \n     pensions have touched off strikes and protests, but also puts \n     the deficits of those countries on what seems to be a \n     ``securely downward path,'' the IMF said. Those are the \n     choices the United States has been hesitant to make.\n\n  Two prominent economists, Carmen Reinhart, who testified before our \ncommittee, and Dr. Kenneth Rogoff, issued a paper explaining the \nnegative impact of excessive debt on economic growth. He actually wrote \na book. They have studied countries in the last 200 years that have had \ntheir economies collapse as a result of debt--a lot of South American \ncountries at various times, such as Argentina and others. They caution \nthat there is a point beyond which you do not want to go. That point is \nwhen your debt equals 90 percent of your economy, 90 percent of GDP. \nThat is a very respected study--the first time anybody ever studied the \neconomies that have had economic collapse. This is a key factor in \nthat. We are now at 94 percent of GDP, and by the end of the year, the \nCBO projects we will be at 100 percent. Our debt will equal 100 percent \nof the entire goods and services produced in this economy.\n  Our Nation is on a dangerous--as everybody we have had testify before \nthe committee and virtually anybody who has expressed themselves calls \nit--unsustainable path. The President said we are on an unsustainable \npath. We need strong leadership from our President. The day before his \nState of the Union, I wrote an op-ed that was published in the \nWashington Post. I called on him to present a broad vision for reducing \nspending. I said, ``his proposals cannot be timid'' and that this was \n``a defining moment for his Presidency.''\n  I have to say that he did not rise to that occasion. Instead of a \nbold vision, he put forward a meek plan to continue spending at current \nlevels for 5 more years, calling that a freeze. But we have had a surge \nin spending in the last 2 years. Freezing at that level cannot be \nacceptable. These are the levels that produced the $1.5 trillion \ndeficit.\n  The President's speech, I must say, was disconnected from reality. \nNowhere in that speech did he enter into a dialog with the American \npeople about the severity of the crisis we face, or make any attempt to \ncall on them in a serious way to understand why it is that we can't \ncontinue at this level of spending. He failed to present a credible \nplan.\n  This is what the Washington Post said in an editorial yesterday. They \nweren't mean spirited about it, but you could tell they were \ndisappointed:\n\n       In his State of the Union Address Tuesday night, President \n     Obama failed to present a credible plan for a long-term debt \n     reduction. It's no secret that we think he made a big \n     mistake. If America can't get a handle on its finances, \n     everything else is at risk.\n\n  But not only has the President failed to lead with ideas, he has set \nabout to thwart, to block others from taking action. This is concerning \nto me. This\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\nSunday, on one of the big news programs, his new Chief of Staff, Bill \nDaley, balked at a Republican plan to cut spending for the rest of the \nyear. He said any budget cuts must be paired with new spending--\n``investments,'' as he and the President called them. He taunted the \nRepublicans, I think, with, ``Where's the beef? Let's see the cuts \nthey're talking about.''\n  The President refuses to lead and then sends his emissaries to attack \nany Republican who makes a serious proposal and, I assume, as being \nheartless and wanting to throw children in the streets, and so forth. \nFor instance, the President's chief economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, \nlashed out at Republicans for wanting to reduce discretionary spending \nbefore we raise the debt ceiling. We have to have some sort of \nbipartisan agreement before we agree to raise this debt ceiling that we \nare going to reduce some of the spending, clip back on the credit card \na little bit, something significant.\n  The President's own Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, recently \nargued that it was too early to begin cutting the deficit. So it is \nunsustainable, but it is too early to start cutting it now--maybe in \n2012, or after that, maybe. Geithner's comments ring all too similar to \nthose of his predecessor, Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury under \nPresident Bush, who said the housing downturn was under control, before \nthe Wall Street firms began falling like dominoes.\n\n  But ignoring the reality of our situation does not change it. The \nmoney simply isn't there to support the President's spending agenda \nthat he announced at the State of the Union Address. We don't have the \nmoney. Our Nation cannot afford another era of big government.\n  In 2 weeks, on February 14--just 2 weeks from now--the President will \nsubmit a new budget to Congress. He will go to our Budget Committee. \nThis may be--and I say this seriously--his last chance to get it right, \nfor the President to be a credible voice in this debate. He must put \nforward a budget that significantly lowers spending levels. He cannot \npresent Congress with the same unserious plan he presented last Tuesday \nnight.\n  Three years into his turn, I think this budget he will be submitting \nis a defining act of what he views and how he views the debt we face. I \nthink if this budget fails to meet the necessary demands for curtailing \nspending, we will know pretty conclusively where the President is.\n  Numbers count. You can have rhetoric and we can disagree, but at some \npoint you have to put out your budget that says what you are going to \ndo, how much you are going to spend, and where you are going to get the \nmoney--in this case, how much we are going to borrow to carry on the \ngovernment at that time. So we are going to see whether the President \nis moving with the American people to fiscal and economic sanity or \nwhether he will continue his ideological commitment to big government. \nI think that is it. I think we will know in 2 weeks. It is a serious \nmatter.\n  So I think we need to turn back from the cliff toward which we are \nheading and get on a new road. We need to reduce both the size of the \ndeficit, and we will have to reduce the size of the government \nsomewhat. We are not going to sink into the ocean. If we go back to \n2008, 2006 levels of Federal spending, will the country collapse? Give \nme a break. Certainly, it is not going to collapse, but it will put us \non a road to fiscal sanity. It will restore not only public confidence \nin our economy, but it will restore the foundations of American \nprosperity.\n  I truly believe one of the clouds over the American economy is the \nperception--unfortunately, too true--that we are spending at a reckless \nrate, that we are irresponsibly running up the debt, and that could \ncause us to inflate the value of our currency, that could cause a debt \ncrisis, which Mr. Greenspan said was almost a 50-50 chance in the next \n2 to 3 years. If you have money to invest, what does that say to you? \nMaybe you better sit back and see a little more until we get this \ndebt--that is spiraling out of control--under control. Until we are \nheaded on a downward path toward a balanced budget, we are not going to \nsee the economic growth that is possible. I think that is where we \nshould be heading.\n  So strong, sustained reductions in spending will not be easy. It will \ntake us down a tough road, but it is the only road, the only course \nthat will lead to a better financial future for ourselves and our \nchildren and preserving the integrity of the U.S. economy in a way that \nis necessary for growth to occur.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Mr. President, this past Friday marked the annual Earned-\nIncome Tax Credit Awareness Day. I rise to recognize the success and \nimportance of this vital tax benefit for hard-working Americans.\n  As our country continues its steady recovery from the worst economic \nconditions hard-working American men and women have faced since the \nGreat Depression, families need financial relief and many people need \njobs.\n  As we renew our efforts to promote job creation, increase access to \ncredit for small businesses, and restore confidence and stability to \nmarkets, we should not forget that we already have what one President \nonce called ``the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job-\ncreation measure to come out of Congress.'' President Ronald Reagan was \ntalking about the earned-income tax credit.\n  Since 1975, the EITC has helped to offset the impact of Social \nSecurity taxes for low- and moderate-income individuals. Nearly 26 \nmillion taxpayers across the country received the EITC when they filed \ntheir tax returns last year. In Hawaii alone, over 100,000 low- and \nmiddle-income workers received an average of nearly $2,000 for this \ntremendous tax benefit. These vital EITC resources help families pay \nfor essentials such as food, housing, clothing, transportation, and \neducation expenses.\n  The earned-income tax credit is more important now than ever before. \nWith many Americans still out of work, some families accustomed to \nbudgeting based on the earnings of two people are struggling to survive \non the income of one. Some people in Hawaii and across the country who \nare working new, lower paying jobs may be eligible for the earned-\nincome tax credit for the first time.\n  To be clear, every taxpayer who receives the EITC is hard working \nbecause the earned-income tax credit is only provided to Americans who \nwork for a living. The EITC encourages individuals to find work, \nsupport themselves and their families, and improve their quality of \nlife.\n  A few years ago, only one in five taxpayers eligible for the EITC \nclaimed their benefits. Since then, tremendous progress has been made. \nThe number has risen to four in five, thanks in part to the tireless \nwork of taxpayer consumer advisers and advocates in our communities.\n\n  Our goal now should be to see to it that all eligible taxpayers claim \ntheir EITC benefits this year. That would mean in Hawaii alone about \n34,000 more taxpayers would receive much needed financial relief, with \nsimilar results across the country.\n  I plan to reintroduce the Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act in this 112th \nCongress. My bill is intended to protect low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers from falling victim to unscrupulous lenders. Historically, \nmany EITC recipients have turned to predatory refund anticipation loans \nwhich are short-term loans typically carrying steep interest rates. \nWorking families cannot afford to lose a significant portion of their \nEITC to these expensive short-term predatory loans. My bill will better \nprotect consumers from predatory lenders that prey on the EITC benefits \nof low-income taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to support it when \nthe bill comes to the floor. In today's economy every penny counts, and \nthe value of the earned income tax credit is magnified.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to better educate, \nprotect,\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\nand empower taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to join me to increase \nawareness of the earned-income tax credit.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the second week of the 112th \nCongress. I welcome back the Presiding Officer. I have spent many a \nMonday afternoon presiding over this Chamber as a new Member in my \nfirst 2 years. While they are not here, I welcome my new colleagues in \nthe Senate and, obviously, our new colleagues in the House.\n  We still have an enormous number of challenges facing us as a \ncountry, and I look forward to working with Members in both bodies to \nmake sure we meet these challenges in a bipartisan way.\n  Last year, I took up the banner that had actually been started by the \nPresiding Officer's colleague who preceded him in this Chamber, and \nthat was the effort of honoring, on a regular basis, exemplary Federal \nemployees right here on the Senate floor. It is a tradition that was \nbegun by Senator Ted Kaufman.\n  I want to start this new 112th Congress with what will be a weekly \noccurrence where I will come forward and recognize Federal employees \nwho play an extraordinarily important role in our country. I have been \nblessed to have had a great number of those employees in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, as the occupant of the Chair has been in \nDelaware.\n  Today, I thought I would actually rise on no specific employee but to \nhonor congressional staff on Capitol Hill and in the many congressional \ndistricts across the country. There are nearly 6,000 Federal employees \nin the Senate, and nearly 10,000 serve in the House of Representatives. \nI am referring to the individuals who sort the mail, the clerks who sit \nbefore you in the presiding chair, the folks who manage the Chamber day \nin and day out, and the Capitol Police, who do an incredibly important \njob of making sure we are able to work in a safe environment. I am also \nreferring to those folks who work directly for us as Members of \nCongress. They work their hearts out for us. Beatriz is here with me \ntoday. They work long hours and get little attention. Clearly, they \nimpact the lives of millions of Americans every day.\n  I know a little about this firsthand because I started my career in \npolitics as a staff member for then-Congressman Chris Dodd. I did \nmanage to get him lost a number of times when I drove him around his \ndistrict in eastern Connecticut. That experience taught me how \ndedicated the congressional staff is and that they are truly public \nservants and are instrumental to the democratic process that takes \nplace on the floor of the Senate and on the floor of the House.\n  Congressional staff help Members of Congress draft and analyze \nlegislation. They respond to literally thousands of letters, phone \ncalls, and e-mails on a regular basis. More often than not, they are \nout in the district or back at home when we are in Washington.\n  I know my State staff has helped Virginians with securing adoptions, \nreuniting families through our immigration casework, and simply helping \ncountless Virginia families navigate the complex bureaucracy that we \nknow as the Federal Government.\n  Congressional staff also help us plan events that bring us closer to \nthose we represent so we can continue to hear their views or complaints \nas we try to communicate our agenda.\n  I want to take a special moment--and we did this as a body last \nweek--to pay tribute to those who were lost in the horrible shooting in \nTucson. It is important to remember as we pray for the recovery of \nCongresswoman Giffords that we recall as well a member of her staff, \nGabe Zimmerman, who was Congresswoman Giffords' director of community \noutreach. Gabe was one of the victims of that mass shooting. He was \nsimply doing his job organizing ``Congress On Your Corner'' for the \nCongresswoman to make sure the folks who hired her, the people of \nArizona, had a chance to see her firsthand and express their views.\n  I want to make sure we also recognize and continue to keep in our \nprayers Pamela Simon and Ronald Barber who were injured on that day and \nare in the process of making their recovery.\n  As we keep in mind that tragedy, I think it is important that we \nrecall not only are those of us who are directly hired sometimes put in \nharm's way by this job, but there are literally thousands of \nparticularly young people who work for us day in and day out without a \nlot of recognition who are public servants as well. As we saw with the \ntragedy a month or so ago in Tucson, they sometimes give the greatest \ndevotion of service as well.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me over the coming week or two and say \na special thanks to all of those who work long and hard for us on our \nstaffs, including the pages who keep the order; the reporters who make \nsure, even when we are a little bit too long-winded, that they take \ndown virtually every word; and those special folks on the dais who have \nbeen known at times to keep new Members awake during particularly long-\nwinded speeches by Members.\n  I thank our congressional staff. We will be back on a regular basis \nto celebrate the very good work of Federal employees in various walks \nof life. I can't think of a better way to restart this tradition than \nthis week honoring those great staff members who serve us in the Senate \nand in the House.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in morning business; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the heroic \nlife of Suzanne Waughtel-Hopper, a deputy sheriff of Clark County, OH, \nand a beloved mother, wife, daughter, sister, and friend who was killed \nin the line of duty on the morning of January 1, 2011.\n  On that fateful day, Deputy Hopper, who went 6 years without ever \nmissing a work day, volunteered to work overtime where she was \nscheduled to start her shift at 3 a.m. But by 2:34 a.m. she had already \nstarted her patrol, and by 2:58 a.m. she had already made an arrest by \ntaking a drunk driver off the street. Throughout the morning, she \nfielded calls of theft and criminal activity, and by 11:30 a.m. she \nanswered her last call, a report of a dispute at a local campground. \nWhile taking forensic evidence photographs, she was shot and killed and \nGerman Township officer Jeremy Blum was injured. As Deputy Hopper did \neach day of her career, she answered her call to duty, the call to \nuphold the sacred oath she took to protect her community.\n  In the days since her tragic loss, family and friends have recounted \nher commitment to the core values of the Clark County Sheriff's \nOffice--integrity, duty, courage, and honor. During the celebration of \nher life on January 7, 2011, at First Christian Church in Springfield, \nOH, thousands of people from Clark County and across the State and the \nNation remembered her acts of courage on the job, her kindness and \nempathy to the community, and her love and affection for her family. \nFlag waving mourners gave thanks and prayers to a public servant who \nkept their streets and neighborhoods safe for the last 12 years.\n  School children will remember her as a role model and DARE \ninstructor. Special Olympians will remember her encouragement and \nsupport, while several charities will remember her generosity and \nselflessness. Families who she helped in the line of duty will remember \nthe clothing and food she provided them while she was off duty.\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nFrom Young's Dairy to Diane's in North Hampton to the streets of Clark \nCounty, her friends from old remember a young girl who grew up into the \npolice officer she always wanted to be.

Mr. President, today I remember Officer First Class \nJon-Michael Ronda, formerly of the New Castle County Police Department, \nwho passed away on December 2, 2010, after a long and courageous battle \nwith cancer.\n  Officer Ronda was an outstanding citizen of Delaware, and the \nselflessness of his service to the people of New Castle County and the \nNation will not be forgotten. He was born in Panama and moved with his \nfamily to New Jersey, where he graduated from Pemberton Township High \nSchool and Trenton State College. Determined to serve his country, \nOfficer Ronda joined the 177th Security Forces Squadron of the New \nJersey Air National Guard in 1995 and was deployed to Qatar in 2002. He \nwas an outstanding staff sergeant and combat arms instructor, \nrecognized with the Air Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medal, the \nAir Force Training Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Air \nForce Longevity Service Award Ribbon, the Good Conduct Ribbon, the New \nJersey Merit Award, and the Small Arms Expert Marksman Ribbon. Officer \nRonda's strength in the face of adversity was a hallmark of his \nservice, and he received an honorable discharge in 2007.\n  Officer Ronda joined the New Castle County Police Department in 1998 \nand was a member of the National Latino Peace Officers Association. He \nwas a well-respected member of the Department who received several \ncomplimentary letters for his service.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to his family and \nfriends and join the people of Delaware in my gratitude for his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/31/senate-section/article/S356-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CENTER FOR FAMILY RESOURCES\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I honor in the Record the \n50th anniversary of the Center for Family Resources in Marietta, GA.\n  In 1960, three community leaders--Fred Bentley, Sr., Howard Ector, \nand Harry Holliday--envisioned a better way to combine six existing \nemergency assistance organizations in the county under one roof to be \nmore effective and efficient. After working with the United Way for \nfunding, they founded the Cobb County Emergency Aid Association, Inc.--\nCCEAA.\n  For a decade, the organization worked tirelessly to help meet the \nemergency needs of the citizens of Cobb County, GA, through financial \nassistance, furniture, clothing, medical supplies, food and a Christmas \nprogram.\n  As the organization grew, it began to look for ways to become more \neffective in helping families become independent and self-sufficient. \nFamilies repeatedly faced limited access to affordable transportation, \nchildcare and housing, as well as a lack of education and training to \nsecure and maintain employment. The organization determined the removal \nof those barriers was the real key to breaking the cycle of poverty.\n  In 2004, the agency changed its name to the Center for Family \nResources. The Center for Family Resources has grown from a small \nemergency aid agency to a multifunction human services organization, \nserving both generations of the family to develop personal \nresponsibility and a self-sufficient lifestyle. The center develops and \nmaintains collaborative partnerships with organizations to improve \nservices for local families.\n  Today, the Center for Family Resources serves an average of 10,000 \nindividuals each year and has served more than 400,000 individuals \nsince 1960.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize the Center for Family Resources and its contributions to Cobb \nCounty. I congratulate Jeri Barr, the Board of Directors, the staff and \nvolunteers of the Center for Family Resources on their many \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/31/senate-section/article/S356-3", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on January 28, 2011, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the President pro tempore (Mr. Inouye).\n\n       H.R. 366.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more timely access to home health services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Conrad to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and \ndisabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the \nMedicare program.\n  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives \nand clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important \nroles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural \nand medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be \nin scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in \n1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services \nprovided by these health professionals as long as those services are \nwithin their scope of practice under State law.\n  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered \nnurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home \nhealth services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only \nphysicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for \nMedicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the \npatient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, \nthe certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the \npatient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, \nphysician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse \nmidwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, \nthis requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps \nto the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it \ncan lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home \nhealth care they need simply because a physician is not readily \navailable to sign the form.\n  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician \nassistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for \nMedicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these \nproviders may be the only health care professionals available. For \nexample, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a \nMedicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only \nhealth care professional serving the patient's small town, and the \nsupervising physician was located 60 miles away.\n  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her \ncollaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. \nAs a consequence, the patient experienced a two-day delay in getting \nneeded care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another \nphysician. Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous \nthat she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute \nfacility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to \nwait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and \noccupational therapy could continue simply because the home health \nagency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation \nof the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to \nauthorize when the patient was in the facility.\n  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure \nthat our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care that they need \nwhen they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives \nto order home health services. Our legislation is supported by the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American \nCollege of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, \nthe American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse \nAssociations of America. I urge all of my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Webb, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 231. A bill to suspend, until the end of the 2-year period \nbeginning on the date of enactment of this Act, any Environmental \nProtection Agency action under the Clean Air Act with respect to carbon \ndioxide or methane pursuant to certain proceedings, other than with \nrespect to motor vehicle emissions, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President. I rise today with Senators Webb, \nMcCaskill, Tim Johnson, Manchin, Ben Nelson, and Conrad to introduce \nthe EPA Regulations Suspension Act of 2011. We are introducing this \nlegislation for a simple but enormously important reason. At a time \nwhen our economy is finally headed toward a recovery, the last thing we \nwant to do is add new burdens to American companies that could result \nin them cutting jobs or being less productive in the global \nmarketplace.\n  In fact, I believe that the fate of our entire economy, our wide and \nvaried manufacturing industries and our workers, especially our coal \nworkers, rests in part on the decisions we make here in Washington. One \nthing we should never do is put the fate of an entire industry into the \nhands of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  My legislation is simple and reasonable. It requires that for 2 years \nthe EPA can take no regulatory action, regarding carbon dioxide and \nmethane emission from stationary sources. During that time no facility \ncan be subjected to any requirement to obtain a permit or meet a New \nSource Performance Standard under the Clean Air Act with respect to \ncarbon dioxide or methane. At the same time the legislation \nspecifically allows for the widely-supported motor vehicle emission \nstandards to continue moving forward.\n  At the beginning of this year regulations came into effect that say \nif a company wants to retrofit an existing or build a new power plant, \nor factory, they now have to find ways to reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Later this year the EPA will propose expanding these rules to cover \nexisting stationary sources that are not expanding their operations. \nThe impact of these rules is that companies will sit on the sidelines \nand opportunities for innovation and job creation will be lost. Because \nof these new rules companies won't build that new factory. They won't \nbuild that new power plant. And so they won't employ some of the \nmillions of Americans who are out of work. That is why I believe these \nregulations need to be suspended.\n  I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I believe that climate \nchange is an important issue and Congress should and will address it \nworking collaboratively with the administration and the private sector.\n  But the lead should come from Congress and not the EPA. Congress, \nunlike the EPA, can craft proposals that reduce greenhouse gases while \nsimultaneously protecting our economy. Most importantly, Congress is \ndirectly accountable to the people whose lives we impact.\n  We are capable of tackling this great challenge in a way that \nsupports rather than undermines our economy and our future.\n  But the process has to work. It has to be open. It has to be truly \nbipartisan. It has to acknowledge the fact that all of our States use \nenergy in very different ways. It has to protect our economy. This will \nnot be achieved overnight, but it is possible.\n  Technology can be a solution to this problem. West Virginia is poised \nto lead the effort on clean energy technology: because we know energy. \nWe know coal. We know natural gas. We know Carbon Capture and Storage \nor CCS as few others do. We are coming to know wind and we have great \npotential in learning how to use our geothermal resources as well.\n  The fact is, we in West Virginia know and embrace what too many \nothers either don't understand or refuse to see, which is that our \nNation and countries around the world are dependent on coal. That is \nnot something that will change when half the globe is struggling to \nrise out of poverty.\n  In this country we get almost half our electricity from coal. That \nwill not change anytime soon. Globally countries such as China and \nIndia continue to increase their usage of coal as they develop their \neconomies.\n  To fight climate change we can't just choose to stop using coal. Even \nif we in the United States did, the rest of the world wouldn't; and the \nproblem would continue. Instead we must find the technological solution \nthat allows us to use coal, while reducing its impact on the Earth and \nher people.\n  I know that there are many on the Republican side of the aisle who \nbelieve it does not go far enough. There are many on my side of the \naisle who believe it goes too far in tying the EPA's hands. Ultimately \nI believe this is good legislation because it is an achievable \ncompromise. Too often in this body we seek to score political points on \nissues rather than solve problems that the country is facing now.\n  And right now our Nation's manufacturing and industrial sectors are \nfacing the prospect of overwhelming EPA regulation. Regulation that \nmakes it harder for them to put America back to work. While many might \nthink this is not the perfect solution it is a solution that I believe \nwe can and should move early this year.\n  One piece of the debate that is often missing in our discussions is \nto keep our focus on people and all the problems, including the problem \nof climate change, that affect their future.\n  My focus is on protecting the hard-working people I represent--people \nwho changed my life when I was born anew in the coalfields of West \nVirginia at the age of 26. These people, their work and their lives \nmatter. Any regulatory solution that creates more problems for them \nthan it fixes; and causes more harm than good in their lives is no \nsolution at all. EPA regulation of greenhouse gases does just that.\n  So that, Mr. President, is why I have introduced this legislation \ntoday. I hope that this body will act on it quickly, for we do not have \ntime to waste. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 232. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe manufacturer limitation on the number of new qualified plug-in \nelectric drive motor vehicles eligible for credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that is \nan important step for the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing by \ncontinuing the nurturing of the market for the next generation of \nelectric vehicles. This bill will continue the availability of the \n$7,500 consumer tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles. Current law \nlimits the availability of this plug-in hybrid tax credit to the first \n200,000 vehicles per manufacturer, which is too small to support the \nrevolutionary technological change that we are hopefully going to \nwitness. Failure to provide this support risks falling short of \nPresident Obama's important goal of putting 1 million electric vehicles \non the road by 2015.\n  The U.S. auto industry is poised for a technological explosion that \npromises to fundamentally change transportation here and around the \nworld. Already, the success of GM's Volt has demonstrated that electric \nvehicles are not just an engineer's dream or a science fiction story. \nThey are real, and there is plenty more innovation ready to be \nunleashed.\n  But like almost every transformational technology, from the great \nrailroads to the Internet, this technological revolution needs support \nif it is to spread. President Obama last week laid out a vision of how \nthis kind of technology can help ensure our economic future. With the \nproper support, we can transform transportation and create new jobs for \nAmerican workers. But if we fail to support this revolution, we risk \nmissing an opportunity that we may never get back. If we do not get it \nright, there is no doubt that other countries will--and their workers--\nin China, India, South Korea and elsewhere--will then build these \nvehicles instead of American workers.\n  So I am pleased today to be introducing this bill that is identical \nto one that my brother Sandy Levin introduced last week in the House of \nRepresentatives. This legislation will increase the cap on the number \nof vehicles eligible for the plug-in hybrid tax credit in current law \nand provide much greater certainty to our manufacturers. It says to our \nmanufacturers that\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nwe will support technology of great potential and it says to consumers \nwe will continue to help make these vehicles more available and \naffordable. This change in law will make a difference immediately, and \nit is an important signal of future support for the transformation of \nour transportation sector.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE IN MANUFACTURER LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER \n                   OF QUALIFIED PLUG-IN ELECTRIC DRIVE MOTOR \n                   VEHICLES ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT.\n\n       Paragraph (2) of section 30D(e) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``200,000'' and inserting \n     ``500,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Feinstein (for herself and Mrs. Boxer)):\n  S. 234. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide for \nenhanced safety and environmental protection in pipeline transportation \nand to provide for enhanced reliability in the transportation of United \nStates energy products by pipeline, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Strengthening \nPipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2011, with my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Barbara Boxer.\n  This bill strengthens and expands legislation proposed by U.S. \nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and it includes many provisions to \nimprove pipeline safety and inspection that Senator Boxer and I \nproposed last year.\n  In addition, the bill would also mandate that natural gas pipeline \noperators comply with recently issued urgent recommendations of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, which call on operators to \ncreate ``a traceable, verifiable and complete'' record of pipeline \ncomponents in order to verify the ``maximum allowable operating \npressure'' of every pipeline segment.\n  NTSB issued these recommendations earlier this month because it \ndiscovered very serious problems with Pacific Gas and Electric's \nrecordkeeping during its investigation of the tragic pipeline disaster \nin San Bruno, California.\n  Pipes were mislabeled. One was labeled as a seamless 30-inch pipe. In \nfact, there is no such thing as a 30-inch seamless pipe. Pipes that \nlarge are manufactured with seams, according to experts.\n  Maximum Allowable Operating Pressures of the pipeline at issue cannot \nbe verified.\n  NTSB's findings are deeply concerning to me. I believe that a utility \nsending explosive gas under neighborhoods must know what kind of pipe \nlies under that community.\n  If it does not know what pipe is underground, how can it operate the \npipeline at a safe pressure? How can it inspect for faulty seams and \nwelds if inspectors do not know the pipe has welds in the first place?\n  I am very distressed by NTSB's findings, and I call on all pipeline \noperators to verify their records, including Pacific Gas and Electric. \nThe operators should do this on their own accord. In case they do not, \nthis legislation will mandate it.\n  On September 9th, at 6:11 p.m., a natural gas pipeline in San Bruno, \nCalifornia, just south of San Francisco, exploded, turning a quiet \nresidential area into something resembling a war zone.\n  The blast in the Crestmoor neighborhood shook the ground like an \nearthquake.\n  The first reports suggested it was a plane crash, as the blast site \nwas only two miles from San Francisco International Airport. But as the \nfire raged on it became clear that something was fueling it.\n  Firefighters were powerless, as the water main in the area had been \nburst in the blast. CalFire helicopters were brought in.\n  The inferno burned for 1 hour and 29 minutes before the gas to the \n30-inch transmission pipe could be turned off at two different \nlocations.\n  One of the valves was 1 mile from the blast, and another was 1.5 \nmiles away.\n  They were both in secured locations. To shut each valve, a worker \nneeded to drive through rush hour traffic, use a key to get into the \narea, and attach a handle to the valve to crank it.\n  It took more than 5 hours to turn off the gas distribution pipelines \nto the homes on fire.\n  The blaze damaged or destroyed 55 homes, injured 66, and killed eight \npeople. It consumed 15 acres.\n  The next day I called the National Transportation Safety Board Chair. \nTwo days later, I visited San Bruno. I walked through the devastation \nwith Christopher Hart, vice chairman of the NTSB.\n  I saw homes and cars totally incinerated. It was like a bomb had \nstruck.\n  The sections of pipeline that exploded--now a key part of the \ninvestigation--appeared to have ripped apart along longitudinal and \ncircular welds, now 55 years old.\n  A gaping crater demonstrated the size of the initial blast.\n  This crater was located at the low point in the valley, where the \nstreet and pipeline, that ran down the middle of the street, dipped and \nrose.\n  This tragedy shows the heavy toll, in death and destruction, when \nhigh pressure natural gas pipelines fail. The risk is unacceptably \nhigh.\n  To address this risk, I join with my colleague, Senator Barbara \nBoxer, to introduce the Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement \nAct of 2011. The legislation:\n  Doubles the number of Federal pipeline safety inspectors. The \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration currently has \n100 pipeline inspectors, responsible for 217,306 miles of interstate \npipeline. Each inspector is responsible for 2,173 miles of pipeline--\nthe distance from San Francisco to Chicago. NTSB has recently \nrecommended that inspectors ``must establish an aggressive oversight \nprogram that thoroughly examines each operator's decision-making \nprocess.'' Doubling the number of inspectors will make this possible.\n  Verifies Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure. The bill would mandate \nthat pipeline operators comply with NTSB's urgent recommendation to \nverify the accuracy of each pipeline's Maximum Allowable Operating \nPressure.\n  Specifically, pipeline operators must establish ``a traceable, \nverifiable and complete'' record of pipeline components in order to \nverify the ``maximum allowable operating pressure,'' based on the \nweakest section of the pipeline. Pipelines with incomplete records must \nbe pressure tested or replaced, and must operate at reduced pressure \nuntil testing is completed.\n  Requires deployment of electronic valves capable of automatically \nshutting off the gas in a fire or other emergency. Manual operated \nvalves must be located, accessed, and physically turn off in an \nemergency. Automatic valves could dramatically reduce damage caused by \na pipeline breach.\n  Mandates inspections by ``smart pigs,'' or the use of an inspection \nmethod certified by the Secretary of Transportation as equally \neffective at finding corrosion and weld defects. Accident statistics \nover the past decade identify corrosion as the leading cause of all \nreported pipeline accidents, and the NTSB has found substantial defects \nin weld of the pipes in San Bruno.\n  Prohibits natural gas pipelines from operating at high pressure if \nthey cannot be inspected using the most effective inspection \ntechnology. This precautionary approach to pipeline operations assures \nthat pipelines more likely to have undetected problems are operated at \nlower risk.\n  Prioritizes old pipelines in seismic areas for the highest level of \nsafety oversight. Today, regulators consider a pipeline's proximity to \nhomes and buildings. Other risk factors are not a defining \nconsideration, even though pipe age and seismicity have a clear impact \non the risk of a catastrophic incident.\n  Directs the Department of Transportation to set standards for natural \ngas leak detection equipment and methods. Today there are no uniform \nnational standards for how to detect leaks.\n  Finally, the legislation adopts a number of common-sense provisions \nproposed by Secretary LaHood to improve pipeline safety, including \nincreasing civil penalties for safety violations; expanding data \ncollection to be\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nincluded in the national pipeline mapping system; closing \njurisdictional loopholes to assure greater oversight of unregulated \npipelines; and requiring consideration of a firm's safety record when \nconsidering its request for regulatory waivers.\n  Senator Boxer and I introduce this legislation in order to initiate \nquick action to make our pipeline system safer.\n  We have put forward our best ideas to improve inspection, address old \npipes, and advance modern safety technology. We hope to improve these \nideas as new information comes forward about the San Bruno tragedy.\n  For instance, just last week, the NTSB issued a new report, which \nconcluded that the welded seams of the San Bruno pipe were imperfect.\n  Microscopic and X-ray evidence turned up 27 defects on that \nlongitudinal seam that fell short of current day standards, including \ntoo-shallow welds and both debris and gas bubbles trapped inside welds.\n  For the welds running around the circumference of the pipe, \ninvestigators found 166 substandard defects.\n  This pipeline's weld defects were not discovered during 55 years of \ninspections, even though the Federal Code of Regulations clearly \nrequires utilities to look for such defects, 49 CFR 192.917.\n  I hope the committee will take a serious look at how to develop an \neffective inspection regime to find and address flaws and weaknesses in \npipeline welds.\n  We look forward to working with the Senate Commerce Committee to move \nand improve this legislation expeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nroles and responsibilities of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise before you today with Senators \nSnowe, Leahy, Wyden, Johnson and Kerry to introduce important \nlegislation--the Guardians of Freedom Act of 2011--which will make the \nChief of the National Guard Bureau a member of\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. This legislation will strengthen our \nnational security both abroad and here at home.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff does an outstanding job providing support \nto the Secretary of Defense and performing oversight of military \npersonnel and resources within the Department of Defense. However, it \nlacks the voice of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau who \nrepresents more than twenty percent of the uniformed service members.\n  This is important because each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is \na military adviser to the President, the National Security Council, the \nHomeland Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. In that role, \nthey may offer their advice and opinions to the President, the National \nSecurity Council, the Homeland Security Council, or the Secretary of \nDefense. And, as we all know, the National Guard has important homeland \nsecurity responsibilities in addition to national defense \nresponsibilities.\n  As the former Governor of West Virginia, I cannot say enough about \nthe importance of the National Guard. The National Guard is always \nthere. Whether it is flooding, snow storms, tornadoes, or other \ndisasters, the National Guard comes to the rescue of communities in \nevery State throughout our Nation. And, I would bet that there is a \nmember of the National Guard living in every single congressional \ndistrict and every single community in our country. These citizen-\nsoldiers are our Governors' emergency force.\n  Unlike our active-duty forces, the National Guard has both a State \nand Federal mission. Now I'm not taking anything away from our active-\nduty or reserve forces as they have always performed, and will continue \nto perform, in an outstanding fashion. However, the National Guard is \nunique in that it serves each State's Governor in addition to the \nPresident and Commander-in-Chief.\n  The National Guard's State mission includes responding to natural and \nman-made disasters as well as domestic emergencies. They have been \ncalled to respond to hurricanes, floods and snow storms. They serve \nnext door to each of us.\n  Among the National Guard's Federal responsibilities is providing \nhomeland defense and defense support to civil authorities. The National \nGuard accomplishes its Federal mission through a variety of programs. \nOne of those programs is the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, \nNuclear, or High-Yield Explosive Teams, which respond to incidents and \nsupport local, State, and Federal agencies as they conduct \ndecontamination, medical support, and casualty search and extraction.\n  Last year's Quadrennial Defense Review acknowledged that the \nDepartment of Defense must be prepared to provide appropriate support \nto civil authorities. One key finding of the Quadrennial Defense Review \nwas the recognition of the need to field faster, more flexible \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives \nevents consequence management response forces. As a result of this \nfinding, the National Guard will build a Homeland Response Force in \neach of the 10 Federal Emergency Management Agency regions. These 10 \nHomeland Response Forces will provide the needed response capability. \nThese are just two of the many ways in which the National Guard works \ndirectly with the homeland security community as the central connection \nbetween the Federal Government and State and local officials. And, I \nwould be remiss if I did not mention that a primary training unit for \nthese Homeland Response Forces is the West Virginia National Guard's \nJoint Interagency Training & Education Center.\n  These Federal programs, along with the National Guard's State \nmission, clearly illustrate the National Guard's unequivocal role in \nprotecting our home front. And, it goes without saying that our Guard \nmembers make tremendous contributions to military operations outside of \nthe United States.\n  Today, tens of thousands of Guard members train with first responders \nand protect life and property here at home, while also engaging in \ncombat operations in far-off, dangerous locations--including Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Since September 11, 2001, our National Guardsmen have been called \nupon to deploy abroad at a higher rate than ever before. At the same \ntime their domestic and State missions have expanded. Given the \nNational Guard's role in defending our country, it is important that \nthe National Guard be resourced and equipped to fulfill its dual \nmission.\n  Our Guard members must be assured of the ability to meet their \nobligations to their Governors, their next door neighbors, and to our \nNation as a whole. In order to do that, the National Guard's voice must \nbe heard at the highest levels of our government.\n  By making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the Guardians of Freedom Act of 2011 will \nguarantee that the National Guard is a part of the discussion as the \nNation responds to threats both foreign and domestic. It also makes \ncertain that the concerns of the Nation's Governors are considered when \nresources are scarce. And it will build upon the relationship developed \nbetween the active-duty forces and the National Guard, a bond has been \nstrengthened as a result of the ongoing operations.\n  Before I end my remarks, I want to acknowledge Major General Allen \nTackett, the Adjutant General of the West Virginia National Guard for \nthe last 15 years and the longest serving Adjutant General in the \ncountry. Major General Tackett is retiring today after enlisting in the \nArmy more than 45 years ago. He has been a great partner and visionary \nover the years. He led the transformation of the West Virginia National \nGuard and, according to General McKinley, Chief of the National Guard \nBureau, is leaving West Virginia with the Nation's finest National \nGuard. I can honestly say that we are better off as a Nation because he \nchose to dedicate his life to defending ours. Thank you, Major General \nTackett. God smiled on West Virginia the day he gave us you, and we are \neternally grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/31/senate-section/article/S366-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S366-S367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 34--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 7 THROUGH 11, \n              2011, AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, and \nMr. Sanders) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 35\n\n       Whereas the protection of the privacy of personal \n     information is a global imperative for governments, commerce, \n     civil society, and individuals;\n       Whereas new and innovative technologies enhance our lives \n     by increasing our abilities to communicate, learn, share, and \n     produce, and every effort should be made to continue both the \n     development and the widespread use of such technologies;\n       Whereas the use of numerous technologies in our everyday \n     lives and in our work gives rise to the potential compromise \n     of personal data privacy if appropriate care is not taken, by \n     individuals, government, and businesses, to protect personal \n     information;\n       Whereas many individuals are unaware of the risks to \n     privacy posed by new technologies, of data protection and \n     privacy laws generally, and of specific steps that they can \n     take to help protect the privacy of personal information;\n       Whereas a continuing examination and understanding of the \n     ways in which personal information is collected, used, \n     stored, shared and managed in an increasingly networked world \n     will contribute to the protection of personal privacy;\n       Whereas National Data Privacy Day constitutes an \n     international collaboration and a nationwide and statewide \n     effort to raise awareness about data privacy and promote \n     education about the protection of personal information;\n       Whereas government officials from the United States, \n     Canada, and Europe, privacy professionals, academic \n     communities, legal scholars, representatives of businesses \n     and nonprofit organizations, and others with an interest in \n     data privacy issues are working together on this date to \n     further the discussion about data privacy and protection;\n       Whereas privacy and security professionals and educators \n     are being encouraged to take the time to discuss data privacy \n     and security issues with teens and young adults in schools \n     and Universities across the country, and parents are being \n     encouraged to discuss data privacy issues with their \n     children;\n       Whereas the Federal Government has a demonstrated interest \n     in promoting privacy and security education in schools;\n       Whereas the third annual Congressional recognition of \n     National Data Privacy Day will encourage more people \n     nationwide to be aware of data privacy concerns and to take \n     steps to protect their personal information; and\n       Whereas January 28, 2011, would be an appropriate day to \n     designate as National Data Privacy Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of a National Data Privacy \n     Day;\n       (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the \n     day with appropriate activities that promote awareness of \n     data privacy;\n       (3) encourages educators and privacy professionals to \n     discuss data privacy and security issues with teens in high \n     schools across the United States;\n       (4) encourages corporations to take steps to protect the \n     privacy and security of the personal information of their \n     clients and consumers; to design privacy into products they \n     create where possible; and to promote trust in technologies; \n     and\n       (5) encourages individuals across the Nation to be aware of \n     data privacy concerns and to take steps to protect their \n     personal information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/31/senate-section/article/S369-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
