Madam President, there is a fundamental principle we have \nto focus on in the Senate, and I think we have focused on it; that is, \nwe cannot default on our debt. We have 11 or 12 days until that crucial \ntime comes. We have a number of plans that are being talked about here. \nWe have a path forward in the Senate, we believe. There is the Gang of \n6, which reported some encouraging news yesterday. We have President \nObama's grand plan that has been talked about a lot.\n  So now we return to the roots of what this country is all about; that \nis, our constitutional form of government. The Founding Fathers \nuniquely--when they finally figured out a way to do the Constitution, \nthe breakthrough was in June of 1787, the so-called Grand Compromise, \nwhen a member of the Constitutional Convention from Connecticut came up \nwith the idea of a bicameral legislature. No one had ever thought about \nthat before, that we would have a system of government with three \nbranches--executive, judicial, and legislative. No one had ever \nconsidered having anything other than a parliamentary form of \ngovernment.\n  But our Founding Fathers came up with a new idea, and that new idea \nwas to have within the legislative branch of government two Houses; one \nbased strictly on population and one based on the same number of \nSenators from each State. That took care of the big problem they had \nwith New York--big, massive New York, with a lot of area and lots of \npeople--and little, tiny Rhode Island--not much area and not many \npeople.\n  The reason I say we return to our roots is we are not going to be \nable to do the fundamental principle that guides this country in the \nlast 11 or 12 days of this legislative session; that is, we cannot \ndefault on our debt. We in the Senate can have the greatest ideas in \nthe world, but if they are not accepted in the House we cannot extend \nthe debt ceiling, which we have to do.\n  So now we await the House of Representatives. With our bicameral form \nof legislature, that is what we must do. We know they know time is of \nthe essence. We know all of the partisanship that has been shown in the \nHouse of Representatives, including their spending so much time on this \nplan they call cap, cut, and balance--which others have called cut, \ncap, and destroy Medicare, and all the other names this program has \nbeen given--and we have to get now where we work on something that is \nimportant and has an opportunity to pass.\n  Everyone knew, the Republican leadership knew that did not stand a\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nchance over here. That is why, with this most important issue we are \nfacing; that is, not defaulting on our debt, they have to become real \nand send something over to us or we will send something to them or \nagree in the interim to something that will extend the debt.\n  As most know, I have worked hard in trying to figure a way through \nall this. Others have worked just as hard as I have. Right now, I am at \na point where I am saying we need to hear from the House of \nRepresentatives. We have a plan to go forward over here. But until we \nhear from the House of Representatives, all of our work here would be \nfor naught.\n  So I await the word from the Speaker. He indicated that he thought it \nwould be appropriate they get this other matter out of the way first. I \nlook forward to working on this.\n  I had a terrific conversation with the President last night. He \nunderstands the issue as well as anyone in the country, if not more so, \nbecause the buck does stop at his desk. So I tell all Senators to be \ncalm and deliberate. I am confident we will be able to work our way \nthrough this very difficult time. But we are at this stage depending on \nthe House of Representatives to help us find a path forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4682-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ORDER FOR MEASURE TO BE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 2560\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, our Nation is less than 2 weeks away \nfrom potentially facing what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has \ncalled a ``calamitous outcome.''\n  Unless we act, the United States of America, for the first time in \nour history, may face the prospect of defaulting on our loans, and not \nmaking good on the promises we have made to millions of our citizens.\n  This outcome is unthinkable, and we should be doing everything we can \nto avoid it. That is why I am so disappointed that instead of working \nwith us to tackle this issue seriously, the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives has chosen to put politics ahead of everything else, \nand has sent us a bill they call cut, cap, and balance.\n  First of all, this is a colossal waste of time. The Republican House \nhas sent us a bill that may appeal to their extreme base, but right now \nthe American people are looking for results, not more rhetoric.\n  The Washington Post reports this bill as being ``a doomed plan.'' \nEven conservative columnist David Brooks said in his column yesterday \nthat this bill has ``zero chance of becoming law.'' And that it is \n``likely that Republicans will come to regret this missed \nopportunity.''\n  But second of all, this bill is not just a waste of time, it's truly \nterrible policy. It would essentially enshrine into our Constitution \nthe failed Republican policies that got us into this crisis in the \nfirst place.\n  It could bind our hands from responding to national emergencies that \nrequire quick and decisive action. Like another terrorist attack or \nHurricane Katrina, payments for families who have lost their homes in \ntornadoes, or an infrastructure breach in states across the country \nlike the Howard Hanson Dam in my home State of Washington.\n  It would force us to say ``no'' to families across the country who \nneed some temporary support to help them get back on their feet, and at \nthe same time help them contribute back to our economic strength.\n  This bill would have prevented us from taking any real actions after \nWall Street brought us to the precipice of financial collapse in 2008, \nwhich would have led to thousands more job losses across the country at \na time when we could afford it least.\n  And it would not allow Congress, as representatives of the American \npeople, to make the investments we need to continue innovating, \neducating, and leading in the 21st century economy.\n  Republicans may be talking about the virtues of cutting, capping and \nbalancing now, but their actions and votes speak much louder than these \nthree words.\n  And the Republican budget this same House of Representatives just \npassed, a budget that slashes and burns away at the fabric of our \nsociety that cuts off millions of middle class and working families \nfrom the health care, nutrition, education, and housing support they \nneed. Even this Republican budget would not meet the standards of cut, \ncap, and balance. And you know who else's budgets would not meet those \nstandards? Ronald Reagan's and George W. Bush's.\n  It is truly unbelievable that they are playing these games with the \nclock ticking down to another financial crisis. We do not need a so-\ncalled cut, cap, and balance bill to put in place sensible policies \nthat work for the American people.\n  My Republican colleagues may choose to ignore this fact these days, \nbut we did some responsible cutting and balancing of our own here in \nAmerica not too long ago and we did not need a constitutional amendment \nto do our jobs, either. Like many of them, I was here in 2000.\n  I remember that when President Clinton left office we were on a \ncourse to completely pay down the $5.6 trillion debt by 2012. I \nremember the projections of surpluses. I remember some of my colleagues \nactually being worried that the large surpluses in years ahead could be \na problem. And I remember the efforts by many of us to safeguard that \nfunding for our seniors, for our future, and to pay down the debt.\n  But I also remember what Republicans chose to do with that surplus. \nThey could not wait to get their hands on the nation's credit card. And \nwhen they did, after President Bush took office, they spent lavishly.\n  Throughout the Bush years, and particularly in the Bush tax cuts of \n2001 and 2003, trillions of dollars in tax breaks went to the very \nwealthiest Americans.\n  There were capital gains tax roll-backs. Tax breaks designed to \nbenefit corporate giants. And a new tax bracket that provided the very \nwealthiest Americans the lowest tax rates they have enjoyed since World \nWar II.\n  These tax breaks were all unpaid for, all handed out to those who \ncould most afford to pay, and all put on the Nation's credit card.\n  Our country was also led into two wars, and neither of them were paid \nfor.\n  Now that the credit card bill has come due, now that all those tax \ncuts and spending need to be reckoned with, and just as our Nation is \nstarting to recover from the Wall Street crisis that has devastated so \nmany families, Republicans are playing political games with our future.\n  This is serious. If we cannot come to an agreement by August 2, the \nconsequences will be dire.\n  A few weeks ago the Bipartisan Policy Center put out a report \nauthored by a former Bush Treasury official about\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nwhat would happen if Congress failed to act and the administration was \nforced to make desperate spending decisions in August. And the \nscenarios were worse than grim.\n  Potentially at risk are: the benefits and health care we owe our \nveterans, loans for struggling small businesses, food stamps for those \nstruggling to buy groceries, Social Security checks for our seniors, \nunemployment benefits for the millions of workers desperately seeking \njobs, and even active duty pay for our military. These risks are \nunacceptable.\n  Senior citizens in this great country are worried that the Social \nSecurity checks they depend on, and that they have been promised, may \nnot be coming in the mail in 2 weeks. And then they read the news and \nhear that Republicans are still ``playing games.''\n  Mothers and fathers are sitting around their kitchen table, trying to \nfigure out what they would do if the food stamps they count on to feed \ntheir kids got cut off. And then they turn on the television, and see \nreports of the House of Representatives sending us a bill that cannot \npass. This is an embarrassment. And the American people deserve better.\n  Democrats have come to the table again and again with reasonable \nproposals for coming to an agreement. We have come to the middle. We \nhave offered up serious and deep cuts in Federal spending. But again \nand again, Republicans have said no.\n  So far, they have refused to make any deal that does not protect tax \ncuts and loopholes for oil companies, private jets, and millionaires \nand billionaires and as we see today, they seem to be more focused on \noffering up red meat to their base than actual solutions for the \nAmerican people and more focused on negotiating tensions within their \nown party than on working with us to get results.\n  So, with 13 days to go, I urge House Republicans to get serious about \nthis.\n  The so-called cut, cap, and balance bill is bad policy. It is the \nkind of silly politics that Americans are sick of, and it is a waste of \ntime that we as a country simply cannot afford right now.\n  If all it took were slogans and gimmicks to solve this crisis, House \nRepublicans would have this covered. But we know that is not the case. \nAnd the clock is ticking for families across America.\n  Democrats are going to keep working to solve this crisis. We are \nready to compromise. And we need a partner at the table that is just as \nserious about this as we and the American people are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nlegislation that I believe is very important for the future of health \ncare fairness in our country.\n  Yesterday, I introduced the Savings Through Eligibility Fairness Act, \nwhich addresses Medicaid fairness and debt reduction. My friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, \nSenator Enzi, has a shared interest in this issue, and I commend and \nappreciate his offering of similar legislation and offer to continue to \nwork with him to deal with and find solutions to this issue.\n  Medicaid is an important safety net for Nebraska and our country's \nmost vulnerable families. I am committed to making sure they will \ncontinue receiving health care coverage. Unfortunately, the health care \nreform law passed last year would inadvertently make some middle-class \nAmericans eligible for Medicaid who should not be eligible for \nMedicaid. My bill changes the law to ensure that only the neediest \nNebraskans and Americans would qualify for the Medicaid expansion and \nhealth exchange subsidies created by the health reform law.\n  This simple, reasonable change has a significant impact: It saves $13 \nbillion. Let me repeat that--$13 billion worth of savings. My bill \ncommits that $13 billion will be used to pay down the national deficit. \nAs Washington debates various debt-reduction plans, my bill offers one \nconcrete, commonsense way to reduce the national debt by $13 billion. \nWe hear a lot of different ideas but not with the same level of \nconcrete, commonsense approach.\n  I regularly hear from Nebraskans who are already benefiting from the \nnew health care law--children remaining on their parents' coverage, \nseniors closing the doughnut hole, and young people no longer being \ndenied coverage because of preexisting conditions. Those are Nebraskans \nwho are already benefiting from the new health care law. So \nimprovements such as the one I have proposed will save money and help \nreduce the national debt, while still protecting health care for \nNebraska and American families.\n  In the current debate of how best to reduce spending and reduce our \nNation's deficit, I believe Congress should start with this commonsense \napproach. It will maintain sensible eligibility requirements for the \nMedicaid expansion and health exchange subsidies rather than focusing \non shifting costs to States, providers, and the people who rely on this \nmost important program.\n  Right now, most States do include Social Security income when \ndeciding who will be eligible for Medicaid. So my legislation will \nmaintain that definition for establishing eligibility for both Medicaid \nand health exchange subsidies. Keeping this same definition \nconsistently will ensure Medicaid will not start down the path of \ncovering middle-income families, which has never been the purpose of \nthis program, nor should it be. Rather, Medicaid is part of a critical \nsafety net for the most vulnerable and the most in need.\n  Let me point out an important fact. Those who would no longer qualify \nfor the Medicaid expansion would still be eligible to receive health \ninsurance coverage through the State health insurance exchange and \nsubsidies where appropriate. So they will receive the health care they \nneed. As a result, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nthe savings through the Eligibility Fairness Act will have a negligible \neffect on the total number of individuals projected to be insured as a \nresult of health care reform.\n  Let me conclude and summarize by saying that Medicaid is an important \nhealth safety net for Nebraska and America's most vulnerable citizens. \nI am committed to preserving this program for more than 200,000 \nNebraskans out of 1.85 million who include children, seniors, pregnant \nmothers, and the disabled. I am committed to maintaining this coverage \nfor these Nebraskans in this fashion.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Madam President, this weekend I was in eastern Oregon \nholding townhalls. At each gathering, citizens asked me: How important \nis August 2? Are the Members of the Senate going to be able to come \ntogether and make sure our Nation doesn't default?\n  I rise today to address that question. Indeed, it would be historic, \nthe first time in the history of the United States that we will have \nrefused to pay our bills.\n  Some of my colleagues have called into question the significance of \nsuch an event. One of my colleagues said:\n\n       I am a little bit cynical about the scare mongering and \n     putting America's back up against this August 2 deadline just \n     to get an increase in the American credit card.\n\n  I heard some of my colleagues talk about the situation in which they \nview paying the interest on Treasury bills as equivalent to a family \nholding a mortgage; and the fact that the United States has other \nbills, such as checks to write to our veterans and our senior citizens, \nas more equivalent to utility bills; and that somehow, as long as you \nkeep paying on your mortgage, you can quit making your payments on your \nutilities; that is, other payments for\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\ndebts and obligations we have already incurred.\n  I want to clarify that this is a deeply flawed analysis because we \ndon't have our national debt locked in for 30 years in a situation \nwhere we don't have to worry about changes in interest on it as long as \nwe keep making our payments. Indeed, every week there is an auction of \nTreasury bonds. Thus, even if we make our payments on our interest, if \nwe are not making our payments on other obligations in the United \nStates, that translates into a sense that we are in trouble, and we \nwill have to pay higher interest on the Treasury side. So it is as if \nyou had to refinance your family mortgage and you knew that if you \ndidn't pay your utility bills, you weren't going to be able to get that \nbill refinanced or at least you would have to pay higher interest. The \nconsequences are substantial because this would be an increase in \ninterest that is like a tax on all Americans, on all small businesses, \non the entire economy, and a tax that buys us nothing of value.\n  A Representative from the House has said, referring to the \npossibility of losing our AAA rating:\n\n       I am not as worried as Moody's or anyone else as this \n     economy gets worse . . . I don't take the premise that we're \n     going to default on our obligations.\n\n  Quite frankly, to believe that we can ignore payments on our debts \nand not have serious consequences is way off the mark. If we don't hit \nAugust 2 with action and we don't get our act together by then, on \nAugust 3 we will fail to make payments, and there will be a severe \nimpact on our national economy. No matter how we shuffle around the \nmoney, we will not have enough money to pay some of our obligations, \nwhether it be our interest payments, Social Security checks, checks to \nveterans, military checks--you name it--and our credit rating will be \ndowngraded. Already, the ratings agencies have stated as much. As \nSenator Schumer and others have shown very effectively, there is no way \nfor revenues we have coming in to cover the full set of obligations we \nhave incurred.\n  This cavalier attitude about the consequences of default ignores the \nfact that default will have an immediate impact on interest rates and \ncould send our economy into quite a tailspin. That is the last thing \nfamilies need--higher costs in the short term and perhaps a severe loss \nof jobs and a much deeper recession. That would put us in a hole deeper \nthan the one we have now. It would not facilitate our path to a \nsolution; it would hinder our path to fiscal responsibility.\n  I thought I would note that the impact on families is fairly direct. \nMost major items families buy are with loans. A three-quarters of a \npercentage point increase on the interest rate for Treasury bonds, \nwhich J.P. Morgan has estimated would be the minimum it would rise in \ndefault, translates into serious costs for a family.\n  Let me be clear. This is the best-case scenario. The consequences \ncould be much more severe.\n  Let's start first with the consequences on a mortgage. The average \nfamily takes out a loan of $172,000 to buy their home, with a monthly \nmortgage payment of around $1,000. The expected increase in Treasury \nbond rates would translate into higher rates for mortgages, and it \nwould cost the average family about $1,000 more per year. This would be \non new loans. Families who have adjustable-rate mortgages based on \nTreasury rates would also be impacted.\n  Let's take a second look at credit cards. Families use credit to pay \nfor everything from food, to gas, to prescription drugs--it is \nespecially true during hard times such as we are in now. The median \nbalance for an American with credit card debt was $3,300 in 2009. That \nmeans the average family with credit card debt will pay about $250 more \nin interest per year.\n  Let's turn to some of the other family expenses.\n  Analysts estimate that a technical default on bonds will also \ndiminish the trading value of the dollar, maybe causing it to fall 5 \npercent or so against competing currencies. This would have a direct \nimpact, and we would feel it most directly in the cost of oil. I have \nbeen arguing that we need a plan to end our dependence on overseas oil. \nWe send $1 billion a day out of our country. That creates jobs overseas \nrather than here at home. But ending our dependence on overseas oil \ncan't happen overnight, so all of the costs of that additional oil, at \na different exchange rate, would be felt in the family budget.\n  Indeed, if there was a decline of 5 percent, the impact would be felt \non food. It takes a lot of energy to power agriculture. The estimate is \nabout $318 more per year for a family. That is a J.P. Morgan estimate.\n  Similarly, on utilities, we have all heard horror stories throughout \nthe recession that families have to decide which utilities to pay \nfirst. Mothers and fathers are sitting around the kitchen table \nthinking, Can we get by without electricity or should we postpone the \nwater payment or perhaps the natural gas payment? Default would make \nthe situation worse for families, adding, at that 5 percent estimate \nfrom J.P. Morgan, about $182 more per year. Remember, this is the best-\ncase analysis.\n  Gasoline at the pump is similarly affected. Taking a look at average \nconsumption per year, families would pay about $100 more per year on \ngas. Again, that is the best case.\n  If we total these, we can see that the overall cost for a middle-\nclass family would be on the order of about $1,850. We can round it off \nto about $2,000 per family. I don't know about the block you live on, \nbut on the block I live on $2,000 is a real blow for working families.\n  That is just the beginning of this story because, as it unfolds, the \nimpact on the dollar and the shock waves that would flow would very \nlikely send us into a double-dip recession. Now, it would have an \nimpact as of August 2 or 3 on Social Security and Medicare payments. A \nbipartisan committee has taken a look at it and backed up Senator \nSchumer's statement that there would not be enough revenue coming in to \ncover all of our obligations. The stock market would probably take a \nhit, and 401(k)s could be severely impacted. Other savings could be \nseverely impacted. We all know how that felt in late 2008 and 2009 when \nfamilies often saw their life savings wiped out in a few short weeks.\n  The bigger issue is jobs. Perhaps more than half a million jobs could \nbe lost. This analysis is from the Third Way. Their estimate is 640,000 \njobs. Oregon has about 1 percent of the Nation's population. This would \ntranslate into about 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in my home State. We would \nlove to have an increase of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in Oregon, and we would \nhate to see a loss of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs. I know that would extend \nthroughout our Nation. We need more jobs, not fewer jobs.\n  In addition, this situation will have an impact on our debt. Contrary \nto what some of my colleagues have said, it will make the situation \nworse, not better. That is because the interest payments on the debt \nwill go up--$1.3 trillion additional in new debt. Is that really the \ndirection in which we want to go? Is that really good stewardship of \nthe economy--to impose a situation in which Social Security checks \nmight be halted and veterans might go to the mailbox and find it empty; \nthat the bills will have to be missed, and it will put people more \ndirectly in harm's way in terms of being able to keep house payments up \nand avoid foreclosure in a situation where we already face a tsunami of \nforeclosures across this country? At a minimum, the American families \nwill be impacted by higher costs on their homes, credit cards, \nessential goods--food, gas, utilities--and then with the significant \npossibility of hundreds of thousands of Americans losing jobs, and \nadditional debt, not less.\n  It is important that we come together and have a sound deal so that \nwe can avoid this situation. This isn't about incurring new spending, \nthis is about paying the bills on spending decisions that were made in \nthe past. I disagreed with a lot of those spending decisions. I \ndisagreed that Medicare Part D should have been enacted without a way \nto pay for it. I disagreed with the giveaways for the best off in \nAmerica, the wealthy and well-connected, when we could not afford it, \nwhich reversed the surplus into a deficit in this country. I disagreed \nwith a strategy where we are spending $120 billion in Afghanistan and a \nstrategy of nation building that is not the best use of national \nsecurity and of our soldiers, who are there to fight for our national\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nsecurity. Those decisions were made in the past, and we must pay the \nbill on those decisions, even though I disagreed with them.\n  Then we need to put together a plan that takes on our deficit and our \ndebt. That plan has to put all of the options on the table. Some of my \ncolleagues across the aisle said: Well, we want to protect the tax \nspending programs, where we have tucked in tax provisions for the \nwealthy and well-connected. They want to defend those, and they want to \ncut the programs for working Americans.\n  That is unacceptable. We have seen an enormous increase in the \ndisparity between the wages and welfare of our citizens in general and \nthe best off becoming much wealthier proportionately. We can't continue \nto say that we are going to protect the well-connected while attacking \nworking families. That is not the America we want to build. We want to \nbuild an America where families can thrive, provide a great foundation \nfor their children to also thrive. That means all policies have to be \non the table, all spending programs, whether in tax bills or in \nappropriations bills, have to be on the table, and we have to weigh \nthem one against the other to say which is most important in creating a \nstronger economy, which is more valuable in strengthening the financial \nfoundations of our families.\n  That is the process we must go through, and that is the process that \nwill put us back on track. But let us not doubt for a moment that when \nthe citizens of my State come to a townhall and say, How important is \nit that we get this figured out by August 2, the answer is, Very \nimportant. When they ask, Will it hurt us if we fail, the answer is, \nYes, it will hurt us. We will be shooting ourselves maybe--I say in the \nfoot, maybe worse.\n  This is a serious issue. We must come together, not as Democrats and \nRepublicans but as Senators working together for the best future for \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4685-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4685-S4687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in my view something significant happened \nyesterday in the House of Representatives. I am pleased with the \noutcome of the passage of the cut, cap, and balance legislation. I \nthink we have a serious responsibility here in the Congress to see that \nwe address the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. \nCertainly the way we do that is important. I am one who believes it \nwould be irresponsible not to address the debt ceiling, but I also \nbelieve it would be irresponsible only to address the debt ceiling \nwithout adequately taking into account the economic circumstances we \nare in and the tremendous debt our country faces.\n  There is no way we can continue down the path we are on. While it is \neasy for us to make accusations, the reality is that this country, \nthrough its Congress and through various administrations, has overspent \nyear after year. The fact that 42 cents of every dollar we spend is now \nborrowed tells us we cannot continue down that path. In one of my \ntownhall meetings this past weekend back in Kansas, the suggestion was \nwe are willing to take a cut in what benefits we get from government \nbut let's do this in a fair way and let's do an across-the-board \nreduction in Federal spending. The suggestion by the constituent was \nmaybe if we all took 5 percent off of what we received, we would be \nfine.\n  I appreciate that attitude but it fails to recognize the magnitude of \nthe problem. Reducing Federal spending by 5 percent across the board \nwill not get us out of the financial circumstance we are in, will not \nrestore fiscal sanity to our Nation. So while we are about, between now \nand August 2, seeing what we can do to raise the debt ceiling, in my \nview we have to come together with a plan that addresses the long-term \nfinancial condition of our Federal Government.\n  I am a supporter of cut, cap, and balance, and was pleased by the \nbroad support that legislation received in the House. It is my \nunderstanding we will now consider that legislation here in the Senate \nthis week. But I read the press reports and the political pundits who \nsay that legislation is dead on arrival in the Senate. I encourage my \ncolleagues not to reach that conclusion. It may be the one and only \npath we have to accomplish what we need to accomplish in the next 2 \nweeks. It may be this is one of the very few measures, if not the only \none, that would pass the House of Representatives. We have now received \nin the Senate a message that says this is something we are willing to \ndo. For a long time I have been told as a Senator there is nothing that \nwill pass the House of Representatives that raises the debt ceiling. \nYet we saw last night that was not the case. So let's not be so quick \nto say that the Senate will not address and seriously consider and \npotentially pass legislation based upon cut, cap, and balance.\n  In some circles, this concept of cut, cap, and balance is considered \nradical, extreme. Cutting spending is not extreme. That is what every \nKansas family does when the budget gets too tight, when we have \noverspent, when the credit cards are maxed. We reduce our spending. It \nis unlikely we can go out and say I need a raise to solve our problems. \nOur employers are not that sympathetic. We ought not be so quick to say \nwe need a raise. We ought to say what can we find within the government \nthat we can reduce, that we can cut.\n  The idea of capping is certainly not radical. For the last 60 years, \nour country has averaged 18 percent of the gross national product in \nspending by the Federal Government. In the last couple of years that \naverage has increased to 24, 25 percent. It would not be radical to \nmove us back to the days in which we were living with 18 percent--what \nseems to me to be a significant percentage; if we would go back to the \ndays in which only 18 percent of our gross national product was spent \nby the Federal Government.\n  Finally, balancing the budget is not a radical idea. Amending the \nConstitution ought to be done rarely and with great regard for this \ndivinely inspired document, but the Constitution allows for an \namendment process. In fact, it has been utilized to solve many of our \ncountry's problems and challenges over the time of history. It is not \nradical. Forty-nine States have a provision that requires them to have \na balanced budget in some form or another at the end of the year. So \namending the U.S. Constitution to say we are not ever going to get back \nin the mess we are in today certainly is worth pursuing. Of the cut, \ncap, and balance provisions, perhaps it is the constitutional amendment \nthat is the most controversial among my colleagues. I certainly would \nexpress an interest to work with others to find the right \nconstitutional amendment, the right language in an amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution that met their concerns.\n  This cut, cap, and balance seems to me the path forward and the \nSenate should pass a version of cut, cap, and balance to not only allow \nthe debt ceiling to be raised but to allow the debt ceiling to be \nraised only if we become responsible stewards of American taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I actually have a fourth component of cut, cap, and balance. I would \nsay it is cut, cap, balance, and grow. The last time our fiscal house \nwas in solvency--was solvent--was back at the end of President \nClinton's administration. In part, Republicans and Democrats could not \nget along well enough in those days to spend money on big programs. \nThere was legislation that was passed that was supported in a \nbipartisan way by President Clinton and Republicans in Congress to \nlimit spending, so there was some spending restraint. But the reality \nis that the last time we had our fiscal house in order, that we were \nspending less money than we were taking in, was a time at which the \neconomy was growing. If we want to address the issue of balancing our \nbudget, we should focus much more attention than we have on growing the \neconomy, putting people to work and allowing, as they work, that the \ntaxes will be collected.\n  The greatest opportunity we have to improve people's lives is to \ncreate an environment in which jobs are created,\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\nin which employers feel comfortable in investing in the future, buying \nplant and equipment and putting people to work. So while it is cut, \ncap, and balance today, we need to make certain we do not forget what \nis in my view that fourth component: Grow the economy. In my view that \nmeans a Tax Code that is certain and fair, that does not change, that \nis something a business person or a family can rely upon. It is also a \nregulatory environment that allows businesses to have the opportunity \nto grow their business.\n  The most common conversation I have had with a business owner in \nKansas, walking through a manufacturing plant, some small business that \nmanufactures a piece of agriculture equipment--that is pretty common in \nour State--the most common conversation we have is: Senator, what next \nis government going to do that puts me out of business? If that is the \nmindset, how do we ever expect that business person to reach the \nconclusion that they have the faith in the future to invest in their \nplant and equipment and in hiring new employees? We need to make \ncertain our financial institutions, particularly our community banks, \nare not hamstrung by significant regulations that would discourage them \nfrom making loans and create uncertainty about the ability to do that, \na tax regulatory and access-to-credit environment that says now is the \ntime to invest in America, to put people to work.\n  I am here to urge my colleagues to seriously consider, not dismiss, \ncut, cap, and balance and upon its passage for us to immediately return \nto the progrowth agenda that allows people to have the faith the future \nof their country is bright and we return to them the opportunity for \nthe next generation of Americans to understand the American dream can \nstill be lived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the good words of my colleague \nfrom Kansas. He comes from a State where they understand that the role \nof the government should be limited. They understand the importance of \nliving within your means, of not spending money you do not have. The \nSenator from Kansas has had a long and distinguished career in public \nlife, but before coming to Washington, DC, to serve in Congress I \nsuspect he also was a State legislator and my guess is that when he was \na member of the State legislature in Kansas they had to balance their \nbudget every year.\n  I ask my colleague if he could perhaps shed some light on what his \nState of Kansas does, year in and year out, in order to get their \nbudget balanced, to make sure they are not spending more than they take \nin. I think, as he pointed out, that is something for most families in \nKansas--I would say for most families in my State of South Dakota--\nthose are decisions they have to grapple with all the time and we don't \nalways have the luxury of being able to borrow. Most States don't allow \nit. My State of South Dakota doesn't allow that. Certainly rules in our \nStates probably are not very conducive to saying we are going to raise \ntaxes on people and on small businesses, which requires then we have to \nmake our decisions on spending.\n  I would, through the Chair, ask my colleague from Kansas, perhaps \nthat might have been the way in which they went about dealing with \ntheir fiscal crisis in the past?\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota and \nwould indicate that, yes, Kansas is one of those 49 States in our \nConstitution in which we are prohibited in almost all ways of living \nbeyond our means. It has been something that the Kansas legislature and \nGovernor have lived with throughout the history of our State, including \nin today's environment where an economic downturn creates the \ncircumstance in which there are less revenues. So the solution to the \nproblem in Kansas is not a try for more revenue, it is a recognition \nthat spending in difficult times has to be reduced. It is the restraint \nthat we desperately need in Washington, DC, that is so common in State \ncapitals and families and businesses across the country. While I have \nalways indicated to Kansans, while we have this debate every year how \nto balance the revenues with the expenditures--and it is not an \nenjoyable debate--we are fortunate in Kansas we have to reach that \nconclusion and it is something we need in Washington, DC.\n  For a long time the political talk of Washington is that we are too \nlikely to spend and tax. There is also a problem of spending and \nborrowing. We are now suffering the consequence. We are not immune from \nwhat we see in Greece and Italy and Portugal and Ireland. If we do not \nsolve this problem that we face today in a responsible way, it will be \nsolved for us by the markets, by those from whom we borrow money, \ndetermining we are no longer creditworthy. We don't have to worry much \nabout that in Kansas because we have a constitutional provision that \nrequires our legislature and Governor to reach the right conclusion, \nand it is why I thought this debate on the debt ceiling was the \nopportunity for us to force ourselves to do the things that politicians \ndo not always like to do.\n  Mr. THUNE. To the point the Senator from Kansas was making, he talks \nabout higher interest rates and the impact of not dealing with the \nfiscal circumstances in which the country finds itself. Look at what is \nhappening in Europe. Three-year government bond interest rates are \nabout 19.4 for Portugal, 28.9 for Greece, and 12.9 for Ireland.\n  Think about the impact in this country if we had interest rates go \nback to what is even a 20-year average. We would see an additional $5 \ntrillion, about $5 trillion in additional borrowing costs in the next \ndecade alone. That is if we went back to the 20-year historical average \nfor this country, not to mention going to what they are looking at in \ncountries in Europe, with these 19, 20-percent rates. Think about auto \nloans, think about home loans, think about student loans, think about \nbusiness loans--all those things we rely on in our economy and that \nfamilies across this country rely on, in order to carry on with their \ndaily lives if we were looking at those types of interest rates. That \nis the type of interest rate sensitivity we have. If we do not get our \nfiscal house in order, we could very well end up like many of these \ncountries, and that would be devastating for our economy.\n  The most important work we could be doing right now--and the Senator \nfrom Kansas pointed this out--is to put policies in place that actually \ngrow the economy and support jobs. I also will support the cut, cap, \nand balance proposal that is before the Senate today because I think it \ndoes important work. It cuts spending today, immediately, it caps \nspending in the near term, and puts in place a process by which we \nbalance the budget in a long term, a balanced budget amendment\n  It is interesting to note, if we go back historically, something \nPresident Ronald Reagan said 29 years ago this week. He led a rally of \nthousands of people on the Capitol steps calling for a balanced budget \namendment. This is what he said: ``Crisis is a much-abused word today \nbut can we deny we face a crisis?''\n  That is 29 years ago at a time when the Federal debt was $1 trillion. \nWe face a debt 14 times as high, $14 trillion. Under the President's \nbudget it would literally double in the next decade. We have to get our \nfiscal house and our spending in order.\n  The Senator from Kansas also mentioned the size of government as a \npercentage of our entire economy. If you go back to 1800, the \nformation, in the early years of our country, 2 percent is what we \nspent on the Federal Government, 2 percent of our total economy. This \nyear we are over 24 percent, in that 24 to 25-percent range. If you \nlook at the 40-year historical average, about 20.6 percent is what we \nhave spent as a percent of our entire economy. What does that mean? It \nmeans we are spending more at the Federal level and that the private \neconomy is shrinking relative to our total economy. What we want to see \nis an expansion of the private economy where we put policies in place \nthat enable our job creators to create jobs and that we get the Federal \nGovernment smaller, not larger. My view is, when you are looking at a \ndebt crisis the way we are, you don't grow and expand the size of \ngovernment, you make government smaller. You get the private economy \ngrowing and expanding and creating jobs, and that is how you ultimately \nget out of this situation.\n\n  We have policies in place right now that are making it more \ndifficult, and\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\nmore expensive I would argue, for our small businesses to create jobs. \nAnywhere you go--in my State of South Dakota and elsewhere--you talk to \nsmall business owners, you talk to farmers and ranchers, and what they \nwill tell you is the policies, the regulations, and the taxes that are \ncoming out of Washington, DC, make it more expensive and more difficult \nfor our job creators to create jobs.\n  If you look, the data on that it is pretty clear. Since this \nPresident took office, we have higher unemployment by 18 percent, we \nhave 2.1 million more people unemployed than we did when he took \noffice, and we have a 35-percent higher debt. We saw spending go up in \nthe last 2 years alone, nondefense discretionary spending, by 24 \npercent. The number of people who are receiving food stamps in this \ncountry is up by 40 percent.\n  All the data, all the tools by which we can measure economic progress \nand growth demonstrate that the policies that have been put in place by \nthis administration have been a complete failure. So what we need is a \nchange in policies, and it starts by cutting Federal spending, capping \nit in the near term, and putting in place a long-term solution--a \nbalanced budget amendment like so many States have in place, like the \nSenator from Kansas mentioned they have in his State of Kansas, like we \nhave in my State of South Dakota, where our State governments have to \nlive within their means. They cannot spend money they do not have. That \nis the problem we have in Washington, DC, today.\n  In terms of our small businesses, there was a survey done by the \nchamber of commerce a couple of weeks ago in which they found that 64 \npercent of the small businesses that responded to the survey said they \nare not going to hire this year. Another 12 percent actually said they \nare going to cut jobs. Why? Half of the small businesses listed \neconomic uncertainty as the major reason. They are concerned about what \nis going to come out of Washington, DC. They don't know what policies \nand regulations are going to be imposed on them and what it is going to \ndo to them and their cost of doing business, and as a consequence they \nare just hunkering down and trying to survive.\n  We need to change that. We change that by getting Federal spending \nunder control. Cut, cap, and balance is an important step in that \nprocess, and I am pleased the House of Representatives last night \npassed it and sent it over here to the Senate. We will have an \nopportunity to vote on that in the next few days, and I would argue to \nmy colleagues that this is fundamentally the best we can be doing to \nnot only get our fiscal house in order and get it on a more sustainable \npath going forward but also to help get our economy growing again and \nget jobs created out there. You can't do it by making government \nlarger. If that was the case, the trillion-dollar stimulus bill that \nwas passed last year would have brought unemployment down. But, as we \nall know, we are facing 9.2 percent unemployment today.\n  We continue to see an economy that is struggling, that is growing at \na very slow rate. We need to unleash that economy, and the way we do \nthat is by capping or cutting spending in Washington, DC, making the \nFederal Government smaller, not larger, getting that amount of spending \nas a percentage of our entire economy back into a more historical norm, \nand working to ensure that taxes and regulations stay low on our job \ncreators in this country.\n  That is why I fundamentally object to what the President and many of \nhis allies in Congress want to do with regard to the debt crisis; that \nis, increase revenues. You cannot create jobs, you cannot grow the \neconomy by increasing taxes on our job creators. I can't think of a \nsingle tax that you could put on our economy that actually would help \ncreate jobs. It will have the opposite effect--it will make it more \ndifficult for small businesses to create jobs, more difficult for us to \nget out of this economic downturn.\n  I hope my colleagues will support cut, cap, and balance and that it \nwill get a big vote here in the Senate and get this country on a more \nsound fiscal footing and on a path where we can create jobs and get \nthis economy growing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4687-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2055, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2055) making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Coburn (for McCain) amendment No. 553, to eliminate the \n     additional amount of $10,000,000, not included in the \n     President's budget request for fiscal year 2012, appropriated \n     for the Department of Defense for planning and design for the \n     Energy Conservation Investment Program.\n       Johnson (SD) modified amendment No. 556, of a perfecting \n     nature.\n       Vitter amendment No. 568, to provide that none of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this act may be \n     obligated or expended at a rate higher than the level of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives concurrent budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 2012.\n       Wyden/Merkley amendment No. 570, to provide for the closure \n     of Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, Oregon.\n       Coburn amendment No. 564, to require evidence of causal \n     relationships for presumptions by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs of service connection for diseases associated with \n     exposure to certain herbicide agents.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the \nSenate will be able to complete action on the MILCON-VA appropriations \nbill today. Members have had ample opportunity to offer amendments, \nstaff has been working to clear them, and I believe we now have a clear \npath to final passage.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes today talking about the military \nconstruction portion of this bill, which is so important to our troops \nand their families. The bill includes $13.7 billion for MILCON, which \nis $1 billion below the budget request. In drafting this bill, we took \na hard look at the projects submitted by the administration and made \nstrategic reductions in order to make wise use of our MILCON dollars \nwithout sacrificing key military priorities. I believe this bill is a \nprudent approach to addressing our military construction needs at home \nand abroad.\n  The bill fully funds the administration's request of $1.2 billion for \nGuard and Reserve projects. Typically, Congress adds funds for our \nGuard and Reserve components; however, given the current budget \npressures, that option was not available to us this year. It is my hope \nthe services will acknowledge and address the chronic backlog of \nconstruction requirements for the Guard and Reserve forces in future \nbudget requests.\n  Of note, this bill includes $550 million to construct or modify 15 \nDepartment of Defense schools at home and overseas. As Newsweek \nmagazine pointed out last month, a shocking number of DOD schools are \ncrumbling and in need of replacing. The administration has made \nupgrading DOD schools a priority, and the committee wholeheartedly \nsupports that goal. DOD school funding in this bill represents a \nsignificant downpayment on the estimated $3.1 billion requirement for \nDOD school recapitalization.\n  The administration's request included funding for the move of Marines \nfrom Japan to Guam. While the committee recognizes the need to \nrestructure force posture in the Pacific, we remain concerned about the \nballooning cost of this plan and the lack of forward progress on the \npart of our Japanese allies. The report accompanying this bill directs \nthe Navy to provide Congress with detailed information on the cost and \nprognosis of the Guam relocation initiative.\n  Additionally, the committee is concerned with the potential cost of \nrelated troop realignments in Korea and the long-term impact of troop \nreductions in Europe. The report accompanying this bill addresses these \nconcerns in depth.\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\n  As I have said before, this is a sound and responsible bill. Senator \nKirk and I have worked hand in hand to forge a bipartisan approach for \nthe MILCON-VA bill, and I believe we have succeeded. I urge my \ncolleagues to support final passage of the bill today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to join with my colleague and say \nthat Republicans unanimously supported this bill that provides \nappropriations for our veterans and for our military construction needs \nunanimously in the subcommittee. Our Republican members unanimously \nsupported this bill in the full committee, and the reason why is \nbecause this bill is marked to the House budget. This bill cuts \nspending on the budget authority discretionary side about $1.2 billion \nbelow the President's request. The bill also cuts spending $620 million \nbelow last year's level, and it even comes in $2.6 million below \nChairman Culberson's bill that passed the House of Representatives \nunder their very strict budget guidelines.\n  I will note that we came together on a bipartisan basis in the Senate \nto bring up this very first of the appropriations bills, and the \ncloture motion to move forward to bring this bill to the floor passed \nby a vote of 71 to 26, with Leader McConnell and our vice chairman, the \nlead Republican on the committee, Mr. Cochran, supporting that.\n  This bill has been endorsed by AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n  I think it is very important as we look at the wider issue of \ndeficits and debt, any danger of interrupting payments to veterans \nbecause of negotiations here on Capitol Hill, it is a very important \nsignal that not just the House pass the appropriations bill to support \nour veterans but also the Senate. So my hope is we will consider the \namendments this afternoon and then advise Members that we would seek to \ngo to final passage and get this first of the appropriations bills done \nthis year, sending a very clear message, especially to our veterans and \nmen and women on Active Duty, that we are supporting their construction \nand veterans health care needs in a way that spends money according to \nthe dictates of the House budget resolution.\n  I yield back and wait for our senior Member from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 minutes as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to point out the obvious; \nthat is, we are 13 days away from August 2, the date Secretary Geithner \nhas indicated, if we do not raise the debt ceiling, that America runs \nthe risk of defaulting on its debt and not paying its bills. I bring \nthis up because this is an issue on which we never should be this close \nto this deadline.\n  It has been pointed out many times that the debt ceiling has very \nlittle to do with how much money we spend. It has nothing to do with \nhow much money we spend because we already spent this money. The \nquestion is whether we are going to pay our bills, whether the United \nStates is going to live up to its obligations, or whether we are going \nto default on our debt.\n  The prospect of not making that deadline is basically unthinkable, \nthat the United States would give up its preeminent position \ninternationally. It could jeopardize the U.S. currency being the global \ncurrency. It would have an effect on everyone in this Nation.\n  We already have heard from the rating houses. Last week, both \nStandard & Poor's, S, and Moody's Investors Service warned they are \nconsidering downgrading the country's credit rating if the debt ceiling \nis not raised. A smaller firm, Egan-Jones Ratings, has already \ndowngraded the U.S. securities. What happens if we get the major rating \nhouses saying we are no longer AAA bond rated? Well, it will have an \nimmediate effect on costs for taxpayers in this country. It will cost \nus more to borrow. That means we will have to pay higher taxes in order \nto pay the interest on the national debt. It will affect all credit in \nthis country. It is estimated that the typical homeowner will pay an \nextra $1,000 a year on mortgage costs. The average credit card holder \nwill pay an extra $250 a year in credit card interest. In other words, \nthe interest rates of the Federal Treasury notes affect all the \ninterest rates in this Nation. All of us will pay more, and it will \ncost jobs. It will cost us in our retirement savings. It will affect \neach one of us.\n  Yesterday, the people of Maryland found out another way the failure \nto increase the debt ceiling will have an effect on Maryland taxpayers; \nthat is, the rating houses have indicated that if the Federal credit is \njeopardized, the State of Maryland's AAA bond rating is in jeopardy. \nWhy? Because Maryland depends, as do most States, upon the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Governor O'Malley, as the Presiding Officer knows--when you were \nGovernor of West Virginia, you managed your State well. The credit \nratings you deserved were based upon what you did in your State. That \nis true in Maryland. But Marylanders will find that their credit costs \nwill go up if we don't increase the debt ceiling by August 2. We are \nall in this. We should never be this close. We should make sure we \nincrease the debt ceiling by August 2.\n  Yes, I do hope we use this as an opportunity to get our spending and \nour budget in order. We need to manage our deficit. We all understand \nthat. We have to bring our debt under proper management.\n  I have taken the floor before to sort of go over how we got here. I \nam not going to do that today, but I am here to tell you that the \nDemocrats in the Senate, under Senator Conrad, have come in with a \nproposal that we think is well-balanced, that has more deficit \nreduction, quite frankly, than any plan that is out there. It is \ncomprehensive, and it will allow us to be able to continue to grow our \neconomy because the best thing we can do for our deficit is to create \nmore jobs. The Conrad Democratic budget does that by investing in \neducation, by investing in innovation and in infrastructure.\n\n  It also recognizes we have to bring the deficit under control. It \nprotects Medicare and Medicaid because we know those programs are \nimportant for our seniors and important for our economy. So we protect \nhigh-priority programs and include more deficit reduction by having a \nbalanced approach. That is what we should do in addition to raising the \ndebt ceiling. We should have a comprehensive approach.\n  Let me cite some of the numbers of what the Conrad budget does. It \nbrings spending down to 22 percent. I heard some of my colleagues talk \nabout the historical averages. Twenty-two percent of our economy would \nbe the same spending amount, on average, we had when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident. I think most of us would agree the Reagan years were \ncertainly conservative in terms of government spending. That would \nbring down the percentages, despite the demographic changes in this \ncountry. I think that is quite an accomplishment.\n  The revenues would be equal to what the revenues were as a percentage \nof our economy when Bill Clinton was President of the United States and \nwhen we had the strongest economic growth and the greatest job growth \nin modern history. So these are responsible programs.\n  It also, by the way, says to our government workers, who should not \nbe used as scapegoats and who are doing incredible work under difficult \ncircumstances and are being asked to do more with less since they have \nalready made the sacrifice with a 2-year pay freeze--the Conrad \nDemocratic budget says enough is enough and doesn't ask our Federal \nworkers to make additional sacrifices beyond the 2-year pay freeze they \nhave already been subjected to.\n  I know there are other efforts and I hope we will continue those \nefforts. I have spoken before about the Bowles-Simpson approach, and we \nhave the bipartisan group working. That is how we should proceed. But, \nquite frankly, this cut, cap, and balance is not a bipartisan effort; \nit is an extreme effort by Republicans to bring forward a budget that \nis even more severe and more radical than the Ryan budget. I call it \ncut, cap, and kill when it comes to Medicare.\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n  Why do I say that? I have taken the floor regarding the Republican \nRyan budget to point out the impact on the Medicare system, which would \nbe to increase the costs, on average, to our seniors, when it is fully \nimplemented, by an additional $6,500 to pay for health care. I know the \nPresiding Officer has been through West Virginia and I have been \nthrough Maryland and I know our seniors are already paying too much for \nhealth care. They cannot afford another $6,500 a year for their health \ncare. We should be looking at reducing their health care costs, not \nincreasing them.\n  But the cut, cap, and balance approach would go even beyond that. It \nis estimated there would be another $2,500 in costs on top of the \n$6,500, so $9,000 of additional costs, when fully implemented, to our \nseniors for health care. That is cut, cap, and kill on Medicare, and I \ndon't think any one of us wants to be responsible for that.\n  I heard my colleagues talk about job growth, and we are all for job \ngrowth. The cut, cap, and balance bill is estimated to cost us hundreds \nof thousands of private sector jobs.\n  Why do we say that? Well, the objective is not very subtle. The \nobjective, as the Heritage Foundation has said--and this was just sent \nout to us--this would cut the size of the Federal Government by about \nhalf within 25 years. Are we going to tell our students they can do \nwithout half of their Pell grants? Yesterday, I joined students from \naround the Nation and presidents of colleges to talk about the \nimportance of the Pell grant. At Morgan State University in Maryland \nand the University of Maryland Eastern Shore--both historically Black \ncolleges and universities, in which 80 percent of their student body is \nmade up of minority students--50 percent depend upon Pell grants. Half \nof that number could not be there without Pell grants. We are saying it \nis OK to cut the Pell grants in half? No, it is not OK.\n  Are we going to tell our seniors we are going to cut Social Security \nin half?\n  Are we going to tell those people who need unemployment insurance \nthey are going to get 50 percent? It is not sustainable.\n  I heard my colleagues talk about predictability. Well, the cut, cap, \nand balance bill is not going to be sustained. It is a radical \napproach. We can do better.\n  Quite frankly, David Brooks, the conservative columnist, said it \nbest. I will quote what he said about where the Republicans, \nparticularly in the House, are trying to lead this Nation. David Brooks \nwrote:\n\n     . . . the Republican Party may no longer be a normal party. \n     Over the past few years, it has been infected by a faction \n     that is more of a psychological protest than a practical, \n     governing alternative.\n       The members of this movement do not accept the logic of \n     compromise, no matter how sweet the terms. If you ask them to \n     raise taxes by an inch in order to cut government by a foot, \n     they will say no. If you ask them to raise taxes by an inch \n     to cut government by a yard, they will still say no.\n\n  That is from David Brooks, the conservative columnist.\n  We need to have the system work. We need Democrats and Republicans \nworking together. We need a budget plan that is predictable, that gets \nour budget under control, that allows America to create the jobs we \nneed, and that invests in education, innovation, and infrastructure so \nAmerica can continue to lead the world in economic growth. That is what \nwe need to do. It starts by raising the debt limit so America does not \ndefault on its obligations and for us to work in a bipartisan manner to \ndevelop a budget plan that gets the debt under control but allows \nAmerica to live up to its commitments to our seniors, to our students, \nand to create the job opportunities for tomorrow.\n  That is what we need to do, and that is what this Senator is prepared \nto do.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, our country is 2 weeks away from a \ndeadline date, and this deadline is approaching because of Washington's \nconstant inaction. To me, this deadline has to do with our national \ndebt. The President, on the other hand, says it has to do with our debt \nlimit, the amount of money we are allowed by law to borrow.\n  I believe it has to do with the amount of money we have already \nborrowed and the amount of money they want to continue to borrow. I \nbelieve as Americans we can do better. I believe as Americans we must \ndo better. Our country needs for us to act.\n  The President has repeatedly said we have to deal with this issue \nnow. Last week he asked the most fundamental question. He said: If not \nnow, when? The clock is ticking.\n  We got a wake-up call from Medicare not too long ago when we found \nout that it will be bankrupt 5 years sooner than they initially \nthought, just over a decade from now. As a doctor who has practiced \nmedicine a long time, I will tell you we have to strengthen Medicare. \nWe know in 25 years the same will happen to Social Security. Unlike our \ndebt limit which Congress can legislate away, strengthening Medicare, \nsaving Social Security, that cannot simply be legislated away. We have \nto act now to prevent these programs from failing not just people on \nthose programs today but also future generations.\n  The President has observed that we are in the eleventh hour when it \ncomes to our debt ceiling, and the only clear path to raise the debt \nceiling that has passed either House of Congress is the proposal that \npassed the House of Representatives last night, the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act. This act would only raise the debt ceiling if we put our \ncountry on the fast track back to fiscal sanity. That is where we need \nto be, on the track to fiscal sanity. It is an approach the American \npeople will tell us we need now more than ever.\n  Our creditors are getting restive. This week Fitch credit ratings \nwarned if the United States does not take action to avoid default, we \ncould lose our AAA credit rating.\n  Standard & Poor's has already warned that unless we cut our budget, \nour credit rating could be at risk. Wasteful Washington spending has \nalready saddled our children with over $14 trillion of debt. If we \ndefault, this spending may also force them to pay punishingly high \ninterest rates that will drain American dollars from our already \nsluggish economy.\n  I believe we will not default. We are already paying $6,000 a second \non interest alone on our debt. For those of us with children, we know \nwhat this impact is going to be on them years and years into the \nfuture. Well, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act would put us on the path to \nresolving the issue by cutting spending immediately, by capping \nspending in the future, and by forcing--finally forcing--Washington to \nlive within its means. This is the sort of law that the country needs \nand that the President should actually welcome.\n  What has the President done? Well, he has threatened to veto this \nlaw, he says, if it crosses his desk. The President has threatened to \nveto the only plan that actually solves the problem that has passed \neither House of Congress.\n  Why? Well, the administration emphasizes ``public opinion'' as their \nreason for opposing the hard choices required by our debt crisis. But \nyet the President said they are opposed to a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. Well, in a recent Mason Dixon poll, 65 \npercent of Americans say they support a balanced budget constitutional \namendment. Where is that respect the President talks about for public \nopinion?\n  Finally, the administration has hidden behind catch phrases rather \nthan debate the merits of cut, cap, and balance. They refer to it by a \ndifferent name. Well, when I hear the White House spokesman talk about \ncut, cap and balance in a different way, I say: How is that ducking the \nissue to confront both our spending problem and the debt ceiling head \non? That is not\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\nducking the issue; that is facing the issue.\n  When the President's spokesman talks about dodging the issue, I will \nsay: How is it a dodge to support commonsense solutions to our spending \naddiction, such as a balanced budget amendment?\n  Then he used the phrase about dismantling. I say: How does stopping \nour government from going bankrupt count as dismantling? The White \nHouse has even admitted that they do not have a plan. You know what, \nthey do not think they need one. Is that astonishing? The White House--\nthe United States, the most powerful country in the world--the White \nHouse does not think they need a plan at the eleventh hour. The White \nHouse Press Secretary just recently said: Leadership is not proposing a \nplan for the sake of having it voted up or down and likely voted down.\n  The budget that was brought to this floor--the President's budget--\nfailed 0 to 97. Not one Republican voted for it. Not one Democrat voted \nfor it. No one voted for what the President had proposed, no one of \neither party.\n  Perhaps the President ought to propose something new. Holding our \ncountry hostage to irresponsible Washington spending while trying to \nhit the economy with tax hikes is not leadership; it is denying the \nreality. Refusing to put forward a plan to resolve our spending crisis \nis not leadership; it is deferring the consequences.\n  Making the economy worse the way this administration has done for the \npast 2 years is not leadership, and it is hurting our country. The \nPresident's policies have made it worse--made the economy worse, made \nhealth care worse, made energy availability worse, housing worse. The \npolicies have made it worse.\n  This administration can accuse cut, cap, and balance of ducking, and \nthey can accuse it of dodging, and they can accuse it of dismantling, \nbut the strategy coming out of the White House seems to be duck and \ncover. That is what we are seeing.\n  Anyone who knows the math knows this strategy was never acceptable \nbefore, and it is doubly unacceptable now. The amount of debt we owe \nright now is so high that it is hurting employment at home. Experts \ntell us our debt is costing us 1 million jobs. Spending like this makes \nit harder for the private sector to create new jobs, and the \nunemployment numbers that just came out show us at 9.2 percent \nunemployment.\n  With that kind of unemployment, energy prices are high, and people \nare noticing it in the quality of their lives. It is harder for \nAmerican families to buy gas, buy groceries, buy cars, homes, pay \ntuition for their kids to go to college, and it is harder to create \njobs for those kids who will be graduating this year and next year and \nevery year until we get the spending under control.\n  Debt is not just a disaster for the distant future. Our debt is \nirresponsible. Our debt is unsustainable. Even our military leaders \nhave condemned it. ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, has said: The biggest threat to our national security is our \ndebt.\n  The debt is the threat. It is not our enemies who are defeating us, \nit is our spending that is hurting us so very much. It is time for \nAmerica to fight back. That is why I am supporting and have cosponsored \ncut, cap, and balance and will vote for it on the floor of the Senate.\n  This piece of legislation takes commonsense steps to get our country \nout of debt. It will immediately reduce spending by over $100 billion \nas a downpayment on our children's future. It will place a hard cap on \nspending so that it never reaches the unsustainable heights of the past \n2 years. It will send a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the \nAmerican people for ratification, and it will prevent us from \ndefaulting on our debt.\n  Passing this law is the kind of leadership that America deserves; and \nif the President wants to show he understands leadership, he should \nretract his veto threat and support this approach. I absolutely will \nsupport it when it comes to this body.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 568\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to ask support, bipartisan \nsupport, for the Vitter amendment which we will be voting on at 12 \nnoon. This amendment is very simple. It is very straightforward. I \nthink it is important and makes a central point.\n  The amendment says these funds in this bill will not be spent unless \nand until we have a 2012 budget, unless we start with first things \nfirst and decide what the overall budget framework is and then move \nforward with spending, with appropriations bills consistent with that \nbudget. That is all it says. It is simple, straightforward, but it is \nan important point.\n\n  Folks around America, including in the market, are scratching their \nheads. They look at Washington and us and the Congress and the \nPresident and see almost complete dysfunction in the complete lack of a \nbudget, even lack of an attempt to get a budget in place, which is a \nglaring, maybe the top example of that.\n  This isn't just a good, commonsense idea, something every family \ndoes, something every small business does; this also happens to be \nrequired by Federal law.\n  The Federal Budget Act mandates that we pass a budget by April 15 of \nevery year. We have not done that. The House passed a budget. The \nSenate, quite frankly, has not even tried. The Senate Budget Committee \nhas not even met to begin to do that in regular order, through the \nnormal process. In fact, it is worse than that. The Senate didn't even \ntry to do that last year under the same current leadership. So we are \nnow over 800 days and counting, that the Senate, under this leadership, \nhas not even tried to comply with Federal law and adopt a budget.\n  Again, my amendment is very simple. It says first things first. We \nneed a budget so any appropriations bill, any spending is only done \nconsistent with and in the context of that budget.\n  That is the right way to do it. That is the right way to run a \nrailroad. That is what every Louisiana family does in setting its \nplans. That is what every Louisiana business does in setting its plans. \nThat is what the American people and the markets want from us.\n  In the last few weeks, there has been great discussion about Moody's \nand Standard & Poor's and the threats to downgrade U.S. Treasury notes. \nWhat they have been saying is loud and clear. It is not a pure focus on \nthe debt ceiling; it is even a more important focus as well on the \nunderlying issue of spending and debt. They have been saying what every \neconomist also says: We are on a completely unsustainable path in terms \nof spending and debt. They want to see a real change in that--the start \nof a real change, adding up to at least $4 trillion of deficit \nreduction. We need to do that.\n  Step one to doing that is to have a budget. We can't begin to do that \nwithout a budget plan, without an outline. Again, that goes to the \ncore, the simple, fundamental, straightforward and important point of \nthis Vitter amendment. I urge my colleagues to put first things first. \nI urge my colleagues to say we need to start doing our business, \nstarting with a 2012 budget.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, we are wrapping up to a vote that we hope \nwill occur on Senator Vitter's amendment at noon. I will summarize \nwhere we are.\n  We are completing debate on a bill that provides funding for the \nVeterans' Administration and military construction needs. This bill \nbacks up over 22 million veterans who have served our country.\n  The reason I and the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee have \nunanimously supported this bill is, it is\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\nmarked to the House budget resolution, the Paul Ryan budget resolution \nnumber. We cut funding by $1.2 billion in budget authority \ndiscretionary numbers below the President's level. This bill comes in \n$620 million below the 2011 enacted level, and it is even $2.6 million \nbelow the House-passed level just adopted earlier this year, Chairman \nCulberson's bill in the House of Representatives.\n  The Senate voted by a vote of 71 to 26 for cloture to bring up this \nbill. This is the first of the working appropriations bills. I hope \nthere are many others. The legislation is important. People may ask: \nHow did we make the funding cuts to come in at the House level? The \nanswer is, Chairman Johnson and I made some difficult decisions. We cut \n24 separate military construction programs. A list is available in the \nreport that accompanies this bill.\n  We made some very tough calls regarding spending that was proposed \nfor Bahrain, for Germany, and for Korea. There was a worthwhile project \nproposed for the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. They wanted a \nbrandnew building and a courtroom. That was denied outright. Those \ntough decisions--those 24 reductions denying a new Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims building--making those cuts necessary then brought us \nunder the House level, as approved by the Paul Ryan budget.\n  I remind Members the legislation is endorsed by the VFW, AMVETS, \nDisabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America. It had the unanimous support of \nRepublicans in the subcommittee and in the full committee because it \ncomes in at the House budget level. That is why I think it is necessary \nto move forward, especially as we talk about a budget crisis, in which \nchecks may or may not go out. I very much hope they do. I think it is \nan important signal to send that the Paul Ryan-approved budget number, \nwhich is what this bill is at, goes forward, which ensures 2012 \nappropriated funding for our veterans and the military construction \nneeds of our men and women in uniform.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, what is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, the Vitter amendment \npending before the Senate is another attempt to derail the progress we \nhave made in a bipartisan fashion on the MilCon/VA bill.\n  The Senate has voted twice on this issue during consideration of this \nbill. At the outset of debate, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee raised a point of order against consideration of this bill \nwithout prior adoption of a budget resolution. I made a motion to waive \nthat budget point of order and the Senate voted 71 to 26 to cut off \ndebate on the motion to waive. The Senate then agreed to waive the \npoint of order 56 to 40.\n  Now we have an amendment that says none of the critical funding \nprovided in the bill can be obligated in excess of a budget resolution \nthat does not exist. The strictest interpretation of this means the VA \ncan't spend money on benefits for vets, and our military can't \nconstruct new training, housing, or other critical facilities until we \nhave a budget agreement.\n  I don't disagree that it is important to pass a budget, but the \nSenate has overwhelmingly voted to move this bill so as to not delay \nessential funding for our troops and vets while negotiations on the \ndebt ceiling and budget continue.\n  I remind my colleagues this bill is $618 million below the current \nlevel, $1.25 billion below the President's budget request, and $2.6 \nmillion below the House-passed bill. This is a responsible and \nbipartisan bill, and the pending amendment would stop all progress we \nhave made. Therefore, I move to table the amendment No. 568, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, we are going to move to a debate on our \nbudget deficit, particularly on the debt ceiling we face on August 2. \nThe proposal before us was enacted by the House yesterday on a \nvirtually partisan rollcall, with one or two exceptions. The \nRepublicans passed a proposal which they have characterized as cut, \ncap, and balance, and they will bring it to the floor of the Senate for \nconsideration. It tries to project spending targets and cuts in \nspending for the years to come and also to include in the conversation \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  It is interesting, the way they approach it, because the balanced \nbudget amendment is literally an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and those of us who take our oath seriously--and I \nassume that is every Member of Congress and the Senate--understand that \nwe are sworn to uphold this Constitution. In other\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nwords, it is to be treated as the guiding document for our actions as \nMembers of Congress. I have taken that oath many times as a House and \nSenate Member, and I take it seriously.\n  Also, because of that oath, I am skeptical of those who come forward \nand want to amend the Constitution on a regular basis. We have had 27 \namendments to the Constitution. They have been enacted over the course \nof our Nation's history. They address some of the most serious issues \nand most historic moments in our history. I think we should address \nthat document, that Constitution, with an air of humility, a feeling \nthat before we add our words, whatever they may be, to this great \ndocument that has endured for more than 200 years, we should take care \nand be serious about it.\n  I don't often question the motives or the intentions of others who \ncome to the floor, and I won't do it in this instance, but I will say \nthat to have before us, as we will later in the day, a proposal that we \namend the Constitution of the United States by choosing one of three \noptions--and that literally is what we will face, three different \nversions of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and what \nwe will consider here will address choosing one of them. I don't think \nwe were elected to the Senate and sworn to uphold the Constitution to \nbe part of a multiple-choice test about what the next amendment will \nbe. I think we should be much more serious in our undertaking.\n  I will also tell you that I have been here in Congress long enough to \nremember a little bit of history. There once was a President named \nRonald Reagan, and Ronald Reagan, as President of the United States, \nwas in a leadership position of the United States at a critical moment \nin our history, there is no question about it. Some amazing things \noccurred during his administration, but when it came to the budget side \nof things, there was some history made there as well.\n  We are considering the debt ceiling of the United States. What is the \ndebt ceiling of the United States? The debt ceiling of the United \nStates is the authority Congress gives to the President to borrow \nmoney.\n  Each year, the Treasury Secretary will call the President and say: I \nneed additional authority to borrow money. Why does he ask for \nadditional authority? Because Congress--the House and the Senate--sent \nrequests for more spending, and the President has to borrow money to \nhonor those requests. How much does the President have to borrow? In \nthis day and age, about 40 cents for every dollar we spend.\n  So the President has been told that August 2 is the drop-dead date. \nHe needs more authority to borrow money for the actions taken by \nCongress. As an example, many Members of Congress--even some who now \nsay they won't give the President this authority--voted for America to \ngo to war not once but twice, and in so voting, for example, on the war \nin Afghanistan, they are committing the United States of America to \nspending $10 billion a month in defense of our men and women in \nuniform, members of our family who are waging this war. They voted for \nthat.\n  Now President Obama has said to them: The bill is coming in for the \nwar in Afghanistan, and I have to borrow money to pay for it. These \nsame Members of Congress--the House and Senate--who voted for the war \nin Afghanistan are now saying: We won't pay the bills. We won't extend \nthe debt ceiling. We won't allow you, Mr. President, to borrow the \nmoney to sustain our military forces in Afghanistan.\n  That is literally what we are talking about here in this debate. The \nAmerican people are starting to come to understand because when you \nfirst ask a person, do you want to extend the debt ceiling, the obvious \nanswer is, no, are you crazy, Senator? Why would I want more debt in \nthis country? We need less debt, not more. Don't you get it?\n  Understandably, that is the public reaction. But when you go to the \npoint of explaining that this is to pay for debts we have already \nincurred--and it is not just to wage war; it is a debt incurred to pay \nfor Medicare. We said to 65-year-olds across America: You get a health \ninsurance plan called Medicare, and it will be there when you need it. \nWhen you go to the hospital and turn in your bills, we will pay that \ndoctor and we will pay that hospital. And we borrowed money to do it.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Would the assistant majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the Senator's comments about where we \nwere. About 10 years ago, we had a budget surplus in this country, as \nyou recall. We had a number of years of quarter after quarter of \neconomic growth, and we know that when you have economic growth, \nobviously the budget gets in a better situation. But then it was the \ntax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that I believe the Senator opposed, as I did \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives, that went overwhelmingly to \nthe wealthiest taxpayers; and then the two wars the Senator talked \nabout that the people enthusiastically--some, not the Senator--voted \nfor but didn't see a reason to pay for them; and then this Medicare \nbill, which was basically a bailout to the insurance and drug companies \nin the name of privatizing Medicare, and we are in a situation now \nwhere we are simply trying to pay the bills.\n  I appreciate the Senator's thoughts and comments about where that \ntakes us. It seems to me it is not like raising your credit card debt \nlimits. These are obligations we have, and we have to be responsible \nelected officials, as we would as responsible citizens, and pay the \ndebts and the obligations we have incurred as a nation, correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. And I would say to the Senator from Ohio \nthat when you look back in history, since 1939 when we had this debt \nceiling, President after President has extended the debt ceiling \nbecause the cost of government--the debt of the United States--has \ngenerally gone up in most administrations.\n  The record holder for extending the debt ceiling in U.S. history \nsince 1939: President Ronald Reagan, on 18 different occasions during \nan 8-year period of time, extended the debt ceiling. During his \nadministration, we tripled our national debt, and so we needed to keep \nborrowing. So to say this debt ceiling extension is the product of a \nDemocratic President is to misstate the case. Every President has faced \nit. Ronald Reagan asked for those debt ceiling extensions more than any \nother President. When it comes to incurring debt in 8 years in office, \nRonald Reagan has the record for tripling the national debt, and coming \nin second is George W. Bush for doubling the national debt while he was \nin office and asking on seven different occasions to extend the debt \nceiling.\n  The point I am making is that President Obama has asked to extend the \ndebt ceiling, and there is ample history--some 89 different times--that \nit has been done, and it is done to pay for obligations we have already \nmade, debts we have already incurred.\n  Now what happens if we don't extend the debt ceiling? Well, what \nwould happen if the Durbin family of Springfield, IL, did not make our \nmortgage payment on our home this month? Not good. We are likely to get \na call from the bank at some point saying: You probably overlooked it, \nbut there was a mortgage payment due. And if you said: We are just not \ngoing to pay it, we are not going to continue to borrow money from your \nbank, they would say there are consequences. And the same thing is true \nif you don't extend the debt ceiling.\n  If we don't extend the debt ceiling of the United States and \nauthorize the President to borrow money to meet our obligations, two \nthings will happen. The credit report of the United States of America \nis not going to look good the next day. The same thing is true for \nindividuals and families: If you don't pay your bills, your credit \nreport doesn't look so hot. What is the difference? For the United \nStates of America, it means the AAA credit rating we have enjoyed \nthroughout our history will be in danger. It means the interest rates \ncharged to the United States for our own debt will go up and interest \nrates across the economy will go up, affecting every family and \nbusiness in America that borrows money, which would be most families \nand businesses.\n  Raising interest rates with this high rate of unemployment is exactly \nthe wrong thing to do. Every single day, the Federal Reserve, under Ben \nBernanke and his Board of Governors,\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nsits down and tries to figure out a way to make interest rates low so \nthe economy will grow and jobs will be created. If we have a self-\ninflicted wound of not increasing the debt ceiling, the net result will \nbe a higher interest rate on our government and higher interest rates \non families and businesses. A 1-percent increase--1-percent increase--\nin the interest rate paid by our government on its debt costs us $130 \nbillion a year--1 percent.\n\n  We are running the risk, by missing the deadline of August 2, of \nraising that interest rate, killing jobs, making it more difficult for \nbusinesses to expand, and increasing the deficit. Can we imagine three \nworse outcomes at this moment in our history?\n  So when Members of the Senate and the House come and make these pious \npronouncements of ``I am never going to vote for an extension of the \ndebt ceiling,'' they are jeopardizing our economic recovery and the \ndebt we face.\n  Some of them have said: I will tell you what. I will vote for a debt \nceiling if we can amend the Constitution and put in a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Throughout my time of service in the House and the Senate, I have \nnever--underline ``never''--voted for a balanced budget amendment and \nhere is the reason: We don't need the Constitution to tell us what to \ndo. We know what we need to do. We should have the will to do it. For \nthose who have been guilty of voting for all this spending and now want \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, it reminds me of the \nperson who says: I will not promise I will not steal again, but I will \nvote for the Ten Commandments. Well, great. Wouldn't it be better if \nthey changed their conduct and the way they acted? Wouldn't it be \nbetter if Congress dealt with this budget deficit forthrightly? And we \ncan.\n  For those who say we don't have a very good track record, they are \nright. But efforts are underway on the part of what is known as the \nGroup of 6, which is expanding in size, which is trying to, on a \nbipartisan basis--Democrats and Republicans--come up with a way through \nthis budget deficit problem. It is not easy. We have been at it for \nmore than 6 months. We have produced a plan which is now being \ncarefully scrutinized and will be worked on, I am sure, for a long time \nto come, but it moves us in the direction of $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction. It does it by putting everything on the table--everything--\nincluding spending cuts, entitlement programs, and revenue.\n  Spending cuts are easy compared to the other two--easier for us, I \nmight add, because they generally involve future spending, and we make \nthe reductions thinking, perhaps, it will not have the negative impact \nin the future that some imagine.\n  When it comes to the entitlement programs, I think we deal with a \ndifferent mindset when it comes to the American people. I believe \nSocial Security and Medicare have become even more important to \nAmerican families than they were 25 years ago because of the \nvulnerability of families today. Many families planned for their \nretirement and saved some money and maybe they had a pension plan at \nwork and then they had Social Security. Well, over the years, perhaps \nthe savings took a hit when the stock market went down some 30 percent \na few years ago. Many of the pension plans didn't survive corporate \nrestructuring or bankruptcy, and Social Security was the last game in \ntown for a lot of the people retiring.\n  So when we talk about changing Social Security, people all across \nAmerica--40 million or 50 million Americans--perk up and say: Senator, \nwhat do you have in mind because we are counting on it and we don't \nwant you to mess it up.\n  Here is what I can say about Social Security. Untouched, with no \nchanges--no changes--Social Security will make every promised payment \nwith a cost-of-living adjustment for 25 years--25 years. That is pretty \ngood. There isn't another program in government that can say the same. \nBut what happens at the end of 25 years? Then the trouble starts. We \nstart running out of money and reducing Social Security payments 22 \npercent. About one-fifth--or a little more--of the payment a person is \nreceiving today would disappear in 2 years. So what we are talking \nabout in all the deficit conversations is to find ways to extend the \nlife and solvency of Social Security.\n  There are ways to do it. We have talked about a variety of different \nways to do it. Any savings in Social Security will stay in Social \nSecurity. It is similar to Las Vegas. We are going to make sure the \nsavings we put in Social Security will be reinvested in the program to \nmake it stronger longer.\n  I also want the program to be fair--we all do--in terms of \nbeneficiaries, particularly the most vulnerable beneficiaries. About 20 \npercent of Social Security beneficiaries--the lowest 20 percent--are \nbelow the poverty line, even after they get the Social Security check. \nWe need to change that. We shouldn't allow that to happen. These are \nmainly elderly people who, with the helping hands of our government and \nSocial Security, should be lifted above the poverty level.\n  Medicare is much the same. If we don't deal with Medicare, the \nincreasing cost of health care is going to cause that program to run \ninto trouble. What we need to do is to make certain at the end we \nprotect the benefits under Medicare but find ways to reduce the cost. \nWe have to reward value rather than volume when it comes to medical \ntreatment, and we have to keep our promise to the Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  There have been proposals made. One was made by the House Republicans \nin their budget, the so-called Paul Ryan budget, which would have \ndramatically changed Medicare. Out-of-pocket expenditures by senior \ncitizens would have more than doubled to $6,000 a year. So $500 a \nmonth, by a person who is retired, can be a hardship, if not an \nimpossibility. Even worse, the House Republican budget would have taken \nMedicare as we know it and turned it upside down and said: In the \nfuture, under the House Republican plan, Medicare is going to be \nmanaged in the tender loving arms of private health insurance \ncompanies. I don't think most Americans feel a sense of confidence or \nrelief to hear that.\n  So as we begin this debate this afternoon on the so-called cut, cap, \nand balance, the point I wish to make is this: We should not be \nconsidering a plan which does not put in specific language a balanced \nbudget amendment but asks Members of the Senate to vote for a multiple \nchoice test as to what the next amendment to the Constitution will look \nlike. Secondly, we should carefully scrutinize every word of that \namendment. Those who have say they are poorly drafted and have no place \nin the most important document in America. Third, let's accept the \nresponsibility to do what we were elected to do--to reduce spending, to \nbring this budget to balance, and to do it in a sensible and humane \nway. The notion we would somehow amend our Constitution and wait for \nthree-fourths of the States to ratify it is, in my mind, not \nresponsible.\n  I am going to oppose this. I am not going to oppose efforts to reduce \nour deficit, but I am going to oppose this notion that somehow a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution is going to be our \nsalvation. As the old Pogo cartoon used to say: We have met the enemy \nand they are us.\n  We have to do this ourselves--Members of the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if there was ever a time in the modern \nhistory of America for the American people to become engaged in what is \ngoing on here in Washington, now is that time. Decisions are being made \nas we speak which will impact not only our generation but the lives of \nour children and our grandchildren for decades to come. I fear very \nmuch that the decisions being contemplated are not good decisions, are \nnot fair decisions.\n  Right now, there is a lot of discussion about two things: No. 1, the \nimportance of the United States not defaulting for the first time in \nour history on our debts--I think there is increased\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nunderstanding that would be a disaster for the American economy, that \nwould be a disaster for the world's economy, and we should not do \nthat--but, secondly, there is increased discussion now on long-term \ndeficit reduction, how we address the crisis we face today of a record-\nbreaking deficit of $1.4 trillion and a $14 trillion-plus national \ndebt--a debt, by the way, that was caused by two unpaid-for wars, huge \ntax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, a Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program written by the insurance companies, and the \nlack of revenues coming in because of a recession caused by the greed \nand recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.\n  Be that as it may, regardless of how we got to where we are right \nnow, there are efforts to develop long-term deficit reduction plans. \nOne of them has to do with a so-called Gang of 6. While we do not know \nall of the details of that proposal--in fact, we never will because a \nlot of that proposal boots the issue to committees, such as the Finance \nCommittee, that have to work out the details, and no one can know what \nthose details will be at this time--I think it is fair to say that \nSenator Coburn, Senator Crapo, and Senator Chambliss deserve a word of \ncongratulations. Clearly, they have won this debate in a very \nsignificant way. My guess is they will probably get 80 or 90 percent of \nwhat they wanted, and in this town that is quite an achievement. They \nhave stood firm in their desire to represent the wealthy and the \npowerful and multinational corporations. They have threatened. They \nhave been very smart in a number of ways. They have been determined. \nAnd at the end of the day, they will get 80 or 90 percent of what they \nwant.\n  That is their victory, and I congratulate them on their victory. \nUnfortunately, their victory will be a disaster for working families in \nthis country, for the elderly, for the sick, for the children, and for \nlow-income people.\n  I did want to mention, based on the limited information we have--and \nas I get more information, I will be on the floor more often, but I \nthink it is important to at least highlight some of what is in this so-\ncalled Gang of 6 that the corporate media, among others, is enthralled \nabout.\n  Some may remember that for a number of years leading Democrats said: \nWe will do everything we can to protect Social Security, that Social \nSecurity has been an extraordinary success in our country, that for 75 \nyears, with such volatility in the economy, Social Security has paid \nout every nickel owed to every eligible American.\n  I have heard Democrats say Social Security has nothing to do with the \ndeficit. And that is right because Social Security is funded by the \npayroll tax, not by the U.S. Treasury. Social Security has a $2.6 \ntrillion surplus today and can pay out every benefit owed to every \neligible American for the next 25 years. An enormously popular program, \npoll after poll from the American people says: Do not cut Social \nSecurity.\n  Two-and-a-half years ago, when Barack Obama--then Senator from \nIllinois--ran for President of the United States, he made it very \nclear, if you voted for him, no cuts in Social Security. Yet what \nSenators Coburn, Crapo, and Chambliss have managed to do in the Gang of \n6 is reach an agreement where there will be major cuts in Social \nSecurity.\n  Do not let anybody kid you about this being some minor thing. It is \nnot. What we are talking about is that under this so-called Gang of 6 \nproposal, Social Security cuts would go into effect by the year 2012--\nvirtually immediately. What that means is that 10 years from now, the \ntypical 75-year-old person will see their Social Security benefits cut \nby $560 a year, and the average 85-year-old will see a cut of $1,000 a \nyear.\n  For some people here in Washington--maybe the big lobbyists who make \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year--$560 a year or $1,000 a year \nmay not seem like a lot of money. But if you are a senior trying to get \nby on $14,000, $15,000, $18,000 a year, and you are 85 years old--the \nend of your life, you are totally vulnerable, you are sick--a $1,000-a-\nyear cut in what you otherwise would have received is a major blow.\n  So I congratulate Senator Coburn, Senator Crapo, and Senator \nChambliss for doing what President Obama said would not happen under \nhis watch, what the Democrats have said would not happen under their \nwatch: major cuts in Social Security.\n  But it is not just Social Security. We have 50 million Americans \ntoday who have no health insurance at all. Under the Gang of 6 \nproposal, there will be cuts in Medicare over a 10-year period of \nalmost $300 billion. There will be massive cuts in Medicaid and other \nhealth care programs.\n  There will be caps on spending, which means there will be major cuts \nin education. If you are a working-class family, hoping you are going \nto be able to send your kid to college, and that you will be eligible \nfor a Pell grant, think twice about that because that Pell grant may \nnot be there.\n  If you are a senior who relies on a nutrition program, that nutrition \nprogram may not be there. If you think it is a good idea that we \nenforce clean air and clean water provisions so our kids can be \nhealthy, those provisions may not be there because there will be major \ncuts in environmental protection.\n  I have heard some people say: Well, all that is not so good, but at \nleast finally our Republican friends are saying we need revenue and we \nare going to raise $1 trillion in revenue.\n  Well, Mr. President, let me ask you this. If you read the outline of \nthe Gang of 6 proposal, which is admittedly vague--I think they would \nacknowledge that; they do not have all of the details--there are very \nclear provisions making sure we are going to make massive cuts in \nprograms for working families, for the elderly, for the children. Those \ncuts are written in black and white.\n  What about the revenue? Well, it is kind of vague--kind of vague. The \nprojection is that maybe we will raise over a 10-year period $1 \ntrillion in revenue. Where is that coming from? Is it necessarily going \nto come from the wealthiest people in this country? Is it going to come \nfrom large corporations that are enjoying huge tax breaks? That is not \nclear at all.\n  What happens if we do not reach that revenue of $1 trillion? What \nmechanism is in place to say it happens? That mechanism, in fact, does \nnot exist. What we do know--and, in fairness, I think the authors of \nthis proposal would acknowledge not all the details are out there, but \ncertainly I want middle-class families to understand when we talk about \nincreased revenues, do you know where that may come from? It may come \nfrom cutbacks in the home mortgage interest deduction program, which is \nso very important to millions and millions of families. It may mean if \nyou have a health care program today, that health care program may be \ntaxed. That is a way to raise revenue. It may be that there will be \nincreased taxes on your retirement programs, your IRAs, your 401(k)s. \nBut we do not have the details for that. All we have is some kind of \nvague promise that we are going to raise $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. There is no enforcement mechanism and no clarity as to where \nthat revenue will come from.\n  So I think it is terribly important that the American people become \nengaged in this debate, which will have a huge impact not only on them, \nbut on their parents and on their children. I believe very strongly \nwhat the American people must fight for is not a big deal or a small \ndeal but a fair deal.\n  At a time when the wealthiest people in this country are doing \nphenomenally well--their effective tax rate is the lowest on record--at \na time when the top 400 individuals in this country own more wealth \nthan 150 million Americans, at a time when corporate profits are \nsoaring, and in many instances these same corporations pay nothing in \ntaxes, at a time when we have tripled military spending since 1997, \nthere are fair ways to move toward deficit reduction which do not slash \nprograms that working families and children and the elderly desperately \ndepend upon.\n  I believe the issue we are dealing with is of enormous consequence. \nIt is clear our Republican friends have succeeded, and I congratulate \nthem on getting 80, 90 percent of what they wanted.\n  I want people to think back 3 years ago--just 3 years ago--to think \nthat there would be a serious proposal on the floor of the Senate with \nall of these\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\ndevastating cuts. I think very few people would have thought that \npossible. So I congratulate my Republican colleagues for their apparent \nvictory. But this Senator is going to fight back. I was not elected to \nthe Senate to make devastating cuts in Social Security, in Medicare, in \nMedicaid, in children's programs, while I lower tax rates for the \nwealthiest people in this country. That is not what I was elected to \ndo, and I do not intend to do that.\n  So I hope the American people get engaged in this issue, stand, and \ndemand that the Congress pass a fair and responsible deficit reduction \nprogram, not what we are talking about today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4695-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MILCON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \noppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma which would \nundo decades of policies on how we treat veterans who are suffering \nfrom diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure. That violates the \npromise we have made to a generation of veterans. The legacy of Agent \nOrange exposure among Vietnam veterans is one of tragedy, roadblocks, \nneglect, pain, and then more roadblocks. It is the legacy of our \nmilitary spraying millions of gallons of poisonous herbicide \nindiscriminately, without any consequences or without any \nrepercussions.\n  At the time of the Vietnam war--and for far too long after it--the \nU.S. Government neglected to track Agent Orange exposures. Then, in the \ndecades following the war, our government stonewalled veterans who \ndeveloped horrible ailments of all kinds from those exposures.\n  To further compound the problem, for decades our government also \nfailed to fund any research on Agent Orange and any other toxins that \nVietnam veterans were exposed to. Those mistakes, those decades of \nneglect, have a cost. It is a cost to the veterans and their loved \nones, a cost to the government that sent them to war, and a cost to all \nof us as Americans. It is a cost that, even in difficult budget times, \neven with our backs against the wall, we cannot walk away from.\n  I am not here to question any Senator's commitment to our veterans, \nbut what I am here to do is to question the standard by which this \namendment says they should be treated. This amendment that was offered \nsays we should change the standard by which we have judged Agent Orange \ncases for two decades.\n  Currently, Vietnam veterans are presumed to be service-connected when \nthe VA Secretary determines that a positive association exists between \nexposure to Agent Orange and a certain disease. One of the reasons \nCongress chose that mechanism is because it was impossible for these \nveterans to prove their exposure to Agent Orange caused their cancers \nor other diseases. These veterans were exposed decades ago. They don't \nknow where exactly they were exposed or how much they inhaled. However, \nunder the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, Vietnam veterans \nwould be asked to now prove the impossible. They would be asked to \nprove they would never have gotten cancer or heart disease or any other \ndisease or condition if not for Agent Orange.\n  Vietnam veterans who have diabetes or prostate cancer or lung cancer \nor blood-borne diseases would be denied care and benefits under this \namendment. Not only would this be a new hurdle Vietnam veterans could \nnever overcome, it would change the rules midstream. It would literally \ntreat Vietnam veterans whose diseases have already been presumptively \nservice-connected different than those whose diseases have not yet been \npositively associated with Agent Orange exposure.\n  I will not deny that compensation for exposure is a difficult issue \nand one that we continually have to look at. We have grappled with this \nissue in relation to Vietnam veterans and exposure to Agent Orange. \nToday we continue to deal with this issue as Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans come home with illnesses potentially associated with their \nexposure to toxins released from burn pits or other environmental \nexposure.\n  Ultimately, we have to look at the facts with reason and compassion \nand weigh the years of our military's failure to track these exposures, \nthe inevitable existence of uncertainty, and the word of our veterans. \nThat is exactly what we have to do.\n  On the one hand, we have thousands of veterans who have come forward \nand believe their cancers and ailments were caused by an exposure to a \nknown killer. We have studies that show veterans who were exposed to \nAgent Orange are more likely to have heart disease, cancer, or other \nconditions. We have the Institute of Medicine that has recommended \ngiving veterans the benefit of the doubt, and we have the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs who has decided that we must move forward to provide \ncompensation to presumptively service-connected veterans exposed to \nAgent Orange for cancer and heart disease.\n  On the other hand, we may have a compelling fiscal case, but the \nSenator from Oklahoma hasn't presented one shred of evidence that Agent \nOrange does not cause heart disease, cancer, or any other condition. \nWhat has been presented is an amendment that asks veterans to wait, \nwait, wait until there is more scientific evidence.\n  Well, these veterans have been waiting for 40 years. How much longer \nshould they wait?\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs decided that the time for waiting \nwas over. I ask that we respect and support this decision, and that we \nalso remember that even in the midst of this whirlwind debt and deficit \ndebate, we have made a promise to veterans, one that doesn't go away.\n  Vietnam veterans have paid enough for that war. They should not end \nup paying for our debt. It is us who owe them a debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHatch and I be allowed to participate in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4695-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4695-S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAXING AND SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, many of our good colleagues like to \nsuggest our Nation has historic deficits because the American people \nare not taxed enough. Some claim the so-called Bush tax cuts are the \nculprit, but the numbers tell a different story. In fact, these tax \ncuts were fully implemented in 2003. Annual revenues have increased \nsteadily from $1.782 trillion to $2.524 trillion in 2008, and they \nincrease every year, for an increase of more than 40 percent. That is \ndouble the rate of inflation after the tax cuts took effect.\n  In fact, since the recession of 2008 and the weakest economic \nrecovery in modern history, revenue has now declined. That makes sense. \nWith high unemployment there are fewer taxpayers and, naturally, \nrevenue declines.\n  Going forward, however, the CBO projects revenue as a share of the \nGDP will rise to 18.4 percentage points of GDP by 2021. That is \nassuming extension, not elimination, of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nreductions. Revenue is therefore projected to return to its historic \n18.4 percent average.\n  It would seem, then, that the American people are already taxed \nenough to finance a government whose spending has grown wildly out of \ncontrol. The real problem is, while revenue will return to its historic \naverage, if nothing is done to slow spending, annual outlays will \nincrease from $3.7 trillion today to $5.7 trillion by 2021, for an \nincrease of more than 50 percent. As a share of GDP, spending will \nremain, on average, above 23 percent of GDP. That is nearly 3 \npercentage points above the historic average.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I could not agree more with the Senator's \npoint on the real driver of our deficit and debt. We have this debt \nbecause government is spending too much. But this is not a matter of \npersonal preference; this is an indisputable and empirically verifiable \nfact. The systemic\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nproblem this country faces is too much spending, not too little tax \nrevenue.\n  I understand our friends on the other side of the aisle are in a \ntough spot. They know this, but their left wing base refuses any \nchanges to the spending programs driving these deficits and debt. They \ndon't want to scare off middle-class Americans by recommending the tax \nincreases necessary to close the gap without major changes for spending \nprograms.\n  When it comes to offering any real plans, they have resorted to \nburying their heads in the sand, as indicated on this photo. They \nchoose to ignore the real problem. They hope their friends in the media \ndo the same thing--ignore the fact that they are ignoring the problem. \nAs you can see from this chart, the problem is spending.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Our friends on the other side of the aisle are almost \nexclusively focused on hitting up the taxpayer for more revenue.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. They are talking about revenue, but the tax \nincreases they are recommending are more distracting than illuminating. \nI think it is fair to say that all of the talk by the President and his \ncongressional allies about corporate jets and yachts is a classic red \nherring. On this chart, it indicates this:\n\n       The name of this fallacy comes from the sport of fox \n     hunting in which a dried, smoked herring, which is red in \n     color, is dragged across the trail of the fox to throw the \n     hounds off the scent. Thus, a ``red herring'' argument is one \n     which distracts the audience from the issue in question \n     through the introduction of some irrelevancy.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, we use this turn of phrase all the time, but I am \nafraid it is worth discussing how politicians use it.\n  Mr. HATCH. As you can see, that is what they are doing. I am glad the \nSenator brought this up. As I just read, my research found that the \nterm ``red herring'' comes from the sport of fox hunting. Again, a red \nherring argument is one that distracts the audience from the issue in \nquestion through the introduction of some relevancy.\n  In my view, all of these tax issues that President Obama and those on \nthe other side of the aisle are discussing are red herrings. They want \nto distract Americans from the real driver of our deficits and debt and \nthe real choices Democrats have to but are refusing to make.\n\n  Let me walk through some examples. If we were to raise the \ndepreciable life on corporate Jets from 5 years to 7 years, as the \nDemocrats propose, it would yield us $3.1 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How many days of debt reduction over that 10-year \nperiod would a $3 billion savings or increase in taxes amount to?\n  Mr. HATCH. To hear the President talk, you would think this is the \nkey to balancing our budget. We all know he is overstating the case. It \nwould provide only a month of debt reduction is about all it would do? \nGiven its essential role in his deficit reduction proposals, you would \nhope so. But I am sorry to disappoint my friend from Alabama, because, \naccording to our calculations, that amount equates to only 20 hours and \n23 minutes of the debt over the next 10 years. Unfortunately, that \ndoesn't even begin to solve the problem. Of course, as you can see \nhere, $13 trillion, the Obama debt; there would be $3.1 billion over \ntime with the corporate jet taxes; and remaining above the debt--\nassuming they didn't spend more, which is an assumption you can't \nmake--would be $12.9 trillion. Is the problem solved? Of course not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, let me say I appreciate the work of the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, a long-time member of that committee. \nIt seems to me pretty clear that the President's budget he submitted \nearlier this year--which I have to say was voted down 97 to 0 in the \nSenate--would have increased the deficit over 10 years by $13 trillion. \nHe has also suggested his plan to increase taxes on corporate jets by \n$3 billion would somehow make a difference in that. I think Senator \nHatch is right, that is not accurate.\n  How about other proposals we hear from the Democratic side, such as \ncutting back mortgage interest deduction for yachts used for second \nhomes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, in other words, by our calculations, the savings \nfrom this proposal would be even more meager. If Congress enacted this \nchange, we could cover the debt from the Obama budget for all of 15 \nhours and 47 minutes. Again, this is not solving the problems of the \nburdensome debt the President is piling on.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is shocking to see how small those numbers are, and \nwe aren't hearing that in the press and in the national discussions. \nFrom the talk we have heard about these proposals, you would think they \nwould yield more than 2 days of debt reduction over 10 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. You would think so. But the other 3,651 days of debt under \nthe 10-year Obama budget would not even be touched.\n  There is a third red herring that has been thrown out there. Maybe \nthat one closes the gap. We have all heard the President talk about \nhitting American oil companies by reducing or eliminating domestic \nenergy incentives. This is a real priority of his and of congressional \nDemocrats.\n  We had a cloture vote on a bill by our friend from New Jersey to \nextract $21 billion in revenue from U.S. oil companies. The Finance \nCommittee had a hearing where the other side touted the benefits of \nthis tax increase by grilling the CEOs of the top five oil companies. \nIf you listened to my friends on the other side, one would think an \nadditional $21 billion would solve all our fiscal problems. Their \nrhetoric suggests this is the only thing standing between more money to \nsend kids to college and provide school lunches.\n  But I wonder if my friend from Alabama might put into perspective how \nmuch of the 10 years of debt under the President's budget this proposal \nwould cover.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, with $13 trillion--that is 13 thousand billion--\n$21 billion won't amount to much.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, here is how many days of the 10-year debt of the \nObama budget that would be covered. Keep in mind, this proposal \noriginated from our friend from New Jersey, the head of the Senate \nDemocratic campaign operation, and his tag teammate, the head of the \nSenate Democratic message operation--the so-called war room--the senior \nSenator from New York. I will let others decide whether this proposal \nwas more political than substantive, but people should at least know \nthe facts about this proposal before deciding.\n  As a deficit reduction proposal, this is very weak tea. This is a \nmuch ballyhooed proposal, and it would cover the deficit for, in \nactuality, 5 days 18 hours and 47 minutes.\n  As you can see, here is the oil rig proposal. We have a $13 trillion \ndebt--actually it is about a $13.5 trillion debt right now--and you \nwould save $21 billion from the extra taxes on oil and gas. Even at \nthat, we would have a remaining debt of $12.9 trillion. So is the \nproblem solved? Of course not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator has served on the Finance Committee for a \nnumber of years and is now the senior ranking Republican there. If you \nlisten to our friends on the other side of the aisle, it would appear \nthat all fiscal problems could be resolved by taxing millionaires. Is \nthat an argument that the Senator is familiar with?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I sure am. Anyone watching C-SPAN will see our \nfriends on the other side making the argument day in and day out. When \nI hear this argument, I often think of a saying from the distinguished \nformer chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Russell Long. \nWhen talking about tax reform, Senator Long said: Some might reduce the \npolitics to this: ``Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that fellow behind \nthe tree.''\n  And since there are a lot more folks who aren't millionaires than \nare, the Democrats have calculated the politics of class warfare works. \nAll of our problems could be solved if the rich paid their fair share, \naccording to the Democrats. As politics, this might sound--I don't even \nthink it sounds good, but as tax policy and its proposal to reduce our \ndeficits and debt, this is the fourth red herring. It does not come \nclose to fixing the deficit from the Obama budget.\n  Our friends on the other side frequently cite the Tax Policy Center--\nor TPC--for tax data. That makes some sense. TPC is a professional \nthink tank that is a joint venture of two center-left think tanks, the \nUrban Institute\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\nand the Brookings Institution. With the exception of its director, \nDonald Marron, TPC is largely staffed by highly qualified tax \nprofessionals who worked in Democratic Treasury Departments and \nDemocratic Hill offices. TPC is a solid professional outfit, but you \ncan't ignore its institutional perspective. To be fair, I would say the \nsame thing about the Heritage Foundation. Their institutional \nperspective is more likely to line up with folks on my side of the \naisle. Nevertheless, I am drawing from TPC data, some of the \nassumptions with which I might not agree.\n  According to TPC models and estimates, for 2011, American households \nearning more than $1 million account for 12 percent of the Nation's \npretax income, they pay 19 percent of Federal taxes and carry an \naverage tax rate of 29 percent.\n  Even more critical from my perspective, these taxpayers also account \nfor 38 percent of all flow-through income. Flow-through income is \npredominantly earnings from the ownership of small businesses. So \nraising rates on the rich will squarely hit those who create and expand \nthe small businesses that need to be the engine of our economic \nrecovery.\n  But let us be clear about something: Higher taxes on these wealthy \nindividuals will not only have adverse economic consequences, it will \nnot even provide the deficit and debt reduction suggested by the left. \nEven if all the income--every dime they earned, of those earning more \nthan $1 million--were confiscated with a 100-percent rate--with the \nunlikely assumption of no taxpayer behavioral response--for the year of \nconfiscation, these higher taxes would yield about $893 billion. That \nwould be a one-time confiscation. Surely none of these folks would \ncontinue to work, save, or invest in the future if the government were \nto confiscate all their income. They would have to cover all their \nother expenses, including State and local taxes, from savings. After \ntaking everything from the folks behind the tree--in this case, the \nfolks earning more than $1 million--how many days of the 10-year Obama \nbudget debt would be eliminated?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, not many, is my answer to that. But as often as \nthe President talks about taxing the rich or spreading the wealth \naround as a cure for our fiscal problems, you would think it would \nbalance the budget. But would he get us there?\n  Mr. HATCH. I say to my friend from Alabama, confiscating all the \nincome from those earning over $1 million does not even fix 1 year of \nthe 10 years of projected Obama debt. It would cover 244 days, 16 hours \nand 34 minutes. That is it. Not even 1 year.\n  Look at this. Federal policymakers could kiss that revenue source \ngoodbye after an event such as confiscation. So there you are: $13 \ntrillion. Take the $893 billion. If we took every dime that \nmillionaires make this next year, the $893 billion, we would be down to \n$12.1 trillion in remaining debt. Is the problem solved? Of course not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Going back to the other chart on taxation and spending \nunder the Obama budget, I would note President Obama's budget raised \ntaxes significantly, increased spending even more, and as a result, \nover 10 years, created more debt projected than if he had made no \nbudget at all.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a stunning thing. You can talk about raising \ntaxes on American workers, on families, on small businesses and on the \nwealthy and investors all you want, but this talk is easy. It ignores \nthe root causes of the deficit and debt problem here in Washington: \nout-of- control spending.\n  It may sound like a cliche to the American people that Republicans \nare always talking about out-of-control spending. We wish it were a \njoke, but sadly, it is true.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish it were too. I am surprised about this debate. The \npress is not pushing Democrats on what a joke their proposals about \njets and yachts are, but the American people--the people I represent in \nUtah--understand these are red herrings. These proposals deal with the \nPresident's legacy of debt for less than 2 days--less than 2 days--over \nthe next 10 years. Add in the much-publicized tax hit on the hated oil \ncompanies and you get another 5 days.\n  So after all the demagoguery on jets and yachts and oil companies, \nyou get about 1 week of deficit reduction. And even throwing in a one-\ntime confiscation of all the income for taxpayers earning above $1 \nmillion, you can only add 244 days. Add it all up and there is still \nless than 1 year. All those tax increases don't even get to one-tenth \nof the debt President Obama will add over the next 10 years.\n  It is class warfare. We all know that. All the talk from the White \nHouse and from our friends on the other side is on behalf of proposals \nthat would address, at best, less than 10 percent of the debt forced on \nAmerican families by the President's budget.\n  I ask my friend from Alabama if he might conclude with the classic \ndefinition of a red herring.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let's take another look at the definition of red \nherring on the chart. It says: The name of this fallacy comes from the \nsport of fox hunting in which a dried, smoked herring, which is red in \ncolor, is dragged across the trail of the fox to throw the hounds off \nthe scent. Thus, a ``red herring'' argument is one which distracts the \naudience from the issue in question through the introduction of some \nirrelevancy.\n  Our friends on the other side, using White House talking points, \nsophisticatedly prepared, appear to have resorted to red herrings with \ntheir deficit reduction proposals. They want the American people to \nthink a few easy tax increases on the rich or yacht owners or corporate \njet users or oil companies--the people behind the tree--can solve our \ndebt crisis without spending reforms. They hope these red herrings will \nhide a serious Democratic vulnerability. If they are not going to \naddress spending in a serious way, then massive tax increases on the \nmiddle class will be a necessity.\n  These red herrings are designed to throw those citizens who care \ndeeply about reducing the $13 trillion debt that the President's budget \nwill incur off the trail.\n  The trail of deficit reduction leads to one of two places: \nrestraining out-of-control spending; or crushing tax relief increases \non middle-class families.\n  Restraining spending is not a red herring. It cuts to the heart of \nour fiscal problems. It goes to the root of the problem.\n  The President and his allies need to come clean with the American \npeople. The President so far has refused to present a deficit reduction \nplan in these negotiations that are going on. He says he has one, but \nwe never see it so it can be scored and analyzed. The White House seems \ncontent to produce cheap talking points justifying these red herrings, \nrather than meaningfully addressing our debt crisis. As I have said \nbefore, and will again, this shows a disrespect for the American \npeople.\n  Our people deserve better. They need honest, fair analyses of the \nproblems we face. I expect they will reward those who talk straight \nwith them and offer serious grown-up efforts to reduce our debt with \ntheir support; and I think they will be unhappy once it is realized how \nlittle these proposals would impact the huge debt crisis we are now \nfacing.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks.\n  I have to say that not only would it not impact it, but it would \nimpact a lot of jobs.\n  I remember when we did the so-called yacht tax back in the early \n1990s, the left thought that was a wonderful thing. We got after all \nthese rich yacht owners. When they found out that thousands and \nthousands of jobs were lost because of that bill, they immediately \nturned tail and got rid of the bill pretty quickly.\n  What we haven't said is we are assuming the $13 trillion is going to \nstay the same. Actually, in the next 10 years there is a good chance it \nwill double to over $20 trillion and possibly as high as $25 trillion \nor $26 trillion the way this administration is spending. Frankly, we \nare going to have a very difficult time ever coming out of this hole we \nare in right now.\n  All I can say is I like the President personally, but he hasn't \npresented a program. He is calling on Congress to do it all, and we \nhave our various problems here in getting together, but he hasn't led \nout on these programs, and neither have the other people down at the \nWhite House.\n  In fact, one of the problems is I can't name one person at the White \nHouse\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nwho has ever created a private-sector job. And let's face it, they are \ngood at creating public-sector jobs, but they are not very good at \ncreating private-sector jobs.\n  The real answer is to work our way out of them, and instead of \ntalking about shared sacrifice, let's talk about shared prosperity by \nallowing the engine of this economy, the small business community, to \npull us out.\n  Even so, we haven't even talked about the fact that the deficit this \nyear, in 1 year, is $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion. I might add that we \nare going to have at least probably close to $1 trillion deficit every \nyear under the President's own actuarial program, every year up through \n2020. You can imagine how we are going to continue to increase the debt \nwithout doing anything about it. Frankly, that is if his actuaries are \nright, and they are usually always wrong on the low side. That includes \nactuaries on both sides, to be honest with you. The expenses have \nalways been more.\n  I think what is important here is that we get real about working \ntogether and coming up with a way of resolving these tremendous debt \nproblems. The future of our young people in this country depend on \nthat, and I don't want to let them down.\n  I want to thank my colleague for his colloquy with me and I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I came to the floor. I heard an \ninteresting colloquy going on between my colleagues, my friend from \nUtah and my friend from Alabama, and I saw that my name was invoked, so \nI thought I would come to the floor and maybe elucidate for them and \nset the record a little bit straight.\n  No. 1 is I am no longer the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee, so my focus in ending the tax breaks that the big \nfive oil companies in this country get to the tune of $21 billion that \nthe taxpayers of this country give in essence to big five oil companies \nthat will make $144 billion in profits this year I simply think don't \nneed it in order to be able to achieve what the marketplace has allowed \nthem to do. And I am happy for them. I am happy for all their \nstockholders and shareholders and everyone else, but they don't need \n$21 billion of the taxpayers' money and tax break--which, by the way, \nthey describe them as these poor oil companies that, wow, we are going \nto stop domestic production.\n  One of the breaks I want to finish actually says you can't be doing \nwhat you are doing. Here in the United States, when you get access to \nthe lands and waters to drill for oil and gas, you pay a royalty. \nBasically, a royalty is a license fee.\n  The oil companies figured out, Well, when I do this in other \ncountries in the world, instead of paying a license fee, let me ask \nthem to pay a tax for the same amount that it would have cost to pay a \nlicense fee. Because then I get the tax and I get to deduct it totally \nagainst my obligations here in the United States, which means that for \nthose poor oil companies that I just heard about, we are, in essence, \nas taxpayers, subsidizing the exploration of foreign oil which goes on \na world marketplace--does not come back to the United States--to the \ntune of $21 billion.\n\n  If we want to talk about the poor, I want to talk about poor people \nwhom Republicans, it seems, want to go after. They want to go after in \ntheir budget the things people need to get through every day. It is \ncalled Medicare for seniors and the disabled. I know it from my \nmother's own life. She worked in the factories of New Jersey, worked a \nlifetime to help build family and community. She had a terrible \ndisease, Alzheimer's, and she would not have lived with the dignity she \ndeserved in the twilight of her life but for what my sister and I were \nable to do for her and Medicare as her baseline of retirement security. \nThat is what I call poor.\n  I call poor, young children who, under Medicaid, are getting money \nfor specific health care that through no fault of their own they \ndesperately need in order to have the quality of life--to even be able \nto breathe, children with respiratory ailments--so they can fulfill \ntheir God-given potential in school. That is poor.\n  But oil companies that are going to make $144 billion in profits, \nthey are poor? Give me a break. I know we belittle the fact that it is \nonly $21 billion that we would put directly to deficit reduction, but \nif we start putting in those $21 billion and then put in the billions \nin ethanol subsidies and then the horse racing industry and the \ncorporate jets and we start adding it all up, maybe if, instead of \nworking-class and middle-class working families whom our Republican \ncolleagues in the Congress seem to want to put all the emphasis on, if \nwe talked about the wealthiest people in the country and said to them: \nWe need you to help the country get out of this difficult time, they, I \nthink, would be incredibly patriotic.\n  I have talked to a lot of wealthy people who told me if it is to help \nthe country and if we are going to get our house in order, I am willing \nto help the country. I am willing to pay a little bit more.\n  But, no, that is not possible to even talk about. It is not possible \nto talk about big oil companies that are going to make record profits. \nIt is not possible to talk about ethanol. It is not possible to talk \nabout the wealthiest in the country, millionaires, multimillionaires, \nand billionaires. Yet I did not hear any of these voices when Ronald \nReagan raised the debt ceiling 17 times for the equivalent of $4 \ntrillion in today's money. I never heard any of these voices say how \nirresponsible it was when George Bush raised it seven times, for $5 \ntrillion--basically, the same amount of money he used to give tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in the country but which became the collective \ndebt of the United States. No, I did not hear any of it then.\n  I had no intention of coming to the floor. But when the facts are \nwrong and my name is invoked, I intend to come and set the record \nstraight. I am happy to debate my colleagues. We need to make sure \nworking-class, middle-class families in this country do not bear the \noverwhelming consequences of our effort to end our deficits and meet \nour obligations. We cannot continue to hear we cannot close the \nloopholes in the Tax Code for the poor oil companies, poor corporate \njets, poor multimillionaires and billionaires, all because that would \nsomehow be a tax increase, but we can take it right out of the pockets \nof middle-class and poor families by virtue of the services we deny \nthem--so they will not have the money to be able to produce or scrounge \nor keep what little they have been able to acquire--and say that \nsomehow is not a tax increase.\n  I hear about entitlements all the time. I have a new sense of what my \nRepublican colleagues mean by entitlements. The oil companies are \nentitled to their $21 billion. Those are just two provisions. I could \ncome up with a whole bunch of others for which they get tax breaks. The \noil companies are entitled. The ethanol producers, they are entitled. \nThe large agribusinesses in the country, they are entitled. But \nfamilies who struggle every day to make ends meet? No, they are not \nentitled. We have to cut their entitlements.\n  Something is wrong with that equation. A nation, at the end of the \nday, in its budget, talks about its values as a country. We all have a \nbudget. We may not think about it as a budget in our personal lives, \nbut it is income, however we derive it, through gainful employment, the \njob we have, maybe some investments we make, maybe some interests we \nget from our savings. That is our revenue. Then there are our \nexpenditures. The house we keep for our family, the insurance we \nprovide for their health care, the education, the tuition we pay for \nthe education we want them to achieve, the church or synagogue we tithe \nto, the charitable contribution we make to an organization that we \nbelieve is worthy of the\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nwork we do, that is an expression of our personal values.\n  The Nation's budget, which is both revenues and expenditures, is an \nexpression of our collective values as a country. I cannot understand, \nin that expression of collective values, how it is that the very \nwealthy, that the very influential, that Big Oil is entitled but \nworking-class families and the poorest among us are not entitled to \nrealize their hopes, dreams, and aspirations in the greatest country on \nthe face of the Earth.\n  Anyhow, I wanted to come, since I heard my name invoked before. I \nthink the facts were not quite up to par. There is, obviously, a \ndifferent view.\n  Having had the opportunity to set the record straight, I yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, I wanted to take this occasion to \nacknowledge a very important event that occurred last night. It \noccurred in the other body, where we had a vote for the first time \nsince we have been deliberating and debating and wrestling with this \nchallenge of what to do with our debt limit and the fact we have \nreached that debt limit. We have had a vote by one of the two bodies \nthat have a say in this matter on this very issue, and the House voted \nyesterday by a significant margin, with a bipartisan vote--although it \nwas mostly one-sided, there were Members of both parties--in favor of \nraising the debt limit. The House voted to raise the debt limit, in \nfact, by the full amount the President requested. The House voted to \nraise the debt limit by $2.4 trillion, which would completely eliminate \nthis problem, this struggle we have had over this looming deadline we \nhave been given.\n  However, the vote came with one condition. It came with the condition \nthat the President join Congress in putting our Federal Government on a \npath to a balanced budget. That is the requirement. That is the \ncontingency. The way the House bill achieves that is by establishing \nthree parts: The first is cuts in spending, the second part is caps on \nspending, and the third is a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. The colloquial name this approach has been given is the \n``cut, cap, and balance'' approach.\n  This is a big deal because until last night, among the three parties \nto this debate--the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the \nPresident--nobody had previously laid out a case that said: Here is how \nwe will raise this debt limit and deal with this problem. The House has \nnow done so. They have passed this measure by a significant margin.\n  I would like to quickly walk through the three elements of it--the \ncuts, the caps, and the balance. They are really all different pieces \ndesigned to achieve one goal, which is to put our Federal budget on a \npath to balance.\n  The cut refers to cuts in spending in this next fiscal year, which \nbegins soon. It begins on October 1. The cut is 3 percent from this \nyear's spending level--3 percent. So under the House-passed plan, next \nyear we would spend 97 percent of everything we are spending this year, \nbut we would cut 3 percent. Now, anybody who has run a business, \nanybody who has run a household knows that if you have to, you can cut \n3 percent from any big budget. I guarantee you, from the enormously \nbloated and oversized $3.7 trillion U.S. Government budget, 3 percent \nis not much, but that is the cut. That is the first part. That is the \nlevel of spending for next year--about 3 percent or $111 billion.\n  The next part is the caps. These are the statutory limits as to how \nmuch the Federal Government would be permitted to spend in each of the \nsubsequent years for the next 10 years. These levels have spending \ngrowth every year. Some suggest these are Draconian, savage cuts in \nspending. Actually, it is increases, but it is increases in spending at \na slower rate than we have had in the past and certainly slower than \nwhat others have proposed--what the President's budget proposed and \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office is expecting. Therein lies \nsavings. Therein lies the opportunity to put us on a path to a balanced \nbudget because I think we all acknowledge that, unfortunately, we are \nnot going to be able to achieve a balanced budget overnight. Can't do \nit. We have dug too deep a hole. So we need a little time to get there. \nThe spending caps provide that discipline as we move in that direction.\n  The final piece is a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich is something most Americans have strongly supported for a long \ntime. If we achieve that, frankly, we would never have to worry about \nraising the debt limit anymore because we wouldn't run a deficit. We \nwould be forbidden. Without a deficit, you don't need to issue a new \ndebt, so the debt would never rise, and this problem would be \npermanently resolved, but much more important, we would have our \nFederal Government on a sustainable, strong, viable fiscal path, and \nthat would create the opportunity for strong economic growth.\n  I am convinced that part of the reason we are having such a weak \neconomy and such poor job growth is because of the uncertainty we have \ncreated not so much over whether we are going to raise the debt limit \non August 1 or 2 or 3 or whenever it is but whether we are going to \nsolve the big fiscal challenge we face, the problems dragging down \nEurope now, and the problems that loom for us.\n  The President and the Treasury Secretary have been extremely alarmed \nabout the prospect that we might not raise the debt limit on August 2. \nTo that very point, the Treasury Secretary said--and I quote from a May \n13 letter he sent to Members of Congress:\n\n       This would be an unprecedented event in American history.\n\n  He is referring to a failure to raise the debt limit.\n\n       A default would inflict catastrophic, far-reaching damage \n     on our Nation's economy, significantly reducing growth, and \n     increasing unemployment.\n\n  President Obama had a similar message of great alarm, again referring \nto a scenario in which we did not raise the debt limit by August 2. He \nsaid:\n\n       If investors around the world thought that the full faith \n     and credit of the United States were not being backed up, if \n     they thought that we might renege on our IOUs, it could \n     unravel the entire financial system . . . We could have a \n     worse recession than we already had, a worse financial crisis \n     than we already had.\n\n  So this is how serious the President and the Treasury Secretary say \ntheir concern is that we raise the debt limit. Well, the House just did \nit. The House said: Mr. President, we hereby vote--and they did vote--\nto raise the debt limit by $2.4 trillion, the full amount the President \nasked for. They have said this is the only condition: You, Mr. \nPresident, need to join us in putting our budget on a path to balance, \ntaking care of this fiscal crisis, and giving us a sustainable fiscal \nfooting so we can have strong economic growth.\n  So the question today before us is, Will the President join us? Will \nthe President embrace this? The President, as I have just quoted, has \nindicated great alarm at the prospect of not getting the debt limit \nincrease he has asked for. The House has just said: Here it is.\n  Actually, I think, if not every Republican Senator, a big majority of \nRepublican Senators will support what the House has done. I hope there \nwill be many Democrats who will support this as well because none of us \nwants to test the proposition of what happens if we don't raise the \ndebt limit.\n  So the opportunity is here now. For the first time, we have a bill \nthat has been passed in one of these two bodies that would do exactly \nwhat the President has asked for, with just this one condition.\n  Let me comment for a moment on one of the reasons I think it is so \nimportant that the President join us in putting our budget on a path to \nbalance. We have heard from various rating agencies that several of \nthem are considering downgrading the credit standing of the United \nStates. This is an appalling thought.\n  I was involved in the bond market in my first career when I got out \nof college, and the United States stood above\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\nratings. We didn't talk about having a AAA rating because we were above \neven that. Our rating was so superior to anyone else's, the rating \nsystem didn't even really apply to the United States. Well, now, not \nonly does it apply, but the danger is that we won't even qualify for \nthe top rating.\n  Do you know what it is that would cause them to downgrade the debt of \nthe United States? It is not a failure to raise the debt limit by \nAugust 2; it is the failure to address this fiscal imbalance, these \nmassive, unsustainable deficits. That is what they have told us has to \nbe corrected or else the downgrade follows, and a downgrade will be \nenormously problematic because it has all kinds of knock-on effects.\n  So we have heard about a lot of different ideas that have been \nfloated, and I congratulate and commend everybody who has been involved \nin putting in a lot of effort. I don't agree with everything that \neverybody has talked about doing, but I think we have seen people from \nboth parties make a good-faith effort to try to solve this problem one \nway or another. But the fact is there is only one proposal on the table \nthat has passed either body, and there is only one proposal that \nactually solves our long-term fiscal challenge in the law that has \nalready passed--the bill that has already been passed.\n  So my question now is, Will the President join us and put our \ngovernment on a path to a balanced budget? We don't expect to get there \novernight. By the way, the various levels of cuts and spending and the \nexact terms of the balanced budget amendment naturally would be subject \nto discussion. But will the President join us in this effort to restore \nfiscal sanity and give us the basis for strong economic growth? That is \nthe question, and that is the opportunity for the President.\n  Now, I know the President has been dismissive of the idea of \nbalancing our budget, but I certainly hope he is not so opposed to \nbalancing our budget that he would reject the debt limit increase that \nhe has said we desperately need. There is an opportunity here to solve \ntwo problems at once--to solve this problem over the looming date of \nAugust 2 by which he has said we absolutely must raise the debt limit, \nbut the more important opportunity is to put our house in fiscal order.\n  The House took a very important step in that direction. The Senate \nwill have a vote later this week. I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill embrace this opportunity and the President will join us and will \nput our Federal Government on a path to balance.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4700-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, I rise to address amendment No. 570, \noffered by Senator Wyden, regarding closure of the Umatilla Chemical \nDepot. It is an amendment on which I am proud to partner with him.\n  This is a very important issue to my home State of Oregon. We have a \nsituation where 20 years of planning have gone forward to arrange for \nthe final transition of this chemical depot based on the \nrecommendations of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Indeed, \nthe BRAC Commission, as it is known, noted:\n\n       On completion of the chemical demilitarization mission in \n     accordance with treaty obligations, close Umatilla Chemical \n     Depot, Oregon.\n\n  This was language that was specifically done to recognize that the \nchemical depot had to complete its work dismantling the chemical \nweapons stored there according to the Chemical Weapons Convention \nTreaty. That treaty had a deadline of April 29, 2012, and thus it \nwasn't clear that the work would be done within the 6 years outlined \nfor most of the BRAC's work. So they changed the language from ``close \nthe Umatilla Chemical Depot'' to ``on completion of the chemical \ndemilitarization mission in accordance with treaty obligations.''\n  So since this has been a discussion for so long, with the community \nworking so hard with so many stakeholders in order to put the plans \ntogether to transition this base to a productive civilian role, it came \nas a complete shock recently when the community was notified by the \nArmy that, despite the specific language that accommodated the treaty \ndeadline of April 2012, they were going to rule that the transfer under \nthe BRAC legislation could not be completed because it was an \nexception--even an exception written into the law--to the initial 6 \nyears.\n  It was quite a shock because a local reuse authority has been formed \nand has been working hard with representatives from all local \nstakeholders to make sure this base is transferred in a way that \ncreates the best possible economy and best use of this land. It has \nbeen a complicated task. It has been an earnest effort.\n  This is not the time for the Army to change the rules, digging up a \nclause and misapplying that clause, ignoring the exception written into \nthe law, and claiming that this work done over all this time doesn't \nmatter.\n  That is why I am so delighted to join with Senator Wyden in putting a \nclarification into statute that says, yes, what the original \nlegislation said with an April 2012 deadline recognizing our treaty \nobligations must be honored and the BRAC process must be honored for \nthe best use of this land in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4700-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I have offered an amendment to H.R. \n2055. It seeks to help to make sure our wounded warriors get the \nbenefits of next-generation advanced prosthetics in a timely fashion.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nsubmit to Congress a report within 90 days, identifying the \nbureaucratic hurdles and redtape we need to cut through to make sure \nthe research that is being done and the next-generation advanced \nprosthetics that are being developed to help our wounded warriors will \nget to them as quickly as possible.\n  We have invested substantial taxpayer dollars, including through the \nDefense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, in developing this \ngreat technology in advanced next-generation prosthetics.\n  Last week, I had the chance to go to Walter Reed Hospital and meet \nwith some of our wounded warriors. They are absolutely amazing \nAmericans, and what they have done for our country is incredible. We \ncan never repay the sacrifices they have made. But the last thing they \nshould have to put up with is waiting for years of delay through the \nFDA or other government agencies to make sure they can get the very \nbest technology available for next-generation advanced prosthetics. \nThat is why I offer this amendment.\n  I hope this amendment will be passed to make sure we can cut through \nthe redtape, that the Veterans' Administration will identify any \nhurdles that are present, that we can get through those hurdles and get \nthat technology to our wounded warriors as soon as possible, given what \nthey have done for our country and continue to do in fighting on our \nbehalf. They are heroes, and they deserve to not have to wait and wade \nthrough government bureaucracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 577\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside any \npending amendments and call up amendment No. 577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 577.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. __ No later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     on the status and improvement plan for all DODEA schools with \n     an overall condition rating of Q3 (poor) or Q4 (failing) as \n     identified in the October 2009 Report to Congress on \n     Department of Defense Education Activity's Military \n     Construction Program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Department of Defense runs schools \nthat serve over 86,000 children across America, Europe, and in the \nPacific region. That is why I was able to get together with Senator \nGraham and Senator Inhofe to work on a way we could get those schools \nfixed because they are crumbling. Since a picture is worth a thousand \nwords, I will show this picture from one of the schools.\n  We can see the tiles on the roof crumbling. We have had that in our \npublic schools, before we woke up. Literally, these tiles fall down, \nand it is just by the grace of God that a child or a teacher doesn't \nget hit and very hurt. Clearly, we need to do something about it.\n  What I would like to say is, we started off with an amendment that \nactually required the DOD to fix these schools. Now we are asking for a \nreport that they do it because we have to avoid some parliamentary \nprocedure problems of legislating on approps. So we believe we have \ndone this.\n  I think everyone should be read last month's Newsweek. They published \nan investigation by the Standard for Public Integrity, which documented \nthe conditions of DOD-run schools with serious problems, leaks, \ncorrosion, mold and overcrowding and relying on temporary facilities.\n  My amendment has the strong support of the National Military Families \nAssociation. They sent me a statement and I will close with this.\n\n       DOD schools, especially at U.S. installations overseas, are \n     a community focal point and a key element in the support \n     network for our military families stressed by a decade of \n     war. Poorly repaired or out-of-date buildings can also create \n     the perception among military families that their children's \n     education is not a priority for our Nation.\n\n  I urge support for this bipartisan amendment, and I would yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Johnson-\nKirk amendment No. 556 be modified further with the changes that are at \nthe desk; that Senator Warner be added as a cosponsor to the Johnson-\nKirk amendment; that the pending amendments be set aside and two \namendments from Senator Hutchison be called up, No. 562 and No. 563 en \nbloc, and following the reporting of the Hutchison amendments, the \nfollowing pending amendments be agreed to: Johnson-Kirk No. 556, as \nfurther modified; Wyden No. 570; Hutchison, No. 562; and Hutchison No. \n563; further, the pending McCain amendment No. 553 be withdrawn; that \nno other amendments, motions or points of order be in order other than \nmotions to table or budget points of order and the applicable motions \nto waive; that at 4:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto the following amendments in the order listed below: Ayotte amendment \nNo. 575, Boxer amendment No. 577, and Coburn amendment No. 564; that \nupon disposition of the Coburn amendment, the substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to; the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill, as amended; and the motions \nto reconsider be made and laid upon the table; finally, that upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio \nof 9 to 8.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Amendment No. 556, as further modified, and \namendments Nos. 570, 562, and 563 are agreed to.\n  Amendment No. 553 is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 564\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Coburn \namendment and ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think it is important for us to \nunderstand what this amendment is about.\n  It does not affect the decisions regarding disability as a result of \nAgent Orange that have already been decided under the guidelines that \nwere extended by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This is a \nprospective amendment. So any allegation that this somehow affects \nprevious awarding of disability payments is not correct. It is a \nprospective amendment for cases that will be decided in the future.\n  The issue of disability is always one that is very difficult because \nwe start on the basis that concerns men and women who have served \nhonorably in the military. Obviously, the predilection is, \nappropriately, to grant disabilities where those claims are made. But \nwe now have a situation where somewhere around $40 billion, $41 \nbillion, simply over the issue of heart disease, can be awarded without \nwhat appears to be a direct connection to Agent Orange.\n  There were many of our men and women who were serving in the conflict \nin Vietnam who were exposed to Agent Orange, but there were many more \nwho were not. I don't think one can make a case that someone who was \nstationed on a ship in the Gulf of Tonkin and was many miles from any \nAgent Orange, that one could make a plausible case that Agent Orange \nwas the cause of this disability.\n  What this amendment tries to do is give a realistic set of parameters \nfor the awarding of disability payment for those who actually were \nexposed, and not only exposed but also that there is a direct \nconnection between the exposure to herbicides and the outcome.\n  There are many needs amongst our veterans. They are there every \nsingle day. The purpose of this amendment is to make sure there is a \nlegitimate need for compensation for those who were exposed to Agent \nOrange and a direct connection between that exposure and certain \ndisabilities, particularly heart disease, Parkinson's disease, \nHodgkin's, et cetera. What we are trying to do is make sure those who \nwere actually exposed, and there is a direct connection, are rewarded, \nand adequately so, but at the same time not have a situation where it \nis an open-ended expenditure of taxpayers' dollars.\n  The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission endorsed the need for \nestablishing a new framework for presumptions with more transparent \nprocesses but failed to take the full step of embracing causality in \ndecisionmaking. This amendment will achieve that goal identified by the \nInstitute of Medicine to ensure that scientifically based causality is \nat the heart of the disability determination process.\n  I would match the commitment of the Senator from Oklahoma and my own \nfor veterans with the commitment of anyone in this body, but there also \nhas to be some rationality associated with it. I was a great admirer of \nthe Honorable Tony Principi, who was the former Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs. Again, I want to quote from his statement:\n\n       If the American people lose faith in the integrity of our \n     disability benefit system, veterans and their families will \n     be the ones who suffer. The surest way for that to happen is \n     for the public to be convinced that presumptive service \n     connection decisions are based on anything other than sound \n     scientific advice.\n\n  These presumptions, as they presently exist, are not based on sound \nscientific advice. With some I am sure this amendment is not popular, \nbut I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for bringing it to the attention \nof this body.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. We \nwant to make sure any veteran who has a positive causation factor from \nany aspect that would lead to any disability, that we meet that need. \nThat is not what this is about.\n  This has been looked at two times by the Institute of Medicine. The \nfirst time there was no study--none of the studies they cited showed \neven positive association. The last time we had two that showed some \npositive association but absolutely no causation. There is a big \ndifference in science. Something can be associated with something and \ndoesn't mean it causes it. On that basis, the Secretary committed this \ncountry to make payments to people for disabilities that are not \nassociated with their service. The point is, in a limited budget going \nforward, if we are paying for disabilities that are not associated with \nservice, that means we are going to have less money available for those \nveterans who do have a disability.\n  We have heard, No. 1, this will reverse all that has come before. It \nwill not. It is prospective only. It will not change the presumption \nthat if someone was in or above Vietnam they have the presumption of \nbeing exposed to Agent Orange. That will not change at all. The \nprevious scientific diseases that were based on causation will not be \neliminated at all. But, in fact, those that are not associated with \ncausality will be eliminated.\n  Will they be eliminated in the future? If the science at some point \nin time shows us that there is a causal relationship between that \nexposure and disease, then we can do something about it. But now we are \nthrowing money at disabilities that are not associated and not caused \nby veterans' exposure to this herbicide.\n  I ask, given where we are in this country and the fact that we are \ngoing to have a tough time funding veterans\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\nprograms in the future anyway, that we ought not spend a dollar on \nsomething that is not directly caused by a veteran's exposure to Agent \nOrange so that we have that dollar to pay for those who truly were \nexposed and truly have a disability.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I ask him, I have \nheard anecdotally the eligibility for disability under the guidelines \nas issued by the Secretary of the Army--and, by the way, we are talking \nabout $40-some billion additional of taxpayers' money. I think that \nshould be the subject of legislative action rather than a decision made \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Is it not true that, anecdotally, we have heard that people who were \nin the Korean war and not the Vietnam war have somehow become eligible? \nAnd people who were on ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, not anywhere near \nAgent Orange, have also been declared eligible?\n  Mr. COBURN. They are eligible, and there are some reasons for that. \nBut that is not what this debate is about. We are not questioning it. \nWe are just saying on this basis we are not using science how we have \nused it in every other aspect of veterans' disability. Now we are going \nbeyond science.\n  When we look at the total number of studies, rarely 3 percent or so \nshow any association, and association does not imply any causation. So \nwe have the Secretary who has made a decision to commit this country to \n$42 billion of additional expenditures not based on sound science but \nthe fact that he can do that, and that is what I think is wrong. If the \nveterans committee thinks there is the science to do that, they should \nbring a bill to the floor and do that. But the science is not there. I \nhave looked at it. I have read it. It is not there.\n  The Institute of Medicine says it is not there, and they say \ndisability ought to be based on causation, not on association.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 577, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Boxer \namendment No. 577 be modified with the changes that are already at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 577), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. __. No later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall report to the Congressional \n     Defense Committees of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives on the status and improvement plan for all \n     DODEA schools with an overall condition rating of Q3 (poor) \n     or Q4 (failing) as identified in the October 2009 Report to \n     Congress on Department of Defense Education Activity's \n     Military Construction Program.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 575.\n  The amendment (No. 575) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 577, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Boxer amendment No. 577, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 577), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 564\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Coburn amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a commonsense amendment that will secure this for \nveterans and make sure we are not paying for disabilities for those who \nare not truly service connected, that are not based on science or \ncausation. I know it is a tough vote, but in the environment we face \ntoday we ought to be using science to positively connect causality with \nany disability we grant.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. So my colleagues know, there is a reason we have made \nthis type of compensation like Agent Orange presumptive. It is because \nour military did a miserable job of tracking these exposures, and it is \nbecause no veteran will ever be able to go to a map and tell you with \ncertainty where they were exposed. No veteran will tell you what and \nhow much of this poison Agent Orange they inhaled. So we have to look \nat the facts with reason and compassion, and in this case on the one \nhand we have the knowledge that we sprayed a known killer throughout \nthe area where a number of these veterans were serving.\n  We have had thousands of veterans who have come forward and believe \ntheir cancers and ailments were caused by that exposure. We have \nstudies that show veterans exposed to Agent Orange are more likely to \nhave heart disease, cancer, and other conditions. We have the Institute \nof Medicine which has recommended giving these veterans the benefit of \nthe doubt, and we have the Secretary of Veterans Affairs who has \ndecided we need to move forward to provide compensation.\n  On the other hand, you have an amendment today--while it makes a \ncompelling case for saving money, it hasn't presented any evidence at \nall that Agent Orange did not cause the conditions faced by these \nVietnam veterans coming forward. An amendment that asks our veterans to \nwait longer? That is something they have already done too much of. They \nhave been waiting and getting sicker. They have been dying for 40 years \nor more. We should not ask them to wait longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. I urge my colleagues to vote to table \nthis amendment. And if the Senator wants to finish his remarks, I will \nmove to table when he is finished.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wish to make one point. The Institute of Medicine did \nnot recommend this. As a matter of fact, their recommendation was that \ncausality ought to be the only way in which we would do this.\n  I would ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to table the amendment. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

In support of our troops on the front lines, we need to \nmake sure they have the infrastructure they need to train and the \nfamily housing facilities they deserve.\n  The bill includes $11.1 billion for military construction worldwide \nto provide for barracks, readiness centers, schools, hospitals and \nclinics.\n  In particular, it provides the entire requested amount, $1.2 billion, \nfor reservist construction projects.\n  Several of these projects from the President's budget are in \nIllinois, totaling some $146 million. The bill provides for Army \nReserve centers in Homewood and Rockford, IL. It also provides for an \nArmy National Guard Readiness Center in Normal, IL, as well as \nrenovations to the Great Lakes Naval Station.\n  The bill provides funding for necessary projects like these all \nacross the country.\n  Without them, our Guard and Reserve would struggle to maintain the \ntraining and preparations necessary in a time of war.\n  The bill also keeps our commitment to our veterans, some of whose \nlives have changed forever as a result of their service.\n  We are all committed to providing our veterans with the care, \nservices and facilities they deserve, even in tough budget years.\n  As such, the bill provides VA medical research at $72 million above \nthe budget request for mental health, traumatic brain injury, spinal \ncord injury, burns and sensory loss.\n  These are key areas for a cohort of veterans who are surviving in \nlarger numbers than previous wars due to improved medical care.\n  To take one example: Our men and women on the front lines are \nincreasingly suffering brain injuries from improvised explosive device, \nIED, blasts. While we have advanced our understanding of how traumatic \nbrain injury, TBI, affects the brain, there is still a lot more to \nlearn through this research.\n  This funding will also continue work with prosthetics. Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center has done amazing work with providing prosthetics \nthat even help return some servicemembers to their pre-injury jobs in \nthe military.\n  Many use their new prosthetics and relearn how to not only take care \nof themselves, but also ski, ride a bike, and even fish. Without this \nfunding our troops and veterans would not have access to the amazing \nmedical advances which make these activities possible.\n  Another key area of this bill fully funds the information technology \ninfrastructure at the VA. This will allow the agency to continue \ndeveloping and improving electronic health records, paperless claims \nsystems, and implementing the seamless integration between the DOD and \nthe VA.\n  These systems should help address the claims backlog--a problem our \nveterans deserve to have addressed.\n  Yes, the VA has expanded eligibility to include those exposed to \nAgent Orange, a policy long time coming. Yes, there are large numbers \nof OEF and OIF veterans submitting claims, an unfortunate state of \nevents.\n  But not one of these veterans deserves to wait for months and years \nfor a response to their disability claim. We can do better. And we must \ndo better.\n  And for our veterans who have been severely injured as a result of \ntheir service and now require full-time care, the VA has already begun \naccepting applications for the Caregivers Program. Over 1,100 \napplications have been received nationwide by the end of last month.\n  I am proud to have helped create this program as part of the \nCaregiver and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009.\n  The Caregiver Program helps keep the promise our country has made to \nour veterans by providing comfortable and dignified home care by a \nfamily member for post-9/11 veterans.\n  I have met several of these veterans and their caregivers in \nIllinois. It has been a long and winding road, but we are finally going \nin the right direction and supporting those families whose \nservicemember was severely injured.\n  This bill provides 100 percent of the President's request, $208 \nmillion, for implementation of the Caregivers Program, and our veterans \nand their families are depending on the passage of this bill.\n  Americans are counting on us to pass bills and legislate. Our \nservicemembers are counting on us to fund their needs so they can get \non with the business of keeping us safe. And our veterans are expecting \nus to honor our commitment and honor their service by paying for the \ncare and services they have so rightly earned.\n  Senator Johnson and Senator Kirk, the managers of this bill, have put \na great deal of effort into creating a spending bill that is fiscally \nresponsible without sacrificing the needs of our men and women in \nuniform. I look forward to the conclusion of debate on this bill and \nmoving to final passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues \ntwo amendments that Senator Webb and I have filed to the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct for 2012.\n  Each of these amendments relates to the Navy's proposal to build a \nnew nuclear pier facility to support east coast aircraft carriers. With \nannual recurring costs, this new project would likely cost just shy of \na billion dollars.\n  At a time when our Nation is in a severe fiscal crisis and the Navy \ncannot pay to maintain the infrastructure it currently owns. As Admiral \nMullen has said, the greatest challenge to our national security is our \nmounting debt.\n  Together, these amendments would save nearly $15 million for an \nunnecessary Navy military construction project at Naval Station \nMayport, FL. We are awaiting completion of an independent GAO \nassessment of the strategic risks to our carrier fleet which include \nmanmade and natural disasters. It would also consider the cost and \nbenefits of what other measures we can take to mitigate risk.\n  This is not a small project, the Navy estimates its homeporting plan \nwill cost nearly $600 million, but that cost could escalate to up to $1 \nbillion during the eight years ahead. Tack on to that more than $20 \nmillion in annual maintenance costs currently estimated for an \nadditional homeport and we are signing the taxpayer up for a big bill, \nmuch of which is not funded. It is in the ``outyears'' as they say.\n  The justification for a new homeport is the mitigation of the risk of \na terrorist attack, accident, or natural disaster occurring at the \nnuclear handling facility at the existing carrier homeport at Norfolk, \nVA.\n  However, the current Navy plan fails to take into account the two \nadditional east coast carrier capable facilities at Newport News, VA, \nand the Naval Shipyard. Each of these facilities maintains separate \nnuclear handling sites located many miles apart. If there were damage \nto the existing Naval base, the Navy could simply disperse the carriers \nto other piers. That is a lot cheaper and more efficient than building \na new, duplicative facility.\n  Additionally, recent Navy briefings indicate there is a 50-percent \ngreater chance of a major hurricane hitting Mayport than Norfolk. Why \nwould we want to build a new facility at a higher risk location?\n  The Navy has also identified unfunded priorities totaling $11.8 \nbillion between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2012. These priorities \nare in critical areas including shipbuilding, military construction, \nmaintenance, and acquisition programs--programs which are\n\n[[Page S4705]]\n\ncritical to both our current and future readiness.\n  We must maintain our existing infrastructure properly before pursuing \na duplicative homeporting project. It is more fiscally responsible for \nthe Navy to reduce its current unfunded requirements, which total tens \nof billions of dollars.\n  With our serious fiscal reality, it is much more responsible to focus \non taking care of the infrastructure we have then embarking on buying \nnew infrastructure which we cannot afford and piles more money onto our \nnational debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I would like to yield to \nSenator Kirk for any final remarks he may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I remind Members, we are now moving to final \npassage on our first appropriations bill of this Congress. It has been \n2 years since the Senate has passed a separate freestanding \nappropriations bill, but this is a bipartisan measure. It is marked to \nthe House budget level, the Paul Ryan budget. We made difficult \ndecisions cutting 24 separate military construction programs. We denied \nthe Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims a new building. We came in \nbelow the President, about $1.2 billion below the President; $620 \nmillion below last year, and even $2.6 million below the House-passed \nbill.\n  This is the bill that takes care of over 22 million veterans and our \nmilitary construction needs. I thank Chairman Johnson for his work as \nwe get the Appropriations Committee going again in a bipartisan way.\n  With that, I yield back to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting \non final passage of the MILCON-VA appropriations bill. I would like to \nthank Leaders Reid and McConnell and Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman \nCochran for their leadership and support in getting us to this point.\n  I would especially like to thank my ranking member, Senator Kirk, for \nhis cooperation and support in crafting this bill and steering it \nthrough the Senate. I am confident we would not be where we are today \nwithout his help and hard work on this bill.\n  I also thank my colleagues for helping us to move this bill forward \nby rejecting dilatory amendments and by showing restraint in offering \namendments to this bill. A number of Senators have filed amendments \nthat are very important to them but are also controversial or not \nrelevant to the bill. I appreciate their willingness to postpone debate \non some of these issues so as not to bog down this bill.\n  For example, I know Senators Webb and Warner feel very strongly about \ntheir amendments regarding the homeporting of a Navy carrier on the \neast coast, and I know the Florida Senators have equally strong \nfeelings on this subject. I understand the Defense authorization bill \nincludes a provision mandating a GAO report on this issue, and I \nappreciate the willingness of both delegations to postpone the debate \non the carrier issue so we can focus on timely passage of this \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I also thank the subcommittee staff who do the heavy \nlifting in the drafting and managing of the bill on the Senate floor.\n  As I have said many times, this is a good bill. It is bipartisan, and \nit is responsible. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KIRK. If the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Yes.\n  Mr. KIRK. I also thank Dave Schiappa, Laura Dove, and Ashley Messick \non the Senate floor for guiding this bill through; Chairman Inouye and \nespecially his staff director, Charlie Houy; Vice Chairman Cochran and \nhis staff director, Bruce Evans.\n  I thank Chairman Johnson and especially Tina Evans, Chad Schulken, \nAndy Vanlandingham, Dennis Balkham, D'Ann Lettieri, and Patrick \nMagnuson who have brought this first appropriations bill of this \nCongress through.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask for the yeas and nays on passage \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Boozman).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the chairman \nand the ranking member of the subcommittee for the work they have done \non this bill. It took a little longer than we wanted, but they got it \ndone. They have been excellent managers of this important legislation. \nIt is our first appropriations bill. Senator McConnell and I want to do \nother appropriations bills. It would be a new day to do these bills \nrather than having a big omnibus bill. Again, I express my appreciation \nto the managers.\n  There will be no more rollcall votes today. Tomorrow, I am going to \nmove to proceed to the bill that we call the Cut, Cap, and Balance bill \nreceived from the House today. Under the rules of the Senate, a cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed will occur Saturday. Therefore, I expect \na cloture vote sometime before lunchtime.\n  I am committed to allowing a full and fair debate on this bill. I \nwant the proponents and the opponents to have plenty of time to air \ntheir views. If the proponents of the bill would like to have the vote \nsooner, they can let me know and we will try to work something out. \nThere may be efforts to try to advance that vote. As far as I am \nconcerned, we should have a full and fair debate, and I look forward to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority \nleader regarding the chairman and the ranking members of this \nsubcommittee, who have done a fine job. I commend Senator Kirk, who has \nserved around here for the last couple of years. It is truly remarkable \nto pass an appropriations bill. We passed it at a level where it is \nlikely to be conferenced successfully with the House. I congratulate \nboth Senators--in particular our new Senator from Illinois.\n  I also share the view of the majority leader that we should have a \nvigorous debate over cut, cap, and balance. I look forward to being \nhere Saturday to vote to proceed to that bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is the first \nappropriations bill separately passed by the Senate since November of \n2009. It represents a substantial achievement of bipartisan cooperation \nbetween the majority and minority.

I have been coming to the floor for several weeks to talk \nabout the need to restrain spending and cut our deficit. As we look at \nthe next few days, we are going to have an opportunity to debate \nsomething that does that. We are going to be talking about the Cut, \nCap, and Balance plan.\n  The third part of the plan--the balanced budget amendment--is \nsomething I have supported since I first ran for the House of \nRepresentatives about 15 years ago. This past week, I received a letter \nfrom a Boy Scout in South Dakota, who was writing in to earn a merit \nbadge. I will read an excerpt from the letter. This is what he said:\n\n       I feel that the Federal Government needs a balanced budget. \n     If we don't, the debt gets larger each year. I feel that \n     there are two solutions for this. In our house, we are \n     careful to only spend what my Mom and Dad earn. The needs \n     come first and what is left is for wants. Many times we were \n     told no when we asked for something. With my allowance and \n     lawn mowing money, I divide it between donations, savings and \n     spending. I can't spend more than I make.\n\n  I think there are two very powerful thoughts in this statement. First \nis that the need for a balanced budget is obvious--even to this young \nman because, like him, we cannot spend more than we make. The second is \nthat this has a profound impact on the younger generation. The debts we \nare running up now will have profound impacts on our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is on the floor. She is fairly new to \nthe Senate, but she has already had an immediate impact on many of \nthese budget debates. She is also the mother of two young children, \neach of whom is carrying a $46,000 debt. I ask the Senator from New \nHampshire about those two young children and the $46,000 burden that \nhas been placed on them by the $14.3 trillion national debt we have. \nDoes she feel comfortable having her children essentially owe $46,000 \nof this massive national debt we have accumulated now for the past \nseveral years?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from South Dakota. This is such an \nimportant issue, as he has pointed out, and as his constituent has \nwritten him.\n  As a mother of two children, I am deeply concerned with what is going \nto happen to the next generation if we continue to kick this can down \nthe road and if we don't use common sense to balance our budget.\n  I have heard from constituents in New Hampshire--and I am sure the \nSenator from South Dakota hears the same--that basically only in \nWashington would the notion of balancing your budget be called \n``extreme.''\n  It is common sense that you can't spend more money than you have. We \nneed to pass the Cut, Cap, and Balance plan, because it is a \ncommonsense proposal to ensure that we don't continue along this cycle \nof continuing to increase our debt and not have a plan to pay our \nbills.\n  And borrowing money from China--that has to stop. When you think \nabout all the money we have borrowed from a country such as China, \nwhich doesn't share our values--right now, there is no other plan that \nhas been presented but the Cut, Cap, and Balance plan, which was just \npassed by the House. We can do this now and put our nation on a path to \na balanced budget and make sure that the Senator's constituents--and I \nknow he is a father as well--and our children don't bear the burden of \nour failure to make the tough decisions today. We owe it not only to \neverybody in our generation but to our children and our grandchildren.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator from South Dakota this: The cut, cap, and \nbalance plan puts emphasis on cutting spending instead of raising taxes \nto bring down our deficit and our $14 trillion debt. Does he believe \nthat is the right approach for America?\n  Mr. THUNE. Absolutely. I say to my colleague from New Hampshire that \nthe cut, cap, and balance approach is the correct way to approach this \nproblem, because it makes cuts to spending today--real cuts--this year, \nto this year's budget. It caps spending in the near term, and then it \nputs into place a balanced budget amendment that would require Congress \nto balance its budget in the future years. Obviously, that is something \nmany States have. My State of South Dakota has that. I know that the \n``live free or die'' State of New Hampshire has some very distinct and \ndirect views about the role of government and making its role limited, \nkeeping spending under control, and living within your means.\n  Cut, cap, and balance is the correct approach because it puts the \nemphasis on getting spending under control. If you look at the five \ntimes our country balanced the budget since 1969, the average amount we \nspent was just under 18.7 percent of GDP--our entire economy. This \nyear, we are set to spend 24.3 percent of our GDP. That is just on the \nFederal Government--a historic high.\n  The President spends substantially above this average in his budget \nfor every year. You literally have to go back to the end of World War \nII to find a time when we spent this amount as a percentage of GDP on \nthe Federal Government.\n  Part of the reason for this is the huge increase we have seen in \nnondefense discretionary spending from 2008 to 2010. In those 2 years, \nin which the economy was hurting and families everywhere were cutting \nback, these accounts increased by a mind-boggling 24 percent.\n  This year, part of our deficit is also caused by low tax receipts, \nwhich are caused by a slow economic recovery. If you look at the tax \nrevenue that we brought in in 2006 and 2007, we brought in over 18 \npercent of GDP in both years. So if we are able to constrain spending, \nwe know we will be able to balance our budget once our economy \nimproves.\n  I argue that one of the ways we help our economy improve and get back \non track is to get Federal spending under control. In 2006 and 2007, \nthe income Tax Code--the way we collected taxes was similar to what we \nhave today. We brought in over 18 percent of GDP in both of those \nyears. So if we get back to a more normal footing in terms of the \neconomy, we will see revenues start to come back. But we have to get \nspending controlled and actually start to rein in the out-of-control \nspending we are seeing here in Washington, DC.\n\n  If there is still a gap, even if we get back to 18 percent of GDP in \nterms of what we collect in the form of tax receipts, there is still \n23, 24, 25 percent of GDP that the President wants to be comprised of \nFederal spending. The gap cannot be met through tax increases. It has \nto be dealt with through spending restraint.\n  A couple of years ago--and I want to get back to my colleague from \nNew Hampshire in just a moment--Senator Ayotte's predecessor in this \njob, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, who was a great fiscal mind around \nhere and somebody who was very focused on spending and debt, along with \nCongressman Ryan, asked the Congressional Budget Office to estimate how \nhigh tax rates would have to rise to pay for our projected spending. \nCBO's response had two parts. First, they said marginal rates would \nhave to more than double to cover the expected expenditures of our \ngovernment. They said:\n\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\n\n       The tax rate for the lowest tax bracket would have to be \n     increased from 10 percent to 25 percent. The tax rate on \n     incomes in the current 25 percent bracket would have to be \n     increased to 63 percent. And the tax rate at the highest \n     bracket would have to be raised from 35 percent to 88 \n     percent. The top corporate income tax rate would also \n     increase from 35 percent to 88 percent.\n\n  That is a quote from the Congressional Budget Office in response to \nan inquiry from Senator Gregg and Congressman Ryan about what the tax \nrates would have to be in order to get our budget back into balance.\n  CBO also said that, practically speaking, this is impossible; you \ncannot increase tax rates and create this huge disincentive that would \nhave a profound impact on our economy and our ability to create jobs.\n  So we know that amount of revenue would never be collected when you \nraise tax rates that high. We know the real way to deal with the budget \nand to get the budget balanced and under control in this country is to \nget spending under control. So I think the cut, cap, and balance \napproach is the correct way in which to proceed because it puts that \nfocus on spending. We need to make sure to constrain spending and live \nwithin our means. The cut, cap, and balance approach does that.\n  By the way, I would like to make one observation about that because \nthere are people who have said the balanced budget amendment that has \nbeen proposed by Republicans is too Draconian and won't work. The cut, \ncap, and balance plan doesn't specify or prescribe a specific balanced \nbudget amendment; it just says a balanced budget amendment.\n  I think my colleagues on this side would be more than happy to work \nwith our colleagues on the other side to come up with a balanced budget \namendment that actually would work to ensure we don't spend more than \nwe take in each and every year, which is what almost every State in the \ncountry has in its constitution. That is why they are able to live \nwithin their means.\n  I would say to my colleague from New Hampshire, I am told she \nrecently held a townhall meeting back in New Hampshire, and I am \ninterested in knowing what her constituents had to say because I think \nNew Hampshire has always been a good barometer when it comes to fiscal \nissues. What did they think about the crisis we are facing? Do they \nbelieve the way we ought to deal with this would be to constrain \nspending and to get our budget balanced in that way, as opposed to \nmoving toward raising taxes, which is what many of our colleagues on \nthe Democratic side and the President have suggested doing?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague. What I have heard from my \nconstituents in New Hampshire--and we do have a requirement to balance \nour budget, and it is not easy to make those tough choices--is that \nthey do not understand why in Washington there is controversy over the \nnotion of balancing the budget because at home people are balancing \ntheir budgets. Families balance their budgets, and businesses balance \ntheir budgets.\n  I meet with businesspeople, and they look at me in disbelief and say: \nI don't understand why in Washington they don't look at what they have \nto spend and then stick within a strict budget. It really comes down to \ncommon sense.\n  One of the biggest issues I have heard about from my constituents is \nthat they are concerned that it has been over 2 years--over 800 days--\nsince the Democrat-controlled Senate last passed a budget. The notion \nthat we have been operating without a budget and running well over \ntrillion-dollar deficits and haven't sat down and done the hard work of \nrolling up our sleeves, allowing the Budget Committee to do its work, \nastounds New Hampshire citizens because they understand that if we \ndon't have a basic spending blueprint for our country, the end result \nis that we are going to continue to run up deficits and spend money we \ndon't have, borrowing from countries such as China, which doesn't share \nour values.\n  One of the things that is very important about this cut, cap, and \nbalance plan is that it cuts $111 billion in fiscal year 2012 and it \nplaces firm caps on future spending, contingent upon the House and \nSenate passing a balanced budget amendment, which is so important.\n  As we have talked about, let's let the States decide. Really, this is \nabout sending it to the people of this country and allowing them to say \nwhether we should balance our budget. I know what the answer will be in \nNew Hampshire. They will say: Yes, please, balance the budget.\n  If you look at where we are, as Senator Thune has mentioned, with \nrespect to spending in terms of the size of our economy, we are over 24 \npercent of our GDP that we are spending right now--well above our \nhistorical level, well above the amount of money we are bringing in. \nYet the only fiscal plan the President brought forward would massively \nincrease our debt over the next decade, so much so that not even one \nMember of his own party in the Senate voted for that budget.\n  So when we talk about a real plan to get America back on track, this \ncut, cap, and balance plan has a very commonsense approach. We will cut \nspending right away, put together a responsible fiscal plan for \nAmerica, and then make sure we have those caps in place so we don't \ncontinue to spend close to 24, 25 percent of our GDP. I mean, the \nPresident has increased our debt 35 percent since he has been in \noffice.\n  Finally, let's put to the States the question of whether they think \nit makes sense to balance our budget. I think we know what the answer \nwill be. They will say: Yes, please balance your budget, as we have to \ndo at home, as we do in State government.\n  The other issue we are facing right now is, of course, what the \nrating agencies have said about our failure to handle this fiscal \ncrisis. We have heard about the concerns that if we do not come up with \na credible plan that really cuts spending right now, our credit ratings \nwill be threatened. That will further impact our economy, and that is \nwhy we can't continue to put off the tough decisions. This cut, cap, \nand balance plan will put forward $6 trillion of cuts over the next \ndecade. That will help make sure we preserve our credit ratings for \nthis country. It will make sure we focus on real economic growth that \nget people back to work.\n\n  If we raise taxes the way CBO has suggested based on the questions \nfrom Senator Gregg and Congressman Ryan, we know that is going to hurt \nthe American taxpayer. It is going to hurt job creators in this \ncountry.\n  I also happen to come from a small business family. I know the impact \nof raising taxes in the way that was described. If we have to raise \ntaxes to address the spending problem we have in Washington, it is \ngoing to hurt our small businesses--those who create the jobs in this \ncountry--and that is the last thing we should be doing when we have \nover a 9-percent unemployment rate.\n  So I hope my colleagues will pass the cut, cap, and balance plan \nright away. The House has passed it, and we can raise the debt ceiling \nwith a responsible plan to cut spending right away, impose spending \ncaps, and send a balanced budget amendment to the States.\n  I would ask my colleague from South Dakota, when the Senator was \nfirst elected, before he served in the Senate, I know he had a career \nin the House of Representatives and served the people of South Dakota \nthere. There was a vote on the balanced budget amendment at the time in \nthe Senate, and it only failed by one vote. What does the Senator \nbelieve our current fiscal situation would be had the balanced budget \namendment passed the Senate at that time?\n  Mr. THUNE. What is remarkable about that is when I first got here, \nthere was a vote in the Senate in 1997. We didn't have the opportunity \nto vote on it in the House of Representatives, although I think we \ncould have passed it with a two-thirds majority there at the time. It \nfailed in the Senate by one vote. It got 66 votes in the Senate and it \nneeded 67.\n  I can't help but think how different things would be today had we \npassed the balance budget amendment then and sent it to the States. I \npresume, as does the Senator--and New Hampshire is not unlike South \nDakota--that we would certainly have ratified it. The 38 States would \nhave ratified it, and it would have put us on a path that is fiscally \nsustainable. Ironically, at that time the debt was about $5 trillion. \nWe are talking about $14 trillion today. Back then, it was $5 trillion. \nSo that is a $9 trillion increase. If we had passed a balanced budget \namendment, we wouldn't have run up this debt.\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\n  Now, it is interesting because--and I will point this out to my \ncolleague from New Hampshire too--if you go back 29 years ago this \nweek, President Reagan led a rally of people--thousands of people on \nthe Capitol--calling for a balanced budget amendment. He said:\n\n       Crisis is a much abused word, but can we deny that we face \n     a crisis?\n\n  I would say to my colleague from New Hampshire that the Federal debt \nat that time was $1 trillion, and President Reagan thought that was a \ncrisis at that time. Obviously, we are in a situation now where the \ndebt is 14 times that amount--$14 trillion since President Reagan 29 \nyears ago suggested we needed a balanced budget amendment because of \nthe debt crisis we faced then.\n  A lot of our Democratic colleagues say we just need to balance our \nbudget; we don't need a balanced budget amendment. My response to them \nis, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, where is your plan? \nWe have been sitting here for 812 days since the Democrats passed a \nbudget in the Senate, and even then that was a budget that didn't \nbalance. The President's budget submitted earlier this year, as the \nSenator from New Hampshire pointed out, was rejected by the Senate 97 \nto 0. When the President sent a budget up here, it was actually voted \non in the Senate and didn't get a single vote, either Democrat or \nRepublican. So the President took a mulligan on that budget, and he \ngave a speech outlining the framework for how he would cut the deficit. \nThat didn't balance either.\n  So it is clear the Democrats don't have the will to balance the \nbudget now. But if we had a balanced budget amendment, they would, \nalong with all of us--Republicans and Democrats because we have all \ncontributed to where we are today--be required to balance the budget \nevery single year, and that would have a huge impact on what our future \nis going to look like and what the future for your two children and my \ntwo children will be.\n  The rating agencies are considering, as the Senator from New \nHampshire mentioned, downgrading us if we don't take concrete steps to \nreduce our deficits. It would have a tremendous impact on interest \nrates if that happened. As I mentioned earlier today, 3-year government \nbond interest rates for Portugal are 19.4 percent; for Greece, they are \n28.9 percent; and for Ireland, 12.9 percent. We are already suffering \nfrom slower economic growth because of our debt and deficit.\n  There is a study by economists Reinhart and Rogoff that found that \ndebt levels above 90 percent of GDP were associated with economic \ngrowth that was 1 percentage point less than it would be otherwise.\n  We know from the President's own economic advisers that translates \ninto the loss of about 1 million jobs every year. So it is clear we \nneed to cut spending now, we need to balance our budget, we need a \ndiscipline imposed on Congress. A balanced budget amendment would do \nthat, as it has done for so many States around the country.\n  But the cut, cap, and balance approach cuts spending, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire mentioned, now, today, by over $100 billion this \nyear, cuts spending over the next decade by almost $6 trillion, and \nthen puts in place a balanced budget amendment that would ensure that \ngoing forward into the future we learn to live within our means, that \nwe don't continue to spend money that we don't have.\n  So I appreciate the observations of my colleague from New Hampshire, \nas I said. She represents a State that has a great tradition when it \ncomes to keeping spending and government under control. We need that \ntradition in Washington, DC. I would simply say to my colleague from \nNew Hampshire, I hope we can find the support among our colleagues in \nthe Senate when we have this vote--and it sounds like now it is going \nto be scheduled for sometime on Saturday--to get a big bipartisan vote \nin support of cut, cap, and balance.\n  I know that is what my colleague from New Hampshire hopes as well. I \ndo believe it is the pathway that will get us toward fiscal \nsustainability for the future of this country and put us on a \ntrajectory that is good for our children and grandchildren, doesn't put \nthis Nation on the verge of bankruptcy, doesn't have the adverse \neconomic impacts that we are experiencing in real time both in terms of \njobs lost, potential for much higher interest rates that would affect \nhomeowners, people who are trying to get student loans, auto loans, \npeople who are trying to start businesses. It would be absolutely \ndevastating to this economy if that happened. If we don't get our \nfiscal house in order, that is the train wreck we are headed for.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from South Dakota. And I, too, hope \nwe will have bipartisan support for this cut, cap, and balance plan. It \nis so critical, and as the President's own fiscal commission said:\n\n       Our challenge is clear and inescapable. America cannot be \n     great if we go broke. Our businesses will not be able to grow \n     and create jobs and our workers will not be able to compete \n     successfully for the jobs of the future without a plan to get \n     this crushing debt burden off our backs.\n\n  Well, the cut, cap, and balance plan will help get this crushing debt \nburden off our backs to allow our job creators to actually create jobs.\n  Also, when we think about starting from where we began this \ndiscussion, our children, we have to act now. I don't want my two \nchildren looking at me one day in the future and saying: Mom, what did \nyou do about the fiscal crisis that everybody saw coming? Right now in \nthe Senate, we can come together around this cut, cap, and balance \nplan. Once and for all, let's commit to passing a balanced budget \namendment. Let's send that question to the States. Let's let the people \nof this country weigh in, because we know they will weigh in with \ncommon sense because they do it at the State level, they do it at a \nfamily level, they do it in their small businesses.\n  So I, too, hope we will work with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle; that we will get this cut, cap, and balance plan passed. I \nlook forward to working with all the Senators in this Chamber, and \nparticularly the Senator from South Dakota who, I know, has been such \nan advocate and such a strong fiscal conservative, wanting to preserve \nour country and the greatness of America to make sure we get this plan \npassed now.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think our colleagues in the House have shown us the way. \nThey passed this last night. They have given us an opportunity now to \nhave this vote, and it is long overdue. In my view--and I think the \nnumbers bear this out--this is not a revenue problem. This is not a \nproblem of having too little tax revenue. This is not a problem, as I \npointed out, that can be solved by tax increases, which would devastate \nthe job creators in this country and make it more difficult for our \neconomy to recover and to get people back to work. But this is really \nabout spending.\n  This is about getting Federal spending back to a level that is \nhistorically normal. If we could do that, we will have done a great \nthing for the future of this country, for our children and \ngrandchildren. It is so important, in my view, that we not wait any \nlonger. We can't afford to wait. The time is now.\n  We are going to have this vote coming up, it looks like probably on \nSaturday. I hope we will have a big bipartisan vote in support of this \napproach that would cut spending today, cap it in the future, and get a \nbalanced budget amendment on the books.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4715-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4715-S4716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING THOMAS ``BROWN'' BADGETT, SR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as cochairman of the \nHelsinki Commission to again draw attention to the tragic consequences \nof Turkey's invasion and ongoing occupation of the Republic of Cyprus \nbegun 37 years ago today. I applaud the leadership demonstrated by \nPresident Christofias in an attempt to bring about a comprehensive \nsettlement and reunification of his country based on a bizonal, \nbicommunal federation with political equality, as defined in the \nrelevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, with a single sovereignty, \nsingle citizenship and single international personality. Attempts to \nresolve the Cyprus issue are exacerbated by Turkish intransigence; the \ncontinued deployment of tens of thousands of Turkish troops in occupied \nnorthern Cyprus; and the introduction of an estimated 160,000 settlers \nfrom mainland Turkey. Indeed, the reality is that settlers outnumber \nindigenous Turkish Cypriots altering the demographic composition of \nthat community by a margin of about two to one.\n  Previously, I have addressed a number of specific human rights \nconcerns stemming from the ongoing occupation, including freedom of \nmovement, property rights, and freedom of religion. Under my \nchairmanship, the Helsinki Commission convened a public briefing, \n``Cyprus' Religious Cultural Heritage in Peril'' to document the \ndesecration and destruction of sacred sites in occupied Northern \nCyprus.\n  Today, I want to focus on the situation in the city of Famagusta, the \nonce thriving commercial center and tourist destination on the east \ncoast of Cyprus, featuring the country's deepest water port. This \ncosmopolitan city, home to nearly 50,000 Cypriots, was a center for \ntrade and finance as well as culture, known for its many museums and \nvibrant nightlife. The second wave of the Turkish invasion, launched in \nAugust 1974, targeted Famagusta and the surrounding region. Seaside \nhotels that attracted tourists from throughout the world and other \nimportant high rise buildings were targeted for bombardment as \nresidents were forced to flee. Today, barbwire rings the city of \nFamagusta, a veritable ghost town except for Turkish troops patrolling \nthe perimeter of this once bustling urban center. What looters left \nbehind is slowly being reclaimed by nature and decades of exposure to \nthe elements.\n  The only thing I can compare this scene to comes from my walk along \nthe deserted streets in the city of Prypiat, a Ukrainian city of \nsimilar size to Famagusta, located in the Chornbyl exclusion zone a \nshort distance from the site of the world's worst nuclear accident. \nWhile health concerns keep the residents of the former away, armed \nTurkish troops prevent lawful residents of Famagusta from returning.\n  Notwithstanding numerous U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, including \nprovisions specifically addressing the city of Famagusta, Turkey \ncontinues to illegally occupy a third of Cypriot territory, preventing \nGreek Cypriots from returning to their homes and businesses in the \noccupied area, including Famagusta. In keeping with these UN \nresolutions and principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act, it is \ntime for Turkey to end its illegal occupation of the sovereign Republic \nof Cyprus. Agreement allowing the lawful residents to return and \nrebuild the city of Famagusta would be an important step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on July 20, 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus. \nThirty-seven years later, Turkish troops continue to occupy 37 percent \nof the island. The invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of \nmore than 5,000 Cypriots and made some 200,000 Cypriots refugees in \ntheir own land.\n  Since 1974, more than 75 resolutions have been adopted by the U.N. \nSecurity Council and more than 13 by the U.N. General Assembly, calling \nfor the return of the refugees to their homes and properties and for \nthe withdrawal of the Turkish troops from Cyprus. In addition to these \nResolutions, the European Court of Human Rights has in various \njudgments held Turkey responsible for the violation of the basic human \nrights and fundamental freedoms of Greek Cypriots, such as the right to \nlife, the right to liberty and security, the right to respect for \nfamily life, the right to the protection of property and the \nprohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment.\n  Building on past meetings in November 2010 and January 2011, \nPresident Christofias again this month met with Turkish Cypriot leader \nMr. Eroglu in the presence of U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in \nGeneva, where they agreed to intensify discussions on the difficult \n``core issues'' of the negotiations, including the sharing of power and \nauthority between the two communities of Cyprus, territorial \nadjustments, property issues, and the issue of the withdrawal of \nforeign troops, security and guarantees. The Cypriot government is \nworking in good faith to achieve a viable agreement and I remain \nsupportive of the Cypriot government's insistence that this process \nremain a Cypriot-led process, with any solution agreed upon by the \nCypriots and for the Cypriots, without any external arbitration or \ntimeframes, while recognizing that a solution cannot be reached without \nthe full and constructive cooperation of Turkey.\n  As Cypriot-Americans join with Cypriots from throughout the world in \nthis effort to unify their homeland, and as they seek to secure an \neconomically prosperous state free of illegal occupation, I will stand \nby them. I will work to ensure that the Turkish occupation comes to an \nend.\n  This week, we remember those who perished in the invasion of Cyprus, \nand honor those who survived and who continue to live under Turkish \noccupation. We have not forgotten and our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem and their families.\n  Remembering together the events of July 20, 1974, in solidarity gives \nreverence to historical events we cannot afford to forget as we move \nforward to a peaceful, just solution and a hopeful tomorrow.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of the disastrous \ninvasion of Turkish armed forces into the\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\nRepublic of Cyprus. On this day, 37 years ago, Turkish soldiers began \nthe forcible expulsion of approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots from the \nisland's northern territory. It is in support of the liberty and human \ndignity of those evicted that I stand to address my colleagues today.\n  At this moment, there are more than 43,000 Turkish troops on Cyprus--\nthat is roughly one Turkish solider for every two Turkish Cypriots. And \nregrettably, their presence continues to perpetuate the usurpation, \noccupation, and destruction of Greek Cypriot-owned property. So too \ncontinues the egregious desecration of Greek Orthodox churches and \nreligious artifacts that are not only sacred to millions of faithful \nbelievers, but also beautiful and irreplaceable historic sites and \nobjects of inherent cultural value to all of humanity.\n  Since 1974, more than 75 resolutions have been adopted by the United \nNations Security Council calling for the withdrawal of Turkish troops \nfrom Cyprus and the return of refugees to their homes and properties. \nYet despite 37 frustrating years of diplomatic stops and starts, a \nprocession of U.N. special representatives and envoys, and untold hours \nof negotiations, Turkey continues to occupy this region in complete \nviolation of international law.\n  It is imperative that Turkey withdraw its forces and at long last \nconcede that the Cyprus question is one that can only be resolved \nthrough mutual agreement on a solution, not the imposition of one. In \nthis way, Turkey must contribute practically and substantially to the \nnegotiating effort and embrace in concrete terms a reunified and \nprosperous Cyprus where Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can live \ntogether in peace.\n  As a fellow democracy, the Republic of Cyprus shares basic values \nwith the United States and has remained a close friend and ally for \nmany years. Indeed, the U.S.-Cyprus friendship remains an anchor of \nAmerican foreign policy in this region.\n  We must, in our solemn role as a nation that champions human rights \nand adherence to the rule of law, stand with Cypriots to bring peace, \nstability, and prosperity to their island. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Cyprus settlement process with \nthe goal of finding a fair and lasting agreement for the benefit of all \nCypriots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4717-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING JAMES NOEL SMITH\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to pay \ntribute to the life of a fine Montanan and good friend, James Noel \nSmith. Jim passed away last month after a long and courageous battle \nwith cancer.\n  Raised in the mountainous northwest Montana town of Thompson Falls, \nJim grew up with a deep reverence for the land, the water, and the wise \nstewardship of our natural resources. This became his calling in life.\n  After graduating from the University of Montana, Jim heard the noble \ncall of public service. He was inspired by national leaders like \nPresident Kennedy and Montana's Senators Mike Mansfield and Lee \nMetcalf. Senator Metcalf, in particular, became Jim's mentor. Jim, his \nwife Camie, along with their young son Mark--who later served on my \nstaff for a number of years--made their way back to Washington where \nJim worked as a legislative aide for Senator Metcalf. In their early \ndays in Washington, Jim and Camie had a daughter Terry. As a young \nadult, Terry found her way back to Montana, where she lives in Bozeman \ntoday.\n  Jim went on to serve with distinction at the Interior Department, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and several conservation \norganizations. During the latter part of his career, Jim organized the \nCouncil of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, a trade association \ndedicated to helping municipalities pay for infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  While they remained in Washington for four decades, Jim and Camie \nwere never Washingtonians. They were Montanans. Thus, when they decided \nto retire, it came as no surprise to those of us who knew them that \nthey headed home to the ``Big Sky.''\n  They settled in Bozeman, sharing their love of Montana, its land, and \nits people. Jim immersed himself with his work on the board of \ndirectors of the Gallatin Valley Land Trust, GVLT, an organization that \nprotects open land and promotes recreational opportunities throughout \nthe Gallatin. While environmental issues too often turn fractious, Jim \nrespected GVLT's consensus-based approach. He thought it got results \nand made a difference.\n  That is the way Jim lived his life--striving for consensus, getting \nresults, and making a difference. Mel and I offer condolences to Camie, \nMark, Terry, and their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4717-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DELMONT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to commend the \nheroic actions of Ms. Mallory Reis, of Johnston, Rhode Island. Last \nweek, the Providence Journal reported that while vacationing in \nMassachusetts, Ms. Reis helped resuscitate a 3-year-old boy who had \nstopped breathing after choking and falling in the water.\n  Ms. Reis, an officer with the Cranston Police Department, reacted \nimmediately upon hearing screams for help coming from the water's edge \nof Curlew Pond. She raced over to the crowd that had formed around the \nboy. His body was blue and limp, and he had no pulse. The boy needed \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR, and Ms. Reis was the first to \narrive with the necessary training. Immediately, she began performing \nCPR and directed bystanders to call 911.\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\n  After Ms. Reis performed a series of chest compressions and mouth-to-\nmouth resuscitation, an-off duty New Bedford firefighter arrived on the \nscene. Together, they worked to clear the boy's airway and get him \nbreathing again. Thanks to Ms. Reis' efforts, the boy is alive today \nand it is reported that he is recovering well.\n  The efforts of Ms. Reis underscore the vital role our first \nresponders play in keeping our communities safe. Law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel are often the \nfirst line of protection, taking risks to keep us and our families \nsafe.\n  Today I would like to thank Ms. Reis for her swift and heroic \nresponse that saved this young boy's life, and commend the Cranston \nPolice Department for providing officers of that caliber. I would also \nlike to commend all our first responders who dutifully perform these \nacts of heroism every day, and express my deep appreciation for their \nunwavering commitment to our safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4718-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4718-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4718-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR AND ON \nTHE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY BLOCKING PROPERTY OF CERTAIN \n PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS FROM LIBERIA \n THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, 2004--PM 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication stating that \nthe national emergency and related measures dealing with the former \nregime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect beyond July 22, \n2011.\n  The actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor \nand other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian \nresources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian \nfunds and property, continue to undermine Liberia's transition to \ndemocracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, \nand economic institutions and resources.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify, modernize, and improve public notice of and access to tax \nlien information by providing for a national, Internet accessible, \nfiling system for Federal tax\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\nliens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Congress continues to debate ways to \nreduce our national deficit, some Members of Congress are taking the \ntime to reflect on the state of the Federal tax system and consider how \nwe can simplify it and make it more efficient and fair. Today, as part \nof that effort, I along with my colleague Senator Begich are \nintroducing legislation aimed at simplifying and modernizing the \nexisting system for filing Federal tax liens, a key tool used by the \nTreasury to collect unpaid taxes. The bill has been endorsed by \nCitizens for Tax Justice, Tax Justice Network, Public Citizen, US \nPublic Interest Research Group, and the FACT Coalition, an organization \nof public interest and business groups concerned with tax fairness.\n  It has been 45 years since Congress has made any significant changes \nto the laws regulating how the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, files \nFederal tax liens. Right now, outdated laws are forcing the IRS to \nwaste taxpayer dollars on an old-fashioned, inefficient, and burdensome \npaper-based filing system spread out over 4,000 locations that should \nbe replaced by a modernized electronic filing system capable of \noperating at a fraction of the cost. It is time to bring the Federal \ntax lien system into the 21st century. The Tax Lien Simplification Act, \nwhich we are introducing today, will simplify the process of recording \ntax liens at an estimated ten-year cost savings of $150 million, while \nat the same time improving taxpayer service by making it easier to \nverify lien information and speed up the release of liens after taxes \nare paid.\n  Tax liens are a principal way to collect payment from persons who are \ndelinquent in paying their taxes. By law, Federal tax liens arise \nautomatically ten days after a taxpayer's failure to pay an assessed \ntax. The lien automatically attaches to the taxpayer's real and \npersonal property and remains in effect until the tax is paid. However, \nthe tax lien is not effective against other creditors owed money by the \nsame taxpayer, until a notice of the Federal tax lien is publicly \nrecorded. Generally, between competing creditors, the first to file \nnotice has priority, so the filing of tax lien notices is very \nimportant to the Government and to the taxpaying public if taxes are to \nbe collected from persons owing taxes.\n  Current law requires the IRS to file public notices of Federal tax \nliens on paper in State, county, or city recording offices around the \ncountry, to ensure other creditors receive notice of the government's \nclaim. There are currently more than 4,100 of these recording offices, \nmany of which have developed specific rules regulating how such liens \nmust be formatted and filed in their jurisdictions. This patchwork \nsystem developed more by default than by plan, as different offices \ndeveloped procedures for filing a variety of legal documents affecting \ntitle to real and personal property.\n  In 1966, to help the IRS comply with a proliferating set of filing \nrules for Federal tax liens, Congress passed the Tax Lien Act to \nstandardize certain practices. This act provided, for example, that \nliens against real estate had to be filed where the property was \nlocated, and required each State to designate a single place to file \nFederal tax liens applicable to personal property. Most States \nsubsequently adopted a version of the Uniform Tax Lien Filing Act, \nenabling the IRS to file a notice of tax lien in each locality where \nthe taxpayer's real estate is located, and a single notice where the \ntaxpayer resides to reach any personal property. For corporations, \nStates typically require the IRS to file a notice to attach real estate \nin each locality where the real estate is located, and a separate \nnotice, usually at the State level, to attach other types of property. \nThere are often additional rules for trusts and partnerships. The end \nresult of the law was to reduce some but not all of the multiple sets \nof rules regulating the filing of Federal tax liens.\n  The bottom line today is that, in most cases, tax liens have to be \nphysically filed in one of over 4,000 recording offices. In most cases, \nthat filing is accomplished by mail, using paper documents. Some \njurisdictions also allow electronic filings, but those jurisdictions \nare few and far between. The same is true if a lien has to be \ncorrected, or a related certificate of discharge, subordination, or \nnonattachment needs to be filed, or when a tax liability has been \nresolved and the IRS wants to release a lien. Each action usually \nrequires a paper filing in one or more recording offices and requires \nthe additional involvement of third parties. If a paper filing is lost \nor misplaced, the IRS often has to send an employee in person to deal \nwith the problem, adding travel costs to other administrative expenses.\n  The paper filing system imposes similar burdens on other persons \ndealing with the tax lien system. Any person who is the subject of a \ntax lien, for example, or who is a creditor trying to locate a tax \nlien, is required to make a physical trip to one or more recording \noffices, which may not even be in the same State as the taxpayer, to \nsearch the documents, see if a lien has been filed, and verify or \nexamine the information. Currently, there is no single database of tax \nliens that can be accessed by any taxpayer that is the subject of a \nfederal tax lien, by any creditor, or by any member of the public. Not \neven IRS personnel have access to such a tax lien database. It does not \nexist.\n  The result is an inefficient, costly, and burdensome paper filing \nsystem that can and should be completely revamped. Businesses across \nthe country learned long ago that electronic filing systems outperform \npaper; they save personnel costs, material costs, time, and \naggravation. Government agencies have learned the same thing as they \nhave moved to electronic databases and recordkeeping, including systems \nmade available to the public on the Internet. Among the many examples \nof government-sponsored, Internet-based systems currently in operation \nare the contractor registry operated by the General Services \nAdministration to allow persons to register to bid on federal \ncontracts, the license registry operated by the Federal Communications \nCommission to allow the public to search radio licenses, and the \nregistry operated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to allow the \npublic to search currently registered patents and trademarks. Each of \nthese systems has saved taxpayer money, while improving service to the \npublic.\n  Just as government agencies gave up the horse and buggy for the \nautomobile, it is time for the IRS to move from a decentralized, paper-\nbased tax lien filing system to an electronic national tax lien \nregistry. But the IRS' hands are tied, until Congress changes the laws \nholding back modernization of the federal tax lien filing system.\n  The bill we are introducing today would make the changes necessary to \nenable the IRS to take immediate steps to simplify and modernize the \nfederal tax lien filing system. The operative provisions would require \nthe establishment of a national registry for the filing of tax lien \nnotices as an electronic database that is Internet accessible and \nsearchable by the public at no cost. It would mandate the use of this \nsystem in place of the existing system of paper filings. It would \nestablish the priority of federal tax liens according to the date and \ntime that the relevant notice was filed in the national registry, in \nthe same way that priorities are currently established from the date \nand time of a paper filing. The bill would also shorten the time \nallowed to release a tax lien, after the related tax liability has been \nresolved, from 30 days to 20 days.\n  To establish this new electronic filing system, the bill would give \nthe Treasury Secretary express authority to issue regulations or other \nguidance governing the establishment and maintenance of the registry. \nAmong other obligations, Treasury would be required to ensure that the \nregistry was secure and prevent data tampering. Treasury would also be \nrequired to work with industry and other potential users of the \nregistry to develop accurate search criteria to identify persons who \nare the subject of a tax lien. In addition, prior to the implementation \nof the national registry, the Treasury Secretary would be required to \nreview the information currently included in public tax lien filings to \ndetermine whether any of that information should be excluded from \ndisclosure on the Internet. For example, the Treasury Secretary would \nend disclosure of social security numbers that are currently included \nin some tax lien filings.\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nWhile such identifying information could continue to be included in a \ntax lien filing to ensure that the filing is directed toward the \ncorrect person, the registry could be constructed to prevent such \ninformation from being disclosed publicly and instead provide such \ninformation only upon request from appropriate persons involved in the \nenforcement of the tax lien or collection of the tax debt. By requiring \nthis information review prior to implementing the national tax lien \nregistry, the bill would provide greater privacy protections for \ntaxpayer information than occurs in current tax lien filings.\n  To ensure a successful transition to the new system, the bill would \nrequire the Treasury Secretary to establish one or more pilot projects \nto be carried out within 2 years of enactment of the bill, and require \na successful nationwide test of the tax lien registry before it can be \nmade operational. The bill would also allow the IRS to continue to use \nthe existing paper-based tax lien filing system, in parallel with the \nnew system, for an appropriate period to ensure a smooth transition.\n  Moving to an electronic tax lien filing system using an Internet-\nbased national registry of tax liens, would accomplish at least three \nobjectives. It would save taxpayer dollars, streamline the process for \nfiling, correcting, and releasing tax liens, and improve taxpayer and \npublic access to tax lien information.\n  The IRS estimates that moving from a paper-based tax lien system to \nan Internet-based, Federal tax lien registry would save about $150 \nmillion over 10 years. These savings would come from the elimination of \nState filing fees, paper and mailing costs, IRS administrative and \ntravel costs related to paper filing problems, and the cost of lost \ntaxes whenever the IRS makes an error or a tax lien filing is misplaced \nor delayed. Filing fees, for example, vary widely from State to State, \nbut typically cost at least $10 per filing, and in some States cost as \nmuch as $150. If a taxpayer has real estate in multiple jurisdictions, \nthose costs multiply. A Federal tax lien system would standardize costs \nfor all taxpayers, and require only one filing across all \njurisdictions.\n  In addition, right now, an IRS service center is currently charged \nwith filing tax liens nationwide and complying with the myriad filing \nrules in effect in the 4,100 recording offices across the country. \nEliminating the paper filing system would free virtually that entire \nservice center for other taxpayer services and enforcement work.\n  Electronic filing would not only save money, it would improve \ntaxpayer service. Taxpayers who are the subject of a tax lien filing, \nfor example, would benefit from an electronic registry in several ways. \nFirst, taxpayers would be able to review their liens as soon as they \nare filed online, without having to make a physical trip to one or more \nrecording offices. Second, taxpayers would have an easy way to look up \ntheir liens on multiple occasions, identify problems, and correct any \nerrors. A single tax lien registry would be particularly useful for \ntaxpayers who move during the ten years that a tax lien can be in \neffect and have to look up liens in jurisdictions where they no longer \nlive.\n  Third, once the underlying tax liability is resolved, the IRS would \nbe required to release the tax lien in 20 days, instead of the 30 days \nallowed under current law. The longer 30-day period is necessitated by \nthe current complexities associated with filing a paper lien in one or \nmore offices across the country, requiring the action of multiple \nparties in different jurisdictions. These complexities would be \neliminated by the establishment of an electronic registry. The registry \nwould also enable taxpayers, after they pay their taxes, to make sure \ntheir liens have been lifted.\n  Creditors who need to research Federal tax liens would also benefit \nfrom a single electronic registry. Lenders, security holders and \nothers, for example, would be able to use a simplified search process \nthat could take place online and would not require procedures that, \nultimately, require physical trips to multiple locations. A single tax \nlien registry would make it easier to locate tax liens for persons who \nhave moved from the jurisdictions where the liens were first filed. \nSimplifying the search process would also provide greater certainty \nthat all tax liens were found. The ability to research Federal tax \nliens remotely and instantaneously should be of particular benefit to \nlarger lenders and to creditors of taxpayers with assets in more than \none county or State.\n  Tax liens are not a topic that normally excites the public's \ninterest. But sound tax administration requires attention to efficient, \neffective and low-cost filing systems. Saving taxpayer dollars is more \nimportant than ever as Congress looks for ways to tackle the deficit.\n  Federal law is currently impeding development of a more efficient, \ncost effective tax lien filing system. Amending the law as indicated in \nthe Tax Lien Simplification Act to streamline the tax lien filing \nsystem, moving it from a paper-based to an electronic-based system, \nwould not only advance the more efficient, effective tax system we all \nwant, it would also save taxpayer money. At the same time, it would \nmake the system work better for individual taxpayers by reducing the \npossibility for mistakes and speeding up the release of liens for \ntaxpayers who have paid. Modernizing our tax lien filing system makes \nsense in every way. I urge our colleagues to join us in enacting this \nbill into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Alexander, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1392. A bill to provide additional time for the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to issue achievable standards for \nindustrial, commercial, and institutional boilers, process heaters, and \nincinerators, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act of 2011. I am pleased to be joined in this effort \nby my colleagues Senators Wyden, Alexander, Landrieu, Pryor, and \nToomey. Our legislation is straight forward: it would allow the EPA the \ntime it needs, by its own estimate, to adequately consider and propose \na reasonable, workable rule that affects boilers.\n  Our bill includes four key provisions. First, it provides the EPA \nwith the 15 months it requested to properly analyze the best methods \nfor implementing the application of the Clean Air Act to certain \nboilers. Second, it will give businesses adequate time to comply with \nany requirements the EPA adopts by extending the compliance deadline \nfrom 3 years to 5 years. Third, our bill will direct the EPA, when \ndeveloping the new rules, to ensure that renewable and carbon-neutral \nmaterials remain classified as fuel and not solid waste. Fourth, our \nlegislation will help ensure that the rules are achievable by real-\nworld standards consistent with the President's directive to improve \nFederal regulations.\n  At a time when manufacturers are struggling to retain jobs, it is \nessential that this rule not jeopardize thousands of jobs in \nmanufacturing, particularly in the forest products industry, by \nimposing billions of dollars of new costs. Our legislation provides \ncommon sense solutions to the challenges the EPA is facing in \nattempting to draft and implement these complicated rules, which if \nwritten without proper data, analysis, and consideration, would cost \nthe industry billions of dollars and potentially thousands of jobs.\n  To be sure, the EPA performs some vital functions in helping to \nensure that the air we breathe is clean and the water we drink is safe. \nWe need, however, to make sure that as the EPA issues new regulations, \nit does not create so many roadblocks to economic growth that it \ndiscourages private investment, which is the key to maintaining and \ncreating jobs.\n  The EPA's proposed ``boiler MACT'' rules, which would affect tens of \nthousands of boilers, have been an issue of great concern to many of my \nconstituents in Maine. The forest products industry, in particular, is \nthe economic backbone of many rural areas in our country, including in \nMaine. Mill managers and workers in Maine have expressed their concern \nto me about the impact of imposing excessively costly regulations on \ntheir mills at this time of economic hardship.\n  Since these rules were first proposed in April 2010, I have been very \ntroubled that the cost of implementation would\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nbe far greater than EPA originally estimated. According to industry \nestimates, this rule could cost Maine businesses alone hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and put many jobs at risk, when less expensive \napproaches could be used to address emissions from boilers. This is \nsimply unacceptable in this economic climate.\n  Furthermore, these rules might force some of our mills in Maine to \nstop using biomass, a source of renewable energy, and instead dump the \nbiomass in landfills and switch to fossil fuels. This makes no sense. \nAs the President has stated, biomass is an important renewable energy \nsource that our nation should promote in working to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. Converting to fossil fuels alone would also \ncost mills hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  My colleagues and I have been concerned about this issue since the \nEPA proposed these new boiler MACT rules in April 2010. Last year, 40 \nof my Senate colleagues, including 17 Democrats, wrote to the EPA \nexpressing our deep concern that the boiler MACT regulations would \nimpose onerous burdens on U.S. manufacturers. We asked the EPA to set \nemissions standards based on what real-world, best-performing units \nactually can achieve. This letter reflected the widespread bipartisan \nconcern about the proposed boiler MACT rules.\n  It is important to remember that, under The Clean Air Act, a Maximum \nAchievability Control Technology rule, or ``MACT'' rule, is designed to \nreduce emissions to an achievable degree while also considering the \neconomic impact on businesses. The MACT rule must also set its standard \naccording to the best performing practices existing facilities. \nHowever, in the case of the boiler MACT rule, the EPA cherry-picked \ndata without considering the real world operating practices of the \nfacilities that will be affected by this rule.\n  In March 2011, I also asked Administrator Jackson at a hearing to \nexplain why the EPA is not considering alternative standards for \nemissions since the MACT limits may be far more stringent than \nnecessary to protect public health. Additionally, I have pressed \nofficials at the Office of Management and Budget, such as Administrator \nof the Office of Regulatory Affairs, Cass Sunstein, about the very \nnegative impacts EPA's Boiler MACT rules would have on the forest \nproducts industry.\n  In 2010, the EPA did request more time from the court to analyze and \nprepare the boiler MACT rules after it received thousands of comments \nthat raised technical and cost concerns the agency had not originally \nconsidered. In response, the EPA appealed for an additional 15 months \nto implement the rule, noting that the public interest would be best \nserved if it could obtain additional input from the public on these \ncomplex rules. Unfortunately, this plea was rejected by the D.C. \nDistrict Court, and the agency was forced to re-propose the rule in a \nmere 30 days.\n  The stakes are too high for the EPA to be forced to rush a complex, \nmulti-step process that could cost thousands of American jobs. Our bill \nwill provide a balance that will help the EPA protect the environment \nand public health while ensuring that businesses in Maine and \nthroughout the country are not faced with needlessly onerous burdens.\n  The EPA has claimed that the cost of the final rule has been lowered \nby 50 percent since the proposed rule last year; however, this is \nlittle comfort to manufacturers because the initial rule, according to \nindustry estimates, was approximately $4 billion in capital costs to \nthe forest industry and over $14 billion for all industrial sectors \nnationwide. The industry experts that I've talked with are very \nconcerned that the standards are being set so high that they are going \nto have to make a massive new investment at a time when they can least \nafford it.\n  The EPA is making progress in reducing the costs and coming up with a \nmore practical approach to the boiler MACT rules, and I believe we can \nachieve the health benefits that we desire without putting thousands of \npeople out of work. This bill will help ensure that result.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that the EPA has sufficient time to propose a well \nthought-out rule that minimizes the negative effect on the economy, \nwhile helping to protect public health and the environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 20, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our united and \n     strong support for legislation you are introducing today and \n     for H.R. 2250, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011,'' \n     bipartisan legislation to address the serious concerns that \n     remain with EPA's Boiler MACT rules. As they exist today, the \n     final Boiler MACT rules will have serious economic impacts on \n     a vast array of facilities across the industrial, commercial \n     and institutional sectors. These rules place at risk tens of \n     thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs that our nation \n     cannot afford to lose.\n       As finalized, the Boiler MACT rules are unaffordable, just \n     as the proposed rules were. The rules are not achievable for \n     real-world boilers across the range of fuels and operating \n     conditions. EPA also has created a presumption that materials \n     commonly used as fuels are wastes subject to the extremely \n     costly and stigmatizing incinerator standards. This would not \n     only impose billions of dollars in unreasonable costs, but it \n     also would cause millions of tons of valuable materials to be \n     diverted to landfills and replaced with fossil fuel--a bad \n     result for the environment.\n       As EPA has acknowledged, the rules were finalized with \n     serious flaws because EPA was forced to meet a strict court-\n     ordered deadline. The final Boiler MACT rule alone would cost \n     over $14 billion in capital for the manufacturing sector, \n     plus billions more in annual operating costs. Complying with \n     the incinerator standards could cost several billion dollars \n     more in capital.\n       Legislation is needed to resolve serious uncertainties and \n     vulnerabilities, including to: ensure the rules are stayed \n     for an adequate and certain period, as EPA's current \n     administrative stay is being challenged in court; allow EPA \n     adequate time to re-propose the rules and get them right, \n     including time for stakeholders to conduct more emissions \n     testing and to avoid mistakes that occur when rulemakings of \n     this scope and importance are rushed and become vulnerable to \n     legal challenge; provide direction and support for EPA to use \n     the discretion it already has under the Clean Air Act and \n     Executive Order 13563 to add flexibility and make the rules \n     achievable; clarify that using non-hazardous materials as \n     fuels does not result in boilers being treated as \n     incinerators; and give facilities more time to comply with \n     the complex and capital-intensive requirements of the \n     rules.\n       If enacted, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act'' will provide \n     the much-needed certainty and time for EPA to get the rules \n     right and for businesses that will be investing billions of \n     dollars to rationally plan for the capital expenses. This \n     legislation will preserve jobs and the competitiveness of the \n     U.S. manufacturing sector while protecting the environment.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue of great \n     importance to our industries and our workers.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Forest & Paper Association, American Chemistry \n           Council, American Home Furnishings Alliance, American \n           Petroleum Institute, American Wood Council, Association \n           of American Railroads, Biomass Power Association, Brick \n           Industry Association, Business Roundtable, Cement Kiln \n           Recycling Coalition, Composite Panel Association, \n           Construction Materials Recycling Association, Corn \n           Refiners Association, and Council of Industrial Boiler \n           Owners.\n         Hardwood Plywood and Veneer Association, International \n           Falls Chamber of Commerce (MN), National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Federation of Independent \n           Business, National Oilseed Processors Association, \n           National Solid Wastes Management Association, NORA, An \n           Association of Responsible Recyclers (formerly the \n           National Oil Recyclers Association), Rubber \n           Manufactures Association, Society of Chemical \n           Manufacturers and Affiliates, The International \n           Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, The \n           United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of \n           America, Treated Wood Council, U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce, and Virginia Forestry Association.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, biomass energy development is not only a \ngreat economic opportunity for Oregon, it is an essential piece of the \nforest health puzzle. Biomass energy helps create a market and a way to \npay for forest thinning and hazardous fuels programs. It is also a way \nfor keeping local timber and wood products mills in business at a time \nwhen the industry, like many\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\nin the U.S. is going through hard times. Biomass also provides an \nimportant renewable energy option for the Nation as a substitute for \ncoal and other fossil fuels. Every region of the country has biomass \nenergy opportunities even if the exact nature of the biomass that would \nbe used varies from region to region. Today, I am joining my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins, and a bipartisan group of Senators, in \nintroducing legislation to make sure that the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency can, and will, issue regulations under the Clean Air \nAct and the Solid Waste Disposal Act that ensure that the owners of \nthese mills and biomass energy plants can continue to invest in them \nand maintain and create the jobs that are so badly needed.\n  Pending Environmental Protection Agency regulations governing boilers \nand incinerators will make it very difficult for biomass energy to be \nused in the U.S. To its credit, EPA recognizes this fact and has \nrepeatedly proposed to rewrite those regulations to address the \nconcerns of biomass energy users, the forest products industry, and \nother industries. The legislation being introduced today is aimed at \nmaking sure that EPA can collect the necessary data and reissue its \nregulations in an orderly process that preserves biomass energy as a \nnational energy option and allows economically hard pressed timber and \nforest products mills to remain in operation.\n  On December 7, 2010, EPA, which was under court order to issue new \nClean Air Act regulations for boilers and incinerators, filed a request \nwith the Federal Court overseeing the boiler emissions rules asking for \na delay in the court-ordered deadline for issuing the rules by 15 \nmonths so that EPA could reevaluate its own proposed rules and address \nthe problems raised by the forest products industry and others. \nHowever, the Federal judge hearing the case rejected EPA's request and \ngave EPA just a month to fix the rule. In February 2011, EPA met that \ndeadline, but continuing to recognize the flaws in its regulations, it \nimmediately triggered an administrative process known as \nreconsideration to allow affected industries to provide more \ninformation and for the agency to revise its regulations. In May, EPA \nagreed with industry comments that the rule needed to be reviewed and \nit agreed to stay, or delay, the implementation of the existing Clean \nAir Act rules for boilers and incinerators. Unfortunately, EPA did not \nissue a stay of a related rule which defines which materials can be \nburned in those boilers and which need to be burned in incinerators. \nEPA has now proposed a schedule, which it confirmed in letters to me \nand several other Senators, to consider additional comments by industry \nand others and develop new Clean Air Act rules.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story. Stays can be lifted \nby the courts. This legislation would statutorily affirm the EPA's stay \nof the Clean Air Act rules. And it would affirm EPA's proposal to issue \nnew regulations by a date certain. That date would be 15 months from \nthe date of enactment, the same period of time EPA claimed was \nnecessary to draft a new rule. The goal here, which I believe EPA \nshares, is to issue Clean Air Act regulations that make sense, not to \ndo away with Clean Air Act regulations for boilers and incinerators.\n  On the other hand, by not agreeing to make changes to the ``what's a \nfuel and what's not'' rule, EPA has made it very likely that many \nwidely used boiler fuels can no longer be used, like wood scrap from \ndoor and window mills. And some results of the rule make little \npractical sense. For example, scrap tires that are picked up at a tire \nshop can continue to be burned as a fuel. Scrap tires that are picked \nup at a landfill cannot. EPA has indicated that it will try to develop \nregulatory guidance to help industry navigate the regulatory confusion \nit has created.\n  I appreciate the fact that EPA recognizes that there is a problem \nwith the fuel-or-waste rule and that they are offering to try to fix it \nby issuing regulatory guidance. However, I am not convinced that EPA \ncan fix the problems with the rule by just by issuing guidance. This \nlegislation will direct EPA to establish new rules on what materials \ncan be burned as boiler fuel, and which cannot, and give EPA clear \nstatutory direction on what can be included. This direction limits \nallowable fuels to a specific list so that there are no surprises or \nbackdoor exceptions. EPA can add to the list only after notice and \ncomment so the public knows what, if any, additions are being made.\n  This process for defining which fuels can be burned in a boiler and \nwhich cannot is very important to me. While it makes sense to continue \nto allow many materials that the wood products industry and others have \nused as boiler fuels for generations, I do not think that it's \nappropriate to simply decide that any fuel that was used in a boiler in \nthe past should be grandfathered in. The provisions in this bill \ndefining what materials can be burned in a boiler ensure that will not \nbe the case. This was a major issue in litigation surrounding earlier \nversions of these rules and I do not think it is wise to ignore this \nfact. Congress has the opportunity to try to address the legitimate \nconcerns about what is being burned in these boilers and it should.\n  Finally, the bill would extend the normal 3 year period for boilers \nto come into compliance to 5 years. It is my hope that once there a \nfinal regulations and industry knows what it has to do that it will not \ntake that long. However, there some 2000 boilers in the U.S. that would \nall have to upgrade or replace their units all at the same time and \ncoincident with similar rules going into effect for electric utility \ncompany boilers. This extra time will mean that there will be no excuse \nfor not meeting the final standards.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2011.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I appreciate the opportunity to meet \n     with you on June 16, 2011, regarding the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials \n     (NHSM) rule, the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology \n     (MACT) rule, and the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste \n     Incinerators (CISWI) rule. Thank you for your constructive \n     engagement on these priority issues. We are currently \n     exploring various pathways under existing authority to \n     address your concerns.\n       As you know, the Boiler MACT and CISWI standards are \n     currently subject to an administrative stay. Today, as part \n     of a filing with the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, the EPA announced the intended \n     schedule for reconsideration of the boilers and CISWI rules. \n     To ensure that the agency's standards are based on the best \n     available data and that the public is given ample opportunity \n     to provide additional input and information, the agency \n     intends to propose the reconsideration rule by the end of \n     October 2011 and issue a final rule by the end of April 2012. \n     This is the best approach to establish technically and \n     legally sound standards that will bring significant health \n     benefits to the American public.\n       We believe that this stay and the reconsideration period \n     will provide ample time to administratively address the \n     issues raised by various stakeholders on these corresponding \n     rules.\n       The NHSM rule, which we discussed in our meeting, aims to \n     ensure that the burning of solid waste is subject to \n     appropriate emission controls required under the Clean Air \n     Act and that exposure to harmful pollutants is minimized. We \n     understand that biomass derivatives have long been used for \n     energy purposes in the wood products industry and we believe \n     our rule allows such use to continue without being subject to \n     the CISWI standards, provided that criteria, referred to as \n     ``legitimacy'' criteria, are met.\n       Since promulgation of our rule, questions have arisen about \n     how these criteria will be applied and our goal has been to \n     ensure that the flexibility provided by the rule is in fact \n     realized. To that end, we have held several meetings with \n     industry representatives to discuss and understand their \n     concerns and to review newly available data. In addition, on \n     June 21, 2011, my Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and \n     Emergency Response, Mathy Stanislaus, met with \n     representatives of several industries that use biomass \n     derivatives and other non-hazardous secondary materials as \n     fuel to ensure that they understand the significant \n     flexibility already afforded by the rule, and to discuss the \n     EPA's concepts for further clarifying that flexibility.\n       As part of that discussion, Mr. Stanislaus explained that \n     one of the options that EPA is considering is issuing \n     clarifying guidance regarding the Agency's legitimacy \n     criteria. Such guidance is a useful tool that is often used \n     under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to \n     address these types of issues. The guidance could provide a \n     clear guidepost for comparing traditional fuels with \n     secondary materials. It potentially could clarify that \n     certain nonhazardous secondary materials would not be \n     considered\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n     solid waste when combusted and that the units combusting \n     those materials can continue to be used as fuels without \n     having to meet the CISWI standards. Mr. Stanislaus requested \n     that the industry representatives provide the Agency with \n     supporting data on traditional fuels that could further \n     inform the development of such guidance, and asked for \n     feedback on the approach he outlined. In addition to this \n     approach, the Agency is also exploring other options.\n       We recognize that stakeholders have also raised other \n     issues with the NHSM rule. We are continuing to evaluate \n     those issues expeditiously.\n       I believe we have made significant progress in addressing \n     the concerns raised by the industry. I will continue to watch \n     the issue closely and keep you informed. My goal is to bring \n     these issues to closure as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lisa P. Jackson,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Solid \n           Waste and Emergency Response,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2011.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you again for the constructive \n     dialogue regarding issues relating to EPA's Non-Hazardous \n     Secondary Materials (NHSM) rule, the Boiler Maximum \n     Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule and the Commercial \n     and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerator (CISWI) rule. In the \n     Administrator's letter of June 27, 2011 she indicated that \n     the agency is exploring various pathways to address your \n     specific concerns regarding implementation of the NHSM rule. \n     EPA is committed to issuing guidance to assist industry in \n     applying the legitimacy criteria, and had requested that \n     industry representatives provide the agency with supporting \n     data to further inform the development of such guidance.\n       We received additional information from industry and based \n     on this information and further discussions, we have \n     developed the enclosed concept paper for the development of \n     guidance. The paper identifies approaches to the guidance \n     that EPA continues to evaluate for determining whether \n     concentrations of contaminants in the NHSM are ``comparable'' \n     to concentrations of those same contaminants in traditional \n     fuels. These comparisons are important in ensuring that NHSM \n     are being legitimately recycled and are not solid wastes, as \n     well as recognizing the varied uses of such secondary \n     materials as product fuels.\n       We are optimistic about our ability to develop guidance \n     that meaningfully addresses the industry concerns and we are \n     giving it the highest priority within the agency. We intend \n     to complete internal development of draft guidance based on \n     the concept paper by August 31, 2011. In addition, we \n     continue to evaluate all available options available to \n     address the issues raised.\n       Please be assured that EPA will continue to keep you \n     informed of our progress in addressing the issues involved \n     with the NHSM rule, as well as the related Clean Air Act \n     rulemakings. If you or your staff have any questions \n     regarding the enclosed concept paper, please contact me or \n     your staff may call Carolyn Levine in EPA's Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-\n     1859.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mathy Stanislaus,\n     Assistant Administrator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/20/senate-section/article/S4727-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 571.
