Mr. President, I rise to thank Father Steven \nBoes for delivering the opening prayer this morning.\n  Father Boes has been a priest of the Archdiocese of Omaha since 1985. \nHe has more than 20 years experience as a counselor and youth advocate \nin Nebraska.\n  Father Boes served 8 years as director of the St. Augustine Indian \nMission and School in Winnebago, NE. He established programs to help \nWinnebago and Omaha children preserve their traditional language, \nspirituality, and culture while preparing them for higher education.\n  In 2005, Father Boes was named the executive director of Boys Town, \none of the largest childcare organizations in America. Boys Town \nprovides compassionate, research-proven treatment for children with \nbehavioral, emotional, and physical problems. Father Boes is the fourth \npriest to succeed Father Edward Flanagan, the founder of Boys Town.\n  As a young priest in Omaha, Father Flanagan had grown discouraged in \nhis work with transient men. His frustration led him to borrow $90 to \nrent a drafty downtown boarding house and open his first home for boys \nin 1917. Youngsters from all over Omaha soon began showing up at the \ndoorstep of Father Flanagan's Home for Boys. Father Flanagan said:\n\n       When the idea of a boys' home grew in my mind, I never \n     thought anything remarkable about taking in all of the races \n     and all of the creeds. To me, they are all God's children. \n     They are my brothers. They are children of God. I must \n     protect them to the best of my ability.\n\n  In 1921, Father Flanagan moved his boys home to a farm just outside \nof Omaha, and it soon became known as the Village of Boys Town. By the \n1930s, hundreds of boys lived there. The world learned of Father \nFlanagan's success in 1938 when he was played by Spencer Tracy in the \n``Boys Town'' Hollywood movie.\n  Boys Town began admitting girls in 1979 and established programs at \nmore than one dozen sites across the country in the mid-1980s.\n  Under the leadership of Father Boes, Boys Town has focused on \nimplementing its unique integrated continuum of care to strengthen a \nchild's mind, body, and spirit. Father Boes is also expanding Boys \nTown's role in advocating for changes to our childcare system, which is \noften fragmented, expensive, and ineffective. He has called for smarter \ninvestments and earlier interventions for at-risk children, which can \nprevent much more expensive problems for society if those children fall \nthrough the cracks. For instance, keeping a 14-year-old from dropping \nout of high school will end up saving taxpayers about $500,000 over \nthat child's lifetime. Keeping him from becoming a career criminal will \nsave as much as $5 million.\n  Almost a century ago, Father Flanagan said:\n\n       There is nothing the matter with our growing boys that \n     love, proper training, and guidance will not remedy.\n\n  Father Boes continues to carry out that mission of healing today.\n  I thank Father Boes--I know we all do--for his devotion to building \nhealthy, positive lives for children, and I thank Father Boes for his \nwords here\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nthis morning. May they indeed guide us to do what is right for America \nand the world.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2896-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I speak, the heads of the five largest \noil and gas companies in the world are testifying across the street. \nWith the country watching, these extremely wealthy CEOs of extremely \nprofitable corporations are trying to explain to the Senate and, most \nimportantly, to the American people why they still need taxpayer \nhandouts. I don't envy them because it is an impossible position to \ndefend.\n  Think about this: In just the first 3 months of this year, the oil \nindustry made $36 billion in profits alone--not revenues, profits. That \nis $12 billion a month. That is $3 billion a week. In anyone's book, \nthat is pretty good money. Meanwhile, the American taxpayers are giving \nthese same successful companies $4 billion a year. So when we take \nthese companies' profits and add in the handout you, I, and every \ntaxpayer give them, America is saying to big oil: You make $3 billion a \nweek for 52 weeks, and we will basically give you a 53rd week for free. \nEven in the strongest economies, that seems unnecessary. In this \nrecovering economy, it is downright indefensible.\n  Defending these tax breaks is such a hard thing to do that the big \noil bosses have called for backup. Most of our Republican colleagues \nhave eagerly answered the call publicly already. But there is something \nI learned in the courtroom a long time ago: When you try to defend the \nindefensible, you are left with not much of a case. That is why the \nRepublican defenders of big oil have resorted to simply making things \nup. They will tell us that without this taxpayer-funded bonus, gas \nprices will go up. They say that because they know it is a scary \nthought. Gas prices are already high. But there is a big problem with \ntheir argument: It is false. It is not true.\n  Big oil subsidies don't have a thing to do with the prices at the \npump. A report released yesterday by a nonpartisan, independent agency \nsays as much. Experts at the Congressional Research Service who wrote \nthis report don't mention it just once, they write it over and over \nagain. Here is one way CRS says it:\n\n       There is little reason to believe that the price of oil or \n     gasoline consumers face will increase.\n\n  Here is another:\n\n       Available output and prices should be unaffected.\n\n  Here is one more from the independent, nonpartisan expert report: \nTaking away big oil's tax breaks will have ``no effect on the price of \ngasoline.'' I repeat--no effect on the price of gasoline.\n  Little reason to believe prices will increase; prices should be \nunaffected; no effect on the price of gasoline--their words, not mine.\n  So the American people should know this: Every time you hear someone \ndefend taxpayer gifts to oil companies by scaring you about gas prices, \nthey are not telling the truth. Every time you hear someone say we need \nto find better uses for taxpayer money but we also need to keep giving \nbillions and billions of dollars of that same money to oil companies, \nask yourself how it is possible that both are true.\n  I am pleased to see that some of my Republican colleagues are coming \naround. The Speaker of the House recently said these companies should \nbe paying their fair share. Yesterday, the senior Senator from Arizona \nadmitted that subsidies are likely unnecessary. Even the former head of \nShell, one of the five companies testifying today, agrees.\n  If we are serious about reducing the deficit, this is an easy place \nto start. It is, in effect, a no-brainer. Taxpayer giveaways to \ncompanies pulling in record profits are the epitome of wasteful \nspending. So this is the Democrats' idea: Let's use the savings from \nthese taxpayer giveaways to drive down the deficit, not drive up oil \ncompany profits. There are no gimmicks in this legislation. It simply \nsays, let's apply this money to the deficit. These CEOs and their \ncompanies are free to make as much money as they ethically can, and \nthat is the way it should be in our great country. They just don't need \nthe help of the taxpayers of our country. They don't need our help. And \nthe country could sure use that extra $4 billion a year. It is such an \nobvious solution that it should have happened years ago.\n  Here we are with one side saying that black is black and the other \nside still insisting that black is blue. This debate would be a lot \neasier if the Republicans just came out and said what they really mean. \nThey should simply say openly that they want to protect their friends \nin big oil. I don't agree with it, but that is their right. Instead, \nthey are peddling misinformation and scare tactics. Republicans should \nat least have the decency to admit it and then let the American people \ndecide who is best representing their interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2896-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, anyone who cares about the future of \nour country should pay attention to the debate we are having right now \nin Washington. The outcome of this debate will determine whether \nAmerica goes the way of debt-ridden countries in Europe where \nunemployment is permanently high and expectations are permanently low \nor whether we will claim our role as a place where people are rewarded \nfor hard work and for taking risks.\n  This debate is important for other reasons too. Last month, one of \nthe major ratings agencies gave the United States a negative outlook. \nIt said that because of our debt, we stand a one-in-three chance of \nbeing downgraded. The consequences of that would be truly devastating, \nand so would the impact on our ability to govern. If we allow it to \nhappen, we will be admitting that America cannot solve its problems. I \nwon't accept that.\n  The fact that we have a crisis is not in doubt. Right now, America is \ntaking in about $2.2 trillion each year in tax revenues, and each year \nwe are spending about $2.2 trillion on mandatory spending programs and \nnet interest on our debt.\n  What that means is that all of the other spending--every single \ndiscretionary dollar we spend right now on\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nroads, schools, defense, food safety, environmental protection--all of \nit, every single penny is borrowed money. We do not have a dime to \nspend above and beyond the dimes we have to spend by law. If that is \nnot a fiscal crisis, I do not know what is.\n  The Democrats' solution to this crisis is simple: raise the debt \nlimit--raise the debt limit--so we can maintain the status quo. In \nfact, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers said \nin a speech yesterday that it would be ``quite insane'' to do anything \nabout the deficit while increasing the debt ceiling. That from the \nchairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers yesterday.\n  The problem with that is it is not a solution. It is the avoidance of \na solution, and that is not what the American people want. The American \npeople spoke loudly and clearly in November. They want to see changes \naround here. Washington is mortgaging their future and their children's \nfuture by spending too much. They did not speak out last November \nbecause they expected Republicans to come here and raise taxes. They \nsent Republicans here to get our fiscal house in order, and that is \nwhat we intend to do.\n  Americans are still outraged that Washington did not do something to \nprevent the last financial crisis--a crisis most people did not see \ncoming. Failing to prevent one that every one of us knows is coming is, \nof course, totally inexcusable.\n  So my message has been clear: Failing to do something about the debt \nwould be far worse in the long run than failing to raise the debt \nlimit, and that is why I am repeating my plea to the Democrats this \nmorning: The time to avert this crisis is right now. The window is \nclosing. We cannot raise the debt ceiling, as the President has \nrequested, without major spending cuts now.\n  Some have suggested we use triggers. Well, the triggers have already \nbeen pulled. What good is a fire alarm that goes off after the building \nburns down? Agreeing to a trigger is to deny this crisis. We need to \nface this problem now--not tomorrow, not after the President leaves \noffice, not after the markets collapse, not after hell breaks loose, \nnot after we lose another 3 million jobs and the housing market \ncollapses again--now, right now. Anything less would be a dereliction \nof duty and a signal to the world that America does not have the will \nto fix its problems. Republicans refuse to accept that.\n  That has been my message all along. That is a message we will be \ntaking down to the White House later this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2897-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the successful end of the 10-year manhunt \nto bring Osama bin Laden to justice has appropriately heightened the \nNation's appreciation for the diligence, patriotism, and courage of our \nArmed Forces and our intelligence community. They are a great credit \nand inspiration to the country that has asked so much of them and, like \nall Americans, I am in their debt.\n  But their success has also reignited debate over whether the so-\ncalled enhanced interrogation techniques of enemy prisoners, including \nwaterboarding, were instrumental in locating bin Laden and whether they \nare necessary and justifiable means for securing valuable information \nthat might help prevent future terrorist attacks against us and our \nallies and lead to the capture or killing of those who would perpetrate \nthem. Or are they, and should they be, prohibited by our conscience and \nlaws as torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n  I believe some of these practices--especially waterboarding, which is \na mock execution, and thus to me indisputably torture--are and should \nbe prohibited in a nation that is exceptional in its defense and \nadvocacy of human rights. I believe they are a violation of the \nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, \nand Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions, all of which forbid \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of all captured combatants, \nwhether they wear the uniform of a country or are essentially \nstateless.\n  I opposed waterboarding and similar so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques before Osama bin Laden was brought to justice, and I oppose \nthem now. I do not believe they are necessary to our success in our war \nagainst terrorists, as the advocates of these techniques claim they \nare.\n  Even more importantly, I believe that if America uses torture, it \ncould someday result in the torture of American combatants. Yes, I know \nal-Qaida and other terrorist organizations do not share our scruples \nabout the treatment of enemy combatants, and have and will continue to \nsubject American soldiers and anyone they capture to the cruelest \nmistreatment imaginable. But we must bear in mind the likelihood that \nsomeday we will be involved in a more conventional war against a state \nand not a terrorist movement or insurgency and be careful that we do \nnot set a standard that another country could use to justify their \nmistreatment of our prisoners.\n  Lastly, it is difficult to overstate the damage that any practice of \ntorture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment by Americans does to \nour national character and historical reputation--to our standing as an \nexceptional nation among the countries of the world. It is too grave to \njustify the use of these interrogation techniques. America has made its \nprogress in the world not only by avidly pursuing our geopolitical \ninterests, but by persuading and inspiring other nations to embrace the \npolitical values that distinguish us. As I have said many times before, \nand still maintain, this is not about the terrorists. It is about us.\n  I understand the reasons that govern the decision to approve these \ninterrogation methods, and I know those who approved them and those who \nemployed them in the interrogation of captured terrorists were \nadmirably dedicated to protecting the American people from harm. I know \nthey were determined to keep faith with the victims of terrorism and to \nprove to our enemies that the United States would pursue justice \ntirelessly, relentlessly, and successfully, no matter how long it took. \nI know their responsibilities were grave and urgent, and the strain of \ntheir duty was considerable. I admire their dedication and love of \ncountry. But I dispute that it was right to use these methods, which I \ndo not believe were in the best interests of justice or our security or \nthe ideals that define us and which we have sacrificed much to defend.\n  I do not believe anyone should be prosecuted for having used these \ntechniques in the past, and I agree that the administration should \nstate definitively that no one will be. As one of the authors of the \nMilitary Commissions Act, which I believe prohibits waterboarding and \nother ``enhanced interrogation techniques,'' we wrote into the language \nof the law that no one who used them before the enactment of the law \nshould be prosecuted. I do not think it is helpful or wise to revisit \nthat policy.\n\n  Many advocates of these techniques have asserted their use on \nterrorists in our custody, particularly Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, \nrevealed the trail to bin Laden--a trail which had gone cold in recent \nyears but would now lead to his destruction. The former Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, Michael Mukasey, recently claimed that \n``the intelligence that led to bin Laden . . . began with a disclosure \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, who broke like a dam under the pressure of \nharsh interrogation techniques that included waterboarding. He loosed a \ntorrent of information--including eventually the nickname of a trusted \ncourier of bin Laden.'' That is false.\n  With so much misinformation being fed into such an essential public \ndebate as this one, I asked the Director of Central Intelligence, Leon \nPanetta, for the facts, and I received the following information:\n  The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid \nSheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times. We did not first learn \nfrom Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the real name of bin Laden's courier, or \nhis alias, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti--the man who ultimately enabled us to \nfind bin Laden. The first mention of the name Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, as \nwell as a description of him as an important member of al-Qaida, came \nfrom a detainee held in another country. The United States did not \nconduct this detainee's interrogation, nor did we render him to that \ncountry for the purpose of interrogation. We did not learn Abu Ahmed's \nreal name or alias as a result of waterboarding or any ``enhanced \ninterrogation technique'' used on a detainee in U.S. custody. None of \nthe three detainees who were waterboarded provided Abu Ahmed's real \nname, his whereabouts, or an accurate description of his role in al-\nQaida.\n  In fact, not only did the use of ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques'' on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on \nbin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, it actually produced false and \nmisleading information. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed specifically told his \ninterrogators that Abu Ahmed had moved to Peshawar, got married, and \nceased his role as an al-Qaida facilitator--which was not true, as we \nnow know. All we learned about Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti through the use of \nwaterboarding and other ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' against \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was the confirmation of the already known fact \nthat the courier existed and used an alias.\n  I have sought further information from the staff of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and they confirmed for me that, in fact, the \nbest intelligence gained from a CIA detainee--information describing \nAbu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's real role in al-Qaida and his true relationship \nto Osama bin Laden--was obtained through standard, noncoercive means, \nnot through any ``enhanced interrogation technique.''\n  In short, it was not torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment of detainees that got us the major leads that ultimately \nenabled our intelligence community to find Osama bin Laden. I hope \nformer Attorney General Mukasey will correct his misstatement. It is \nimportant that he do so because we are again engaged in this important \ndebate, with much at stake for America's security and reputation. Each \nside should make its own case but do so without making up its own \nfacts.\n  For my part, I would oppose any legislation, if any should be \nproposed, that is intended to authorize the administration to return to \nthe use of waterboarding or other methods of interrogation that I \nsincerely believe are torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading, and as \nsuch unworthy of and injurious to our country. This debate is ongoing, \nbut I do not believe it will lead to a change in current policy \nprohibiting these methods.\n  Perhaps this is a debate for the history books. But it is still \nimportant because Americans in a future age, as well as their leaders, \nmight face these same questions. We should do our best to provide them \na record of our debates and decisions that is notable not just for its \npassion but for its deliberativeness and for opinions that were formed \nby facts, and formed with scrupulous care by both sides for the \nsecurity of the American people and the success of the ideals we \ncherish. We have a duty to leave future American generations with a \nhistory that will offer them not confusion but instruction as they face \ntheir crises and challenges and try to lead America safely and \nhonorably through them. Both sides cannot be right, of course, but both \nsides can be honest, diligent, and sincere.\n  Let me briefly elaborate my reasons for opposing the return to these \ninterrogation policies.\n  Obviously, to defeat our enemies we need intelligence, but \nintelligence that is reliable. We should not torture or treat \ninhumanely terrorists we have captured. I believe the abuse of \nprisoners harms, not helps, our war effort. In my personal experience, \nthe abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence but often \nproduces bad intelligence because under torture a person will say \nanything he thinks his captors want to hear--whether it is true or \nfalse--if he believes it will relieve his suffering. Often, information \nprovided to stop the torture is deliberately misleading, and what the \nadvocates of cruel and harsh interrogation techniques can never prove \nis that we could not have gathered the same intelligence through other \nmore humane means--as a review of the facts provides solid reason to be \nconfident that we can. The costs of assuming otherwise can be hugely \ndetrimental.\n\n  It has been reported, and the staff of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee confirms for me, that a man named Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi had \nbeen captured by the United States and rendered to Egypt where we \nbelieve he was tortured and provided false and misleading information \nabout Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program. That false \ninformation was ultimately included in Secretary of State Colin \nPowell's statement to the U.N. Security Council and, I assume, helped \ninfluence the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq.\n  Furthermore, I think it is supremely unfair to the men and women in \nour intelligence community and military who labored for a decade to \nlocate Osama bin Laden to claim falsely that they only succeeded \nbecause we used torture to extract actionable intelligence from a few \ndetainees several years ago. I have not found evidence to suggest that \ntorture--or since so much of our disagreement is definitional, \ninterrogation methods that I believe are torture and which I believe \nare prohibited by U.S. law and international treaty obligations we are \nnot just a party to but leading advocates of--played an important part \nin finding and killing bin Laden. Rather, I think his death at the \nhands of the United States argues quite the contrary, that we can \nsucceed without resort to these methods.\n  It is also the case that the mistreatment of enemy prisoners \nendangers our own troops who might someday be held captive. While some \nenemies, and al-Qaida surely, will never be bound by the principle of \nreciprocity, we should have concern for those Americans captured by \nmore conventional enemies if not in this war then in the next. Until \nabout 1970, North Vietnam ignored its obligations not to mistreat the \nAmericans they held prisoner, claiming that we were engaged in an \nunlawful war against them and thus not entitled to the protections of \nthe Geneva Conventions. But when their abuses became widely known and \nincited unfavorable international attention, they subsequently \ndecreased their mistreatment of our POWs.\n  Some have argued if it is right to kill bin Laden, then it should \nalso be right to torture him had he been captured rather than killed. I \ndisagree. First, the Americans who killed bin Laden were on a military \nmission against the leader of a terrorist organization with which we \nare at war. It was not a law enforcement operation or primarily an \nintelligence operation. They could not be certain that bin Laden, even \nthough he was unarmed, did not possess some means of harming them--a \nsuicide vest, for instance--and they were correctly instructed to take \nno unnecessary chances in the completion of their mission.\n  Second, bin Laden was a mass murderer. Had we captured him, he would \nhave eventually received the ultimate sanction for his terrible crimes, \nas captured war criminals in previous wars have. But war criminals \ncaptured, tried, and executed in World War II, for instance, were not \ntortured in advance of their execution, either in retaliation for their \ncrimes or to elicit information that might have helped us locate, \napprehend, and convict other war criminals. This was not done because \ncivilized nations have long made a distinction between killing and \ninjuring in the heat of combat, on the one hand, and the deliberate \ninfliction of physical torture on an incapacitated fighter on the \nother.\n  This distinction is recognized not only in longstanding American \nvalues\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nand practices but also in the Geneva Conventions that provide legal \nprotections for our own fighting men and women.\n  All of these arguments have the force of right but, ultimately, even \nthey are beside the most important point. There are many arguments to \nbe made against torture on practical grounds. As I have said, I believe \ntorture produces unreliable information, hinders our fight against \nglobal terrorism, and harms our national interest and reputation. But, \nultimately, this debate is about far more than technical or practical \nissues. It is about far more than whether torture works or does not \nwork. It is about far more than utilitarian matters.\n  Ultimately, this is about morality. What is at stake is the very idea \nof America--the America whose values have inspired the world and \ninstilled in the hearts of its citizens the certainty that no matter \nhow hard we fight, no matter how dangerous our adversary, in the course \nof vanquishing our enemies, we do not compromise our deepest values. We \nare America, and we hold our ourselves to a higher standard. That is \nwhat is at stake.\n  Although Osama bin Laden is dead, America remains at war, and to \nprevail in this war we need more than victories on the battlefield. \nThis is a war of ideas as well, a struggle to advance freedom in the \nface of terror in places where oppressive rule has bred the malevolence \nthat feeds the ideology of violent extremism. Prisoner abuses exact a \nterrible toll on us in this war of ideas. They inevitably become \npublic, and when they do they threaten our moral standard and expose us \nto false but widely disseminated charges that democracies are no more \ninherently idealistic and moral than other regimes.\n  I understand that Islamic extremists who resort to terror would \ndestroy us utterly if they could obtain the weapons to do so. But to \ndefeat them utterly, we must also prevail in our defense of the \nuniversal values that ultimately have the greatest power to eradicate \nthis evil ideology.\n  Although it took a decade to find him, there is one consolation for \nbin Laden's 10-year evasion of justice. He lived long enough to see \nwhat some are calling the Arab spring, the complete repudiation of bin \nLaden's world view and the cruel disregard for human life and human \ndignity he used to advance it. In Egypt and Tunisia, Arabs successfully \nreclaimed their rights from autocracies to determine their own destiny \nwithout resort to violence or the deliberate destruction of innocent \nlife. Now Arabs are trying valiantly, by means as just as their cause, \nto do the same in Syria and elsewhere.\n  As the United States discusses and debates what role we should play \nto influence the course of the Arab spring, can we not all agree that \nthe first and most obvious thing we can do is stand as an example of a \njust government and equal justice under the law, as a champion of the \nidea that an individual's human rights are superior to the will of the \nmajority or the wishes of the government?\n  Individuals might forfeit their life and liberty as punishment for \nbreaking laws, but even then, as recognized in our Constitution's \nprohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, they are still entitled to \nrespect for their basic human dignity, even if they have denied that \nrespect to others.\n  I do not mourn the loss of any terrorist's life, nor do I care if in \nthe course of serving their malevolent cause they suffer great harm. \nThey have earned their terrible punishment in this life and the next. \nWhat I do mourn is what we lose when by official policy or official \nneglect we allow, confuse, or encourage those who fight this war for us \nto forget that best sense of ourselves, that which is our greatest \nstrength; that when we fight to defend our security, we also fight for \nan idea, not a tribe, not a land, not a king, not a twisted \ninterpretation of an ancient religion, but for an idea that all men are \nendowed by their Creator with inalienable rights.\n  It is indispensable to our success in this war that those we ask to \nfight it know that in the discharge of their dangerous responsibilities \nto our country, they are never expected to forget they are Americans \nand the valiant defenders of a sacred idea of how nations should be \ngoverned and conduct their relations with others--even our enemies.\n  Those of us who have given them this onerous duty are obliged by our \nhistory and the many terrible sacrifices that have been made in our \ndefense to make clear to them that they need not risk our country's \nhonor to prevail, that they are always--through the violence, chaos, \nand heartache of war, through deprivation, cruelty and loss they are \nalways Americans, and different, stronger, and better than those who \nwould destroy us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1982, I was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I was elected along with the now-senior Senator from \nthe State of Arizona, John McCain. We were both part of that class of \n1982.\n  I have given a lot of speeches on this Senate floor. So has my friend \nfrom Arizona and so have all of us. Frankly, most of the speeches we \ngive may have a little bite for a day or two. But the speech just given \nby my friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, will be forever \nremembered in our country and in this body.\n  Senator McCain and I have had our differences over the years. That \ndoes not take away from the fact that we are friends. We love \nprizefighting, and we love our States that are neighbors, Arizona and \nNevada. He has an admirable record representing his party and running \nfor the Presidency of the United States and chairman of a number of \ncommittees during his tenure in the Senate. We came to the Senate \ntogether, in addition to the House of Representatives.\n  I want the record to reflect my admiration and respect--as I believe \nthe whole Senate's respect--for the speech given by this fine man from \nArizona. No one in the Senate--no one, without any qualification--could \nhave given the speech that was given today. Why? Because he speaks with \nknowledge--personal knowledge--that I am sure he still remembers in \nthose dark nights when he is trying to rest about his having been \ntortured. Here is a man who, after having been tortured brutally, \nsolitary confinement for not a week, not a month but years, was given \npermission by the North Vietnamese to go home: We will let you go home.\n  He said: I am not going home unless I go home with my colleagues who \nare in prison with me. Think about that--that concentration camp, \nbasically.\n  I wish I had the ability to express in words my admiration for what \nhe has just said because the things we do when it comes to our evil \nenemy, to say that all holds are barred does not work. The easy thing \nto do would be to say we should treat them as poorly as they treat us. \nBut it takes a resume and courage to stand and speak as my friend from \nArizona did today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I thank my very honorable friend and \nadversary for his kind remarks. I will always remember them. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will end my remarks today by reading three \nparagraphs from an op-ed that is running all over the country today, in \nnewspapers all over America, an op-ed written by Senator John McCain:\n\n       As we debate how the United States can best influence the \n     course of the Arab Spring, can't we all agree that the most \n     obvious thing we can do is stand as an example of a nation \n     that holds an individual's human rights as superior to the \n     will of the majority or the wishes of government? Individuals \n     might forfeit their life as punishment for breaking laws, but \n     even then, as recognized in our Constitution's prohibition of \n     cruel and unusual punishment, they are still entitled to \n     respect for their basic human dignity, even if they have \n     denied that respect to others.\n       All of these arguments have the force of right, but they \n     are beside the most important point. Ultimately, this is more \n     than a utilitarian debate. This is a moral debate. It is \n     about who we are.\n       I don't mourn the loss of any terrorist's life. What I do \n     mourn is what we lose when by official policy or official \n     neglect we confuse or encourage those who fight this war for \n     us to forget the best sense of ourselves.\n       Through the violence, chaos and heartache of war, through \n     deprivation and cruelty and loss, we are always Americans, \n     and different, stronger and better than those who would \n     destroy us.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will speak in morning business. Before I \ndo\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\nthat, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nNevada in paying tribute to the Senator from Arizona. Senator McCain's \nwords were both eloquent and profound, and they reflect not only his \nstrong beliefs but his own personal experience and also reflect \nsomething else that has been consistent in everything he has done in \nthe Senate; that is, his respect and deep regard for the men and women \nof the military services. His reflections today remind us of what they \nhave done and of the high standards of conduct they expect of \nthemselves and that we have to recognize also. Again, I join Senator \nReid in saluting Senator McCain for his words but, as he does so many \ntimes, for also being the conscience of the Senate on so many important \ntopics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2900-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to talk about the provisions my \ncolleagues and I have introduced to ensure that the large oil companies \nof this Nation which are receiving great tax subsidies no longer \nreceive taxpayer money to subsidize their profits, and to target those \nsavings towards deficit reduction, which is one of the great tasks \nbefore us.\n  We are seeing an extraordinary runup in gas prices. In Rhode Island, \nthe prices are exceeding $4 a gallon. These high gas prices threaten \nour economic recovery and they also put a brake on the expansion in job \ngrowth which is so necessary for all of our citizens. In fact, it is \nestimated that because of these gas prices, U.S. households will pay \nabout $825 more in 2011 for gasoline than they did last year. That is a \nbig bite out of the discretionary spending available to moderate-income \nfamilies across this country.\n  One aspect of this runup in gas prices is the role of speculation. I \nam pleased that the President responded to a letter I led suggesting \nthe appointment of a task force to look into this. He created the Oil \nand Gas Price Fraud Working Group, and under the leadership of Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder, they are looking seriously at the speculative \naspects of the runup in gas prices. Some economists estimate that \nexcessive speculation can drive up prices by as much as $1 a gallon. In \nfact, the huge retreat in the commodities market for oil last week \nsuggests that much more than just simple supply and demand is \nresponsible for these huge price increases, and we have to look \ncarefully at this.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor, along with Senator Menendez and \nseveral of my colleagues, of the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. It is \nextraordinarily ironic--and that is a mild term--to see the oil \nindustry receiving huge subsidies at a time when market prices are \nproducing what you would think would be the major incentive oil and gas \ncompanies need to explore and develop, and that incentive is the rather \nsubstantial given prices at the pump throughout the Nation. In fact, \nthese prices have transformed and turned themselves into huge profits \nfor the industry. ExxonMobil, for example, posted its biggest first-\nquarter profit in 8 years, with net income rising 69 percent, to $10.7 \nbillion. In fact, the combined profits of the big five oil companies \nwere more than $30 billion for the first quarter. Those are the kinds \nof rewards in the marketplace that suggest to everybody that the need \nfor subsidies from the government is nonexistent. Indeed, what we have \nseen, rather than using the subsidies and these excess profits to go \nout and intensify the search for new oil, is that most of this has gone \nto providing dividends or stock buybacks to stockholders. That is a \nlegitimate use of corporate money, but it really undercuts this notion \nthat these subsidies are so essential for the companies to be \ncompetitive and also necessary for the kind of activity they are \nundertaking to search for and develop new oil resources.\n  There are so many aspects of the bill that I think are positive. They \nhave been, in part or in whole, debated before. The bill ends a \ndeduction the oil industry receives for the production of oil that is \nmeant to assist American manufacturers, not oil producers. Some suggest \nthat the oil companies only discovered this tax loophole after the fact \nbut exploited it very aggressively, that it was intended for small \ncompanies that are producing physical products that could be shipped \naround the country; not for bringing in oil, reprocessing it, refining \nit, and getting a tax break. There are so many other irrational aspects \nof these subsidies that, again, the subsidies themselves have been \ncalled for a serious review, evaluation, and indeed elimination.\n  The other factor that compels us to take this step today is that we \nhave to begin to reduce the deficit. All of the resources that are \nbeing saved, we hope through this legislation, will be targeted to \ndeficit reduction. We can continue to provide the necessary support for \nour economy through a healthy oil and gas system, but not to subsidize \nan industry that does well in the marketplace, and we ought to use \nthose funds to reduce the deficit.\n  There is another aspect not directly related to the provisions \nSenator Menendez and I support, but relates to this debate. At the same \ntime as the big oil companies defend these subsidies, they are also \npushing for increased offshore drilling, but are unwilling to help \nensure that it is safe. For example, we have tried to get the oil and \ngas industry to at least pay more for the inspections that are so \nnecessary on these offshore platforms to provide for safety and prevent \nanother Deepwater Horizon explosion. The administration has proposed an \nincrease in fees oil companies pay for rig inspections from the present \nfee of $3,250 to $17,000, and the companies have balked at this. Here \nis an industry that is deriving huge tax subsidies, and obviously the \nexample of the devastating Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill has \nraised serious concerns about the ability to manage and safely develop \nsome of these offshore platforms, and essentially they are saying: No, \nwe are not going to pay more for the inspection fees that are \nnecessary.\n  The total increase is minimal. In fact, let me give a comparison. BP, \nBritish Petroleum, would be asked to pay about $1.5 million in fees, if \nthis new fee structure were in effect, for their offshore platforms. \nThat would represent about 0.01 percent of the $10.9 billion in \nrevenues from the Gulf of Mexico last year. Yet the companies are \nsaying no. When it comes to paying their fair share for inspections \nthat directly benefit them, provide further confidence to the public \nthat their operations are successful, and give them, frankly, more \nconfidence in allowing or encouraging further offshore drilling, they \nsay no. But when it comes to tax subsidies that benefit their bottom \nline, they say yes, yes, yes.\n  I think what we have to do is press forward to ensure that these tax \nsubsidies are revoked, and dedicate these tax subsidies to deficit \nreduction. In that way, we can let the market decide on the success or \nfailure of these companies. That is one of the mantras I hear so often \nfrom many here, particularly from my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. I think it can be done without in any way impacting the cost \nof fuel in the United States.\n  I think, frankly, what we are seeing--going back to my initial \npoint--is that there are factors beyond tax subsidies that are driving \nup the cost of fuel: speculation; issues of the international exchange; \nthe value of the dollar. But it is quite clear, given our dependency--\nand we have to get off that dependency on oil--that there will be a \nrobust market for petroleum products in this country for the \nforeseeable future. That market alone justifies increased exploration, \nresearch, and other activity, and it will reward the companies. These \nsubsidies are not necessary. Instead of wasting taxpayer money on \nsubsidizing big oil profits, it is time we close these loopholes and \nreturn the savings to the American taxpayer. With that, I urge rapid \nsupport and favorable support of Senator Menendez's legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there was a column written in this \nmorning's\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\nWashington Post which was extraordinary. It was written by one of our \nRepublican colleagues, Senator John McCain of Arizona.\n  John McCain and I came to the House of Representatives in the same \nyear--1983. Though he came to the Senate first, we have worked on many \nthings together over the years. We have our differences, that is for \nsure. But there are times when John does extraordinarily good things, \nand this morning was one of them. He wrote a column in the Washington \nPost about the issue of torture. It is an issue that has been in the \nheadlines for the last 2 weeks, after the capture and killing of Osama \nbin Laden and the questions raised as to whether so-called enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, or torture in another parlance, were used to \nobtain information that led to Osama bin Laden.\n  A few years ago, that issue came up on the floor of the Senate. I had \nstrong feelings about it. But Senator McCain stepped up and led the \neffort to put the Senate and our government on record that we were \nopposed to the use of torture. No person is better qualified in this \nCongress to speak to it than Senator McCain. He was a victim of torture \nhimself when he served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam war. He was \nshot down as a naval aviator and spent more than 5 years in prison. I \ncannot imagine what that must have been like. Couple that with the \nsevere physical injuries he still labors with today and the torture--\nmental and physical--that accompanied it, and no person is as well \nqualified as Senator McCain to speak to it.\n  This morning, in the Washington Post, he once again stated what may \nnot be the popular view but I believe is the right view--that the \nUnited States should make it clear we do not accept torture as a \nstandard for our conduct when it comes to dealing with our enemies. For \nthe longest time, that has been our standard. It was only relaxed or \nchanged after 9/11, when some in a previous administration argued that \nwas the only way to get information from these hard-core terrorists.\n  Senator McCain made a good point in his article this morning in the \nWashington Post. He asked Leon Panetta, head of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, whether there was any linkage to these enhanced \ninterrogation techniques and the information that led to the disclosure \nof the messenger who was then linked to Osama bin Laden which led to \nhis capture. Leon Panetta said no, and McCain revealed that in his \narticle. In fact, the information which came out of waterboarding one \nof these terrorists ended up being just plain wrong. Senator McCain \nmade the point in his article, when you are being tortured, you will \nsay almost anything to make the torture stop. You will lie, if you have \nto, just to make it stop. That is what happened here.\n  So I wish to commend him. It was courageous for him to write that \narticle this morning--not very popular but right. I wish to thank John \non behalf of both sides of the Senate aisle for his leadership and for \nhaving the courage to speak out on such an important issue relative to \nthe values of America and who we are.\n  He ended his column talking about how we would expect our troops to \nbe treated if they were taken prisoner. If anyone tortured an American \nsoldier, I don't know of a single American who wouldn't step forward \nand say it is an outrage. Well, if we are going to stand for humane \ntreatment, sensible treatment of detainees, then we are doing it not \nonly to protect our values but to protect our men and women who serve \nthis country both in the intelligence agencies and in the military \nservices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2901-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2901-S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             OIL SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, an issue is going to come up next week \nwhich is very important for every American family and business; that \nis, the issue of gasoline prices. I have been across my State, and as I \nmentioned on the floor earlier, my expert on gasoline prices is my \nwife. When I speak to her in the morning in Springfield, IL, she will \ntell me the latest in gasoline prices. Last week, it was $4.20 a \ngallon. I don't know what it is this week. But what she asks me is--as \neveryone in Illinois must ask--what are you going to do about it?\n  It turns out we are going to do something. It may not have a direct \nimpact on gas prices, but it certainly has a direct impact on our \npolicy toward oil companies. You see, American families are being \nclobbered three times by high prices at gasoline stations: first, at \nthe pump; second, when we give $4 billion in subsidies every year in \nthe Tax Code to oil companies; and third, when we have to borrow the \nmoney from China to give to these oil companies and we end up paying \ninterest to China--ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren.\n  Paying three times for outrageous gasoline prices is an outrage \nitself. The big oil companies have made almost $1 trillion in profits \nover the last 10 years--over $35 billion in the first 3 months of this \nyear. Some of these oil companies are breaking records on Wall Street \nfor corporate profits. The Wall Street Journal also reported last week \nthat the CEOs of oil and gas companies who are appearing before the \nSenate Finance Committee today had the highest median compensation--at \n$13.7 million annually in 2010, up 17.3 percent from the year before.\n  In addition to the profits, the oil industry receives over $4 billion \nin tax giveaways each year. Instead of using that money to lower prices \nat the pump, these giveaways have merely been used to pad the profits \nand the compensation of the oil companies and their executives. \nYesterday, Senator Menendez introduced a bill, which I am cosponsoring, \nto end the special treatment of tax breaks given to the five largest \noil companies in America. This would save Americans over $4 billion a \nyear, and it is our goal to use that money to reduce our Nation's \ndeficit.\n  Americans across the board agree it is time to end this corporate \nwelfare for the big oil companies. In a recent poll, three out of four \nAmericans support eliminating tax credits for the oil and gas \nindustries to reduce the Federal deficit. We have to deal with our \ndeficit that is growing at an unsustainable rate, and I am hoping this \nwill be a commonsense, good-faith, bipartisan agreement to end these \nsubsidies. We can take the taxpayer dollars flowing to the oil \ncompanies and give them, instead, to those who are dealing with our \ndeficit to reduce it.\n  Incidentally, we are not talking about business expenses at these oil \ncompanies, which is what many of these executives would like to have \npeople think. These are subsidies used to increase profits and reduce \ntheir tax burden. Last year, Exxon had an effective tax rate on its \nU.S. income of 16 percent--less than half the corporate tax rate. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the average American has \nan effective tax rate of over 20 percent. So Exxon was actually paying \na lower tax rate on their profits than the average American pays on \ntheir income.\n  In addition, the big five oil companies have used 71 percent of their \nprofits not for exploration and production, which is what they would \nlike you to think, but rather for boosting share prices. Actually, they \nused only 12 percent of their prices for exploration and new \ndevelopment. In other words, these oil companies spend almost six times \nas much on dividends and stock buybacks as they do in looking for new \nsources of oil. The primary use of these subsidies is not to discover \nnew oil, it is to discover new record-breaking profits.\n  It is time for government handouts to these extremely profitable, \nwell-established companies to come to an end. Ending them will not \nraise gas prices, as some Republicans have argued. We are dealing with \na world market for oil. The price is set by the global market. Gasoline \nprices have risen significantly, even with these subsidies in \nplace. Removing them will not change these prices.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service has said the effects of removing \nthe subsidies would be very small. According to the Department of the \nTreasury, removing them would cause the loss of less than one-tenth of \n1 percent of the global oil supply and have little or no impact on \nprices in the United States.\n  In addition, removing oil subsidies reduces U.S. oil production by \nless than one-half of 1 percent, and it will increase exploration and \nproduction costs by less than 2 percent for companies that are making \nrecord-breaking profits.\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  Removing these subsidies will not affect the price of gasoline, nor \nwill increasing our domestic production. That is the other thing. \nRemember the chant ``drill baby drill''? It was all over the place \nduring the last Presidential campaign. In fact, domestic oil production \nin 2010 was at the highest it has been in 7 years. Even with production \nstrongly increasing, oil prices keep going up, and so do gas prices.\n  Keep in mind, the United States has less than 2 percent of the \nworld's proven oil reserves and every year we use 25 percent of the \nworld's oil production. Even though we have increased production, we \nstill see prices going up. Our fuel price would not be altered by \nincreased drillings. We would still need to import over 50 percent of \nour oil.\n  As has been said many times: We can't drill ourselves out of this \nproblem. We simply don't have enough oil. The only way to end our \ndependence and insulate ourselves from high gas prices is to finally \ndevelop for America a national energy policy. Other countries have one. \nWe don't. We need a sound, comprehensive policy that includes plans for \nenergy efficiency and new renewable sources. Increased drilling is not \ngoing to significantly reduce gas prices.\n  Actually, Congress has taken another step to help consumers bring \nprices under control at the gas pumps. Last year, Congress voted to \nreform the swipe fee that big banks get paid from merchants on debit \ncard transactions. So every time you fill the tank and swipe your debit \ncard, you are paying, on average, 40 cents or more to the bank for the \nswiping of that card. What we have done is to say the Federal Reserve \nshould establish a reasonable and proportional level for that fee. They \nthink it should be much less than 40 cents.\n  The big banks and credit card companies are screaming bloody murder. \nThe notion that the gas company, the convenience store, the retailer, \nthe restaurant, the hotel would not have to pay these high swipe fees \nmeans a loss in profits to the big banks. But what it means to \nconsumers is more competition in price and lower prices. As long as you \nhave a competitive market--one gas station across the street from \nanother--when you reduce the cost to the owner of the gas station, you \nare more likely to see a reduction in the prices charged to consumers.\n  I received a letter on Tuesday from 52 national, regional, and State \ntrade associations representing virtually all the gas retailers in \nAmerica. They made it clear swipe fees inflate gasoline prices and that \nbecause the gas retailing industry is extremely competitive, lower \nswipe fees will produce savings that will be passed on to consumers.\n  The big banks and credit card companies are trying to stop this \nreform. You can understand that. These credit card companies and big \nbanks make over $1 billion a month on what they charge for our using a \ndebit card. If you bring it down to an actual reasonable and \nproportional cost, they will make less, merchants will get more, and \nconsumers will pay less.\n  There is a movement to try to delay this for a so-called study of 30 \nmonths. I did the calculation. Thirty months times the profits the big \nbanks and credit card companies will take out of the existing swipe fee \ncomes to about $40 billion that is going to be taken out of the \nAmerican economy if we agree to a 2\\1/2\\- or 3-year delay of this. That \nis not fair to consumers, it doesn't help the economy, and it doesn't \nhelp bring down gasoline prices.\n  American families can't afford to continue paying for high gasoline \nprices at the pump, in subsidies to oil companies, and in interest paid \non money borrowed from other governments to help us pay these \nsubsidies. It is time to end these handouts to the big profitable oil \ncompanies. It is time to rein in the swipe fee that is benefitting the \nbiggest banks in America as well as the credit card companies. It is \ntime to finally focus on families and consumers across America who have \na challenge today because of this increase in cost.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated May 10, 2011.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 10, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Our associations represent virtually \n     every part of the retail industry selling motor fuels in the \n     United States. Like many Americans, we are concerned about \n     the price of gasoline today. Not only are rising prices bad \n     for our customers, but when the price of gasoline rises, \n     retailers make less money. That might not make sense at first \n     glance, but the retail sale of gasoline is extremely price \n     competitive. Retailers put their prices on large signs that \n     motorists can see as they drive. Studies have shown that \n     customers will drive out of their way just to save one or two \n     cents per gallon. As a result, when the wholesale price of \n     gasoline rises, retailers cannot raise prices to consumers \n     fast enough to keep pace.\n       This is one of the many reasons why the swipe fees paid by \n     our industry are so offensive. Swipe fees are fixed centrally \n     by the credit card giants for both debit and credit cards as \n     a fixed fee plus a percentage of the transaction. That means \n     the fee retailers pay to sell gasoline goes up every time the \n     price of gasoline goes up. While gasoline retailers make less \n     money on rising prices, they pay higher and higher fees. That \n     simply is not fair.\n       With gasoline nearing $4 per gallon, debit swipe fees \n     average about 6 cents per gallon--and credit swipe fees are \n     about 8 cents per gallon. Our customers worry about every \n     extra penny they pay for gasoline and 6 to 8 cents extra is \n     far too much money. To put these huge fees in perspective, \n     consider that every penny per gallon change in the retail \n     price of gasoline costs consumers an additional $3.75 million \n     per day or $1.38 billion each year.\n       The surest and swiftest way to reduce gas prices, however, \n     is to let the Durbin amendment and the Federal Reserve's rule \n     implementing it take effect on time. Doing that will reduce \n     the fees gasoline retailers pay, and the EIA definitively \n     concluded in a 2003 report that gasoline retailers pass \n     through 100 percent of cost reductions in the form of lower \n     gasoline prices. That means lower debit swipe fees will lead \n     to lower gas prices.\n       Senator Tester's bill (S. 575) would do the opposite. It \n     would stop swipe fee relief for two years and keep pushing up \n     gas prices. That same 2003 EIA study found that cost \n     increases get passed along in the form of higher gas prices. \n     Therefore, a vote for S. 575 is a vote for two years of \n     higher gas prices than anyone should be paying.\n       There are many reasons why reform is needed now to limit \n     the price-fixing by credit card giants and banks on debit \n     swipe fees. While some of those reasons might be subject to \n     debate, it is hard for any of us in the business of gasoline \n     retailing to understand why--given the pricing pressures we \n     and our customers all face today--any Senator would vote for \n     two years of higher gas prices when some relief is only a \n     couple of months away. We urge you in the strongest terms to \n     vote against S. 575, a bill that will keep gas prices too \n     high.\n           Sincerely,\n         NACS--National Association of Convenience Stores; NATSO--\n           National Association of Truck Stop Operators; PMAA--\n           Petroleum Marketers Association of America; IGMA--\n           Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America; \n           P & Convenience Marketers of Alabama; \n           APMA--Arizona Petroleum Marketers Association; AOMA--\n           Arkansas Oil Marketers Association, Inc.; CIOMA--\n           California Independent Oil Marketers Association; \n           CWPMA--Colorado Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n           Store Association; ICPA--Independent Connecticut \n           Petroleum Association FPMA--Florida Petroleum Marketers \n           & Convenience Store Association, Inc.; GOA--Georgia \n           Oilmen's Association; HPMA--Hawaii Petroleum Marketers \n           Association; IPM Petroleum Marketers and \n           Convenience Store Association; IPMA/IACS--Illinois \n           Petroleum Marketers Association/Illinois Association of \n           Convenience Stores; IPCA--Indiana Petroleum Marketers \n           and Convenience Store Association, Inc.; PMCI--\n           Petroleum Marketers & Convenience Stores of Iowa; \n           PMCA--Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store \n           Association of Kansas; KPMA--Kentucky Petroleum \n           Marketers Association; LOMACS--Louisiana Oil Marketers \n           and Convenience Store Association; MODA--Maine Energy \n           Marketers Association; MPAMACS--Michigan Petroleum \n           Association/Michigan Association of Convenience Stores; \n           MAPDA--Mid-Atlantic Petroleum Distributors' \n           Association; MPM--Minnesota Petroleum Marketers \n           Association; MPMCSA--Mississippi Petroleum Marketers & \n           Convenience Stores Association; MPCA--Missouri \n           Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association; \n           MPMCSA--Montana Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n           Store Association; NCPA--Nebraska Petroleum Marketers & \n           Convenience Store Association; NPM \n           Petroleum Marketers & Convenience Store Association; \n           NEFI--New England Fuel Institute; IOMANE--Independent \n           Oil Marketers Association of New England; FMANJ--Fuel \n           Merchants Association of New Jersey; NMPMA--New Mexico \n           Petroleum Marketers Association;\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\n           ESPA--Empire State Petroleum Association, Inc.

DALEY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you were to have visited the city of \nChicago in the last 50 years and someone had asked you the name of the \nmayor and you said Daley, you would have been right about 90 percent of \nthe time because for 42 of the last 55 years there has been a Richard \nDaley as mayor of Chicago. Monday marks the end of that era, when \nRichard M. Daley steps down as the current mayor after six terms in \noffice. He has led Chicago for 22 years and 8 months, 5 months longer \nthan his dad and longer than any mayor in Chicago's history.\n  I know Rich Daley pretty well. We started together in politics. He \nwas a State senator and I was a staff attorney to the Illinois State \nSenate back in 1970s. Back then, he was a young father with a young \nfamily, brand new to public life. I worked for him on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and I got to know him sitting next to him for many \nhours of hearings, watching his reaction to ideas, measuring the man.\n  He and his wife Maggie were going through a tough time then. They had \na little baby who was very sick and eventually passed away. It was an \nemotionally draining experience for the whole family and those of us \nwho worked closely with him felt the sense of loss that he and his \nfamily experienced. But he is an extraordinary man.\n  Richard Michael Daley was born in 1942, the fourth of seven children, \nand the eldest son of Richard J. Daley and Sis Daley. His father, who \nran Chicago from 1955 until his death in 1976, was one of the most \npowerful big city mayors America has ever known.\n  Rich Daley grew up in a modest red brick house in Bridgeport, a \nstoried Irish neighborhood of blue-collar bungalows on the south side \nof Chicago. The famine Irish immigrants who settled the neighborhood in \nthe 19th century called it ``Hardscrabble.''\n  Rich Daley's mom and dad taught the kids that family always comes \nfirst. His father, even as mayor, made a practice of eating dinner \nevery night at home with his family, with very few exceptions.\n  Mayor Daley introduced his kids to politics at an early age. Often \nafter dinner he bundled them up and put them in the car and took them \nto ward meetings he was attending, so I guess politics is in the Daley \nblood.\n  One brother, Bill, is now President Obama's Chief of Staff. He served \nas U.S. Commerce Secretary under President Clinton. Another brother, \nJohn Daley, is a Cook County commissioner. In Chicago's De La Salle \nHigh School, which Rich Daley attended, his nickname was ``Mayor.'' No \nsurprise. In his yearbook he said his ambition was to become a ``great \nlawyer and a politician.''\n  His family name may have helped open some doors to his dreams, but \nthen he had to make a name for himself. As he once told a reporter, his \nfather said to him: ``I can put you on the ballroom floor, but you have \nto dance yourself.''\n  He started his political life as a delegate to the convention that \nrewrote Illinois' constitution in 1970. Two years later, he was elected \nto the Illinois State Senate in a landslide. As a senator, he steered \nto passage important mental health and nursing home reforms. He pushed \nfor laws to combat child abuse and drug abuse--and against a sales tax \non food and medicine.\n  In 1980, he was elected Cook County State's attorney. As the county's \nchief prosecutor, he earned a reputation for law and order. He tripled \nthe number of African-American prosecutors in the office and was \nreelected twice. He first ran for mayor in 1983. After finishing last \nin a three-way primary, he considered getting out of politics. Thank \ngoodness, he changed his mind. He got a second chance to run for mayor \nin 1989, in a special election to finish the unexpired term of \nChicago's beloved first African-American mayor, Harold Washington. That \ntime, he won with 56 percent of the vote, and took the oath of office \non April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday. He would go on to be reelected \nfive times, never with less than 60 percent of the vote.\n  Richard Daley's vision has always been clear: To make Chicago one of \nthe best cities in the world. And he has pursued that goal with fierce \ndetermination. His leadership helped transform Chicago from a rustbelt \nmanufacturing center to a cultural and commercial center that the \nGlobal Cities Index calls the sixth-most global city in the world, \nalongside New York, London, and Hong Kong.\n  Richard Daley is funny, blunt, impatient, emotional, and notoriously \ndemanding--especially of his staff. Like his father, he is a hands-on \nmanager. Whenever he sees anything that needs attention--a pothole, \ngraffiti--he makes a note on a blue slip of paper and then calls \ndepartment heads to make sure the problems are fixed.\n  His tenure includes some disappointments--most recently, the city's \nfailed bid to bring the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games to Chicago. \nBut we gave it our best try. But it also includes far more remarkable \nsuccesses.\n  He travelled the world promoting Chicago. He helped bring new jobs \nand new vitality to the Greater Loop, the economic heart of Chicago. \nThe Daley years brought the expansion of McCormick Place, the ongoing \nmodernization of O'Hare International Airport, the redevelopment of \nSoldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears, and the transformation of \nNavy Pier into one of the city's top tourist attractions. Mayor Daley \npushed bravely for sensible gun laws. It is understandable. Too many \ntimes he has had to attend the funerals of policemen and other people \nin the city who were gunned down by gun violence from gangs and other \nsources.\n  Mayor Daley has worked relentlessly to make Chicago the most livable \nbig-city in America and the most environmentally friendly city in the \nworld. During his tenure, Chicago created a comprehensive plan to help \nlower greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. The city \nplanted more than 600,000 trees and built more than 600 green roofs \ncovering more than 7 million square feet, more than any other city in \nAmerica. New flower beds now line the sidewalks and medians.\n  Downtown, a 24-acre expanse that was once an eyesore of tangled rail \nlines is now Millennium Park, one of the most magnificent city parks in \nthe world, an emerald-green showcase for music, recreation, art and \ndesign.\n  In 1995, Mayor Daley made his boldest and riskiest political move. He \nasked the State legislature for control and responsibility of Chicago's \npublic schools. When a political ally told him that taking on the \nschools ``could be the end of your career,'' the mayor replied, ``If I \ncan't do that for the children of Chicago, then I should not be \nmayor.'' Underperforming schools were closed, new schools were opened. \nTest scores went up, and dropout rates were down, and some of the most \ninnovative educators in America led the Chicago public school system \nforward. The mayor would be the first to tell you we still have a long \nway to go. But were it not for his determination and his accepting the \nresponsibility the school system would not be as good as it is today.\n  In 1999, the city took control of the Chicago Housing Authority, \nrazed some of the most notorious public high-rises in the country--\nplaces like the Robert Taylor Homes and Cabrini-Green--and replaced \nthem with mixed-income housing--safe, clean houses.\n  Richard Daley's greatest success is the sense of common purpose he \nhas\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\ngiven Chicago. A recent Chicago Tribune summed it up well. It said:\n\n       What distinguished Richard M. Daley from many big-city \n     mayors is his remarkable if impossible-to-complete work to \n     barrow racial chasms that, during the 1980s, threatened to \n     swallow Chicago. He has done that not with anguished speeches \n     or paeans to social justice, but by projecting a strong sense \n     of fairness in the way he does his job. As a result, he has \n     persuaded many Chicagoans, of many hues, to pull together in \n     the same direction: Up.\n\n  Edward Bedore, who served as budget director under both Mayor Daleys, \ntold the Sun Times: ``One was a builder, the other completed the \nhouse.''\n  In 2005, Time magazine named Richard Daley one of ``the five best \nbig-city mayors.'' NPR's Scott Simon said it well: ``He was his \nfather's son, but he became his own man.''\n  Among Mayor Daley's most cherished childhood memories is going to the \nWhite Sox games with his dad and brothers at Comiskey Park. One of my \nfavorite memories of Richard Daley also involves the White Sox. It was \nOctober 26, 2005--Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, White Sox against \nthe Houston Astros.\n  Mayor Daley was in Washington for business and I had invited him and \nthe members of the Illinois congressional delegation to my office in \nthe Capitol to watch the game. Everyone came, including our new \nSenator, now the President of the United States.\n  What a game. The White Sox finally won it 7-5 with a home run in the \n14th inning. They would go on to win the series. That game was the \nlongest World Series game in history: 5 hours 41 minutes. As the night \nwore on, almost everybody trailed away--but not Rich Daley. I have a \nphoto of the handful of us who stuck it out until the very end. \nStanding in the middle, the happiest man in the photo, is Mayor Daley.\n  That's the Richard M. Daley way: No matter how long it takes, you \ngive it your all until the game is won.\n  On Monday, Chicago will enter a new era: The post-Daley era. We will \nwelcome a passionate, talented, new mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Like so many \nother cities, Chicago is struggling involving the recession and a large \ndeficit. Fortunately, Mayor Emanuel will also inherit a legacy of unity \nand progress that that will continue to benefit Chicagoans for \ngenerations to come.\n  As one reported noted, ``The Daley name is so synonymous with Chicago \npolitics, it might as well be stitched into the city flag.''\n  The legacy Rich Daley has created in Chicago is going to live on, in \nthe improved lives of the people who live in that great city. His \nlegacy will live on in the wonderment of so many people who visit and \nwhose first words about the city are always, ``I couldn't get over how \nclean it is.'' I tell you it doesn't happen by accident. It takes the \nleadership of a mayor and a great first lady, Maggie Daley, who made it \nhappen.\n  To quote from the Tribune editorial which I mentioned earlier, ``When \nthis community, this Nation, needed to know that a city could come back \nfrom economic decline and tribal conflict, he delivered. For that, \nMayor Daley, we thank you.''\n  I also want to offer my personal thanks for his friendship and the \ngreat opportunity to work together over the years. Loretta, my wife, \nand I had an opportunity a couple of weeks ago to go out to dinner with \nthe mayor and Maggie. It is something we have been planning for a long \ntime and we had a great night. We were over on Clark Street at the Naha \nRestaurant. The windows were open and I watched as everybody walked on \nby and stopped to look inside at the mayor and the first lady. They \nknow him because he is Chicago.\n  I also want to say kind words about the Daley children, Nora, \nPatrick, Elizabeth, and Kevin, for sharing their husband and father \nwith us.\n  I will close by saying that we attend the same church in Chicago. It \nis called Old Saint Pat's. Last St. Patrick's Day was the mayor's big \nday. Maggie, who has been struggling with some health issues, made it \nthat day and the church was packed. Everybody was wearing shamrocks and \ngreen ties. The Irish dancers were there for a great celebration of \nSaint Patrick's Day. Luckily for the Daleys, their grandkids were also \nthere, little kids scrambling all over the church pews, waiting in \nanxious anticipation for the end of the mass because at the end of the \nmass the mayor's favorite, the Shannon Rovers bagpipe band, marched \nright up the front aisle of the church and the kids were brimming with \nexcitement as they came up the aisle.\n  I captured a picture on my cell phone, which I sent to the mayor and \nhis wife, of their grandkids in anticipation of the bagpipe band \narriving. I value it and I am sure that family values it too. We value \nMayor Daley and his great family. They have made Chicago a better place \nand the United States a better nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

Madam President, I come to the floor today to support \nthe Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act and to talk about the devastating \neffect that high prices at the pump are having on families in my home \nState of Washington.\n  Middle-class families and small business owners are still struggling. \nOur economy is just starting to turn around, but so many families are \nstill fighting to stay in their homes, so many small business owners \nare still struggling to keep their doors open, and so many workers are \nstill desperately trying to get back on the job. All of this is \nhappening while we are here debating in Congress about the best ways to \ncut spending responsibly and rein in the deficit.\n  This is a serious issue. We need to get it done. But I feel very \nstrongly that before we make budget cuts that slash support for our \nmiddle-class families, we should look at ways to responsibly reduce the \ndeficit that do not hurt the families who are struggling the most. To \nme, one of the most commonsense actions we can take is to end the \nwasteful subsidies that we, the taxpayers, are forced to hand over to \nthe big oil companies every year. It is a no-brainer.\n  Anyone who is serious about reducing the deficit should support this \neffort. It is as simple as that. The big oil companies are already \nmaking billions of dollars in profits from families in America who are \npaying now sky-high prices at the pump. In fact, the five biggest oil \ncompanies have made nearly $1 trillion in profits--$1 trillion in \nprofits--in the last decade and $36 billion in the first 3 months of \nthis year alone.\n  But the big oil companies are not just making money hand over fist \nfrom families paying sky-high prices at the pump. They also have the \ngall to come back to those same taxpayers and demand billions more in \nsubsidies that add directly to their profits. It does not make any \nsense, and it has to end.\n  I think my colleagues in the Senate who oppose this legislation need \nto explain to the American people why they think big oil companies need \neven bigger profits and why they think American taxpayers should \ncontinue to pad their coffers with unwarranted subsidies at the very \ntime we are fighting to rein in the deficit.\n  But in addition to ending those wasteful subsidies to the big oil \ncompanies, we also have to act to end the speculation that is a big \npart of what is pushing prices at the pump higher and higher. At a time \nwhen our household budgets are already stretched so thin, speculators \ncontinue to drive up those prices and volatility in the oil markets. \nThat is one of the reasons I was so angry and disappointed that the \nHouse Republican budget proposal slashed the funding for the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. That is the very agency that is charged \nwith protecting consumers from excessive speculation in the markets. \nHow can they do their job and protect consumers if they are not there?\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\n  I think that says a lot about our very different priorities in \nCongress. The House majority has pushed to slash spending by crippling \nagencies that middle-class families depend on for basic protections, \nwhile Democrats are here trying to reduce the deficit responsibly by \nending subsidies to the big oil companies that do not need them.\n  I urge our colleagues to put taxpayers in the middle class ahead of \nBig Oil, to end those wasteful giveaways to oil companies, and to use \nthat money to pay down the deficit in a responsible way.\n  I thank Senators Menendez, McCaskill, Tester, and Brown for their \ngreat work on this issue.\n  Once again, I support the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. I am going \nto keep fighting to end the oil and gas speculation that is hurting so \nmany families in my home State of Washington and across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nWashington State for her leadership on this issue and for her eloquent \nremarks just now, as well as other Senators who have championed this \ncause, as I have, over years when we have fought rising gasoline prices \nin the State of Connecticut relentlessly and tirelessly, and now I rise \nhere in support of this legislation, the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes \nAct, which would fundamentally restore fairness to our markets and tax \nsystem.\n  Over the last decades, the big five oil companies have taken home \nabout $1 trillion in profits while enjoying tens of billions of dollars \nin taxpayer subsidies, giveaways, sweetheart deals, and preferences \nwhich undermine the credibility of our tax system and our economy in \nthe eyes of ordinary Americans. Ordinary Americans, in fact, are still \nstruggling to make ends meet, to stay in their homes, to keep their \nfamilies together, and to find jobs.\n  In Connecticut, the price of gasoline now has risen to more than \n$4.25 a gallon from about $3 just a year ago. There are a number of \nways to combat the spiraling cost of gasoline, including going after \nsome of the illegal manipulation and speculation that may be occurring. \nI have proposed some measures--for example, a Department of Justice \ninvestigation that for the first time would effectively and \ncomprehensively pursue the traders and hedge funds that are at an \nalltime high in their energy positions.\n  But the ending of giveaways and subsidies is about the fairness of \nour economic system and our Tax Code. Our families and businesses in \nConnecticut are paying these higher costs for gasoline but at the same \ntime are providing subsidies that are in no way needed for exploration \nor refining or any part of the business of these big five oil \ncompanies. They have made over $30 billion in profits in the first \nquarter of this year alone, representing a 50-percent increase in \nprofit from last year. Big Oil doesn't need help from American \ntaxpayers to make unprecedented profits. For better or worse, they know \nhow to do it without corporate welfare, and we ought to end the \ncorporate welfare that makes our job of cutting the deficit and reining \nin the debt and reducing the size of government all the more difficult.\n  This call ought to be an easy one. We have difficult choices ahead in \ncutting spending and perhaps increasing revenue, but this one should be \neasy for us. I hope it will attract bipartisan support because there is \ntruly nothing partisan about this kind of corporate welfare.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, ending these subsidies will not \nincrease prices at the pump. It will impose basic fairness because \nAmericans will no longer pay out of pocket for these tax breaks and \ngiveaways to some of the most profitable companies in the world. It \nwill not add to prices at the pump.\n  In my home State of Connecticut and across the country, people are \nrightly concerned about reducing our debt and deficit, and we will make \nthose difficult choices just as Americans are making difficult choices \nin tightening their belts and their budgets as they struggle to find \njobs and make ends meet. But as resources remain scarce for some of our \nmost vital programs, we can ill-afford this kind of corporate welfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to seize this moment, to cut these subsidies, \nand to protect the hard-earned dollars of American taxpayers. Taxpayers \nin Connecticut and throughout the country basically want fairness--\nshared sacrifice, truly shared sacrifice--and I urge my colleagues to \ndemonstrate to the American people that we are serious about tackling \nunfair giveaways and to take this step toward restoring fairness.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I just met in a room near the \nSenate floor with doctors and others from three of America's great \nchildren's hospitals: Rainbow Children's Hospital in Cleveland, \nNationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, and Cincinnati Children's \nHospital. I think Ohio leads the Nation in the number of children's \nhospitals and, frankly, I think the quality of children's hospitals.\n  There are so much we need to do--I know the Presiding Officer from \nNorth Carolina sits on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and has had an interest in this--where we don't quite focus \nenough attention on children's health. In the past, when we did \nresearch in this country--and we are only now beginning to change \nthis--we used to think about children as just small adults, and if you \nneeded X milligrams in a prescription for a 150-pound adult, for a 30-\npound child you gave them one-fifth as much. We now realize that is not \nthe way we should do research or practice medicine. So we have seen a \nlot of progress, and much of that comes from the activism, if you will, \nof doctors and nurses and administrators at Nationwide Children's in \nColumbus, Cincinnati Children's, and Rainbow Children's in Cleveland, \naffiliated with the University Hospital.\n  We have been able, through a longtime program--about a dozen years \nold now--to do something called children's gradual medical education in \ntraining pediatricians. We have also seen it find its way into making \npharmaceuticals--something called 340B--and getting pharmaceuticals, \nparticularly for orphan drugs and rare diseases, to children's \nhospitals, which helps many small children in this country.\n  We are also working on legislation--and Kit Bond, the Republican \nSenator from Missouri who retired in January, and I worked on this--to \nreally focus on pediatric research and designate a handful of \nchildren's hospitals--maybe 15 or 20--around the country, some of the \nbest research hospitals, to get them more focused on children's \nresearch because even though we have done better, we are not doing well \nenough, and this is an opportunity to do that.\n  So I wanted to share on the floor with my colleagues the importance \nof this legislation, the importance of that focus on children's \nhospitals, the importance of training pediatricians, and the importance \nof children's hospitals overall to our Nation's health, especially as \nregards the future of our Nation and our children.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, everybody knows this country faces a \nmajor deficit crisis and we have a national debt of over $14 trillion. \nWhat has not been widely discussed, however, is how we got into this \nsituation in the first place. A huge deficit and huge national debt did \nnot happen by accident. It did not happen overnight. It happened, in \nfact, as a result of a number of policy decisions made in recent years \nand votes that were cast right here on the floor of the Senate and in \nthe House.\n  Let's never forget, as we talk about the deficit situation, that in \nthe year\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n2000, when President Clinton left office, this country had an annual \nFederal budget surplus--let me underline that, a surplus--of over $200 \nbillion with projected budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. \nThat was when Clinton left office.\n  What has happened in the ensuing years? How did we go from huge \nprojected surpluses into horrendous debt? The answer, frankly, is not \ncomplicated. The CBO has documented it. There was an interesting \narticle on the front page of the Washington Post on April 30, a few \nweeks ago, talking about it as well. Here is what happened. It is not \ncomplicated.\n  When we spend over $1 trillion on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and we \nforget to pay for those wars, we run up a deficit. When we provide over \n$700 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and \nwe forget to pay for those tax breaks, we run up a deficit. When we \npass a Medicare Part D prescription drug program written by the drug \ncompanies and the insurance companies that does not allow Medicare to \nnegotiate prescription drug prices and ends up costing us far more than \nit should--$400 billion over a 10-year period--and we don't pay for \nthat, we run up the deficit. If we more than double military spending \nsince 1997, excluding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we don't \npay for that, we drive up the deficit.\n  Yesterday, my good friend from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions--and he \nis a good friend--came to the floor and suggested that Senator Bernie \nSanders was one of those big government types. I would say to my \nfriend, Senator Sessions, and all of those others who are now wanting \nto make savage cuts in programs for working families, the elderly, the \nsick, and the poor: Guess what. I am the deficit hawk. You guys are the \nbig spenders.\n  This Senator, when he was in the House, did not vote for the war in \nIraq which will end up costing us some $3 trillion by the time we take \ncare of our last veteran. I did not vote for that. Senator Sessions did \nvote for that.\n  I did not vote for the huge tax breaks for the richest people in this \ncountry--no, no. I am the deficit hawk. My Republican friends, in every \ninstance, voted for those huge tax breaks.\n  I did not vote for the Medicare prescription drug program, $400 \nbillion over 10 years. I am the deficit hawk. The big spenders on the \nother side said we could spend that money and not pay for it.\n  My point is, I am not sympathetic to being lectured about deficits by \nthe same people who caused this crisis and who, on legislation after \nlegislation, voted to significantly increase the deficit and forgot \nabout paying for it--just put it on the credit cards for our children \nand grandchildren. So, please, don't lecture me on deficit spending.\n  My Republican friends have come up with an interesting idea as to how \nwe can deal with this crisis, with the deficit crisis. In the House of \nRepresentatives, they voted, I believe, unanimously, for the so-called \nRyan budget.\n  What they said is, at a time when the middle class is collapsing, \npoverty is increasing, unemployment is sky high as a result of this \nterrible recession, they think the best way to deal with the deficit \nand the national debt is to make savage cuts in health care; that is, \nto do away with Medicare as we know it today, convert it into a voucher \nprogram, massive cuts in Medicaid. So at a time when 50 million \nAmericans have no health insurance, that number will go up. I am not \nquite sure what people do if they get sick and lose their health \ninsurance. I don't know what they will do. I don't know how many more \npeople will die if we slash Medicaid and throw millions of people off \nof that program.\n  Their brilliant idea of how to move toward deficit reduction is to \nmake major cuts in education, Pell grants. All over this country \nmiddle-class families, working-class families are struggling to be able \nto send their kids to college, and Pell grants are an important part of \nhow they do it. Cut it, so large numbers of young people never get the \nchance then to go to college.\n  Nutrition, cutting back on food stamps, on the Women, Infants, \nChildren Nutrition Program. People in America are hungry. Cut back on \nthose programs. Housing, cut back on those programs. Head Start, giving \nlow-income kids an opportunity to do well--cut back on those programs. \nChildcare--you name it, they are going to cut back on it.\n  The deficit is caused by unpaid-for wars, tax breaks for the rich, \nthe Medicare Part D prescription drug program, the bailout of Wall \nStreet, a declining economy, and less revenue coming in. Their solution \nis to balance the budget on the backs of the sick, the elderly, the \nchildren, the poor, to cut back on environmental protection, to cut \nback on transportation. It is an interesting idea. I think it is a \npretty dumb idea myself.\n  But inherent in that whole approach is another factor. In the United \nStates today, while the middle class is disappearing and poverty is \nincreasing, there is another economic reality; that is, the wealthiest \npeople in this country have never had it so good. Over a recent 25-year \nperiod, from 1980 to 2005, 80 percent of all new income went to the top \n1 percent. The top 1 percent now earn 23 percent of all income in \nAmerica, more than the bottom 50 percent.\n  Today, if you can believe it, the top 400 individuals in America now \nown more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans, the bottom half \nof America. Four hundred people own more wealth than the bottom 150 \nmillion Americans.\n  Interestingly enough, at a time when the rich are becoming richer, \nwhen the effective tax rates for the wealthiest people, at 16.6 \npercent, are the lowest on record, at a time when the wealthiest people \nhave received hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks, at a time \nwhen corporate profits are at an all-time high and major corporations \nmaking billions of dollars pay nothing in taxes, my Republican \ncolleagues, in their approach toward deficit reduction, do not ask the \nwealthiest people or the largest corporations to contribute one penny \nmore for deficit reduction.\n  Their idea of moving toward a balanced budget is to go after the \nmiddle-class, working families, low-income people, but make sure the \nmillionaires and billionaires and largest corporations in this country \nwho are doing phenomenally well, that they do not have to participate \nin shared sacrifice. They are protected. This is the Robin Hood \nphilosophy in reverse. This is taking from the poor and giving to the \nrich.\n  Many viewers may not believe me, and I ask them to check it out; that \nin the midst of all of this--huge deficit, huge national debt, the \nRepublican proposal to slash programs that working families, middle-\nclass people desperately need--in the middle of all this, our \nRepublican friends have another brilliant idea. Let's give $1 trillion \nin tax breaks to the very wealthiest people in this country. We are \ngoing to throw millions off of Medicaid, we are going to cut back on \nPell grants, we are going to make savage cuts in nutrition programs, \nand whether we get all of those savings, $1 trillion in savings, do you \nknow what we are going to do with it? We are going to give it to the \nrichest people in this country. We are going to lower the tax rate, the \npersonal income tax rate for the rich from 35 to 25 percent.\n  At a time when major corporations such as General Electric and \nExxonMobil make billions of dollars in profit, pay nothing in Federal \nincome taxes, do you know what we are going to do to them? We are going \nto give them even more tax breaks.\n  The President has recently come up with an approach toward deficit \nreduction which is certainly a lot better than the Republican approach, \nbut to my mind is by no means as strong as it should be. I was \ndisturbed, not happy, to hear that his approach calls for $2 in \nspending cuts and only $1 in additional revenue. So at a time of \nsignificant, severe recession, millions of people are hurting, the \nPresident is calling for $2 in cuts in spending but only $1 in \nadditional revenue. I think that is a bad idea. I think that is an \ninadequate idea because if the President starts at that position, $2 in \nspending cuts, $1 in revenue, by the time we deal with the Republicans \nin the House, that number is going to go up and will probably end up 3 \nor 4 to 1 in terms of spending cuts.\n\n  Senator Kent Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee in the Senate, \nhas done a better job. He has not gone anywhere near as far as I think \nhe should go but has at least come up\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\nwith a budget that I think most Americans think is sensible, by saying \nat the very least let's have $1 of spending cuts and $1 of additional \nrevenue. Let's at least have shared sacrifice. Let's not balance the \nbudget on the backs of the weak and vulnerable.\n  My office put together a list of ideas that are out there as to how \nwe can raise revenue in a fair and progressive manner. I want to touch \non them for a second.\n  No. 1, I want everybody to hear this: If we imposed a 5.4 percent \nsurtax on millionaires who have been doing phenomenally well, over a \n10-year period we can raise $383 billion. What do you think? We can \nthrow millions of people off of Medicaid, we can end nutrition programs \nfor low-income kids, or we can ask the wealthiest people to pay a \nlittle bit more. The cause of this recession we are in right now has to \ndo with the greed, the recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall \nStreet. The crooks on Wall Street who made huge sums of money ended up \ndriving this country into a terrible recession. If we passed a \nspeculation fee, a fee on Wall Street speculators, we could raise as \nmuch as $100 billion a year, and, by the way, have the added benefit of \ncutting back on speculation.\n  We could raise more than $580 billion over 10 years by erasing tax \nbreaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. Right now we have a tax \npolicy that says shut down a plant in America, go to China, and guess \nwhat. They are going to get a tax break. I think that doesn't make a \nwhole lot of sense.\n  The estate tax--which my Republican friends refer to as the so-called \ndeath tax--only applies to the top three-tenths of 1 percent, the very \nwealthiest people in this country. Instead of lowering the estate tax, \nas we recently did, we could raise $330 billion over 10 years by \nestablishing a responsible estate tax that asks the top three-tenths of \n1 percent of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million in wealth to pay a \nfair estate tax.\n  We do raise $736 billion over 10 years by taxing capital gains and \ndividends as ordinary income. Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest \npeople in the world, has said he pays a lower Federal tax rate than his \nsecretary, than do nurses and police officers and teachers, because \nmost of his income and most of the income of very wealthy people is \ngenerated by capital gains. Our provision could correct that problem--\ntaxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income.\n  We could raise $40 billion over the next 10 years by ending tax \nbreaks and subsidies for Big Oil and gas. I do understand there is \nlegislation going to be coming to the floor which I strongly support. \nIt doesn't go as far as I would go, but it basically says the top five \noil companies that have made billions of dollars in profits and are now \ncharging us $4 a gallon--prices are soaring despite the fact that \nsupply today is greater than it was a year ago and demand is less--that \nmaybe we do away with some of the tax breaks they have enjoyed.\n  And $40 billion over 10 years is what I would propose we can get. We \ncan raise $100 billion a year by prohibiting abusive and illegal \noffshore tax shelters. The Senate Budget Committee has a photograph of \na building in the Cayman Islands. It is an infamous building. It is a \nfour-story building that houses 18,000 corporations. That is right. One \nbuilding, 18,000 corporations. Obviously the whole thing is a scam. \nThis is being used as a postal address for corporations and wealthy \nindividuals who want to avoid paying taxes to the U.S. Government.\n  The Budget Committee estimates that we are losing about $100 billion \na year by having corporations and wealthy people stash their money in \nthe Cayman Islands. That is a lot of money, $100 billion a year. We \ncould raise up to $500 billion over 10 years by establishing a currency \nmanipulation fee, and, by the way, create up to 1 million new jobs in \nthe process.\n  So what is my point? My point is this deficit was caused by actions \nvoted upon by many of my Republican friends: the war, tax breaks for \nthe rich, Medicare Part D, that in the middle of a recession when the \nmiddle class and working families are already hurting, when poverty is \nincreasing. It is not only immoral, it is bad economics to balance the \nbudget on working families and the most vulnerable people in this \ncountry.\n  When people are hurting, when they have lost their jobs, when their \nincomes are going down, you do not say to those people: We are throwing \nyou off of Medicaid. We are going to ``voucherize'' Medicare, we are \ngoing to cut back on Federal aid to education so your kid cannot go to \ncollege. That is not what you say in a humane and fair society.\n  On the other hand, at the same time when the wealthiest people are \nbecoming phenomenally wealthier, and when large corporations are making \nhuge profits, and in many cases not paying any taxes at all, it is \nappropriate to say to those people: Sorry, you are also American. You \nhave got to participate in shared sacrifice. You have also got to help \nus reduce the deficit.\n  That is where we are right now. We are in the midst of a major \ndebate, but it is not only on financial issues. It is very much a \nphilosophical debate. It is a debate about which side are you on. Do \nyou continue to give tax breaks to the very rich and make savage cuts \nfor working families, for children, the elderly, the poor, the most \nvulnerable?\n  I am going to continue doing everything I can to make sure the budget \nthat is finally passed here in the Senate is a fair budget, is a \nresponsible budget, is a just budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first I want to give kudos and \naccolades to my friend and colleague and fellow Madisonian--Madison \nHigh School in Brooklyn, NY, that is--Bernie Sanders. I have rarely \nmet, not just here in the Senate but in public life, people who display \nthe passion and the effectiveness combined that Bernie does. Sometimes \nit is a lonely world for him in a certain sense, because he feels these \nissues so strongly. He is so outstanding at articulating them in every \nway. And he wonders why the world does not change a little more. Well, \nBernie, in terms of this world, which changes slowly, unfortunately, we \nwould agree with that, you have done a great deal of good for people \nwho need help. I am glad you are here, and I am glad you are my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2907-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2907-S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLOSE BIG OIL TAX LOOPHOLES ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I rise today in support of the legislation authored by \nmy good friend from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. As you know, the \nDemocrats here on our side of the aisle are focusing on this \nlegislation this week and next. But Senator Menendez has been \nchampioning this legislation for quite a while. He was prescient to \nfocus on this idea. I am glad we will have a vote on it. I hope the \nvote will pass. I have heard a few of our Republican colleagues now \nhave said they would consider voting for it. Nothing would be better in \nterms of showing some bipartisanship and giving us some hope that we \ncan come to a fair agreement on the budget than to pass this \nlegislation.\n  In the last election, voters who gave those of us who have the \nprivilege of serving in this Chamber two distinct mandates. They told \nus to do two things at once. First, perhaps foremost, make the economy \ngrow. Create good-paying jobs. Make sure that American dream burns \nbrightly, the dream that says to the average middle-class family: The \nodds are pretty good that you will be doing better 10 years from now \nthan you are doing today, and the odds are very good that your kids \nwill do better than you.\n  For that dream, which has burned so brightly in this country for \nhundreds of years, the candle began to flicker a little bit in this \ndecade, because median income went down even before the recession, \nwhich meant that even if you had a job--and we know that millions are \nout of work despite the fact that they look--I think of all of the \npeople whom I have met who are struggling because they do not have \njobs. But even people who do have work have a difficult time when they \nsit down at that dinner table Friday night after dinner, figuring out \nhow they are going to pay the bills. The cost and needs keep going up. \nAnd even when you have a job, the income does not seem to keep up.\n  So that is one obligation voters sent us, and it is a very justified \none. Second, they said in no uncertain terms,\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nrein in the out-of-control Federal deficit. Rein it in. And they are \nright. Because in a certain sense, I have said this before, but I think \nit is worth repeating: The debt--the symbolic nature of the debt is as \nfollows: We, the U.S. Government, are a blindfolded man, and we are \nwalking toward the cliff. Once we fall off that cliff, there is no \ngetting back up.\n  Now the debate is whether we are 20 feet from that cliff or 200 yards \nfrom that cliff. But we know sooner or later if we keep walking \nstraight, we are going to fall off. So that means try to rein in this \nout-of-control Federal deficit. It would be hard enough to accomplish \none of these goals. To try to do both at once is a Herculean task. It \nis why we are having such divisions here, and it is why everyone is \ngrappling.\n  I think everybody is trying to do the right thing regardless of their \nideology. But there are strong feelings. So when we can come to issues \nthat seem to have an easy common ground, because things are so \ndifficult, we ought to jump at them. That is what the Menendez \namendment is. It is a choice that is not a tough one, not a mile, \nbecause it is obvious that at this time, when there are so many needs, \nto continue to give the oil companies the kinds of tax break we do \nmakes no sense. Getting rid of these corporate subsidies to Big Oil is \na no-brainer. Decades ago these were passed. Oil was $17 a barrel. \nMaybe it made sense in those days to give companies an incentive to \nexplore, to produce.\n  One of the subsidies the Menendez legislation repeals, the Oil \nDepletion Allowance, dates back to 1913. That is the same year a man \nnamed William Burton patented a new oil extraction process called \n``thermal cracking.'' Well, Big Oil no longer cracks for petroleum \nusing Mr. Burton's method. It is an outdated process, decidedly. But \nthe outdated tax subsidy still remains on the books, amazingly enough. \nWith oil hovering at $100 a barrel, Big Oil reaping record profits, it \ndefies logic for this government to spend billions of dollars, for \nthese taxpayers to give dollars out of their pocket every year when \nthey are struggling, to tax giveaways to Big Oil which is making record \nprofits.\n  Believe me, the free market gives the oil companies enough of an \nincentive to produce. When oil is $100 a barrel, they do not need an \nextra subsidy from the government to produce. They are going to produce \nevery bit of oil they can.\n\n  They make huge profits, so they do not need a financial nudge from \nWashington. At the same time, middle-class Americans get hit with a \ndouble whammy. They are paying $70 or more to fill up their gas tanks, \nand then some of their hard-earned tax dollars are being used to line \nBig Oil's pocket.\n  In my home State of New York, the price of gas is up 35 percent on \naverage compared to this time last year. Economists estimate the \ntypical family will pay almost $1,000 more on gas this year than last. \nFamilies across the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As \nthe economy slowly recovers, they cannot afford to get gouged at the \npump.\n  With billions of dollars worth of tax subsidies and gas prices at \nnear record highs, it is no wonder that the top five oil companies just \nannounced mind-boggling profits. These companies are not only among the \nmost profitable businesses in the United States, they are among the \nmost profitable in the whole world. In the first quarter of this year \nalone, the Big Five brought in $36 billion in profits. In the past \ndecade, they took home nearly $1 trillion--not a billion, a trillion \ndollars in profits.\n  There is nothing wrong with these profits in and of themselves. In \nAmerica we celebrate success, we want the private sector to thrive. But \nat a time when the government is looking to tighten its belt, and we \nare grappling with painful cuts because we have the dual goal of \ngrowing the middle class but also reducing the deficit, it boggles the \nmind that we continue to subsidize such a lavishly profitable industry.\n  There are priorities. I said this to the oil company executives today \nwhen they testified before the Finance Committee. I want to salute \nChairman Baucus for holding such outstanding hearings. There are \npriorities. How many Americans would say, if we had to choose, that we \nshould give oil companies an extra subsidy rather than help kids who \ndeserve to go to college pay for college?\n  That is what many of my colleagues are recommending. That is what the \nHouse budget recommended. How many of my colleagues would say we ought \nto cut cancer research but still continue to give the oil companies the \nsubsidies we do? Again, the Ryan budget does that.\n  I understand they say we have to cut spending. We do. But we also \nhave to cut out wasteful giveaways such as tax breaks for Big Oil. I \nwould do that before I cut aid to college students who are struggling \nto pay for college, which is more and more expensive, before I cut \ncancer research, which has saved millions of lives, including people we \nknow and love. I would do that before I cut money for veterans or cut \nmoney to keep our homeland secure. But the budget Mr. Ryan has \nproposed, and many of the budgets I have seen come from colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, choose these subsidies to Big Oil over \nmoney to help kids pay for college, over cancer research, over helping \nour veterans, over keeping our homeland secure.\n  Hardly any American would agree with that. Hardly any American, \nDemocratic or Republican, liberal, conservative, North, East, South, or \nWest.\n  Try to wrap your head around it. Big Oil is reporting record profits, \ngas prices are near an all-time high, and we the American taxpayers are \nsubsidizing the oil industry to the tune of $4 billion a year.\n  You do not need the imagination of Lewis Carroll to come up with a \nmore ridiculous scenario. That is why I strongly support and I am proud \nto cosponsor Senator Menendez's Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act. This \nlegislation will put an end to taxpayer handouts in the five largest \nintegrated oil companies, and use the $21 billion in savings to reduce \nthe deficit. This $21 billion is an excellent downpayment on our effort \nto get the Nation's fiscal house in order. The bill repeals a host of \nByzantine tax provisions that only a lobbyist could love, such as the \ndeduction for tertiary injectants and the deduction for intangible \nextraction costs.\n  Small and medium-sized oil firms are exempt. The legislation only \ndeals with the Big Five: Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, \nand BP. I have heard pundits from the hard right parrot Big Oil's \ntalking point that repealing these giveaways would increase gas prices \nfor consumers. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. \nIndependent analyses have repeatedly found that ending these absurd \nsubsidies would not impact the price of gas. In what was perhaps an \ninadvertent moment of candor at this morning's Senate Finance Committee \nhearing, ExxonMobil's CEO Rex Tillerson said: ``Gasoline prices are a \nfunction of crude oil prices, which are set in the marketplace by \nglobal supply and demand--not by companies such as ours.''\n  That does not seem like an objectionable comment. It is true. And \nwhen he made that comment, Mr. Tillerson of ExxonMobil has conceded \nthat repealing taxpayer-funded subsidies for the Big Five will not \nincrease prices. Prices are set, as he said, by global supply and \ndemand.\n  That is not to say that repealing the subsidies will necessarily \nbring down prices. We are not making that claim. All along we have been \nclear that the purpose of this bill is to make a dent in the deficit by \nrepealing tax breaks for the five companies that are the least in need \nof help from Uncle Sam.\n  Lowering the cost of gas and ridding our country of its dependence on \nforeign oil requires a long-term, comprehensive approach. In the months \nahead, I expect the Democratic caucus will unveil a thorough and \nforward-thinking plan to do just that.\n  In the meantime, if Republicans in the House are serious about \ndeficit reduction, the Menendez bill is their chance to show it now. \nThere is no good reason not to support this sensible legislation. \nSpeaker Boehner said earlier this week he wants to make trillions of \ndollars in cuts. Here is a good place to start. Indeed, the Speaker \nhimself has previously said as much. Let's not forget he was in favor \nof repealing oil subsidies before he was against it. The bottom line is \nthis: At a time of sky-high oil prices, it is unfathomable to continue \nto pad the profits of oil companies with taxpayer-funded subsidies. The \ntime to repeal these giveaways is now.\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n  Our plan to cut the deficit begins with ending wasteful subsidies to \nbig oil. The Republican plan begins with ending Medicare as we know it. \nThat is a bright-line difference between our side and theirs. We know \nwhat choice the American people will make.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Presiding Officer report the \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2909-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Michael \nFrancis Urbanski, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael Francis \nUrbanski, of Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the \nWestern District of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate with respect to the nomination, with the time equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I was very gratified yesterday when the \nSenate unanimously voted to confirm Arenda Wright Allen as U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, and I am very glad \nto be here to speak in support of Virginia's nominee to the Western \nDistrict of Virginia, Judge Michael Urbanski.\n  As I did yesterday, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nleadership of both parties in the Senate for scheduling these important \nconfirmation votes. Filling existing vacancies on our courts is \nimportant to Virginia, it is important to America, particularly in \nthese cases where the nominees are noncontroversial to either party \nand, thus, are able to be brought forward for reasonably quick \nconfirmation.\n  One of the bedrock principles in this country is access to justice, \nand it can clearly be said that vacancies on our courts create \nbacklogs, bottlenecks and delays, and justice delayed is obviously \njustice denied.\n  Again, I wish to express my appreciation to the leadership for moving \nthese two very highly qualified nominees, Arenda Wright Allen, who was \nconfirmed yesterday, and Judge Michael Urbanski, who will be voted on \nshortly.\n  In that regard, I am proud of the work we have been able to do during \nmy time in the Senate in finding dedicated, well-qualified jurists from \nVirginia to recommend to the President when vacancies do occur on the \nFederal bench. When I first arrived in the Senate, Senator John Warner \nand I developed a robust, collaborative selection process to review \ncandidates. Senator Mark Warner and I have continued this thorough, \ndeliberative process, and we were pleased to recommend Judge Michael \nUrbanski to President Obama in June of last year. President Obama first \nnominated Judge Urbanski for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Virginia last December. He renominated Judge \nUrbanski earlier this year, and Judge Urbanski was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee without opposition on March 10 of this year.\n  Senator Warner and I jointly reviewed a highly competitive field from \nthe Western District of Virginia. Judge Urbanski stood out to me \nbecause of the resounding recommendations from the bar associations \nwhich he covers now as a magistrate judge. Those recommendations all \nnoted Judge Urbanski's incredible work ethic. He has worked tirelessly \nas a magistrate judge to ensure the efficient administration of justice \nin the Western District of Virginia. He has served in this capacity \nsince 2004. He also has an outstanding reputation for fairness and a \ngood judicial temperament. He has contributed to the efficiency of the \nWestern District of Virginia by being an effective mediator, resolving \na substantial number of disputes without lengthy litigation. He also \nrecently established a veterans court in the Western District. This \ncourt strives to utilize the many services available to our veterans in \norder to try to find alternatives to incarceration from nonviolent \noffenders and to break the cycle of recidivism.\n  I am very proud to say Judge Urbanski is a product of Virginia's \npublic universities. He graduated from the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law in 1981 and the Nation's oldest university, the College \nof William and Mary, in 1978.\n  Prior to becoming a Federal magistrate judge, Judge Urbanski earned a \nreputation as one of the top trial lawyers in western Virginia. He was \nthe head of the law firm of Woods Rogers' litigation section and \npracticed in Roanoke from 1989 to 2004. I have met personally with \nJudge Urbanski. I am convinced he has the correct judicial temperament, \nintelligence, and dedication to make an excellent district court judge. \nI also had the pleasure of meeting with his family, many of his \nfriends, law clerks, and colleagues. His dedication to his family and \nto his community is abundantly apparent.\n  Though I am proud Virginia has such an exemplary individual to put \nforward as a district judge nominee, the Judiciary Committee clearly \nshares this view, having voted out Judge Urbanski unanimously. I urge \nall my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday this Chamber came together to \nunanimously confirm Ms. Arenda Wright Allen to serve as a district \njudge in Virginia. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nfor their vote. I am confident that we will give the same support to \nanother excellent nominee from Virginia under consideration today.\n  I rise to speak in support Judge Michael Urbanski to serve as the \nnext U.S. district judge for the Western District of Virginia.\n  Judge Urbanski would be appointed to a court that is known for its \nrigor and quality. It is a court that requires a highly effective judge \nthat is sensitive to the details of each case. I think Judge Urbanski \nis perfect for this job.\n  He graduated from the College of William and Mary and the University \nof Virginia Law School. He also served as a law clerk for the Honorable \nJames Turk, a district judge in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  Following his clerkship, he worked in the private sector where he \nbuilt experience in antitrust litigation, counseling and \ninvestigations, contract and business tort litigation and intellectual \nproperty litigation.\n  Since 2004, he has served as a magistrate judge in Roanoke, VA, where \nhe has built strong connections to the community and a reputation as a \nfair and impartial judge.\n  I would be remiss not to mention the overwhelming support his \ncandidacy received from the legal community in which he will serve. In \naddition, the Virginia State Bar, the Virginia Women Attorneys \nAssociation and the Salem/Roanoke County Bar Association ranked Judge \nUrbanski as ``highly qualified'' or ``most highly qualified.''\n  I again would like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nGrassley for moving Judge Urbanski's nomination through the Judiciary \nCommittee so that we could consider him today. As I testified at the \nhearing, I look forward to casting my vote in support of Judge \nUrbanski's nomination and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time used in quorum \ncalls during the debate on the Urbanski nomination be charged equally \nto both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate on the \nnomination of Michael Urbanski to be a U.S. district judge for the \nWestern District of Virginia.\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n  Since we have returned from the April recess, we have done very \nlittle else other than consider judicial nominations. This will be the \nthird judicial nominee to be confirmed in the last 3 days and the 23rd \nconfirmed this year. In fact, after today, we will have confirmed six \njudges in just 8 days. I know the liberal interest groups have been \npressuring the other side to consider more nominees even though we have \nbeen moving at a very brisk pace this entire Congress, but it is \nsurprising to me, with all the issues facing the Nation at home and \nabroad, that we would spend 2 weeks on the floor considering little \nelse.\n  Our economy continues to struggle. Millions of Americans remain out \nof work and are unable to find jobs. The unemployment rate remains at \napproximately 9 percent. Those who do have jobs are finding it more and \nmore difficult to get to work as gas prices are over $4 a gallon and \ninching even higher. Our Nation is facing significant national security \nissues. Every single day, our national debt continues to climb to \nunsustainable levels. These are incredibly important issues. I would \nnot go so far as to say the majority does not care about the issues \nfacing our Nation. Perhaps they are simply out of ideas. But as \nAmericans continue to struggle in this economy, it is difficult to \nunderstand why we would spend 2 weeks voting on hardly anything but \njudicial nominations.\n  As I said, the Senate has been moving swiftly this year on those \nnominations. We have confirmed 23 nominees in just 49 days. That is a \nrate of one judge almost every other day the Senate has been in session \nsince convening in January.\n  However, the Senate must not place quantity confirmed over quality \nconfirmed. These lifetime appointments are too important to the Federal \njudiciary and the American people for the Senate to simply rubberstamp \nthese nominations.\n  I was surprised during one of our recent debates to hear one of my \ncolleagues on the committee come to the Senate floor and imply \notherwise. During the debate on the confirmation of Edward Chen, a \nreference was made to what was characterized as the Senate's \nlongstanding tradition--a deference to home State Senators with regard \nto the Federal district court nominations. That Senator stated that in \nhis time in the Senate, where a Federal district court nominee is \nbacked by the two home State Senators, it is usually almost pro forma \nthat the nominee is confirmed.\n  The fact is that home State Senators do have a great deal to say in \nwho should serve the country on the bench. That is part of the advise-\nand-consent process. But there are 100 voices in this body, and we \nspeak for the American people who come before these jurists. We must \nensure they are fit to serve as impartial arbiters.\n  I do not consider the confirmation process for a Federal judicial \nnominee to be a pro forma process. I will continue to give scrutiny to \nall nominees regardless of home State support. I do not consider it \ndelay or obstruction to fulfill that duty. If the other side chooses to \ndo so, of course, that is up to them, but I will not simply rubberstamp \nthose nominees. We will continue to process the nominees fairly and \nwith the standard to which the people rightly hold us.\n  I support today's nominee. Michael Francis Urbanski is nominated to \nbe a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Virginia. He \npresently serves as a U.S. magistrate judge in the same district.\n  Judge Urbanski received his BA with high honors from William & Mary \nin 1978 and his juris doctorate from the University of Virginia School \nof Law in 1981. Upon graduation, he served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable James C. Turk of the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Virginia. From 1982 to 2004, Judge Urbanski worked in \nprivate practice, first as an associate at the Washington, DC, office \nof Vinson & Elkins and then with the firm of Woods Rogers, where he \nbecame a principal in 1989. In 2003, the nominee was appointed to his \npresent position. In 2010, Chief Judge James Jones appointed the \nnominee to chair an advisory committee on the new local rules adopted \nin the Western District.\n  The American Bar Association Committee on the Federal Judiciary has \ngiven Judge Urbanski their highest rating--unanimously ``well \nqualified.''\n  I am pleased to support this experienced nominee, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate considers the nomination \nof Michael Francis Urbanski to fill a judicial vacancy on the District \nCourt for the Western District of Virginia. I thank the majority leader \nfor scheduling the vote today on this nomination, as well as the vote \nyesterday on another nomination to fill a vacancy in Virginia. With \nvacancies at 90 in Federal courts throughout the country, I hope that \nwe can continue to work together in the remaining weeks of this work \nperiod to ensure that the Federal judiciary has the resources it needs \nto fulfill its constitutional role.\n  Our action to take up and vote on these nominations from Virginia, \nand to come to a time agreement to debate and vote on the long-delayed \nnomination of Ed Chen to the Northern District of California earlier \nthis week, show that the delays that have slowed our progress on \nnominations are unnecessary.\n  Judge Urbanski has been a magistrate judge for 7 years on the court \nto which has now been nominated. Previously, he was in private practice \nin Roanoke, VA, and Washington, DC, and was a law clerk to the Western \nDistrict of Virginia Judge James C. Turk. Judge Urbanski's nomination \nhas the support of both of his home State Senators, Senator Webb and \nSenator Warner. His nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee over a month ago. I expect that it will be \nunanimously confirmed today.\n  In addition to Judge Urbanski, there remain another 10 judicial \nnominations on the Executive Calendar that have been ready for final \nSenate action for weeks and, in some cases, many months. Today we \nreported another five of President Obama's judicial nominations \nfavorably. They are now, also, ready to be considered by the Senate. \nAll of these nominees have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a \ndemonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. They should have an up-\nor-down vote after being considered by the Judiciary Committee, and \nwithout additional weeks and months of needless delay.\n  Our ability to make this kind of progress regarding nominations has \nbeen hampered by the creation of what I consider to be misplaced \ncontroversies about many nominees' records. Recently, Republican \nSenators have tried to twist nominees' litigation experience against \nthem. Their partisan attacks are not consistent. Republicans oppose \nsome nominees by saying that they do not have sufficient litigation \nexperience. When a nominee has extensive experience and is a successful \ntrial lawyer, they reverse themselves and complain that the nominee has \ntoo much experience and will be biased by it.\n  It is difficult to satisfy people whose standards change in order to \nexplain their opposition. Republicans seem to react this way to \nPresident Obama, his actions and his nominees. Republicans were for a \ndeficit commission until President Obama was for it; then they voted \nagainst it. They were for action in Libya until President Obama took \naction; then they were against it.\n  They opposed Judge McConnell of Rhode Island supposedly because he \nwas an excellent trial lawyer. They opposed Judge Chen of California \ndespite his 10 years as a fair and impartial Federal judge magistrate, \nbecause he was a staff attorney litigating to protect civil rights. \nBoth of these nominees have assured us that they understand the \ndifference between being an advocate for a client and serving as a \njudge. I have no doubt that they do. Judge Chen demonstrated his \nimpartiality in 10 years of work as a Federal magistrate judge. \nRepublicans chose to ignore his demonstrated qualifications and \nexperience. They likewise ignore the sworn testimony of the nominees at \nour hearings and their answers to Republicans own questions. When they \ndo that, it makes you wonder what is driving their decisions to oppose \nthese qualified nominees.\n  These are Republican Senators who demanded that President Bush's \nnominees be confirmed despite their ideological commitment to \nconservative activism. In those years, Republicans argued that \nnominees' careers devoted\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nto serving corporate interests and conservative causes were irrelevant \nto the Senate's inquiry and that all nominees should be confirmed if \nthey met basic qualifications. In President Bush's first term, the \nSenate regularly considered nominations, confirming 205 to lifetime \nappointments. We remain well behind that pace, having been allowed to \nconsider only 83 of President Obama's nominations in nearly 28 months \nof his term.\n  Senate Republicans are now adopting a much different standard--and a \nshifting one at that. It almost seems like whatever might be claimed to \njustify strenuous opposition and voting no on an Obama nominee is \njustified by the end--opposing the President. That is wrong. That is \nwrong because this President has worked hard to consult with Republican \nhome State Senators. Yet they still oppose them, including President \nObama's first nomination that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana. \nDespite Senator Lugar's support, Republicans filibustered that \nnomination and delayed it for months. They have filibustered five of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations to date.\n  It is wrong because their actions have created a judicial vacancies \ncrisis that persists to this day. If the 22 judicial nominees \nRepublicans point to as being confirmed this year, 15 should have been \nconfirmed last year and were needlessly delayed. One even required \ncloture to end an unprecedented filibuster against a Federal trial \ncourt nominee.\n  With judicial vacancies at crisis levels, affecting the ability of \ncourts to provide justice to Americans around the country, we should be \ndebating and voting on each of the 15 other judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. The progress we have started to make these \nlast 2 weeks is a sign that the Senate can do better to ensure that the \nFederal judiciary has the judges it needs to provide justice to \nAmericans in courts throughout the country.\n  I congratulate Judge Urbanski and his family on his confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Daily Digest editor proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael Francis Urbanski, of Virginia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Western District of Virginia?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Ethics Committee \nvoted unanimously to release the special counsel's report regarding the \nactions of former Senator John Ensign.\n  The committee also voted unanimously to refer several findings to the \nDepartment of Justice and to the Federal Election Commission because we \nhad reason to believe that Senator Ensign violated laws within their \njurisdiction. I want to thank from the bottom of my heart the Senators \nwho participated in this investigation, many of whom are on the floor \ntoday: my vice chairman, the extraordinary leader, Senator Isakson--and \nI say leader, I mean a leader on the committee. I consider him to be a \ncochair with me. And Senator Roberts, who has been on this committee \nfor a long time, who has a sense of history, and a sense of levity, and \npragmatism. I appreciated his cooperation.\n  I want to note the participation of Sherrod Brown, who came on this \ncommittee and began this journey with us and his very important \ncontribution; Senator Risch, who brought with him a very strong legal \nslant on everything we did and was very valuable. I want to thank him.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks to Senator Cardin who sat in \non this case because Senator Pryor felt he had too close a relationship \nwith Senator Ensign and had to recuse himself. Senator Cardin, we thank \nyou so much for coming in and focusing on this case. I have to say, I \nam so grateful to how thoroughly and hard and collaboratively we all \nworked during this 22-month investigation. I say--and I mean--it was an \nhonor to work with my colleagues.\n  The Ethics Committee is unique. Its staff is nonpartisan, and its \nactions are bipartisan. That is so important always, but particularly \nduring these very polarized times, and also because this was such a \nlong and difficult investigation for many reasons.\n  I want to be clear about why the committee is releasing its report to \nthe public and why Senator Isakson and I are addressing the Senate \ntoday. If any of our colleagues wish to add to our comments, I hope \nthey will do so. While Senator Ensign's resignation ended our \ninvestigation before the next phase, which was the adjudicatory phase \nor the trial phase, it did not end our profound responsibilities to the \nSenate, to our laws, to our rules, to our Constitution, and, of course, \nto the American people.\n  Article 1, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \nStates says that: ``each House may determine the rules of its \nproceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the \nconcurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.'' That is in the \nConstitution.\n  Senate rules give the Ethics Committee responsibility to investigate \nalleged violations of laws and rules and\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n``improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.'' That is a quote \nfrom our rules.\n  Finally, Ethics Committee rules make clear that whenever its members \nhave ``reason to believe'' that a violation of law has occurred, we \n``shall'' report it to the proper authorities.\n  Let me say that again. Ethics Committee rules make it clear that \nwhenever the members of the committee have reason to believe that a \nviolation of law has occurred, we shall report it to the proper \nauthorities. So we have a solemn responsibility indeed. It is actually \na mandate to refer possible criminal or civil violations to the \nDepartment of Justice and to the Federal Election Commission. That is \nwhat we have done today.\n  We also have another responsibility. That is to tell the American \npeople when we believe laws and rules have been broken, and that \nstandards of conduct have been breached. That is what we have done \ntoday.\n  Our special counsel, Carol Elder Bruce, has written a report that \nspeaks in great detail about her findings, and that report has been \nreleased today. These findings are so disturbing that she believed that \nhad Senator Ensign not resigned, and had we been able to proceed to \nthat adjudicatory phase, the evidence of Senator Ensign's wrongdoing \nwould have been substantial enough to warrant the consideration of \nexpulsion, the harshest penalty available to the Ethics Committee and \nthe Senate.\n  That is why when former Senator Ensign resigned, the vice chairman \nand I put out a statement, and we said that he had made ``the \nappropriate decision.''\n  I want to give you the findings of the special counsel.\n  One. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \nconspired to violate Doug Hampton's postemployment contact ban.\n  Two. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign aided \nand abetted Mr. Hampton's violations of the postemployment contact ban.\n  Three. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \nmade false and misleading statements to the Federal Election Commission \nregarding the $96,000 payment made to the Hamptons.\n  Four. There is substantial credible evidence that the $96,000 payment \nto Mr. Hampton violated Federal campaign finance laws.\n  Five. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \nviolated a law and a Senate rule prohibiting unofficial office \naccounts.\n  Six. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \npermitted spoliation of documents and engaged in potential obstruction \nof justice.\n  Seven. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \ndiscriminated on the basis of gender.\n  Eight. There is substantial credible evidence that Senator Ensign \nengaged in improper conduct reflecting on the Senate, including \nviolating his own office policies, written in a manual.\n  These eight serious findings in the special counsel's report are the \nculmination of an extensive 22-month investigation and the basis for \nthe committee's unanimous decision to refer this matter to the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Election Commission.\n  As Chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, I am proud to report to the \nSenate that our committee and its staff and special counsel have been \nfair and thorough. We deposed or interviewed 72 witnesses. We issued 32 \nsubpoenas for documents. We reviewed more than one-half million \ndocuments, including a large number that were initially withheld from \nthe committee. None of this would have been possible without the very \nhard work done by the staff of our committee, our personal offices--and \nI am so grateful to them--the special counsel who was extraordinary and \nto whom we all owe a debt of gratitude.\n\n  I particularly wish to thank the staff director and the chief counsel \nof the Ethics Committee, John Sassaman, and his team. They were focused \nand they searched for the truth, and we believe they found the truth.\n  Again, I also wish to personally thank our special counsel, Carol \nElder Bruce, and her team.\n  Our Founders gave Congress the responsibility to ensure that its \nMembers behave ethically. The Ethics Committee tries to do this by \nworking to prevent violations of rules and laws when possible. We try \nto work with colleagues before they do something they shouldn't do. We \ntry to train colleagues so they understand what we mean when we say \ndon't bring any kind of shame upon the Senate. Then, if something bad \nhappens, we give a fair hearing, we might sanction them, and we do when \nnecessary. This isn't an easy task, but every member of the Ethics \nCommittee is committed to fulfilling our critical responsibility in a \nthorough, fair, and bipartisan fashion.\n  When Senator Ensign resigned, he said: ``I have not violated any law, \nany rule, or standard of conduct.'' I wish to go on record as chairman \nof the Ethics Committee to say how strongly I disagree with that \nstatement.\n  Let's be clear. It was Senator Ensign's actions that led to the \nethics complaint filed against him. It was Senator Ensign's actions \nthat led to a 22-month investigation by the Ethics Committee. It was \nSenator Ensign's actions that led to the very serious findings and \nreferrals in the report we are releasing to the public today.\n  The committee believes every Senator should read this report very \ncarefully. Let me say that again. The committee believes every Senator \nshould read this report very carefully because it is a cautionary tale. \nIt shows that our actions--all of them--have consequences for \nourselves, for our families, for our staffs, for Congress, and for our \nNation. It shows we must ensure every action we take is within the law, \nthe rules, and the appropriate standards of conduct. In my view, if I \ncan say my own personal view, it shows something else; that is, when \nyou are in a position of trust and power, don't abuse it. Don't misuse \nit because people can get hurt, very hurt.\n  We cannot violate the laws or rules we set for others, including our \nown staffs. We must always lead by example, not by words alone.\n  This Ensign case was a sad chapter for the Senate but a far sadder \nchapter for those whose lives were affected and destroyed by his \nactions. I wish to thank the Senate for placing its trust in the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  I yield to the vice chairman of the committee, the one whom I \nconsider my cochairman, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\n  Mr. President, on certain occasions in the life of a public official \none is called upon to make difficult and unpleasant decisions. Such is \nthe case for the six members of the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee today. \nBut we recognize it is essential that the institution--this Senate--\nthat passes the laws which all our citizens must live under must also \nenforce those laws and rules of standards and conduct which we impose \nupon ourselves. It is a solemn responsibility, but it is important to \nthe integrity and the future of this institution.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee looks upon itself as an advisory board \nand a source of information and counsel to our Members. We ask Members \nto come to us when there are questions about the potential ethical \nviolation of a decision or even something that might, in passing, seem \nto be trivial. Our job is to make sure everybody who has a question \ngets an answer and no one unwillingly gets caught in an unethical \nsituation. But it is also our responsibility, when complaints are \nfiled, to follow up on those complaints and, if we find merit in the \ncomplaint, to enter an initial investigatory period of time which, if \nthat position bears enough likelihood that a violation has occurred, \nultimately goes to an adjudicatory phase and then finally a decision on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is rare, and I can tell my colleagues \npersonally it is a situation I hope I am never involved in again. But, \nas I said, it is an essential process to the integrity of this body.\n  When the particular complaint in question in the Ensign case came to \nus, it was, similar to any other case, reviewed initially to determine \nwhether it even merited an investigation. After the initial review \ndetermined it did merit an investigation, the Senate staff did an \noverwhelming and wonderful job of gathering information, evidence, and \ntestimony to help us get to a position to begin to make a decision as \nto whether we could go further in\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nthe case. But we didn't rely just on ourselves. We sought forensic \nexperts and computers and technology so the over 500,000 documents that \nwere reviewed and cross-referenced had a forensic test to them and we \nknew what we were dealing with and how it was dealt with. We even hired \na special counsel, which is rare for the Senate Ethics Committee to do, \nbut it was essential because of where the evidence and the testimony \nwas leading the committee.\n  I wish to say, at this point in time, I have known a lot of lawyers \nin my day, ones I have hired and ones I have been on the other side of \nthe deposition table from. I have never known anybody more professional \nor whose ability I admired more than Carol Elder Bruce, and I wish to \ncommend her on the floor of the Senate. It was her report which we are \nalso submitting with the referrals today to indicate that we have \nlooked to see that there was reasonable evidence to conclude that a \nviolation may have occurred. The ultimate decision on that will be up \nto the U.S. Department of Justice and it will be up to the Federal \nElection Commission. But the report clearly indicates that the Senate \nEthics Committee did not act on what it thought or an opinion or a \nwhim. It acted on facts determined through hundreds of interviews, \n500,000 documents that were examined, and testimony that came to our \ncommittee.\n  It is the hope of the chairman and myself and each member of the \ncommittee that every Member recognizes the Senate Ethics Committee \nwants to be a source of information, advice, and counsel, to see to it \nthis institution always rises to the occasion as the most ethical body \nin our government. But we will as a committee, if it becomes necessary \nand the evidence finds it to be true, pursue our responsibility as a \ncommittee and we will do what is required of us in this body.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Boxer for the method in which she has \nhandled this from the beginning to the end, as well as Laura Schiller, \nwho has been her aide throughout and helpful. I also wish to commend \nJoan Kirchner, Chris Carr, and Glee Smith on my staff for their \ntireless efforts. The members of the committee also should be commended \nfor their hard work, and it has been hard work. Ben Cardin has been a \ntremendous legal mind for us. Sherrod Brown has been an insightful \nperson to ferret out information and guide us in the right direction. \nMy dear friend, Senator Roberts, is the dean of the members of the \nEthics Committee. On the floor are Senator Roberts, Senator Cardin, and \nSenator Brown. Senator Risch from Idaho is not here, but he deserves \nequal credit. As the chairman said, his legal mind and insightful \nnature helped us come to the conclusions we came to today.\n  I wish to repeat my thanks to Carol Elder Bruce for the tremendous \nwork she did, as well as Brian Stolarz, Mike Missel, and John \nSongstregth, who all worked with her legal team. The staff of the \nEthics Committee, our staff director, John Sassaman, has been \ninvaluable in his tireless hours of work to see to it that every I was \ndotted, every T was crossed, and the committee did its job. To Rochelle \nFord, Lynn Tran, Bill Corcoran, and Dan Schwager, thanks to them for \nall the effort they made.\n  I will end where I began. No one in public office volunteers for the \ntype of responsibilities we have had in the case of Senator Ensign. But \nall of us took that responsibility when it came upon us, recognizing \nthe integrity of the Senate and the integrity of our decision was \nimportant for the future of this body. As sad as the deliberations were \nand the ultimate result was, it was proof that this Senate and its \nEthics Committee can stand and do the effort necessary to see to it \nthis institution's integrity proceeds in the future uninhibited and \nunendangered.\n  With that, unless there is a Member who wishes to speak, I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2913-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2913-S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ESCALATING GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the \nescalating cost of gasoline at the pump--something that affects every \nAmerican consumer. Crude oil prices are now more than $100 a barrel and \nthe price of gasoline at the pump for our consumers is about $4 on \naverage across the Nation. It is even more here in the District. \nDespite some correction recently in the oil commodity markets, the U.S. \nEnergy Information Administration expects that prices this summer will \naverage $1 more than they did just a year ago.\n  Gasoline price spikes are a form of stealth inflation eating away at \nthe income of American families, impacting our economic growth, and \ndeepening the hardship to the almost 14 million people we have still \nlooking for work. Some economic analysts indicate that for each $10 \nincrease in the price of a barrel of oil, it has the impact of reducing \nour economic growth by about two-tenths of 1 percent. Each two-tenths \nof 1 percent equates to 120,000 fewer jobs that are created just in the \nfirst year of that type of increase. So you can see it has a very \nsignificant cumulative impact.\n  Imported oil also greatly affects detrimentally our balance of trade. \nLast year alone that contributed to a $265 billion trade imbalance for \nour Nation. The high price of oil, whether it is at the wellhead or the \nprice of gasoline at the pump, impacts every sector of our economy. It \naffects jobs, it affects economic growth, and it certainly affects the \npurchasing power of the American family; therefore, their standard of \nliving and our quality of life.\n  So what do we do? Well, the fact is, oil prices are subject to the \nsame laws of supply and demand as other commodities. When we increase \nthe supply, that helps bring prices down. When we reduce demand, that \nhelps bring prices down. Of course, just the reverse is true as well. \nWhen we have less supply or more demand, that tends to push the price \nhigher. So clearly--clearly--we need to do all we can to produce more \nenergy in this country, and certainly we need to produce more domestic \nfuel, more domestic oil and gas.\n  I don't know how many people realize it, but over the last few \nyears--over the last approximately 5 years--oil imports into this \ncountry have actually been going down, and that is why I have brought \nthis chart along which was prepared by the Congressional Research \nService. As we can see from the chart, domestic oil was shrinking from \nabout 1985 to 2005, and by 2005 we increased our imports to a total of \n12.4 million barrels a day, approximately 60 percent of the total oil \nwe consumed in 2005.\n  However, since 2005 things have begun to change. We have made \nprogress. We have made progress both because we are producing more oil \nand gas in this country and also because we are using less. So we can \nsee from 2005 to 2010 we have actually reduced the amount of oil we \nimport into this country from about 60 percent of what we use to less \nthan 50 percent. Today, about 49 percent of the fuel we consume is \nactually produced in this country. That is a significant reduction in \nour imports of about 3 million barrels a day from 2005.\n  So what changed? Well, what changed is we are producing more oil. We \nare producing more oil offshore and onshore in the lower 48, and we are \nalso producing more natural gas liquids. As I said just a minute ago, \nwe are also consuming less, and we need to continue to do both. In \naddition to those things, though, we are also increasingly relying on \nfriendly governments for our imports rather than governments that are \nhostile to our country.\n  For example, by last year we were importing twice as much oil from \nCanada as we were from Saudi Arabia, and that is certainly a good \ndevelopment. We need to continue to not only produce more domestic oil \nbut, to the extent we import oil, we need to bring it in from countries \nthat are friends rather than countries that are foes, or certainly that \nmay not share our beliefs and our interests. We have opportunities to \ndo that.\n  For example, right now, very close to my State, we are working on a \nproject which is the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline is \ndesigned to carry\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\ncrude oil from the Canadian oil stands in Alberta, Canada, to \nrefineries in the Gulf of Mexico. The problem is, we are still awaiting \napproval for that pipeline. U.S. approval of this project will cost our \nNation not one penny but will increase the supply of oil and gasoline \nin our country and help hold down the price of gasoline at the pump. At \nthe same time, it will help reduce our dependence on oil from volatile \nparts of the world and create thousands of good jobs in America. We all \nknow how important that is at a time when our Nation still has 9 \npercent unemployment and millions of people are out of work.\n  We have similar opportunities to boost the supply of domestic oil and \ngas on American soil as well, and not just in the lower 48 but also in \nAlaska. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline could help increase supply \nenormously, but right now it is only carrying about one-quarter of its \ncapacity. The pipeline has the capacity to carry 2 million barrels of \noil a day. Right now it is carrying something over 600,000 barrels of \noil a day. So, clearly, that is a tremendous capacity that is not being \nutilized.\n  Senator Murkowski has eloquently pointed out that the State of Alaska \nholds an estimated 40 billion barrels of oil, the equivalent of more \nthan 60 years' worth of imports from the Persian Gulf. Yet that oil is \nexcluded from our Nation's reserve figures. The United States is \nalready the third largest oil and gas producing Nation on Earth, with \n28.4 billion barrels of proven reserves. But it also has an estimated \n162, almost 163 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service. Only Russia and Saudi \nArabia produce more than our country.\n  So the lesson in all of this is clear. We can and we must increase \ndomestic production of oil and gas in our country. The record over the \npast 5 years clearly indicates we can do it. As a matter of fact, we \nare on our way to doing it, and we can do much more. For example, in my \nhome State of North Dakota, we have been working over the last decade \nto increase oil production, and we have. Since 2005, North Dakota has \nincreased its production of oil by more than 200,000 barrels a day. \nNorth Dakota is now the fourth largest oil-producing State in the \nNation. We have passed States such as Oklahoma and, more recently, \nLouisiana. We have the opportunity to produce much more. We have just \nbarely scratched the surface.\n  Last month, I hosted a meeting of the U.S. Geological Survey in \nBismarck to make the case for a new, updated study of recoverable \nreserves in the Williston Basin. Of course, the Williston Basin covers \nparts of North Dakota, Montana, and extends into Canada as well. The \nlast agency study was completed in 2008, and it indicated there are 3.5 \nto 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Bakken Shale Formation, \nwhich is in the Williston Basin--3\\1/2\\ to 4 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil. Industry scientists and engineers, however, who are \nworking out in the Williston Basin right now feel that figure is low \nand the reality in terms of recoverable oil reserves in the Williston \nBasin is much higher.\n  That is why we are asking the U.S. Geological Survey to come out and \ndo a reassessment. If they are right, the results will attract tens of \nmillions of dollars in new investment to the region, creating more \ndomestic fuel and lower prices for American consumers, more jobs in our \nState, in Montana, and more jobs for our country. Also, it will help us \ndevelop infrastructure and sustain economic growth throughout the \nregion.\n  In North Dakota we focused on creating more energy, more oil and gas, \nand more other types of energy as well by creating a legal, tax, and \nregulatory climate--a business climate--that encourages private \ninvestment and job creation. I have spoken several times on the floor \nof the Senate and more times than I can count at home and around the \ncountry about the need to forge a legal, tax, and regulatory climate in \nAmerica that will attract investment in the energy industry--whether it \nis wind, biofuels, coal, or oil and gas.\n  At a time when America is struggling with a 9-percent unemployment \nrate, the need to create private sector jobs is absolutely paramount. \nIt is job No. 1. Building our domestic energy industry is one of the \nkeys to accomplishing that. The oil and gas industry alone supports 7.5 \npercent of the U.S. domestic product and more than 9 million American \njobs. Government doesn't create those jobs, but government creates the \nenvironment that empowers and unleashes the creativity and energy of \nAmerican enterprise.\n\n  The challenge confronting the U.S. energy industry today, however, is \na climate of legal, tax, and regulatory uncertainty. This uncertainty \nis not only sidelining investment and impeding production but also \nhindering job creation and raising fuel prices at the pump for American \nconsumers.\n  We all want to ensure we have clean air and water, but at the same \ntime we all want to develop our Nation's abundant natural resources and \ndo it with good, sound environmental stewardship. Clearly, we need to \nlook at our current legal, tax, and regulatory environment to make sure \nwe have the commonsense, reliable rules that not only enable but \nactually empower companies to invest the hundreds of millions and \nbillions of dollars in new technologies that will help us unlock the \nenergy resources in this country, and do it with the kind of \nenvironmental stewardship we all want.\n  It is vital for the rest of our economy. The reason for that is \nsimple. If the energy industry cannot grow, neither can our other \nindustries. They cannot create the jobs and opportunities our Nation so \nvery much needs, and they cannot provide the affordable energy American \nfamilies and businesses depend on every day. Impeding domestic energy \nproduction, moreover, is a national security issue as well as an \neconomic issue. Increased dependence for oil on unstable parts of the \nworld, such as the Middle East and Venezuela, puts not just our economy \nbut our Nation and our Nation's security at risk. Yet rather than \nreduce constraints on production, rather than encourage more \nexploration and recovery, rather than make our country a better place \nto do business, our laws and regulations too often seem aimed at \nserving every other purpose but increasing domestic energy production \nand supply.\n  Ironically, at a time when we need to invest and create jobs, \nbillions of dollars are not being deployed. That is because energy \ninvestors are waiting to see what kind of rules will govern things such \nas fracking for domestic oil, hydraulic fracture, CO2 \nmanagement, and transmission line siting. Companies out there are ready \nto make billion-dollar investments that will have a lifespan of more \nthan 40 years, but they do not know the rules of the road. By \ncertainty, I don't mean more restrictive rules and regulations; I mean \ncommonsense rules of the road that would not change arbitrarily or \naccording to political crosswinds.\n  A number of us in the Senate on both sides of the aisle are already \nworking on commonsense initiatives to ensure that Congress, rather than \ngovernment agencies, establish those rules. I have already spoken about \nsome of those on the Senate floor. Today, I would like to talk about \nanother one. Today, I want to discuss, for just a short period, another \npiece of legislation that I believe will help reduce the price of fuel \nat the pump--not by increasing production but simply by applying good \njudgment to the rules that govern distribution of gasoline in the \nUnited States.\n  Senator Roy Blunt, myself, and a number of other Senators are \npromoting a bill called the Boutique Fuel Reduction Act of 2011. This \nlegislation would simplify the Nation's fuel standards and make more \nfuel available to American consumers. It would give the administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency--the EPA--the flexibility to \nwaive certain agency requirements pertaining to the use of specific or \nboutique fuels--specialty fuels--when extreme or unusual distribution \nproblems are limiting supply.\n  Currently, the increased use of different types of fuel for different \nparts of the country is causing artificial shortages in some retail \nmarkets and, consequently, higher prices at the pump for our motorists. \nA service station in one city that runs out of fuel may not be able to \nuse a certain blend of gasoline available just 50 miles away because it \nis not approved by the EPA for use in that location. Unfortunately, \nunder current law, the EPA can waive the requirements only during a \nnatural disaster, not to meet shortages or price spikes such as we have \ntoday. The law we are sponsoring would change that.\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\n  In addition to the bill, myself and a group of Senators--and House \nMembers as well--have also sent letters to EPA Administrator Lisa \nJackson, calling on the agency and the Department of Energy to complete \nthe fuel harmonization study which Congress requested more than 5 years \nago. That report was due in 2008. This report would examine the effects \nof the Nation's varying boutique fuels on retail prices and also assess \nthe feasibility of developing national or regional standards to reduce \nthe multiple varieties required today by the EPA.\n  Having fewer types of fuel would make more fuel available during \nshortages, thereby putting downward pressure on prices at the pump. It \nwould give refineries more options to meet demand and help stabilize \nand reduce the retail price of gasoline.\n  We expect EPA and the Department of Energy to follow through on the \ncongressional intent that was outlined in the 2005 law and conduct and \ncomplete that study as soon as possible, which correlates closely with \nthe legislation we are sponsoring.\n  Bear in mind, the measures I just discussed do not cost anything. \nThey take no funding to work. Yet they can help us reduce fuel prices \nfor the American consumer, for our American families. They can make \ndoing business in America more affordable, reduce our trade deficit, \nand help get Americans back to work again.\n  We need to increase domestic fuel production, and we need to provide \nregulatory relief in order to do it because high energy prices, whether \nit is fuel for our cars or electricity for our homes and businesses, \nimpact virtually every sector of American life. That includes jobs, \nthat includes economic growth, that includes the purchasing power of \nthe American family, and ultimately includes our standard of living and \nour quality of life.\n  Our future is fueled by energy and that future depends on the \ndecisions and the choices we make right now. We need to get them right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2915-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THANKING THE MISSOURI NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to make some brief comments \nabout people at home I am so proud of. Over the past 3 weeks, my home \nState has been the site of heartbreaking destruction that resulted from \na series of severe weather incidents throughout the State. We have also \nhad the privilege of witnessing great acts of bravery, compassion, and \nneighbors being neighbors in response to these incidents. I wish to \ntake just a moment to recognize the incredible character of Missourians \nand particularly to recognize the contributions made by the citizen-\nsoldiers and airmen of the Missouri National Guard.\n  Today, weeks after historic flooding began, we continue to see its \nlife-altering effects, in my State and others all along the Mississippi \nRiver. My prayers, and those of my colleagues, go out to all those who \nhave and will continue to have their lives altered by this tragedy.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Missouri delegation \nto make sure that the Federal Government provides the assistance \nnecessary to help Missourians affected be tragedy to get back on their \nfeet. Already, the President has granted the first Federal disaster \nassistance to individuals and households across the State. More \nannouncements will come as damage assessments are completed. USDA is \nalso poised to assist and will start holding public meetings in the \naffected areas to inform farmers and landowners of the help that they \ncan receive.\n  One thing that has struck me about the response to the storms has \nbeen the dignity and class with which Missourians have carried \nthemselves. In my State, families have been driven from their homes, \npushed away from their jobs, lost everything. Whether it is a family in \nNorth St. Louis whose home was destroyed by a tornado, or a producer \nwhose family farm was submerged when the levee protecting it was \nintentionally breached, Missourians have drawn on their faith, their \nfamilies, and their neighbors to pull through. I had the opportunity to \nspend time with some of these families during my trip to view flooding \nin southeast Missouri. Their courage is inspiring, and is an example of \nthe American spirit that we all hold dear.\n  We have had a rough year. The last 3 weeks have been particularly \ndestructive, starting with the tornado and strong winds that ripped \nthrough the St. Louis area on Good Friday, April 22. This tornado, \nrated an EF-4, was estimated to be the strongest to hit the area in \nnearly four decades.\n  As the tornado and storms battered the St. Louis area, rain continued \nto fall on southeast and southern Missouri. When Governor Jay Nixon \nmade the decision to deploy the Missouri National Guard to assist local \nemergency responders in their efforts, it marked the 20th time in the \npast 6 years that the Missouri National Guard has provided such \nassistance, including the last time that catastrophic flooding struck \nthe State, in 2008.\n  Since their deployment to respond to this latest disaster, the \nMissouri National Guard, under the strong leadership of their adjutant \ngeneral MG Stephen Danner, has provided invaluable support to the \nGovernor, the Army Corps of Engineers, local responders and citizens \nacross the scores of communities that have suffered damage. Two events \nfrom recent days provide a perfect summary of the service that these \nbrave men and women continue to perform for the people of my State.\n  Last week, the citizen-soldiers and airmen of the Missouri National \nGuard joined the people of Caruthersville, in Pemiscot County, to \nrapidly erect a secondary flood wall to support the existing wall. This \nwall, made of 60,000 sandbags stretched across over 3,000 feet, helped \nto provide safety and peace of mind for a community that feared the \nworst.\n  A couple of counties away, Missouri National Guard members helped to \nsave a 93-year-old trapped in her car as she tried to cross a flooded \nBlack River. One of the guardsmen on the scene, seeing his first \nemergency duty, remarked ``we weren't there to be heroes, we were just \ndoing our jobs.''\n  The citizen-soldiers and airmen of the Missouri National Guard, while \n``just doing their jobs,'' have played an important role in supporting \nthe flood response efforts of their neighbors.\n  A member of the 1138th Military Police Company said it best when he \nsaid ``nothing makes you feel as good as being able to help your \nneighbors in Missouri.'' The Missouri National Guard, and the people \nthey valiantly serve, are and will continue to be the embodiment of \nthose words and the spirit that we all strive to personify. I thank \nthem for their bravery, for their selflessness and for being great \nneighbors.\n  We will all stand by to be of assistance as everyone recovers from \nthe natural disasters that have brought such destruction to the State I \nlove.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to share a few thoughts on a \nvery important matter, the financial health of the United States. We \nhad a nice meeting with the President earlier today. The Republican \nSenators virtually all were there, shared their thoughts, and the \nPresident responded. All in all it was a good exchange. Those are the \nkinds of meetings where I do not talk about what is said in detail and \nquote anyone.\n  I was asked by a number of reporters what happened and what did you \nsay about it. I guess my conclusion is that not much happened. No \ncommitments were made that I could see, that indicated the President \nhad made any\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nchange in the budget he had submitted or the speech he gave somewhat \namending his budget a few weeks ago.\n  He did not make any changes in the plan I am seeing out there. He was \nopen, discussed it, maybe something will happen. What is the status of \nthe Senate's business? This is the Senate. The Senate has serious \nresponsibilities. The Budget Act was designed to ensure that Congress \npasses a budget, because it was learned over the years--it goes back to \nthe 1970s--that a budget is important for a country. Families have \nthem, businesses have them. You need a budget.\n  Congress was having trouble passing a budget. So they passed the \nBudget Act that allowed a budget to become law without 60 votes in the \nSenate, but they could be passed with 50 votes. As we know, there are \n54 Democrats in the Senate--and more, I guess, than that with \nIndependents who caucus with the Democrats. So this is the situation we \nare in.\n  The President complied with the Budget Act, a week late, by \nsubmitting his budget, and his budget failed to meet the requirements \nof our time to a very significant degree. Every witness we have had in \nour budget committee--I am the ranking Republican on it--has indicated \nand told us, many in great detail and with passion, we are on an \nunsustainable course; you cannot continue to borrow 40 cents of every \ndollar and try to fund a government borrowing that kind of money.\n  We will hit a budget deficit this year of $1.5 trillion, the largest \nin the history of America. In 4 years, the President will have doubled \nthe entire debt of the United States based on the trillion-dollar \ndeficits he has had each year. So this is not an acceptable path for us \nto be on.\n  We had hearings in the Budget Committee about the critical issues we \nface. We considered and had testimony from the fiscal commission that \nPresident Obama appointed--Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, we had \nRivlin-Pete Domenici. Senator Domenici, retired now, was Budget \nchairman at one point in time in the Senate. Alice Rivlin, OMB Director \nfor President Clinton, is a wizard herself with numbers. They proposed \nsome real changes in the debt trajectory we are on. I thought after \nthat, and based on the comments of Senator Conrad, our chairman, and \nthe strong witnesses we heard who called on us to make significant \nchanges in what we were doing that we would move forward with a budget \nthat would be a good bit stronger than the one President Obama \nsubmitted.\n  Indeed, President Obama's budget was not serious. President Obama's \nbudget took the current spending line for 10 years, that the \nCongressional Budget Office said we are on, and it made it worse. It \nmade the deficit worse, $2 trillion worse than the current plan we were \non--totally unacceptable.\n  He proposed in his budget increasing the Department of Education \nfunding by 10.5 percent; increasing the Energy Department funding 9.5 \npercent; increasing State Department funding 10.5 percent; proposed \nincreasing the Transportation Department 62 percent.\n  In a time when inflation is 2 percent, we are having those kinds of \nincreases and we say we are submitting a budget that recognizes we are \non an unsustainable course and we have got to change. Well, it was \nunacceptable. I was very disappointed about it. I think even the man he \nappointed to head the debt commission, Erskine Bowles, said they have \ncome nowhere close to what is necessary to avoid our fiscal nightmare.\n  We were told by our Budget chairman, Senator Conrad, whom it has been \na pleasure to work with, that we would have a budget markup beginning \nthis Monday. He told us that last week. Well, it did not happen on \nMonday. Then maybe it was going to be Tuesday. Maybe it was going to be \nWednesday. Then all of a sudden the President invited the Democrats \nover Wednesday and the Republicans to the White House Thursday and \neverything is off.\n  I asked my staff, have we received a notice that we are going to have \na Budget Committee hearing next week? The answer is no. So what do we \nsay about that?\n  The Budget Act says the Senate and the House should commence budget \naction April 1. We have not done that. It says a budget should be \npassed by April 15. The Senate has not done that. The Republican House \nhas. The Republican House has proposed a historic budget. They have \npassed it. They passed it on time. It will reduce spending by about $6 \ntrillion. That would actually reduce taxes also and get the rates down \nto help encourage more economic growth, and put us on a path to fiscal \nsanity, not only this decade, but in the decades to come, because it \ndealt with some of the exploding entitlement programs such as Medicare.\n  What resulted from that? Well, Mr. Ryan, a brilliant young \nCongressman who has worked on budget issues for many years, is the most \nknowledgeable person probably in America about the details and the \nfinancial condition of America. They attacked him as though he did \nsomething wrong. The Democratic Senators and the President are spending \ntheir time attacking the one person who stood up and produced a budget \nthat can be defended. He is prepared to defend it anywhere, anytime. He \ngoes to townhall meetings. He has stood before the press. He has issued \nstatements. He has explained what his budget is. It may not be perfect, \nbut it is a change. It would put us on a path to financial stability. \nAnd what has the Senate done? Complained about his budget. Well, it is \ntime this Senate produces a budget.\n\n  Let me say this: Today, 743 days have passed since the Senate has \npassed a budget. Now, let me ask, if we took a poll of the American \npeople, how many of the American people would say the Senate shouldn't \npass a budget? We have a whole act that requires one to be passed and \nbrought up and voted on. What happened last year? The Budget Committee \ndid produce a budget. It came to the floor, and the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, just didn't have time to bring it up. Why? Well, you \nknow, there is a vote-arama. We don't like vote-aramas. What is a vote-\narama? Everybody gets to file an amendment, and Senators are supposed \nto vote. It has to be brought up and passed. It is passed by a simple \nmajority. Why? Because we want to accelerate the debate and make sure a \nbudget is passed because a nation that intends to be serious about its \nfinancial stability needs a budget, does it not? This began in the \n1970s.\n  So we are now beginning to wonder, will the committee even pass a \nbudget? Is Senator Conrad not even going to have a committee markup and \nproduce a budget? Is the Democratic Senate not even going to move one \nout of committee? At least it moved one out of committee last year. And \nif the committee does meet and does move a budget, is Senator Reid \nprepared to stand up, like Congressman Ryan, lay his budget down before \nthe American people, and defend it before the world? Oh, well, we need \nto have talks. We have talks going on. The Vice President is having a \nmeeting. The President is inviting everybody over.\n  Why don't we move forward with our budget process, I ask? Why don't \nwe? Well, why not? We read in one of our local newspapers that cover \nthe Senate--I think it was The Hill--Senator Conrad had a hard time \nwith his Democratic colleagues. His budget, which I very much was \nafraid wouldn't contain spending enough, but certainly I felt it would \nbe better than the budget President Obama had submitted, was discussed \nwith his Democratic colleagues last week in their conference, and it \ndidn't go well, we are told. So this week he came back again, \napparently, and produced another budget.\n  According to the report, Senator Sanders--probably the most \naggressive and articulate advocate for greater government spending and \nactivism in the Senate--seemed to be very happy that he changed the \nbudget, and it had $2 trillion in tax increases, they said, and $2 \ntrillion in spending reductions. That is supposed to be balanced. But \nthat is not what the debt commission said. The debt commission--which I \ndidn't agree with, really--said we should have at least $3 worth of \nspending reduction for every $1 in tax increases.\n  Then we have another report. I think it was in the CQ publication \nthat does work around here and digs up information. They said it looks \nas if there are going to be fewer spending reductions. It looks as \nthough it is going to be about $2 trillion in tax increases and only \n$1.5 trillion in reduced spending. So it is less than even 1-to-1.\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n  Well, I think if I were the majority leader, I wouldn't really feel \ncomfortable about bringing such a budget as that before the American \npeople and standing right down here and defending such a weak response \nto the fiscal crisis we are now in. Of course, that budget is \nirresponsible if that is so. I don't think the American people will be \nhappy with it. I certainly will oppose it with all the strength in my \nbody if that is the nature of it.\n  Well, why don't you know, Sessions?\n  Well, I haven't been told. We asked. The Republican members of the \ncommittee wrote the chairman and asked that any budget numbers that are \nproduced be produced 72 hours in advance of the hearing so we can study \nit, offer amendments, or substitute as we choose to do. We have been \nbasically told we will get the budget resolution the chairman intends \nto file the morning it starts. When we commence the hearing to mark up \nthe budget, we will be getting the copy of what they propose to bring \nforward. We really think that is not a healthy way to do business on a \nmatter this important.\n  This period in history represents the most significant long-term \nthreat to American financial stability that we have seen maybe ever. \nSure, we had a tough time during World War II and the debt went up, but \nwe could see, when the war was over, the strength of our workforce, and \nthe economy grew. We came right out of that and got that situation \nunder control quickly. But now we are in a situation in which our \nNation is aging. The number of people working is down. The number of \nrecipients of Medicare and Social Security is up. We have to figure out \na way to honestly deal with that without in any way placing our seniors \nat risk and other people who benefit from government programs.\n  It is going to take some change. It is first going to take change in \nwasteful Washington spending. All our discretionary spending needs to \nbe looked at, and we also are going to have to look at the long-term \nprospects for our financial future, as our creditors--those who are \nloaning us this money we are borrowing--are getting uneasy. They are \nnot too comfortable with what we are doing.\n  I believe any President of any party who desires the mantle of a \nleader, desires to demonstrate a commitment to a firm footing for our \nfinancial future, should come forth with a plan as part of the budget \nprocess and lay it out so the American people can see it.\n  I am becoming very concerned, once again, even though 743 days have \npassed since a budget has cleared this Senate, that we may not get one \nthis year. What an event. That, to me, is unthinkable. How \nirresponsible could we be to go another year under these circumstances? \nFor example, the Congressional Budget Office has analyzed the \nPresident's proposal for the future, and that scoring of the \nPresident's budget concludes a couple of things. Last year, the \ninterest we paid on the money this Nation has borrowed was $200 \nbillion. In 10 years, under the President's plan, the Congressional \nBudget Office said the amount of interest that would be paid in 1 year \nis $940 billion. That is bigger than the Defense Department. That is \nbigger than Medicare. It will be the largest single item in the entire \nbudget. It is unthinkable. We get no benefit from that whatsoever \nexcept the money we borrowed to live off of.\n  We are passing huge debts off to our grandchildren. The expert \neconomists and financiers who testified before the Budget Committee \nsaid: Don't think you can just assume the problem falls on your \ngrandchildren. They said we could have a crisis much sooner than that.\n  Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson issued a statement to us when they \ntestified that said we are facing the most predictable debt crisis in \nAmerican history. We asked: Could we have an idea of when such a crisis \ncould hit us? And Mr. Bowles, chosen by President Obama to head the \ncommission, said 2 years, maybe a little earlier, maybe a little later. \nAlan Simpson said: I think it could be 1 year.\n  Well, we hope we don't have some new debt crisis. We hope the people \nwho have been loaning us money don't get so nervous, as they have done \nin Greece, that our interest rate surge puts this economy in a \ndangerous condition and damages our country. I hope that is not \nhappening within 2 years or 1 year. Wouldn't that be a disaster for us? \nHow do we prevent it? We take action now that changes the debt \ntrajectory of our country and sends a message to the whole world: We \nget it. We know we can't continue on this path, and we are changing. \nAnd the way our Congress and government is set up, the way that change \noccurs is through the adoption of a budget.\n  I remain very disappointed that while the House has produced a \nhistoric budget on time--by April 15--we have not even begun to mark up \na budget in the Senate. That is irresponsible. And we need to know and \nthe American people need to know that the majority leader, if a budget \nis passed out of committee--and certainly it should be--will move it to \nthe floor and bring it up for vote and amendment and debate, and then \nit goes to the House and conference, they hammer out the differences, \nand we adopt a budget that can help put this country on a sound \nfinancial path and avoid the kind of crisis so many experts have warned \nus could occur.\n  I thank the Chair. I see my fabulous colleague, Senator Hatch, the \nranking Republican member of the Finance Committee and my former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. I was honored to serve with him.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my dear colleague for his kind \nremarks.

Madam President, yesterday the Finance Committee held a \nhearing on the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, what we call the \nColombia Trade Promotion Agreement. This agreement will provide \nsignificant new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, agricultural \nproducers, and service providers in the rapidly growing Colombian \nmarket.\n  Implementation of the Colombia agreement would also benefit U.S. \nnational security. Colombia is emerging from decades of civil strife, \nand it is in our interests to see that Colombia continues to heal from \nits wounds of the past. This free trade agreement will help bring \nfurther stability to Colombia, a close friend and ally, while also \nopening and further building the market for U.S. exports to that \ncountry. In short, it is a good agreement for the United States.\n  So what is the holdup? Over 4 years have passed since the U.S.-\nColombia Trade Promotion Agreement was signed. It is imperative that \nthe administration submit an implementing bill for this agreement to \nCongress, and soon. The administration, however, still won't say when \nit will send an implementing bill to Capitol Hill.\n  During yesterday's hearing, I asked our Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative two very simple questions regarding this issue. First, \nassuming that Colombia fulfills the steps outlined in the labor action \nplan developed by the Obama administration and the Colombian \nGovernment, will the administration submit the Colombia agreement to \nCongress for a vote? Second, is the administration preconditioning the \nPresident's formal submission of the Colombia trade agreement on \nmatters not related to the action plan, such as congressional extension \nof trade adjustment assistance or permanent normal trade relations for \nRussia? To me, these questions are pretty clear and can be answered \nwith a simple yes or no. But, unfortunately, we did not get a clear \nanswer. After years of delay, we still do not know if the \nadministration will ever submit the Colombia agreement to Congress for \napproval. This is very unfortunate.\n  The Obama administration's delay in submitting the Colombia agreement \nis hurting U.S. exporters. This failure is a drag on job creation and \neconomic growth. While the President has dithered as to whether to \nimplement the trade agreement with Colombia, our trade competitors have \nbeen more than willing to enter into agreements with Colombia. \nConsequently, while Colombia's tariffs on U.S. imports have remained in \nplace, Colombia's tariffs on products from other countries are falling \naway.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  For example, Colombia has implemented a preferential trade agreement \nwith Argentina and Brazil. As a result, U.S. farm products are rapidly \nbeing displaced in the Colombia market by products from those \ncountries. So it is not too surprising that between 2007 and 2010, U.S. \nagricultural exports to Colombia fell by more than half, and it looks \nlike matters are going to get even worse. A Montana wheat grower who \ntestified at yesterday's hearing noted that the U.S. share of \nColombia's wheat market fell from 73 percent in 2008 to 43 percent in \n2010. He also stated that following implementation of the Canada-\nColombia Free Trade Agreement, which is expected to occur this year, \nU.S. exports of wheat to Colombia will drop to zero unless the United \nStates implements its trade agreement with Colombia. So U.S. \nagricultural exports to Colombia are already falling. U.S. manufactured \ngoods and U.S. services will be next.\n  It does not have to be this way. We do not have to continue giving \naway the growing Colombia market to our competitors. If we want to \nboost our exports to Colombia, all we have to do is implement the U.S.-\nColombia Trade Promotion Agreement.\n  The Obama administration had earlier stated that it wanted to address \nColombia's internal labor situation before moving ahead with the \nagreement. But the administration delayed taking any meaningful steps \nto address their concerns with the Colombian government for years. A \nfew months ago, the administration finally got serious about engaging \nwith Colombia. And, lo and behold, in a matter of weeks--in a matter of \nweeks--they were able to develop a labor action plan that addressed \ntheir concerns in a meaningful and concrete way. The administration \ndiscovered that, in their own words, they had a willing partner in \nColombia. The fact of the matter is that Colombia has been taking steps \nfor years to address issues related to violence against unionists and \nhas always been willing to do more. Why it took the administration so \nlong to figure it out is a mystery to me.\n  So the Obama administration has now negotiated an action plan that \naddresses its concerns regarding the labor situation in Colombia. You \nwould think we would have clarity that, once the steps in the action \nplan are fulfilled, the administration would submit the agreement to \nCongress for its consideration. But we do not have this clarity. There \nhas been no clear answer to this very simple question. Instead, there \nseem to be more preconditions on submitting the agreement that are not \neven related to the agreement itself, such as extension of trade \nadjustment assistance and permanent normal trade relations for Russia.\n  This is very odd. Most economists would agree that there are likely \nto be very few workers who will lose their jobs because of \nimplementation of the Colombia trade agreement. After all, the U.S.-\nColombia trade agreement will result in almost no growth in imports \nfrom Colombia. This is the case as almost all Colombian products have \nentered the United States duty free over the past two decades on \naccount of U.S. trade preference programs. In contrast, Colombia's \naverage applied tariff on U.S. imports is over 12 percent, and they can \nreach as high as 388 percent.\n  Moreover, the administration itself testified that implementation of \nthe Colombia agreement: will expand exports of U.S. goods to Colombia \nby more than a billion dollars--that is with a ``B''--increase U.S. GDP \nby $2.5 billion; and support thousands of additional jobs for our \nworkers, at a time when we need jobs, and when we need to pull this \neconomy out of the mess it is in. So it is hard to see further \nextension of the TAA program as a necessary precondition for approval \nof an agreement that will help our economy and support jobs in the \nUnited States. It is a no-brainer.\n  I am also bewildered by any attempts to precondition submission of \nthe Colombia agreement to congressional support for permanent normal \ntrade relations for Russia. These two issues are totally unrelated. \nGiven the current disregard for the rule of law and the many trade \nproblems that persist in Russia today, it is hard to argue that the \ntime is ripe for Congress to grant Russia permanent normal trade \nrelations.\n  Moreover, it would be particularly ironic and sad to condition \npassage of the Colombia trade agreement with permanent normal trade \nrelations for Russia. Over the past 4 years, Colombia has been a \nreliable U.S. trading partner, ready and willing to remove its tariffs \non U.S. imports through implementation of our trade agreement. During \nthese same years, Russia has seemingly gone out of its way on numerous \noccasions to prove to the United States that it is an unreliable \ntrading partner.\n  It is fundamentally unfair to continue to treat a friend and ally \nlike Colombia in this ridiculous way. Unfortunately, it is not the \nfirst time Democratic leaders have put one of our closest Latin \nAmerican allies in this position. The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion \nAgreement was first signed on November 22, 2006--almost 5 years ago. \nDemocratic leaders refused to consider the agreement until their \nadditional demands were met on labor, the environment, and intellectual \nproperty. The Bush administration responded by working with then-\nSpeaker Pelosi on a package of changes that were understood would lead \nto consideration of the agreement. But once they had these changes in \nhand, the Democratic leadership in the House balked, citing yet more \nissues that had to be resolved. When President Bush submitted the \nColombia agreement to Congress for its consideration utilizing trade \npromotion authority procedures in April 2008, the Democratic leadership \nrefused to allow the agreement to come up for a vote. Instead, they \nchanged the rules, and the agreement has since languished for almost 5 \nyears.\n  It is time for the excuses to end. Resolution of unrelated issues \nsuch as trade adjustment assistance and PNTR for Russia should not be \nused as further barriers to submission of this agreement. Colombia is \ntaking the steps laid out by the Obama administration that the \nadministration has said are necessary before the President will \nformally submit the agreement to Congress. Once those steps are taken \nin June, I fully expect the administration to finally fulfill its end \nof the bargain and formally submit the agreement for congressional \napproval without further conditions. If not, the administration is \nmaking a conscious decision to continue denying U.S. exporters improved \naccess to the Colombian market, and to undermine our standing as a \ncredible ally in Latin America.\n  It is a no-brainer to realize that Colombia is one of our best \nfriends. When you compare it to some of its neighbors, such as \nVenezuela--and I can name other countries that are undermining our very \ncountry as we sit here and stand here. The fact of the matter is, \nColombia is a friend. Friends should not be treated this way. It is \nridiculous what is going on. There is very little need for trade \nadjustment assistance in this particular deal. It is just another way \nof sucking from the taxpayers more money for purposes that literally do \nnot exist.\n  I hope the administration will wake up and realize this would be a \ntremendous achievement for them. There is no reason in the world why \nthey should not want to do this. It would be a sure creator of jobs at \na time when we need jobs. It will even up a situation that up to this \npoint has been sad. And it will help our country. Let's quit playing \ngames with this free trade agreement. Let's get it up. Let's vote on \nit, and let's restore our relationship with Colombia to the great \nrelationship it deserves to be.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.)

Mr. President, as I stand here today, I am trying to \nfigure out what our activities look like to the average American. They \nknow we still have serious economic problems, though we are on a good \ntrack, and I think it is fair to say we are feeling a little bit \nbetter. But we were cautioned\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nby President Obama the other day--those of us who had a chance to sit \nin a room with him--that while things are looking up, there is still a \nlong way to go before our people are back to work and before they can \nafford the basics they need to take care of their families.\n  While this is going on we have seen the most incredible courage, the \nmost well-developed military plan imaginable, and the courage of our \npeople who went in to apprehend Osama bin Laden. Thank goodness, nobody \nwas hurt. It was a job well done, and the execution of a plan to bring \nto justice a man who helped kill almost 3,000 people at the World Trade \nCenter and hundreds more in other attacks on American facilities--the \nEmbassy in Tanzania, the Embassy in Kenya, the ship USS Cole--taking \nAmerican lives. That is what they were determined to do.\n  President Obama, after lots of previous administrations looking at \nthings, trying to figure out what to do to stop these terrorist attacks \non America, had the courage to make a decision that would have rested \nso heavily on anyone in that governing position. He decided to take the \nrisk knowing that our people were so well trained, so well committed \nthat the chance of their failure was very slim but very real.\n  Good things have happened in America. Not only did this operation \nagainst bin Laden succeed in at least slowing down, if not eliminating, \nsome of the terrorist threats in America, it also lifted the spirits of \nAmericans across the country. We all felt better about it because we \nfought back against this terror threat.\n  But now I look at where we are and listen to the debate and look at \nwhat the House of Representatives has done with their majority. At this \npoint in time, when we are still reeling from shock, having had perhaps \nthe greatest recession since the Great Depression of the twenties and \nthirties, instead of trying to figure out ways to solve the problems, \nour colleagues on the Republican side are trying to figure out ways to \npunish the public. They would say to them: OK, so you don't have enough \njobs--we are going to try to reduce the possibility that we will have \nenough, to reduce the possibility that a person who can learn but is \nnot well off can get an education. They want to take away those \nopportunities. They want to take away programs that have succeeded.\n  We look back at our history in the last 90 years and ask: How did we \nget here? How did we get where we are? Mr. President, 400,000 Americans \nwere killed in World War II. Then we saw growth in our country because \nof planning during President Roosevelt's days in the New Deal and the \nplanning that President Johnson offered. We had Social Security \ndeveloped, and then came Medicare, and then came Medicaid--programs \nthat help people.\n  On a personal basis, for me, those years I am talking about were \nparticularly significant. I was born to a poor family. My father found \nit very difficult to earn a living, as did millions of other Americans. \nHe worked in a silk factory in the city of Paterson, NJ. He was a man \nvery conscious of his health. But the problem was that the environment \nwas such that he contracted cancer when he was 42. He died when he was \n43 years old. His brother, working in the same type of facility, died \nwhen he was 52. My grandfather, who worked in the mills, died when he \nwas 56 years old. That was life as I saw it. Things were bleak.\n  My mother was a 37-year-old widow, and she had to carry on through my \nfather's sickness. They bought a store to make ends meet. It did not do \nvery well, but it kept her going for a while. When all was over and my \nfather died, I was already enlisted in the Army. My mother had no \nresources left. She owed doctors, owed pharmacists, owed hospitals. \nEvery penny she had was gone. I looked at this experience and thought: \nSomething is not fair. But I was lucky. I was able to get my education \nunder the GI bill, as did 8 million other people who wore the American \nuniform during those dark days.\n  What happened? I got an education. I went to Columbia University. I \nwas lucky. My tuition was paid for. I even got some money for books and \nsome things I might have needed along the way were provided. It made a \nworld of difference.\n  I was able, with two friends, to start a business. The company is \nfairly well known. It is called ADP. The three of us started with \nnothing, the two brothers with whom I was associated. Their father also \nworked in the factories of Paterson. They were immigrants as were my \ngrandparents. But along came this educational opportunity, and with \nthat came an opportunity to start a business. Today that company, ADP, \nis one of the four most creditworthy companies in the United States. \nThey are listed as a three-star company.\n  ADP has 45,000 employees. They work in 21 countries. Most of the \noperation is in America but some of it is outside. It employs over \n45,000 employees and helps businesses by taking over a particular part \nof their recordkeeping needs. It helps make things operate better in \nthese companies.\n  Every month there is a labor statistic that is put out. It is done by \nADP, my old company. The numbers are more reliable than those of the \nBureau of Labor Statistics because the data is fresher. Every week, \nsome 35 million people get their paychecks and that is where the data \ncomes from. I left the company when I came here 29 years ago.\n  From all these experiences, I saw an America that gave people like me \na chance to do things and created what is called the greatest \ngeneration in the history of America. Now, Mr. President, I am \nbeginning to see what I believe is a great generation developing--the \nnumber of people getting to work, fewer claims for unemployment \ninsurance, more consumer spending, and retail sales are up. The signs \nare good.\n\n  So when I look at what is going on in the House of Representatives, I \nsee the stubbornness of our colleagues who refuse to step in and say: \nLook, we have to keep the government strong, we have to make sure we \nsupply the kind of energy to the government that can move America \nalong. Their response is cut, cut, cut, when all the critical social \nprograms I mentioned were a needed expansion of government services. I \nam not one of those who want to cut valuable programs. I am one of \nthose who want to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, when you look at a balance sheet, a financial \nstatement, it carries two parts: One part is expenses--costs--and the \nother part is revenues. You can cut expenses all you want, but if the \nrevenues don't improve, you go bankrupt. It is pretty simple. And that \nis where we are being asked to put our future on the line. Hold the \ndebt ceiling as ransom? For what? For what? It will destroy the \ncompetence in America. It will destroy our ability to be the country we \nare, the country that still leads the world despite competition.\n  When I left home this morning, I passed an Exxon station that is \nfairly near my home. There was a sign on the pump that gave the price \nof their gas--$4.79 a gallon. For people who have any distance to \ntravel, this is painful. This is painful. This is part of the income \nthey can use for basic things that are needed.\n  But what do we see? We see major gasoline companies, and we ask \nourselves: Whose side are our colleagues on? It appears they are on the \nside of the gasoline companies. I think we ought to be more \nconscientious about this and make sure the public understands we are \nthere for them, for the majority of people in this country who are sick \nand tired of seeing the price-gouging we have seen from the gasoline \ncompanies.\n  There was a Finance Committee hearing today, and I watched and heard \nthe heads of these companies--the five big oil companies--say what they \nare worried about. Well, they are worried about the prospect of losing \n$4 billion a year they get in subsidies. And there was even kind of a \ncaustic comment that it might be un-American to take away the subsidies \nthese people get. Mr. President, $4 billion a year in subsidies.\n  When you look at what is going on with these companies, you see \nastounding results. Make no mistake, greed is fueling their appetite, \nand the bigger it gets, the more they want.\n  During the years of World War II, there was an excess profits tax \nthat said companies shouldn't be feeding off of the opportunity the war \npresented and taking advantage of the public. Well, we are at war, in \ncase people have forgotten about it. Afghanistan is a\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nreal war. We still have the remnants of the difficulties in Iraq, we \nhave piracy on the seas, and we have all kinds of things we have to \nkeep fighting for. So there ought to be some recompense for our country \nfor the opportunity they have to make this kind of money.\n  These are their earnings during the first 3 months of 2011, which is \nstill part of the recession time: Exxon, their end-of-quarter profits \nwere over $10 billion. Shell, almost $9 billion. BP, $7.1 billion--that \nis after their foul mistake in the Gulf of Mexico that cost plenty of \nmoney. They still made that kind of money. And Chevron made $6.2 \nbillion. Little ConocoPhillips only made $3 billion in that quarter.\n  When you think about it, the irony is how well BP has done--a company \nthat spewed 200 million gallons of oil into the ocean last year. Why is \nour government shoving billions of dollars into the pockets of their \nexecutives, their lawyers? Why don't we use the money to invest in a \nstronger America and pay down our debt? I would like to see us doing \nthat.\n  Big Oil's greed is helping to inflate our deficit. Every day, \nAmericans are footing the bill. You would think our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle would want to put a stop to this madness, to \nstep up for the average person. Well, so far we are not doing what I \nwould like to see being done for the public, for the average citizen. \nBig Oil is doing everything in its power to protect its subsidies, and \nthe Republicans are doing everything in their power to help them. The \nRepublicans say that eliminating these wasteful subsidies will raise \ngas prices. That is wrong. That is plain wrong.\n  Look at the compensation of the CEOs here. Now, they are not selling \npretzels or making potato chips; they are dealing with a commodity that \nis essential to the functioning of our society, of mankind. The CEO at \nExxon got $29 million; ConocoPhillips, $18 million; Chevron, $16 \nmillion. These are all in 2010, for the year just recently concluded. I \nwant to make certain people understand that companies paying their fair \nshare in taxes isn't going to hurt the industry. It just means Big Oil \nexecutives may have to make do with a smaller swimming pool or maybe \nsmaller yacht, but no real pain or punishment there.\n  The fact is, the Big Oil CEOs aren't feeling this recession. But \ninstead of making our government more fiscally responsible by ending \nthe giveaways to Big Oil, the Republicans have another idea: They want \nto cut the deficit by ending Medicare as we know it. That won't save us \nany money in the long term. It will simply increase the expenditures, \nas many are forced to pay more out of their own pockets for their \nhealth. Seniors are struggling. The big oil companies aren't.\n  I wish the other side would listen a little more closely to the \nwishes of the American people. Almost three-quarters of Americans say \nwe should stop giving billions in tax breaks to the big oil companies \neach year. The American people know these subsidies are unnecessary, \nineffective, and immoral. And it is not as if the oil industry is \ntaking its annual $4 billion windfall and investing it in our country's \nfuture. No. In addition to going into the paychecks of the Big Oil \nexecutives, this money is being used to line the pockets of the \nindustry's lawyers and lobbyists who are seen frequently and obviously \naround here.\n  I have seen this time and time again during my career in the Senate. \nI was the first Senator on the scene at the Exxon Valdez when it rammed \ninto the Alaskan shoreline in 1989. Instead of being forthcoming and \ndoing what they should have done, Exxon fought over every penny with \nthe communities in Alaska--the families and the fishermen whose lives \nit destroyed. Instead of stepping up to pay the court-awarded damages--\n$5 billion--Exxon said: To heck with that verdict. We will fight it. We \nwill fight it all the way. And they did, for years. They knocked down \nthe amount from $5 billion in punitive damages to $500 million. I \nguarantee you they paid a lot of money to the lawyers and lobbyists, \nbut they would rather give it to them than to the American people. That \nis what that shows. In the end, it took more than 20 years for Exxon to \npay for what it had done. Some victims died while waiting for the \ncompany to make things right.\n  So we should not be giving Big Oil $4 billion in tax breaks each \nyear. Their profits, which last year exceeded $100 billion, are larger \nthan lots of countries. We should be investing in ways to break our \ndangerous addiction to oil. We should be investing in innovative \napproaches to moving people and goods, including increasing funds for \ntransit, creating a world-class high-speed rail network, and expanding \nthe number of electric cars on our roads. We should also boost our \ncountry's promising clean energy industry, making sure we lead the \nworld in the export of environmental products that are proudly stamped \nwith the ``Made in the USA'' label.\n  Don't be fooled--drilling will not, in the final analysis, get us out \nof our energy problems. We use almost a quarter of the world's oil, but \nwe sit on less than 3 percent of the world's reserve. So drilling is \ngoing to just quickly bring the end of our ability to produce oil. That \nwill be the conclusion. According to the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, even if we open every offshore drilling area in the \ncontinental United States, the average price of gasoline would drop by \njust 3 cents a gallon by the year 2030. Here, we see it: The benefit of \nincreased drilling will save us 3 cents a gallon in two decades. That \nis not very promising for people who have to rely on the automobile for \nall kinds of things in their lives.\n  Continuing to subsidize oil companies only increases our dependence \non dirty fuels. And even as our children pay a heavy price--with asthma \nvictims and other respiratory problems--it keeps us on a dead-end road \nto sky-high energy bills, more oil spills like the one we saw in the \ngulf, and dangerous pollution levels. Investing in clean alternatives \nto oil, cars that go further on a gallon of gas, and smart \ntransportation, such as mass transit, are the only realistic solutions \nto our energy challenges.\n  Beyond clean energy investments, we should take the $4 billion we \ngive away to Big Oil each year and use that money to pay down our \ndeficit. It is pretty clear that we cannot restore fiscal sanity to our \ngovernment unless we start paying more attention to the revenue column \nin our ledger.\n  I was a CEO for many years. I know you cannot run a company or a \ncountry without a strong revenue flow. Ending the government's wasteful \noil industry subsidies will not be enough to erase our deficit, but it \nis a good place to start.\n  I call on my colleagues, have a citizen's heart. Look at this as you \nwould any other obligation you have in your life. Make sure our country \nis strong and that our middle-class and our modest earners can look \nahead for a decent life for themselves, educating their children and \nprotecting their parents with proper health care. Get Big Oil off the \nwelfare rolls. Let's end the industry's tax breaks and end our \ncountry's addiction to oil and other dirty fuels.\n  Let's invest in clean energy and smart transportation--and cut the \nwindfalls for the oil industry lobbyists and lawyers. I want to make \nsure--and I am sure all of us do, down deep--our grandchildren and \nchildren inherit a country that is fiscally sound and morally \nresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2920-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2920-S2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2011 NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this afternoon I had the honor of attending \nthe Top Cops event hosted by President Obama at the White House. I will \nbe honored Sunday to attend the National Peace Officers Memorial \nceremony. I appreciate the support the President is showing for our law \nenforcement officers not just this week but every week. Local law \nenforcement is critical to the peace and security of our families and \ncommunities in Vermont and across the country.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation to designate \nMay 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date \nfalls as Police Week. Every year during Police Week, thousands of law \nenforcement officers from around the country converge on Washington, \nDC, to honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice keeping all of \nus safe. I want to mark this week by recognizing the heroic women and \nmen in law enforcement who are dedicated to just that. More than \n900,000 law enforcement officers guard our communities at great\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nrisk to their safety every day. National Peace Officers Memorial Day \nprovides the people of theUnited States, in their communities, in their \nstate capitals, and in the Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to \nhonor and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year \nafter year by the women and men who serve in police forces, as peace \nofficers and in all branches of law enforcement.\n  This week we honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty, \nand their families. In 2010, 153 law enforcement officers died while \nserving in the line of duty. Their bravery and sacrifice should not be \nforgotten. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have \nbeen more than 19,000 law enforcement officers who have died in the \nline of duty.\n  Late last week, the Senate passed a resolution I introduced to \nrecognize those officers who lost their lives last year. I thank \nSenator Grassley for joining me in sponsoring that resolution. I am \nglad the Senate came together unanimously to show its strong support \nand appreciation of America's law enforcement officers.\n  Keeping our communities safe is vitally important work and will \nalways be dangerous, but we must work to keep those who protect us as \nsafe as possible. The officers who lost their lives in 2010 are a stark \nreminder that we must not let up in our support of those who work day \nin and day out in the service of all of us and our communities.\n  I was proud to champion bipartisan legislation first passed more than \na decade ago which has authorized Federal funding to assist in the \npurchase of lifesaving bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers. \nI have worked hard to ensure that legislation is funded each year. From \n1999 through 2009, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has \nhelped provide more than 800,000 vests. Just last year, the program \npaid for 95 new vests across Vermont. These vests have saved the lives \nof police officers across America.\n  In these tough economic times, when towns and cities have had to \ntighten their belts and make tough decisions about their budgets, these \ngrants are even more important to protect law enforcement officers. \nCongress must continue to support this initiative to increase the \nsafety of those in the line of duty.\n  Congress must also continue to support Federal assistance to state \nand local law enforcement. Consistent support for key Federal support \ninitiatives like the COPS program, the Byrne/JAG program, and rural law \nenforcement grants are an important reason why crime rates have \ncontinued to decline even as the economy struggled and State budgets \ntightened. We were able to secure funding in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act and renewed commitments in the appropriations process, \nwhich allowed police departments throughout the country to hire and \nmaintain officers, buy needed equipment, and provide training.\n  In the current budget environment, everyone has had to make \nsacrifices. Even the President, who has been a strong supporter of law \nenforcement, has called for modest cuts in Federal assistance to State \nand local law enforcement. What we cannot afford are the draconian cuts \nin law enforcement assistance that others are proposing. We owe it to \nour law enforcement professionals and to our communities to continue \nour much-needed support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2921-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HIRING HEROES ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President George Washington once said \n``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in \nany war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how \nthey perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated \nby their nation.''\n  President Washington's words are a serious reminder of our obligation \nto all of the brave men and women serving our country overseas. We have \na solemn obligation to our veterans when they return home. And the \nunemployment numbers among veterans make it clear that we have a long \nway to go.\n  The unemployment rate among veterans who have served in the military \nsince September 2001 far exceeds that of their nonveteran peers. The \nunemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans hit 13.1 percent in \nApril. This is roughly 3 percentage points higher than the previous \nyear. The unemployment rate among Montana veterans has more than \ndoubled since 2005. This is a serious problem. We should be greeting \nour veterans with quality health care and our eternal gratitude, not an \nunemployment check.\n  Yesterday, I was proud to stand with my friends and colleagues, \nSenator Patty Murray and Senator Jon Tester, as we introduced the \nHiring Heroes Act of 2011. The bill will take a number of important \nsteps to help our brave veterans find work when they come home from \nwar.\n  If a soldier serves as a truck driver or a medic in the military, \nthere shouldn't be excessive red tape to become a truck driver or serve \nin a hospital as a civilian. That is why this bill requires the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the \nSecretary of Labor to study how skills learned in the military can be \nmore effectively translated to meet the qualifications required for \ncivilian jobs back home. The legislation would also initiate a new \nprogram aimed at eliminating the barriers between military training and \ncivilian licensure or credentialing.\n  The Hiring Heroes Act would require the Department of Labor to reach \nout to and assist recently discharged veterans receiving disability \npayments. The bill would also extend the VA's authority to provide \nrehabilitation and job training for severely wounded troops. Without \nthis extension, only veterans separated from the military could take \nadvantage of these critical employment services. Helping veterans \nrequires close cooperation between the VA and veterans service \norganizations. That is why the legislation would authorize $4.5 million \nin grants for nonprofit organizations that help veterans find work.\n  The Hiring Heroes Act of 2011 compliments the legislation that \nSenators Tester, Grassley, Senator Burr and I introduced earlier this \nyear: the Veteran Employment Transition Act of 2011. This legislation \nwill reward employers that hire veterans who have recently completed \ntheir service in the military with up to a $2,400 tax credit under the \nwork opportunity tax credit. I am proud that 17 of my colleagues in the \nSenate--Republicans and Democrats--have cosponsored this legislation. \nThe House companion has 54 cosponsors.\n  The bill also cuts the redtape that generally exists under the work \nopportunity tax credit. Rather than having to go through the tax \ncredit's current certification process, qualified servicemen and women \nwho have been recently discharged will only need show their discharge \ndocumentation that was provided by the Department of Defense. This \nincludes those men and women who were activated by their states as \nmembers of the National Guard.\n  Enacting this legislation would just be the first step. The tax \ncredit will not work unless veterans and small businesses across the \ncountry know about it. That is why I am working with the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other \nVeteran Service Organizations to help get the word out about this tax \ncredit once we pass the legislation.\n  Briefly, I thank my Defenders of Freedom Fellows, Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans and Montana-Natives Charlie Cromwell and Troy \nCarter. As legislative fellows in my office, Charlie and Troy worked \nhard to draft and advance this bill. I created the Defenders of Freedom \nFellowship so that Montana veterans could work on legislation that \nhelps their fellow veterans. They would be proud of this legislation.\n  I encourage all interested Montana veterans to contact my office for \nmore information. It will take this kind of teamwork to provide the \nsupport our veterans need when they come home from war. It is an honor \nto introduce this legislation and I look forward to its quick passage \nthis legislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2921-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2921-S2922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SBIR/STTR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President. I wish to express my disappointment \nwith this body's failure to move forward with the Small Business \nInnovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer \nreauthorization.\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\n  The SBIR and STTR programs, as they are known, are key components in \nour Nation's commitment to being a global leader in research and \ndevelopment. If we allow these programs to expire, as they are \nscheduled to do at the end of this month, we will forfeit one of the \nbest tools we have to support innovation.\n  Big companies do not hold a monopoly on big ideas. Small businesses, \nhowever, often lack the resources necessary to get a good idea off the \nground. The SBIR and STTR programs have a long track record in helping \nsmall businesses leverage Federal support into innovative new \ntechnologies. Products developed with assistance from these programs \ncan be found inside everything from the B-2 bomber to the electric \ntoothbrush.\n  I am proud to say that some of these innovations were made in my home \nState of Rhode Island. Since the SBIR and STTR programs were created, \nRhode Island companies have received 277 awards and almost $100 million \nin Federal support.\n  One of those companies is EpiVax, a biotech firm located in \nProvidence. EpiVax focuses its work in the field of immunology and has \nreceived several SBIR awards over the years. Its most recent grant \nsupports research on the development of a type I diabetes treatment. \nOther projects have included a hemophilia therapy and an improved \nTuberculosis vaccine.\n  SEA Corp. is another Rhode Island company that has benefited from \nboth SBIR and STTR grants. Located in Middletown, SEA Corp. is a \nveteran-owned engineering firm. In 2000, they received an SBA award to \ndevelop launch systems for the Navy. They have taken the same kind of \ninflator that is used in automobile airbags and reconfigured it to \nshoot objects as large as a 750-pound torpedo. SEA Corp. is now \nadapting that technology to launch unmanned aerial vehicles from ships \nand submarines.\n  I am proud of these innovative Rhode Island projects and the \ncontributions they have made to our country. For Rhode Islanders, \nthough, their most significant impact has been in the jobs they have \nhelped create. EpiVax has grown to 22 employees at their facility in \nRhode Island, and SEA Corp. employs 330. At a time when my State \ncontinues to suffer from 11 percent unemployment, we cannot overlook \nthe importance of these jobs and the role played by the SBIR and STTR \nin supporting them.\n  In Rhode Island, we have put special emphasis on promoting the \n``knowledge district'' concept. Leaders like Brendan McNally, the \ndirector of the Rhode Island Center for Innovation and \nEntrepreneurship, have worked to bring together early-stage ventures \nand to foster an environment of collaboration and innovation. A handful \nof RI-CIE businesses have received SBIR awards and many others have \nexpressed interest in taking advantage of the grants to help their \ncompanies grow. If we fail to reauthorize these programs, great \ncompanies like EpiVax and SEA Corp. and so many others in Rhode Island \nand across the country may no longer have the resources to devote to \ndeveloping the next generation of cutting-edge technologies and to \ncreate high-quality jobs in those fields.\n  It is clear that America must renew its commitment to being the \nworld's leader in research and innovation. It is more than just a \nmatter of national pride--it is an important part of creating jobs and \nsecuring our country's long-term economic well-being. The \nreauthorization bill would strengthen the Small Business Innovation \nResearch and Small Business Technology Transfer programs and help \npreserve America's position as a leader in innovation.\n  I was discouraged that so many of my colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle voted to block the reauthorization of these vital \nprograms. Simply put, this should not be a partisan issue. Given the \nimportance of these programs to small businesses across the country, I \nhope that my Republican colleagues will come back to the table so that \nwe can work together to pass a bipartisan reauthorization bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2922-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ISRAEL'S 63RD INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the first months of 2011 have been marked \nin the Middle East by profound change as citizens have demanded greater \nrepresentation and increased accountability from their governments. As \nmany of those protesting for change were beaten and killed in the \nstreets, a sense of uncertainty about the future of the region and the \ncommitment of some of our allies to American values was palpable. Yet, \nduring this time of revolution, there has been no doubt about the \ncertainty and strength of our Nation's alliance and friendship with \nIsrael.\n  Since the United States recognized Israel 11 minutes after its \nfounding on May 14, 1948, the two countries have worked side by side to \nadvance democracy and peace.\n  In a region where dictators and family rule are the norm, Israel has \nstood out as a beacon for democracy--a country with an independent \njudicial system and strong rule of law where citizens are free to \nworship and speak as they wish.\n  For those wanting better governance and more rights in the Middle \nEast, they just have to look next door to Israel for an example of how \nthings could be.\n  In advance of Yom Ha'atzmaut--Israel's Independence Day--I wish to \ncongratulate the citizens of Israel for building a strong and vibrant \ncountry despite the myriad challenges, wars and attacks they have \nfaced. I look forward to working in the Senate to strengthen this \nstrategically important relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2922-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2922-S2923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PRIMO CARNABUCI\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, sometime after nightfall on November 1, \n1950, under the cover of a dark sky, there was a firefight north of the \ntown of Unsan, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Unsan lies \nin the eastern North Pyongan province, on the western half of the \npeninsula. It sits peripheral to the Kuryong River, which cuts a steep \nvalley through the land as it channels out into the Korea Bay. Unsan \nalso lies north of the 38th parallel and was enemy territory for the \nU.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, which had taken up \nposition there just days before.\n  The regiment was part of a northward advance toward the Sino-Korean \nborder, in aggressive pursuit of a weakened, retreating North Korean \nenemy. But as it advanced, it encountered a ferocious counteroffensive \nlead by Chinese forces, absorbing tragic casualties at the hands of \ndamaging defeat. As the regiment retreated south back across the \nKuryong, it was forced to leave behind many brothers in arms. Almost \n600 Americans fell that day, many of whom were declared missing in \naction, MIA, never to be found.\n  Among the regiment was Primo Carnabuci of Essex, CT. Primo came from \na family of patriots; his two brothers, Dominic and Louis, also served \nour country in uniform. Anecdotes about Primo from the battlefield \npaint the picture of a tenaciously courageous fighter. In one such \nstory, outlined in a military document awarding him a Distinguished \nService Cross for heroism, as reported by the Middletown Press, Primo \nwas temporarily sidelined from battle after killing three enemy \nsoldiers and taking grenade shrapnel to the face. As he was being \nattended to by a medic, Primo, according to the document, ``thrust away \nthe aid man, picked up his rifle, and with utter disregard for his own \nsafety, advanced into the fire of the enemy machine gun with blood \nstreaming down his face.''\n  His brother Dominic was not surprised to hear that story. And it is \nsafe to say that, as his regiment encountered those Chinese forces on \nthat November night in 1950, Primo did not shy away from danger, but \nrather took the fight to the enemy, even as it overwhelmed his \nregiment. He ultimately perished in that battle and was declared MIA, \nleaving his family back home in Connecticut heartbroken and unsure \nabout where he was, and whether he was alive or dead.\n  Suppressed in history's pages between the Second World War and the \nVietnam war, the Korean war is often referred to as the ``Unknown \nWar,'' or as the ``Forgotten War.'' While Primo Carnabuci's whereabouts \nwere unknown to his family, he was certainly not forgotten. Every night \nsince then, his brother Dominic has prayed that his brother would be \nfound, and returned safely and soundly.\n  Miraculously, that prayer was answered, in part, just a few months \nago,\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nwhen Dominic received a phone call from a U.S. Government official. \nPrimo's body had been found in a mass gravesite surrounded by several \nof his compatriots and identified by DNA. Now, Primo has left Unsan, \nand he is coming back home to Connecticut.\n  As we gaze across the endless expanse of graves at Arlington \nCeremony, or as we mourn the loss of a servicemember during a military \nburial somewhere across our land today, we must think about those who \npaid the ultimate sacrifice of not returning home alive but also not \nreturning home at all. This country and its freedoms that we enjoy \nexist because men and women like Primo Carnabuci have defended it. Many \nhave fallen for it so that we might live in freedom, and unfortunately, \nsome of those who have fallen do not have the solace of having America \nas their final resting place.\n  On Thursday, Primo Carnabuci will be buried in Clinton, CT, with full \nmilitary honors. As the crack of rifle fire and the cry of a bugle \nripple through the air, and as the colors that Primo wore the uniform \nfor are draped across his coffin, I hope that Dominic and the entire \nCarnabuci family will feel relief that Primo has come home and pride in \nhis service. America is where he belongs, and America is where he will \nnow forever rest in peace.\n  God bless Primo Carnabuci, God bless his family, and God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2923-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2923-S2924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor 349 high school \nseniors in 10 northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision to \nenlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 349 seniors from 116 high \nschools in 104 towns and cities, 98 will enter the Army, 134 will enter \nthe Marine Corps, 42 will enter the Navy, 25 will enter the Air Force, \nand 50 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard. In the presence of \ntheir parents or guardians, high school counselors, military leaders, \ncity and business leaders, all 349 are being recognized on May 12, \n2011, by ``Our Community Salutes of Cleveland.''\n  Later this month, these young men and women will join with many of \ntheir classmates in celebration of graduation. At a time when many of \ntheir peers are looking forward to pursuing vocational training or \ncollege degrees, or are uncertain about their future, these young men \nand women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to military \nservice in defense of our country.\n  Naturally, many may be anxious about the uncertainties that may await \nthem as members of the Armed Forces. But, they should rest assured that \nthe full support and resources of this Chamber, and the American \npeople, are with them in whatever challenges may lie ahead.\n  It is thanks to the dedication of an untold number of patriots like \nthese 349 that we are able to meet here today, in the U.S. Senate, and \nopenly debate the best solutions to the many diverse problems that \nconfront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the United \nStates of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a fractious \nworld. We are grateful to them, their parents and their communities for \ninstilling the character, values, discipline and mental and physical \nabilities of these outstanding young men and women.\n  Their decision to serve our country will not go unrecognized as we \nthank these 349 graduating seniors for the selflessness and courage \nthat they have shown by volunteering to risk their lives in defense of \nothers. We owe them, along with all those who serve our country, a deep \ndebt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe list of names of the high school seniors.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       United States Army--98:\n       Albright--Cleveland;

During his \ntenure, CSU has made great strides in becoming one of the country's top \nurban universities--the campus has been transformed with new buildings; \nhighly credentialed faculty and researchers have enriched the learning \nexperience; and enrollment has increased.\n  Mr. Weinberg has generously given his time and expertise to support \nCSU's mission and contribute to its success. Additionally, he has \nfinancially supported many CSU initiatives. He and his wife Terri \nserved as cochairs of the Moses Cleaveland Scholarship Dinner, and he \nis a platinum sponsor of Radiance. Additional recognition of Mr. \nWeinberg's efforts will come as the Trustees' boardroom is named for \nhim in recognition of a generous scholarship gift.\n  As part of Cleveland State University's Commencement Weekend \ncelebration, Mr. Weinberg, CSU President Ronald M. Berkman and the CSU \ncommunity will participate in the celebration of graduation as well as \nembark on a new tradition of celebrating and supporting scholarships, \nwhich are key to attracting promising students to Cleveland State \nUniversity and giving them the tools to succeed.\n  It is during this time of commencement that we can all pause to honor \nour new graduates on their accomplishments and wish them well as they \nembark on new opportunities. We are also grateful to CSU for helping to \nprovide our young people with the tools they need to be prepared for a \ncompetitive job market and to support their communities. It is \nimportant to thank those, such as Mr. Weinberg, who have dedicated time \nand resources to contribute to the success of our students, an \ninvestment that is critical to Cleveland's and our Nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2924-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS G.

The \nstory of how it happened is worth recounting.\n  On June 15, 1969, Lieutenant Kelley was leading several boats up the \nOng Muong Canal to extract an Army company when one suffered a \nmechanical failure. Moments later, the enemy attacked. At this point, I \nwould like to quote from Tom Kelley's Medal of Honor citation presented \nby President Richard M. Nixon:\n\n     . . . Lt. Comdr. Kelley realizing the extreme danger to his \n     column and its inability to clear the ambush site until the \n     crippled unit was repaired, boldly maneuvered the monitor in \n     which he was embarked to the exposed side of the protective \n     cordon in direct line with the enemy's fire, and ordered the \n     monitor to commence firing. Suddenly, an enemy rocket scored \n     a direct hit on the coxswain's flat, the shell penetrating \n     the thick armor plate, and the explosion spraying shrapnel in \n     all directions. Sustaining serious head wounds from the \n     blast, which hurled him to the deck of the monitor, Lt. Cmdr. \n     Kelley disregarded his severe injuries and attempted to \n     continue directing the other boats. Although unable to move \n     from the deck or to speak clearly into the radio, he \n     succeeded in relaying his commands through one of his men \n     until the enemy attack was silenced and the boats were able \n     to move to an area of safety.\n\n  The citation concludes:\n\n       Lt. Comdr. Kelley's brilliant leadership, bold initiative, \n     and resolute determination served to inspire his men and \n     provide the impetus needed to carry out the mission after he \n     was medically evacuated by helicopter. His extraordinary \n     courage under fire, and his selfless devotion to duty sustain \n     and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n  Tom retired from the Navy in 1990 with the rank of captain and \ncontinued to serve in the Defense Department as a civilian. After \nreturning to his hometown of Boston, Tom was named commissioner of the \nMassachusetts Department of Veterans' Services in 1999. In 2003, then \nGovernor Romney named him the department's secretary, where he served \nuntil January of this year. Many of us in and out of the service were \nvery sorry to see him go.\n  While at the helm of the Massachusetts Department of Veterans' \nServices, Tom Kelley remained a hard-charger, and through tireless \neffort, transformed the agency into a national model for effective and \nefficient care. Under Tom's leadership, a new generation of warriors \nwent off to fight in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nLiberation. Many of these warriors came home with severe physical \ninjuries and the invisible scars of brain trauma and post traumatic \nstress disorder. Tom ensured that the department devoted the same level \nof care for these younger men and women as it did veterans from earlier \nconflicts.\n  When I served in the State legislature, and as a member of the \nVeterans and Federal Affairs Committee, I worked closely with Tom on \nmany issues and was always inspired by his energy and passion for \nhelping his fellow veterans.\n  Tom served under Republican and Democrat Governors and ensured that \nthe department remained focused on providing outstanding service to \nMassachusetts' veterans. I have no doubt that Tom Kelley will always be \nregarded as an extremely effective and dedicated secretary of veterans' \naffairs.\n  Tonight, Tom will receive a fitting farewell at a bipartisan gala, \nall the proceeds of which will go to the Massachusetts Soldiers Legacy \nFund. And it comes as no surprise that the guest of honor insisted on \npurchasing his own ticket.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2924-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2924-S2925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DORI CARLSON\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes today \nto recognize an outstanding North Dakotan. On\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nJune 18, 2011, Dori Carlson will become the first female president of \nthe American Optometric Association, AOA. Dori, who has two offices in \nNorth Dakota, was honored in 1994 as the North Dakota Young Optometrist \nof the Year and in 2003 as the Optometrist of the Year. She was also \nthe first female president of the North Dakota Optometric Association.\n  Dori's No. 1 priority is to advocate the importance of having young \nchildren undergo vision testing. She tells parents all over the country \nabout ``vision'' problems faced by young children, and that it is \neasier to address these problems if discovered early. She regularly \nhighlights President Obama's statement regarding the need to review \nvision of young children:\n\n       No child should be falling behind at school because he or \n     she can't . . . see the blackboard.\n\n  This is President Obama, February 4, 2009.\n  As a result of Dori's emphasis on the importance of children's \nvision, there continues to be an increase in vision testing. This means \nthat fewer children are having vision problems. For all parents, we \nthank Dori for her dedication and congratulate her on becoming the new \nAOA president.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2925-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UH-72 LAKOTA LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to speak \ntoday to honor the inception of the UH-72 Lakota Light Utility \nHelicopter into the active fleet of the South Dakota National Guard D \nCompany 1/112th Security and Support Battalion. On May 15, a ceremony \nwill be held at the Crazy Horse Monument in the Black Hills of South \nDakota--the traditional homeland of the proud Lakota Sioux for whom \nthis aircraft has been named. After nearly a decade of development, the \nLight Utility Helicopter program offers the UH-72 Lakota as a state-of-\nthe-art aircraft which will provide medical support to members of our \nmilitary.\n  The UH-72 Lakota stands as a defining symbol of the continued \npartnership between the U.S. military and the Sioux people. Native \nAmericans from all reaches of this Nation have proven, time and again, \ntheir willingness to serve in the U.S. military to protect our \nfreedoms. In fact, members of Native American tribes like the Lakota \nhave historically served, and continue to serve, at a higher per-capita \nrate than any other ethnic group in America. In its medical evacuation, \nhomeland security, and drug enforcement aircraft capacities, I know the \nUH-72 Lakota will do this legacy proud, wherever it serves.\n  Per Department of Defense regulations, military helicopters are named \nafter Native American tribes, and the UH-72 joins the ranks of other \ndistinguished service helicopters like the H-60 Black Hawk, the H-64 \nApache, the H-66 Comanche, and many others. Naming the UH-72 after a \ntribe with such a distinct and honorable history of bravery and service \nis a tribute to Native American heritage as potent as the service the \naircraft itself will provide.\n  I commend the developers of this new aircraft for their hard work in \nthe design and testing phases, as well as the pilots and crews whose \ninput so critically enhanced the UH-72 as a finished product. I was \npleased to have the opportunity to view the Lakota up close at a \nRosebud Pow Wow a few years ago. I wish the pilots and crews of each of \nthe D Company 1/112th Security and Support Battalion, as well as those \nserving in other regions, the best of luck with this new aircraft. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2925-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING MAINE COMMERCIAL TIRE, INC.\n\n Ms SNOWE. Mr. President, next week marks the 48th annual \ncelebration of National Small Business Week, a tradition started in \n1963 under President Kennedy to highlight the critical role small \nbusinesses play in our society. This year, despite a difficult economy \nstruggling to rebound, we can be proud of our Nation's nearly 30 \nmillion small firms that are working to move our Nation forward.\n  In light of this, today I commend and recognize Maine Commercial \nTire, MCT, a commercial tire servicer and supplier in my home State of \nMaine. Recently, MCT's owners James McCurdy and James Lynch were named \nMaine's 2011 Small Business Persons of the year by the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration. This is a highly deserved honor as both \nindividuals' leadership has allowed MCT to prosper in a struggling and \ntumultuous economy.\n  Maine Commercial Tire began in 1990 in the town of Hermon, roughly 15 \nminutes from Bangor. Their goal was to supply new tires and retreaded \ntires while providing outstanding service to the many trucking \nbusinesses in Maine and portions of New Hampshire. Since that time MCT \nhas grown substantially from 18 employees to 59 employees, and expanded \nby opening three additional locations across the State, in Augusta, \nScarborough, and Lewiston. The company now retreads roughly 35,000 \ntires each year.\n  MCT is recognized both locally and globally for its commitment to \nexcellence. The International Organization for Standardization, ISO, \ndevelops and sets high global standards that a variety of international \ncompanies strive to achieve in order to become certified in their \nfield. In 2000, MCT became the first--and thus far, only--ISO 9002 \ncertified tire dealer and independently owned retread shop in the \nUnited States. In addition to demonstrating MCT's commitment to \nexcellence, this certification shows that American small businesses can \ntruly compete in a global marketplace with hard work and perseverance.\n  As a result of their accomplishments at MCT, Mr. McCurdy and Mr. \nLynch are receiving the prestigious Small Business Person of the Year \naward. This award takes into account a variety of criteria including: \nstaying power as an established business, growth in number of \nemployees, increase in sales and/or unit volume, current and past \nfinancial performance, innovativeness of product or service offered, \nresponse to adversity, and contributions to community-oriented \nprojects. This is truly a deserved honor for Mr. Lynch and Mr. McCurdy. \nTheir hard work and dedication has resulted in MCT being regarded as a \nnationwide leader in both the supply and servicing of truck tires and \nretreaded truck tires. Mssrs. McCurdy and Lynch were honored at a \nluncheon in Maine on May 5, and will also be recognized next week \nduring National Small Business Week here in Washington.\n  It will take small businesses to lead us out of our economic morass. \nThat is why I am thankful for companies such as Maine Commercial Tire, \nwhich have persevered and made great strides over the past 21 years. I \nthank Mr. McCurdy and Mr. Lynch for their leadership and everyone at \nMCT for their dedication to excellence, and offer my best wishes for \nsuccess in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2925-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2925-S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. PHILLIP O. BARRY\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I, with my colleague \nSenator Bingaman, wish to recognize Dr. Phillip O. Barry on the \noccasion of his retirement from a distinguished career serving higher \neducation institutions in our home state of New Mexico and elsewhere.\n  A former Fulbright scholar, Dr. Barry has spent the past 36 years \nworking in community colleges to improve learning opportunities for New \nMexicans, Iowans, and New Jerseyans. Access to quality higher education \nmakes all the difference for our children and our economy. In order to \nsecure the future of the Nation, we must provide the best education \npossible. Innovative administrators like Dr. Barry play a vital role in \nachieving this important goal. As a community college president, Dr. \nBarry devoted 24 years to leading these institutions into the 21st \ncentury and helping them expand to meet the needs of more students and \nan evolving economy.\n  In his 15 years at Mesalands Community College in Tucumcari, NM, Dr. \nBarry transformed Mesalands from a technical school into a community \ncollege, including leading the college through a rigorous accreditation \nprocess. He established the college's foundation in order to ensure the \nfinancial security of the school for the future. Through Dr. Barry's \nleadership and foresight, Mesalands Community College created such \ninnovations as its Dinosaur Museum, the North American Wind Research \nand Training Center, and an intercollegiate rodeo program.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  Dr. Barry's vision for and guidance of Mesalands Community College \nhas been instrumental to the continued development and success of the \ncollege. Senator Bingaman and I thank Dr. Barry for his commitment to \nhigher education in New Mexico and to the community college students of \ntoday and tomorrow. Thanks to Dr. Barry and institutions like those he \nled, a growing number of Americans are able to continue their \neducations, achieve secondary degrees, and help ensure our country's \nfuture competitiveness in an increasingly global economy.\n  We wish Dr. Barry continued success, and for a most happy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2926-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2926-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2926-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:10 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1229.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe program of payments to children's hospitals that operate graduate \nmedical education programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today Senator Isakson and I are introducing \nthe Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2011. Since \nits creation in 1999, this program has provided freestanding children's \nhospitals with funding to support the training of medical residents. \nWhile most hospitals receive support through the Medicare program, \nfreestanding children's hospitals are not eligible for that funding. \nThat is why reauthorizing this program is vital.\n  Prior to the enactment of CHGME, the number of residents in \nchildren's hospitals' residency programs had declined over 13 percent. \nThe enactment of CHGME has enabled children's hospitals to reverse this \ntrend and to increase their training by 35 percent.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have three hospitals who participate in this \nimportant program. This is a critical investment in our country's \nmedical future and guarantees that children will have continuing access \nto the care they need across provider settings. Children are not little \nadults. We must continue to ensure we have the specialized workforce to \ncare for them.\n  Perhaps the benefit of this program is best told in the words of the \nresidents themselves. Gabriela Marein-Efron is a resident at the \nChildren's\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nHospital of Philadelphia. She shared this story with us.\n  ``One of the most powerful experiences I've had during my training \nhas been in my primary care continuity clinic. Many of my patients are \nnow almost 3 years old, and I've been taking care of them since they \nwere newborns. My connection to these families, who are often \nespecially vulnerable because of barriers such as poverty or language \ndifferences has influenced my ultimate career choice. In a few months \nI'll become an Attending Physician at this urban clinic and continue to \ntake care of these underserved families and serve as their medical home \nfull-time.''\n  Chief Resident Dustin Haferbecker had an equally meaningful \nexperience. ``My training at CHOP allowed me the unique opportunity to \ndiscover a need in the community, and ultimately help meet that need. \nDuring residency, I was exposed to extreme lack of adequate health care \nthat was available to the large number of refugees that continue to \npour into the city, brought here by our government. Our CHGME funded \ncurriculum made it possible for myself and a group of residents to \ninvestigate this problem, identify support from within the institution, \nand establish a clinic dedicated to meeting their unique health care \nneeds. A family of three children that have spent their life a refugee \ncamp in Nepal, are now being treated for their vitamin D deficiency and \nnewly discovered latent tuberculosis.''\n  Pamela Puthoor is a resident at the Children's Hospital of \nPittsburgh. ``I had had almost zero exposure to pediatric specialists \nbefore coming to Children's,'' she says. ``I knew that Children's \nHospital offered a rigorous primary care program and the depth and \nbreadth of specialty care, so I would be able to make an educated \nchoice. I have been able to learn from leaders in their fields, and \nfrom that I have decided to go into pediatric gastroenterology.'' Dr. \nPuthoor says that Children's also encouraged her to pursue her interest \nin public health policy. ``Children's attracts passionate, altruistic \npeople devoted to taking care of kids. The support and encouragement we \nreceive is extraordinary,'' she says.\n  These residents and the stories they share are a testament of why we \nmust continue this program.\n  I want to thank Senator Isakson for leading this legislation with me. \nI also want to thank Senators Sherrod Brown, Roy Blunt, John Kerry, \nScott Brown, Richard Blumenthal and Pat Roberts for signing on as \noriginal cosponsors. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nget this legislation passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 960. A bill to provide for a study on issues relating to access to \nintravenous immune globulin (IVG) for Medicare beneficiaries in all \ncare settings and a demonstration project to examine the benefits of \nproviding coverage and payment for items and services necessary to \nadminister IVG in the home; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today along with Senator Alexander I am \nintroducing the Medicare IVIG Access Act to help patients with primary \nimmunodeficiency diseases, PIDD, who currently face a number of health \nchallenges. Today, Medicare beneficiaries with PIDD already have a Part \nB benefit for home-based intravenous immune globulin, IVIG, treatment. \nUnfortunately a gap in coverage exists so no payments are available for \nthe items and services necessary to administer the treatment.\n  Treatment in the home is more cost effective and also protects the \npatient from the risk of exposure to additional illnesses in other \nhealth care settings. This is of particular concern to PIDD patients, \nsince they already have weakened immune systems. A 2007 report from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, Office of Inspector \nGeneral and the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation \nfound that problems with payment exist, namely the absence of coverage \nfor required items and services associated with IVIG home infusion.\n  That is why I have worked with my colleague Senator Alexander to \nintroduce the Medicare IVIG Access Act to create a 3-year demonstration \nproject to provide for and evaluate the benefits of providing a payment \nfor items and services necessary to administer IVIG in the home. The \nbill includes a study to explore issues surrounding IVIG treatment, \nincluding the impact of the demonstration project on access to care, \nand an analysis of the appropriateness of new payment methodology for \nIVIG treatment in all settings.\n  This legislation is supported by a number of organizations including \nthe Immune Deficiency Foundation and the Clinical Immunology Society. I \nask all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 961. A bill to create the income security conditions and family \nsupports needed to ensure permanency for the Nation's unaccompanied \nyouth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Reconnecting \nYouth to Prevent Homelessness Act to improve training, educational \nopportunities, and permanency planning for older foster youth and \nreduce homelessness among our young people.\n  This year approximately 3.5 million people, including 1.5 million \nchildren in the United States will experience homelessness at some \npoint. That is one out of every 50 kids. For children who were in the \nfoster system the chances of becoming homeless are even greater. Every \nyear approximately 30,000 children age out of the foster care system--\nmany with no family and nowhere to go. These children were placed in \nthe foster system at absolutely no fault of their own and too often \nthey leave the system without a place to call home.\n  We have a responsibility to take care of our young people and make \nsure families have the resources they need to be able to keep a roof \nover their heads. I developed this legislation after hearing troubling \nstories from teenagers in Massachusetts. For example, I heard from one \n15-year-old who has been in multiple foster care placements and is \nexpected to eventually age out of the system. He told me ``. . . I feel \nthe age 18 is too young, some of us don't always have somewhere to go . \n. . if this bill gets passed it will greatly help a lot of people in so \nmany different ways . . . I thank you for giving us the opportunity to \nhelp us better ourselves and letting us know that we are heard in this \nworld and someone cares deeply and truly about us.'' That is why I am \nintroducing the Reconnecting Youth to Prevent Homelessness Act. This \nlegislation will help ensure that regardless of where in the country a \nfoster child lives, they will not face the prospect of becoming a \nhomeless teenager by allowing them to remain in care until their 21st \nbirthday and improving permanency planning.\n  It provides support for States to work together to decrease barriers \nthat prohibit cooperation across State lines for placing foster \nchildren in loving homes outside their state of residence. It provides \nsupport for programs that improve family relationships and reduce \nhomelessness among youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or \ntransgender. This legislation ensures that children in foster care \nreceive Social Security benefits they qualify for due to the death of a \nparent or a disability.\n  The bill makes significant improvements to the Temporary Assistance \nto Needy Families, TANF, program such as enhancing efforts to connect \nfamilies with education, training and housing resources. It also \nincreases the time frame for young parents to qualify for TANF benefits \nif they are in an education or training program. Finally, it provides \nmore flexibility for states to work with young families to become \ncompliant with TANF requirements.\n  This legislation is supported by over 40 organizations, including the \nAmerican Bar Association, the National Coalition for the Homeless, \nNational Network for Youth, and Voice for Adoption. I thank my \ncolleagues Senator Murray and Senator Begich for their support and co-\nsponsorship of this bill. It is my hope that we can move forward in a \nbipartisan manner. I ask all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. DeMint,\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n        Mr. Paul, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \n        Risch, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Lee, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mr. Coburn, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. \n        Johanns, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Burr, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Heller, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n        Rubio, and Mr. Corker):\n  S. 964. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to clarify \nthe applicability of such Act with respect to States that have right to \nwork laws in effect; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today \nto introduce, on behalf of 34 Senators, the Job Protection Act.\n  The Job Protection Act is occasioned by a decision by the acting \ngeneral counsel of the National Labor Relations Board that filed a \ncomplaint to stop the Boeing Company from building airplanes at a \nnonunion plant in South Carolina, suggesting that a unionized American \ncompany cannot expand its operations in 1 of 22 States with a right-to-\nwork law.\n  The right-to-work law protects workers' rights to join or not join a \nunion. For example, in Tennessee we are a right-to-work State. In the \ncase of a Saturn employee, where United Auto Workers is the bargaining \nagent, a worker doesn't have to join the union or pay dues, but he has \nto accept the UAW as his bargaining agent.\n  At the Nissan plant a few miles away from the General Motors plant, \nworkers have three times elected not to have a union as their \nbargaining agent. That is what a right-to-work State is. There are 22 \nof them. The State of New Hampshire is in the process of deciding \nwhether to become the 23rd. Their legislature is of one view, and their \nGovernor is of the other view.\n  The Job Protection Act, which I introduce today on behalf of 34 \nSenators, would preserve the Federal law's current protection of State \nright-to-work laws in the National Labor Relations Act and provide \nnecessary clarity to prevent the NLRB from moving forward in their case \nagainst Boeing or attempting a similar strategy against other \ncompanies.\n  Specifically, the Job Protection Act would, first, explicitly clarify \nthat the board cannot order an employer to relocate jobs from one \nlocation to another; two, it guarantees an employer the right to decide \nwhere to do business within the United States; and, three, it protects \nan employer's free speech regarding the costs associated with having a \nunionized workforce without fear of such communication being used as \nevidence in an anti-union discrimination suit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of the 34 Senators who are original cosponsors of the Job \nProtection Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Job Protection Act--Cosponsor List\n\n       Lamar Alexander, Lindsey Graham, Jim DeMint, Rand Paul, \n     John Cornyn, Richard Lugar, Richard Shelby, Johnny Isakson, \n     James Risch, John Boozman, Mike Lee, Jon Kyl, David Vitter, \n     Thad Cochran, Tom Coburn, Chuck Grassley, Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison.\n       John Hoeven, Mike Johanns, Ron Johnson, Mitch McConnell, \n     John Barrasso, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, Jeff Sessions, \n     Orrin Hatch, Mike Enzi, Saxby Chambliss, Jim Inhofe, Dean \n     Heller, John McCain, Roger Wicker, Marco Rubio, Bob Corker.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks two articles by the Wall Street \nJournal, the first written by me on April 29 and the second written by \nthe president of the Boeing Company, Jim McNerney, who is also chairman \nof President Obama's Export Council.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, now to make a few remarks about the \nactions that have caused this.\n  I just left a hearing in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on the middle class. One of the witnesses was the general \ncounsel of the Boeing Company. As might be expected, given the \nnotoriety of this case and the breathtaking scope of it, he got a lot \nof questions.\n  Let me first say why there is such a breathtaking scope here. Up \nuntil the filing of the complaint, one would assume that a \nmanufacturing company, such as Boeing or a smaller company that wanted \nto open a new plant to create new jobs could make its own decision \nabout where to do that. Then in doing so, it could take into account \nsuch factors as the cost of labor. It could take into account such \nfactors as the labor relations within a State, as well as the \ngeographical location of the State and many other factors.\n  The reason the decision by the acting general counsel has attracted \nso much attention is it basically says--or at least it suggests--to any \ncompany manufacturing a product in a State which is not a right-to-work \nState, such as Washington, that you better think twice before you open \na new production line in one of the right-to-work States.\n  Let me talk for a moment about why that has an impact on the middle \nclass in America. Thirty years ago I was Governor of Tennessee. We were \nthe third poorest State. My goal was to raise family incomes and to \ncreate an environment in which they could be raised. I was a young \nGovernor, but I knew enough to know the government did not raise the \nincomes but it might create a good environment for that to happen.\n  I went to my first White House dinner with the President of the \nUnited States. The President was then Jimmy Carter. The President said \nto us Governors at a very nice dinner--just the Governors and their \nspouses and the President and Mrs. Carter: Governors, go to Japan. \nPersuade them to make in the United States what they sell in the United \nStates. I remember I called Dean Rusk, who had been Secretary of State, \nand asked him to visit with me. I talked to him about how to do this.\n  Off I went to Japan, which is not something I planned to do when I \nwas walking across Tennessee trying to be the Governor. I met with the \nNissan officials in Tokyo in the fall of 1979. At that time, Japanese \ncompanies seemed so powerful that there were books coming out saying \nthey might take over the United States economy, but they were not \nmaking here what they sold here. They were making Nissan cars and \ntrucks in Japan. They were making a decision about where to locate in \nour country. I took with me a photograph of the United States at night \ntaken from a satellite. They asked: Where is Tennessee? I said: It is \nright in the middle of the lights. That reduced the shipping and \ntransportation costs. Then the next decision was: Where in the center \ndid they want to go? Every State north of us did not have a right-to-\nwork law. Tennessee and the States around us did. Nissan chose \nTennessee, and they and the General Motors plant that later came and \nthe Volkswagen plant and thousands of suppliers have helped our middle \nclass raise incomes over the last 30 years. A third of our jobs are \nauto manufacturing jobs because we provided an environment in which \nautomakers can compete in the world marketplace.\n  Nissan said today that soon they will be making in the United States \n85 percent of what they sell in the United States, which makes them a \nvery American company. That is what we want. But this decision says we \nthrow a big wet blanket over all the auto suppliers and manufacturers \nwho might be thinking about moving into Tennessee or opening new plants \nin Tennessee or suppliers who might be wishing to follow Boeing to \nSouth Carolina because it says you cannot make that decision.\n  We have never had that kind of law in the United States. We have had \na right-to-work law on the books since 1947. States have a right to \nadopt it or not to adopt it. The legislation I am offering today on \nbehalf of 34 Senators does not change that, but it does preserve the \nright of States to adopt a right-to-work law, the right of employees to \njoin or not to join a union, and the right of employers to make \ndecisions about where to locate their plants and their ability to speak \nin public about what they are doing.\n  This is a most consequential decision. It is one that deserves the \nattention of every Senator because as the Boeing chairman, who is the \nhead of President Obama's Export Council,\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nwrote in the Wall Street Journal this week, a union State would not be \nable to attract a manufacturer because a manufacturer might be afraid \nthat any expansion could never be done in a right-to-work State. By \nsimple mathematics, if Boeing, which is our largest exporter--155,000 \nemployees in the United States, another 15,000 around the world--has a \ndisincentive or if it cannot expand a new production line in a right-\nto-work State and if it might think twice about expanding in any other \nState, then where is it going to go? It is going to go to some other \ncountry.\n  This decision by the acting general counsel of the National Labor \nRelations Board is the single most important action I have seen in \nyears that would rush American jobs overseas in pursuit of an \nenvironment in which they can build and manufacture competitively. It \nis just the reverse of what President Carter said to the Governors 30 \nyears ago when he said: Governors, go to Japan. Persuade them to make \nhere what they sell here.\n  We did that. They came here. They are making 85 percent of what they \nsell here. We want Volkswagen to do that. We want General Motors to do \nthat. We want Ford to do that. We want Boeing to do that. And if we say \nto them, But we are going to tell you, the Federal Government is going \nto tell you where you have to locate your plants, you are going to \noverride section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act which was passed in 1947 \nand which has created an environment which has permitted American \nmanufacturing to succeed.\n  All one has to do is read David Halberstam's book ``The Reckoning'' \nin the late 1980s to see that if our entire auto industry were still \nlocked in Detroit, it would not be as competitive as it is today--cars \nmade in America. I know that firsthand because I saw it happen when \nNissan came to Tennessee. They did not hire a bunch of people from \nJapan to run the plant. They went to Detroit. They got Ford executives \nwho knew how to run a plant but were not allowed to by the environment \nthere, and they put them at a start-from-scratch place and created the \nmost efficient automobile plant in North America.\n  We welcome also the General Motors plant and the United Auto Workers \nto their Spring Hill location in Tennessee. That is what a right-to-\nwork State is where you can choose to join a union or not to join a \nunion. Both can operate. Employees make the decision.\n  But when the Federal Government starts telling any company--a Boeing \nor a Boeing supplier, an auto company or an auto supplier or any \nmanufacturing company--you cannot locate in a right-to-work State, they \nprobably will not locate in a non-right-to-work State. Where are they \nlikely to go? Mexico, Europe, Japan. Boeing sells airplanes all around \nthe world. It can make airplanes all around the world. If we persist in \npolicies such as this, instead of having a situation where our largest \nexporter has 170,000 employees, more than 150,000 of which are in the \nUnited States, we will turn that right upside down and they will be \nmaking 85 percent of their airplanes in the countries where they sell \nthem, and the United States will have a lot fewer jobs.\n  This is a consequential matter that I hope attracts Democratic as \nwell as Republican support. It preserves the right-to-work law. It \npreserves the choices of employees. It preserves the decision of \ncorporations to make their own decisions about where to locate. It \nwould stop a Federal Government regulation which is the single most \neffective action I know about to chase American jobs overseas and lower \nfamily incomes.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 2011]\n\n              The White House vs. Boeing: A Tennessee Tale\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       The National Labor Relations Board has moved to stop Boeing \n     from building airplanes at a nonunion plant in South \n     Carolina, suggesting that a unionized American company cannot \n     expand its operations into one of the 22 states with right-\n     to-work laws, which protect a worker's right to join or not \n     join a union. (New Hampshire's legislature has just approved \n     its becoming the 23rd.)\n       This reminds me of a White House state dinner in February \n     1979, when I was governor of Tennessee. President Jimmy \n     Carter said, ``Governors, go to Japan. Persuade them to make \n     here what they sell here.''\n       ``Make here what they sell here'' was then the union battle \n     cry, part of an effort to slow the tide of Japanese cars and \n     trucks entering the U.S. market.\n       Off I flew to Tokyo to meet with Nissan executives who were \n     deciding where to put their first U.S. manufacturing plant. I \n     carried with me a photograph taken at night from a satellite \n     showing the country at night with all its lights on.\n       ``Where is Tennessee?'' the executives asked. ``Right in \n     the middle of the lights,'' I answered, pointing out that \n     locating a plant in the population center reduces the cost of \n     transporting cars to customers. That center had migrated \n     south from the Midwest, where most U.S. auto plants were, to \n     Kentucky and Tennessee.\n       Then the Japanese examined a second consideration: \n     Tennessee has a right-to-work law and Kentucky does not. This \n     meant that in Kentucky workers would have to join the United \n     Auto Workers union. Workers in Tennessee had a choice.\n       In 1980 Nissan chose Tennessee, a state with almost no auto \n     jobs. Today auto assembly plants and suppliers provide one-\n     third of our state's manufacturing jobs. Tennessee is the \n     home for production of the Leaf, Nissan's all-electric \n     vehicle, and the batteries that power it. Recently Nissan \n     announced that 85% of the cars and trucks it sells in the \n     U.S. will be made in the U.S.--making it one of the largest \n     ``American'' auto companies and nearly fulfilling Mr. \n     Carter's request of 30 years ago.\n       But now unions want to make it illegal for a company that \n     has experienced repeated strikes to move production to a \n     state with a right-to-work law. What would this mean for the \n     future of American auto jobs? Jobs would flee overseas as \n     manufacturers look for a competitive environment in which to \n     make and sell cars around the world.\n       It's happened before. David Halberstam's 1986 book, ``The \n     Reckoning''--about the decline of the domestic American auto \n     industry--tells the story. Halberstam quotes American Motors \n     President George Romney, who criticized the ``shared \n     monopoly'' consisting of the Big Three Detroit auto \n     manufacturers and the UAW. ``There is nothing more vulnerable \n     than entrenched success,'' Romney warned. Detroit ignored \n     upstarts like Nissan who in the 1960s began selling funny \n     little cars to American consumers. We all know what happened \n     to employment in the Big Three companies.\n       Even when Detroit sought greener pastures in a right-to-\n     work state, its ``partnership'' with the United Auto Workers \n     could not compete. In 1985, General Motors located its $5 \n     billion Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., 40 miles from \n     Nissan, hoping side-by-side competition would help the \n     Americans beat the Japanese. After 25 years, nonunion Nissan \n     operated the most efficient auto plant in North America. The \n     Saturn/UAW partnership never made a profit. GM closed Saturn \n     last year.\n       Nissan's success is one reason why Volkswagen recently \n     located in Chattanooga, and why Honda, Toyota, BMW, Kia, \n     Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and thousands of suppliers have chosen \n     southeastern right-to-work states for their plants. Under \n     right-to-work laws, employees may join unions, but mostly \n     they have declined. Three times workers at the Nissan plant \n     in Smyrna, Tenn., rejected organizing themselves like Saturn \n     employees a few miles away.\n       Our goal should be to make it easier and cheaper to create \n     private-sector jobs in this country. Giving workers the right \n     to join or not to join a union helps to create a competitive \n     environment in which more manufacturers like Nissan can make \n     here 85% of what they sell here.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2011]\n\n                  Boeing Is Pro-Growth, Not Anti-Union\n\n                           (By Jim McNerney)\n\n       Deep into the recent recession, Boeing decided to invest \n     more than $1 billion in a new factory in South Carolina. \n     Surging global demand for our innovative, new 787 Dreamliner \n     exceeded what we could build on one production line and we \n     needed to open another.\n       This was good news for Boeing and for the economy. The new \n     jetliner assembly plant would be the first one built in the \n     U.S. in 40 years. It would create new American jobs at a time \n     when most employers are hunkered down. It would expand the \n     domestic footprint of the nation's leading exporter and make \n     it more competitive against emerging plane makers from China, \n     Russia and elsewhere. And it would bring hope to a state \n     burdened by double-digit unemployment--with the construction \n     phase alone estimated to create more than 9,000 total jobs.\n       Eighteen months later, a North Charleston swamp has been \n     transformed into a state-of-the-art, green-energy powered, \n     1.2 million square-foot airplane assembly plant. One thousand \n     new workers are hired and being trained to start building \n     planes in July.\n       It is an American industrial success story by every \n     measure. With 9% unemployment nationwide, we need more of \n     them--and soon.\n       Yet the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) believes it \n     was a mistake and that our actions were unlawful. It claims \n     we improperly transferred existing work, and that our \n     decision reflected ``animus'' and constituted ``retaliation'' \n     against union-represented employees in Washington state. Its \n     remedy: Reverse course, Boeing, and build the assembly line \n     where we tell you to build it.\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\n       The NLRB is wrong and has far overreached its authority. \n     Its action is a fundamental assault on the capitalist \n     principles that have sustained America's competitiveness \n     since it became the world's largest economy nearly 140 years \n     ago. We've made a rational, legal business decision about the \n     allocation of our capital and the placement of new work \n     within the U.S. We're confident the federal courts will \n     reject the claim, but only after a significant and \n     unnecessary expense to taxpayers.\n       More worrisome, though, are the potential implications of \n     such brazen regulatory activism on the U.S. manufacturing \n     base and long-term job creation. The NLRB's overreach could \n     accelerate the overseas flight of good, middle-class American \n     jobs.\n       Contrary to the NLRB's claim, our decision to expand in \n     South Carolina resulted from an objective analysis of the \n     same factors we use in every site selection. We considered \n     locations in several states but narrowed the choice to either \n     North Charleston (where sections of the 787 are built \n     already) or Everett, Wash., which won the initial 787 \n     assembly line in 2003.\n       Our union contracts expressly permit us to locate new work \n     at our discretion. However, we viewed Everett as an \n     attractive option and engaged voluntarily in talks with union \n     officials to see if we could make the business case work. \n     Among the considerations we sought were a long-term ``no-\n     strike clause'' that would ensure production stability for \n     our customers, and a wage and benefit growth trajectory that \n     would help in our cost battle against Airbus and other state-\n     sponsored competitors.\n       Despite months of effort, no agreement was reached. Union \n     leaders couldn't meet expectations on our key issues, and we \n     couldn't accept their demands that we remain neutral in all \n     union-organizing campaigns and essentially guarantee to build \n     every future Boeing airplane in the Puget Sound area. In \n     October 2009, we made the Charleston selection.\n       Important to our case is the basic fact that no existing \n     work is being transferred to South Carolina, and not a single \n     union member in Washington has been adversely affected by \n     this decision. In fact, we've since added more than 2,000 \n     union jobs there, and the hiring continues. The 787 \n     production line in Everett has a planned capacity of seven \n     airplanes per month. The line in Charleston will build three \n     additional airplanes to reach our 10-per-month capacity plan. \n     Production of the new U.S. Air Force aerial refueling tanker \n     will sustain and grow union jobs in Everett, too.\n       Before and after the selection, we spoke openly to \n     employees and investors about our competitive realities and \n     the business considerations of the decision. The NLRB now is \n     selectively quoting and mischaracterizing those comments in \n     an attempt to bolster its case. This is a distressing signal \n     from one arm of the government when others are pushing for \n     greater openness and transparency in corporate decision \n     making.\n       It is no secret that over the years Boeing and union \n     leaders have struggled to find the right way to work \n     together. I don't blame that all on the union, or all on the \n     company. Both sides are working to improve that dynamic, \n     which is also a top concern for customers. Virgin Atlantic \n     founder Richard Branson put it this way following the 2008 \n     machinists' strike that shut down assembly for eight weeks: \n     ``If union leaders and management can't get their act \n     together to avoid strikes, we're not going to come back here \n     again. We're already thinking, `Would we ever risk putting \n     another order with Boeing?' It's that serious.''\n       Despite the ups-and-downs, we hold no animus toward union \n     members, and we have never sought to threaten or punish them \n     for exercising their rights, as the NLRB claims. To the \n     contrary, union members are part of our company's fabric and \n     key to our success. About 40% of our 155,000 U.S. employees \n     are represented by unions--a ratio unchanged since 2003.\n       Nor are we making a mass exodus to right-to-work states \n     that forbid compulsory union membership. We have a sizable \n     presence in 34 states; half are unionized and half are right-\n     to-work. We make decisions on work placement based on \n     business principles--not out of emotion or spite. For \n     example, last year we added new manufacturing facilities in \n     Illinois and Montana. One work force is union-represented, \n     the other is not. Both decisions made business sense.\n       The world the NLRB wants to create with its complaint would \n     effectively prevent all companies from placing new plants in \n     right-to-work states if they have existing plants in \n     unionized states. But as an unintended consequence, forward-\n     thinking CEOs also would be reluctant to place new plants in \n     unionized states--lest they be forever restricted from \n     placing future plants elsewhere across the country.\n       U.S. tax and regulatory policies already make it more \n     attractive for many companies to build new manufacturing \n     capacity overseas. That's something the administration has \n     said it wants to change and is taking steps is to address.

A bill to prevent online threats to economic creativity and \ntheft of intellectual property, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few things are more important to the future \nof the American economy and job creation than protecting our \nintellectual property. At a time where our country is beginning to \nregain its economic footing, businesses face an additional hurdle, the \nseverity of which is increasing by the day--digital theft.\n  Copyright infringement and the sale of counterfeit goods are reported \nto cost American businesses billions of dollars, and result in hundreds \nof thousands of lost jobs. Further, the Institute for Policy Innovation \nestimates that copyright piracy online alone costs Federal, state and \nlocal governments $2.6 billion in tax revenue. In today's business and \nfiscal climate, the harm that intellectual property infringement causes \nto the U.S. economy is unacceptable.\n  While the growth of the digital marketplace has been extraordinary, \nand benefits businesses by enabling new opportunities to reach \nconsumers, it also brings with it the threat of copyright infringement \nand counterfeiting. Internet purchases have become so commonplace that \nconsumers are less wary of online shopping and therefore more easily \nvictimized by online counterfeit products that may have health, safety \nor other quality concerns when they are counterfeit.\n  Today, I am introducing the bipartisan PROTECT IP Act, which is based \non last year's Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act. It \nwill provide the Justice Department\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nand rights holders with important new tools to crack down on rogue \nwebsites dedicated to infringing activities. This legislation will \nprotect the investment American companies make in developing brands and \ncreating content and will protect the jobs associated with those \ninvestments. It will also protect American consumers, who should feel \nconfident that the goods they purchase are of the type and quality they \nexpect.\n  Both law enforcement and rights holders are currently limited in the \nremedies available to combat websites dedicated to offering infringing \ncontent and products. These rogue websites are often foreign-owned and \noperated, or reside at domain names that are not registered through a \nU.S.-based registry or registrar. American consumers are too often \ndeceived into thinking the products they are purchasing at these \nwebsites are legitimate because they are easily accessed through their \nhome's Internet service provider, found through well known search \nengines, and are complete with corporate advertising, credit card \nacceptance, and advertising links that make them appear legitimate.\n  The PROTECT IP Act authorizes the Justice Department to file a civil \naction against the registrant or owner of a domain name that accesses a \nforeign rogue website, or the foreign-registered domain name itself, \nand to seek a preliminary order from the court that the site is \ndedicated to infringing activities. The court is authorized to issue a \ncease and desist order against a rogue website. If the court issues \nthat order, the Attorney General is authorized to serve that order, \nwith permission of the court, on specified U.S. based third-parties, \nincluding Internet service providers, payment processors, online \nadvertising network providers, and search engines. These third parties \nwould then be required to take appropriate action to either prevent \naccess to the Internet site, in the case of an Internet service \nprovider or search engine, or cease doing business with the Internet \nsite, in the case of a payment processor or advertising network.\n  The act authorizes a rights holder who is the victim of the \ninfringement from a rogue website to bring a similar action against the \nrogue site, whether domestic or foreign. If the court issues a cease \nand desist order, the rights holder is authorized to serve that order, \nif authorized by the court, on payment processors and online \nadvertising networks, to cut off the financial viability of the \ncriminal activity.\n  The legislation will also encourage voluntary action by Internet \npartners that have credible evidence a rogue website is threatening the \npublic health by trafficking in counterfeit, adulterated, or misbranded \nprescription medication.\n  Finally, the PROTECT IP Act will help law enforcement identify and \nprevent counterfeit products from being imported into the United States \nby ensuring law enforcement can share samples of packaging or labels of \nsuspected counterfeits with the relevant rights holders to determine \nwhether the shipment should be seized at the border. Similarly, it \nensures that law enforcement can share anti-circumvention devices that \nhave been seized with affected parties.\n  This legislation will provide law enforcement and rights holders with \nan increased ability to protect American intellectual property. This \nwill benefit American consumers, American businesses, and American \njobs. We should not expect that enactment of the legislation will \ncompletely solve the problem of online infringement, but it will make \nit more difficult for foreign entities to profit off American hard work \nand ingenuity. This bill targets the most egregious actors, and is an \nimportant first step to putting a stop to online piracy and sale of \ncounterfeit goods.\n  Protecting intellectual property is not uniquely a Democratic or \nRepublican priority it is a bipartisan priority. I look forward to \nworking with all Senators to pass this important, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to express support for S. 968, the \nPreventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of \nIntellectual Property, PROTECT, Act as introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Leahy. Chairman Leahy and I have worked together on the \nprotection of intellectual property rights on a number of occasions \nover the years and I am pleased to partner with him once again on this \nimportant bill. I also want to recognize the efforts of Senator \nGrassley, the distinguished Ranking Minority Member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. He is a valued friend and his support is greatly \nappreciated as we move forward.\n  With this legislation, we are sending a strong message to those \nselling or distributing counterfeit goods online, namely that the \nUnited States will strongly protect its intellectual property, IP, \nrights. Despite what seems to be a common assumption, just because \nsomething is available on the Internet does not mean it is free. Fake \npharmaceuticals threaten people's lives. Stolen movies, music, and \nother products threaten the jobs and livelihoods of many people. Every \nyear, these online thieves are making hundreds of millions of dollars \nby stealing American IP, and this undermines legitimate commerce. This \nis why protecting property rights is a critical imperative and is why \nwe have come together to introduce the PROTECT IP Act.\n  Utah is considered a very popular State for film and television \nproduction activity. Indeed, many American classics have been filmed in \nmy home State. Nothing compares to the red rock of Southern Utah or the \nsweeping grandeur of the Wasatch Mountains. Not to mention Utah's \nworkforce, which is one of the most highly educated and hardworking in \nour country. It is estimated that the motion picture and television \nindustries are responsible for thousands of jobs and tens of millions \nof dollars in wages in Utah. So, IP theft has a direct, negative impact \non Utah's economy and its workforce, and this same impact can be seen \nnationwide.\n  There is no question that the legislative process can be tedious at \ntimes, and often it takes multiple Congresses to get things right. We \nwitnessed this first hand in the patent reform debate. It took three \nCongresses for the Senate to pass patent reform legislation. I was \npleased to be the lead Republican sponsor of the America Invents Act, \nS. 23, which passed the Senate in March by a vote of 95 to 5. I can \nconfirm that the final Senate-passed bill was a product of countless \nhours of negotiation and legislative fine-tuning. While I hope the bill \nbefore us will not take nearly as long, I can confirm that significant \nand positive changes have already occurred since we introduced the \nbipartisan legislation last year. These changes include a narrower \ndefinition of the type of Internet sites to which the bill applies, \nspecifically those ``dedicated to infringing activities;'' \nauthorization for the Attorney General to serve an issued court order \non a search engine, in addition to payment processors, advertising \nnetworks and Internet service providers; authorization for both the \nAttorney General and rights holders to bring actions against online \ninfringers operating an Internet site or domain where the site is \n``dedicated to infringing activities,'' but with remedies limited to \neliminating the financial viability of the site, not blocking access; \nrequirement of plaintiffs to attempt to bring an action against the \nowner or registrant of the domain name used to access an Internet site \n``dedicated to infringing activities'' before bringing an action \nagainst the domain name itself; protection for domain name registries, \nregistrars, search engines, payment processors, and advertising \nnetworks from damages resulting from their voluntary action against an \nInternet site ``dedicated to infringing activities,'' where that site \nalso ``endangers the public health,'' by offering controlled or non-\ncontrolled prescription medication.\n  It is worth underscoring that the purpose of the PROTECT IP Act is to \ntake down Internet sites dedicated to infringing activities, or in \nother words, the most egregious offenders in the world of online IP \ntheft. Indeed, the bill authorizes the Department of Justice, DOJ, to \nfile a civil action against the registrant or owner of a domain name \nthat accesses a foreign infringing Internet site, or the foreign-\nregistered domain name itself. However, DOJ officials must seek \napproval from a Federal court before taking any action. I trust that a \nFederal judge will weigh all of the facts carefully before issuing an \norder, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to shut \ndown a Web site dedicated to infringing activities.\n  There is no quick fix to this problem. But doing nothing is not an \noption. We must explore ways, albeit in incremental steps, to take down \noffending\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nWeb sites. For this reason, I believe the PROTECT IP Act is a critical \nstep in our ongoing fight against online piracy and counterfeiting. I \nam pleased with the progress that we have made so far on this bill and \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on further refinements as it \nmoves through the legislative process.\n  We must take steps to combat those Web sites that are profiting from \nstolen American intellectual property.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 971. A bill to promote neutrality, simplicity, and fairness in the \ntaxation of digital goods and digital services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Digital Goods \nand Services Tax Fairness Act. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, in introducing this needed \nlegislation.\n  The creation and consumption of downloadable digital goods, like \nbooks, songs, ringtones and video games, and the provision of digital \nservices, like health care monitoring and cloud computing, represent a \nrapidly growing segment of our national economy. These goods and \nservices, which are supporting a growing number of American jobs, are \nsold over communications networks that transcend numerous state and \nlocal boundaries. Tax law, not surprisingly, has failed to keep pace \nwith the rapidly changing technology and economy. The lack of a \nnational framework addressing how State and local taxes can be imposed \nupon these products has led to a confusing process that will only grow \nmore burdensome for consumers and the providers of digital commerce as \nnew, innovative and emerging technologies become available.\n  Since digital goods and services can be downloaded in a mobile \nenvironment, there is a significant question as to which jurisdiction \nhas the authority to tax such purchases. In fact, there is substantial \nrisk that, without a national framework, multiple States and localities \nwill claim they have authority to tax the same digital transaction. For \nexample, if a consumer is on vacation in another State and downloads a \nsong, the State the consumer is visiting, the State that houses the \nserver providing the song, and the consumer's home State could all \nclaim the authority to tax the purchase. This is not only an unfair tax \nburden on the consumer, but also for the seller that is responsible for \nidentifying the jurisdiction on whose behalf it should be collecting \ntaxes. Left unchecked, these multiple taxes could stifle the digital \ncommerce and crush a growing industry that is creating the good jobs \nthat our country needs.\n  We can't let that happen. We need a uniform solution that will \nmodernize our State and local tax system to appropriately address the \ninherent complexities that digital commerce presents.\n  Neutrality should guide tax policy and administration in the area of \ndigital commerce. Transactions involving similar types of goods and \nservices should be taxed fairly, regardless of the method and means of \ndistribution, whether through electronic transfer or through other \nchannels of commerce. To ensure neutrality and avoid multiple taxation, \nrules should be adopted to reflect the unique nature of electronic \ncommerce and how digital goods and digital services are provided.\n  I am introducing the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act to \nestablish a framework for when and how local governments can tax \ndigital goods and services. The framework put forward in the \nlegislation respects States' authority to tax these products while also \nfostering innovation and growth in this segment of global commerce.\n  In most cases, this legislation will use the address of the consumer \nto determine which jurisdiction has the authority to tax a digital \npurchase, as long as the State has passed a law to do so and is \nlawfully able under the Internet Tax Freedom Act and the Supreme \nCourt's Quill decision. Similar to mobile phones, digital purchases \nshould be taxed by the State the consumer resides, not the State that \nthey may have been traveling through while they downloaded the digital \nproduct.\n  This legislation would also preclude discriminatory taxes from being \nimposed on digital goods and services solely because they are \ntransmitted over communication networks. Additionally, this legislation \nwould ensure that if States tax digital goods and services, they should \nonly be taxed at the same rate imposed upon other tangible goods taxed \nunder the general sales tax.\n  The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2011 is structured \nto provide discipline, but also certainty to States and local \ngovernments that wish to tax digital commerce and to the businesses and \nconsumers that are engaged in this marketplace. Our economy is changing \nin a variety of exciting ways. Congress must be responsive to this \nreality and consider this legislation soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Ms. Landrieu, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 973. A bill to create the National Endowment for the Oceans to \npromote the protection and conservation of the United States ocean, \ncoastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss an \nimportant piece of bipartisan legislation that I am introducing today \nwith my friend and fellow New Englander, Senator Snowe, to establish a \nnational endowment for the study, conservation, and restoration of our \nNation's oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.\n  Let me begin with a particular thank-you to our original cosponsors: \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Rockefeller of West \nVirginia; the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye \nof Hawaii; my colleague from the great State of Michigan, Senator \nStabenow; and two colleagues from the Gulf of Mexico region, Senator \nBill Nelson of Florida and Senator Landrieu from Louisiana.\n  As any Rhode Islander can tell you, the ocean is central to our \nState's way of life. I tell colleagues that Rhode Island's coast is one \nof the most beautiful places on Earth. But we don't call Rhode Island \nthe Ocean State just because it is beautiful. We are the Ocean State \nbecause from our earliest days we have relied on the ocean and our \nbeloved Narragansett Bay for trade, for food, for recreation, and for \njobs in the shipbuilding, shipping, fishing, and tourism industries.\n  And we are not alone--across America, our oceans and coasts directly \nprovide over $130 billion to our country's gross domestic product, and \nsupport 2.3 million America jobs. But one impact goes far beyond that.\n  Our coastal zone areas generate nearly 50 percent of our Nation's \ngross domestic product and support more than 28 million jobs.\n  In part, it is Americans' love of and reliance on the oceans that \ndrives the need now to protect and restore them. Coastal America is \nexperiencing a huge population boom, leading to more and more \nconstruction that puts significant pressure on our natural coastline \nand our wetlands.\n  Worldwide demand for seafood grows at a pace that our fish stocks \ncannot keep pace with, and our demand for energy leads us ever deeper \ninto the ocean in search of fuel.\n  There is an old adage, that nothing focuses the mind like a crisis. \nIf this is true, it must be time to focus on taking care of our oceans, \nbecause I believe that our oceans are facing what can be characterized \nas nothing less than a crisis. Our oceans are facing an array of \nthreats, from marine debris aggregating in gyres the size of Texas, to \nwhales so full of bio-accumulative toxins that they constitute swimming \nhazardous waste.\n  These are just a few of the headlines from just the past year:\n  This spring, we have watched in horror as Japan, already suffering \nfrom a terrible earthquake and tsunami--and our hearts go out to them--\nbattled to keep the Fukushima Nuclear Plant intact. Leaks from the \nplant have sent harmful levels of radiation into the ocean.\n  In July of 2010, the Midwest experienced its largest oil spill ever, \nafter a leaking Michigan pipeline poured oil into the Kalamazoo River \nand thence into the Great Lakes.\n  Last June, the journal Science published a literature review by \nresearchers from the University of Queensland\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nand UNC Chapel Hill, revealing mounting evidence that:\n\n       Rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving \n     ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of \n     years, with an associated risk of fundamental and \n     irreversible ecological transformation.\n\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, the Narragansett Bay has witnessed \na 4-degree increase in average annual winter water temperature, causing \nwhat amounts to a full ecosystem shift.\n  And of course, in April 2010, we witnessed the horrific explosion of \nthe Deepwater Horizon, the tragic loss of life, and the unfolding of \nthe largest environmental disaster our country has ever seen. The Gulf \nof Mexico, and the people who depend on this ecosystem for their \nsustenance and livelihoods, are still struggling to recover.\n  We are now 13 months beyond the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Lives \nare still shattered; livelihoods reliant on the gulf ecosystem are \nstill threatened. But we are within the window of action. It is not too \nlate to provide for short-term restoration of the gulf coast to enact \nlegislation that reduces the risk of future oilspills, and as my \ncosponsors and I seek to provide dedicated funding to study, protect, \nand restore the marine and coastal ecosystems within the United States' \nboundaries.\n  The National Endowment for the Oceans is our proposal to meet this \nlast challenge. The Endowment would make grants available to coastal \nand Great Lakes States, local government agencies, regional planning \nbodies, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations so these \nentities could embark on projects to learn more about and do a better \njob of protecting our precious natural resource. Projects that allow \nresearchers to hire technicians, mechanics, computer scientists and \nstudents. Projects that put people to work relocating critical public \ninfrastructure jeopardized by sea level rise. Projects that solve \nresource management problems and restore our natural ecosystems. \nProjects that protect jobs by restoring commercial fisheries habitat, \nand creating new fisheries gear for sustainable and profitable fishing.\n\n  The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration received $167 million \nfor coastal restoration projects under the Recovery Act. More than 800 \nproposals for shovel-ready construction and engineering projects came \nin, totaling $3 billion worth of work. But NOAA could only fund 50 of \nthe 800.\n  The National Endowment for the Oceans would help us move forward with \nthese projects and others that protect our oceans and drive our \neconomy. As I stand here today, more than a year after the beginning of \nthe oilspill in the gulf, and in the face of mounting evidence that our \noceans and coasts are truly facing a crisis, I understand the feelings \nof concern and frustration. But, again, I believe it is not too late.\n  In fact, I believe the time is now to pass legislation that will help \nto restore the gulf ecosystem. The time is now to pass legislation that \nwill reduce the risk of future oilspills. And it is time now to provide \ndedicated funding for the study, restoration, and protection of our \nNation's ocean and coastal resources.\n  We need to put the stewardship of our natural resources, our ocean \nresources, at the forefront of our national agenda. The National \nEndowment for the Oceans, as I said, is bipartisan. I thank Senator \nOlympia Snowe for her leadership in this effort. This legislation is \nscience based, with much of the money made available through a \ncompetitive grant program. This legislation is cost effective, \ncoordinating existing efforts of Federal, local, and private programs, \nreducing duplication of research efforts, and crossing political \nborders to ensure that every dollar is spent with the greatest possible \neffect.\n  Finally, this legislation is appropriately paid for with revenue \ngenerated from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, a portion of \nroyalties from Outer Continental Shelf energy development, and fines \nand damages collected for violations of Federal law off our coastline. \nPut simply, a small portion of the revenue we extract from our oceans \nand great waters will be reinvested to now protect the long-term \nviability of those oceans and great waters.\n  The ocean provides us with great bounty, and we will continue to take \nadvantage of that, as we should. We will fish, we will sail, and we \nwill trade. We will dispose of waste. We will extract fuel and \nconstruct wind farms. Navies and cruise ships, sail boats and \nsupertankers will plow the ocean surface. We cannot change how reliant \nwe are on our ocean. What we can change is what we do in return.\n  We can for the first time give back. We can become stewards of our \noceans, not just takers but caretakers. The oceans contain immense \npotential for new discoveries, immense potential for new jobs, and \nimmense potential for new solutions to the emerging oceans crisis. But \nto meet the demands of this moment, we must respond to the challenges \nbefore us. We must heed the alarm bells that are ringing from the \narctic seas to our tropic oceans, from the top of the food chain to the \nbottom, alarm bells indeed are ringing.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Snowe and myself in support of \nthe National Endowment for the Oceans. Let ours be the generation that \ntips the increasingly troubling balance between mankind and our oceans \na little bit back toward the benefit of our oceans for the long-term \nbenefit of mankind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 974. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe tip tax credit to employers of cosmetologists and to promote tax \ncompliance in the cosmetology sector; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, I am delighted to rise today, on the eve of \nNational Small Business Week, with Senator Landrieu, who is Chair of \nthe Committee, to introduce the Small Business Tax Equalization and \nCompliance Act.\n  Our bipartisan measure is a pro-small business bill and would allow \nthe salon industry to have the same tax rules on tips paid to employees \nas is permitted in the restaurant industry. The legislation would \nincrease compliance with payroll tax obligations and will make sure \nthat the women who work in the salon industry earn all the Social \nSecurity retirement and disability benefits they should be entitled to. \nIt would also help to prevent salons that do not follow the tax law \nfrom gaining a competitive disadvantage against those that do follow \nthe law. Congressman Sam Johnson, R-TX, is leading the charge on a \ncompanion bill in the House.\n  Clearly this legislation will help all parts of the salon industry, \nbig and small, men and women. But the reality is that because 84 \npercent of the workforce in the salon industry is female, this issue \nhas special relevance for women. When women work as independent \ncontractors at hair salons, they are less likely to disclose all of \ntheir tips for purposes of paying Social Security taxes. As a result, \nthey reduce their future right to earn retirement and disability \nbenefits in the Social Security system and reduce the size of any \nbenefit they do ultimately earn. Making sure that working women are \ncorrectly paying into Social Security is critical to their future \nretirement security because many of these women will have had no other \nretirement benefits available to them.\n  We know that women are disproportionately dependent on Social \nSecurity for their retirement benefits, a March 2010 study by the Women \nfor Women's Policy Research showed that women's Social Security \nbenefits in 2008 were only about 75 percent of the benefits earned by \nmen and it comprised about half of their total retirement income. By \ncontrast, Social Security benefits comprised roughly one-third of men's \nretirement income. Earning the right to collect a decent Social \nSecurity benefit is vital to women.\n  As a small business issue, salons are a quintessential small business \non Main Streets across America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 98 \npercent of salon industry firms have only one establishment; 92 percent \nof salon establishments have sales of less than $500,000; and 82 \npercent of salon establishments have fewer than 10 employees. Extending \nthe tip tax credit to salon owners would allow them to reinvest in \ntheir businesses and employees,\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\ncreate new jobs, granting new economic and employment opportunities in \ntheir local communities.\n  I specifically want to explain what this legislation would do. First, \nit would provide to the salon industry with the same type of tax credit \ncurrently available in the restaurant industry. The credit is for \nemployers to offset the matching Social Security and Medicare taxes \nthat the salon pays on the tips that employees receive from customers. \nNext, the bill would help to make more even-handed IRS enforcement of \nlaws on payroll and income taxes. Without this legislation it is often \nthe lopsided practice of the IRS to seek back taxes from the employer \nbut rarely from the employee or independent contractor despite the \nrequirement that taxes be paid in equal measure.\n  The legislation will protect both legitimate independent contractors \nand employees who pay their taxes but frees up IRS resources to focus \non those bad actors who are not complying with the law. Although non-\nemployer salons comprise 87 percent of establishments, their reported \nsales represent only 36 percent of total salon industry revenues, \nimplying a significant underreporting of income in the non-employer \nsegment. This legislation includes education and reporting requirements \nwhich will help address the ``tax gap'' and reveal a valuable new \nsource of tax revenues for the federal government. This is a win-win-\nwin for the salons, for employees, and for the government.\n  This bill is supported by the Professional Beauty Association, the \nlargest association in the professional beauty industry, which is \ncomprised of salon and spa owners, manufacturers and distributors of \nsalon and spa products, and individual licensed cosmetologists.\n  Finally, I want to thank two salon owners who brought this issue to \nmy attention, Alan Labos of Akari Salon in Portland, ME, Tiffany Conway \nof bei capelli salon in Scarborough, ME.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport our bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Tax \n     Equalization and Compliance Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Bush, as well as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power \n     plants, and a nightclub.\n       (3) Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, \n     the United States and allied forces have captured thousands \n     of individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and \n     associated terrorist organizations that do not abide by the \n     law of war, including detainees at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of \n     those attacks, trainers of terrorists, financiers of \n     terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden, \n     recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators of terrorism.\n       (4) Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the \n     United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, \n     prevented terrorist attacks, and saved lives.\n       (5) Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually \n     identifying the location of Osama bin Laden.\n       (6) In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense \n     confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released \n     from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities \n     or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against \n     the United States or our allies.\n       (7) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that \n     includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed \n     responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks \n     against the United States.\n       (8) Detention according to the law of war is a matter of \n     national security and military necessity and has long been \n     recognized as legitimate under international law.\n       (9) Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them \n     from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and \n     allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist \n     attacks against innocent civilians.\n       (10) The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the \n     humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees \n     at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \n     notwithstanding regular assaults on the guard force by some \n     detainees.\n       (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross visits \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a \n     quarterly basis.\n       (12) The detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they \ncan address their own health needs and the health needs of their \nfamilies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last weekend we observed Mother's Day and \ncelebrated our families. When we reflect on our own mothers, many of us \nthink about the woman who nursed us when we were sick, took us to the \ndoctor for checkups, and cared for our grandparents as they aged, while \nat the same time working to put food on the table.\n  These balancing acts are hard enough. But for many moms, and dads, \nacross the country, juggling all these roles means making impossible \nchoices. This is especially true for people who do not have the basic \nright of paid sick days. For these workers, missing work due to an \nillness, injury, or doctor's appointment can mean putting their job and \ntheir family's financial security in jeopardy. So they are forced to \nchoose between the jobs they need and the families they love. In these \ndifficult economic times, no one should have to make that choice.\n  But for a huge segment of the American workforce, these difficult \nchoices are a daily reality. Four in ten U.S. workers have no paid sick \ndays, they cannot miss a day of work with the guarantee of their pay or \nthe assurance that their job will be there when they come back. What is \nmore, 2/3 of low-wage workers, those who can least afford to lose a \npaycheck or a job, have no paid sick days. This means many of these \nworkers report to work sick or send their children to school or day \ncare sick, spreading their illness to others.\n  This robs workers of their basic dignity, and that shouldn't happen \nin a country as wealthy and successful as America. In fact, the U.S. is \nthe only developed country that does not guarantee paid sick days to \nits workers, and our workers are the most productive in the world! \nAmerica's workers deserve to earn a decent living; a living where they \ncan provide for their families without being punished when they or \ntheir children catch the flu. America's workers deserve paid sick days.\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n  Lack of access to paid sick days isn't just a crisis for individual \nfamilies--it's a public health crisis as well. Health officials urge \npeople with contagious illnesses to stay home from work to avoid \nspreading disease. But the workers in industries with the most contact \nwith the public, such as food service and hospitality, are the least \nlikely to have paid sick days. A recent survey shows that nearly two-\nthirds of restaurant workers, 3/4 of whom don't have paid sick days, \nreport cooking or serving food while sick. This puts the health of all \nof us in jeopardy. And not having paid sick days puts these workers in \nthe terrible position of choosing between the health of their customers \nand their family's health and economic security.\n  But this doesn't have to be the case. We can give working people the \ntools they need to protect their health and their families' health \nwhile also safeguarding the public health. Workers want to do the right \nthing and stay home when they are ill or stay home with their sick \nchildren rather than sending them to school. But our current laws \nsimply do not protect them.\n  This is why Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and I are introducing the \nHealthy Families Act, which will allow U.S. workers to earn up to 7 \npaid sick days per year to recover from short-term illness, care for a \nsick family member, seek routine medical care, or seek help if they are \nvictims of domestic violence. This important legislation will provide \nmuch-needed security for hardworking families struggling to balance the \nobligations of work and family. It will improve public health and \ndecrease health costs by preventing the spread of disease and giving \nemployees the access they need to obtain preventive care and treatment. \nIt will also help victims of domestic violence to protect their \nfamilies and their futures.\n  Providing paid sick days to workers will be good for working people \nand their families, and good for our businesses and our economy as \nwell. Allowing workers to tend to their health or their families' \nengenders good will and loyalty, and boosts morale at the workplace. \nBusinesses will save because the greatest cause of lost productivity \ndue to illness is not absenteeism but ``presenteeism,'' the practice of \nsick workers coming to work, infecting their colleagues, and being less \nproductive themselves. Businesses whose workers have paid sick days \nwill also benefit from reduced turnover, and its high associated costs, \nwhen workers can hold on to their jobs. Experience bears this out, in \nSan Francisco, where workers have had guaranteed paid sick days since \n2007, surveys show that 6 out of 7 employers found no negative effect \non profit. Indeed, 4 years after implementation, two-thirds of surveyed \nemployers were supportive of the city's paid sick days law.\n  The overall economy will benefit from reduced health costs as well. \nEnsuring that workers are able to seek preventive care as well as care \nin a doctor's office, rather than the ER, will minimize health care \ncosts. Reducing the spread of contagious illnesses by allowing workers \nor children to stay at home where they won't infect their coworkers or \nclassmates will also reduce health costs by keeping more people healthy \nin the first place.\n  Most of all, workers will have peace of mind and financial security. \nThey won't be faced with a potentially long search for new work, while \ncollecting unemployment benefits. They won't face reduced income and \nhaving to cut back on their spending on food, medicine, and other \nnecessities bought in their local communities. Working people will have \nthe security of knowing that if illness strikes, they will be able to \ntend to their families without losing their jobs or their paychecks.\n  The Healthy Families Act has had the strongest of Senate champions \nwho have led the fight for workers' rights, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nDodd. I am proud to be the new leader for this vital piece of \nlegislation. I thank my colleagues who are joining me today as original \ncosponsors, and I encourage all Senators to join us in supporting the \nHealthy Families Act. This bill will provide health, peace of mind, and \nsecurity for America's workers and their families. At a time when the \nAmerican Dream and the middle class seem to be slipping away, these \ngoals could never be more important.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Families Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Working Americans need time to meet their own health \n     care needs and to care for family members, including their \n     children, spouse, parents, and parents-in-law, and other \n     children and adults for whom they are caregivers.\n       (2) Health care needs include preventive health care, \n     diagnostic procedures, medical treatment, and recovery in \n     response to short- and long-term illnesses and injuries.\n       (3) Providing employees time off to meet health care needs \n     ensures that they will be healthier in the long run. \n     Preventive care helps avoid illnesses and injuries and \n     routine medical care helps detect illnesses early and shorten \n     their duration.\n       (4) When parents are available to care for their children \n     who become sick, children recover faster, more serious \n     illnesses are prevented, and children's overall mental and \n     physical health improve. In a 2009 study published in the \n     American Journal of Public Health, 81 percent of parents of a \n     child with special health care needs reported that taking \n     leave from work to be with their child had a ``good'' or \n     ``very good'' effect on their child's physical health. \n     Similarly, 85 percent of parents of such a child found that \n     taking such leave had a ``good'' or ``very good'' effect on \n     their child's emotional health.\n       (5) When parents cannot afford to miss work and must send \n     children with contagious illnesses to child care centers or \n     schools, infection can spread rapidly through child care \n     centers and schools.\n       (6) Providing paid sick time improves public health by \n     reducing infectious disease. Policies that make it easier for \n     sick adults and children to be isolated at home reduce the \n     spread of infectious disease.\n       (7) Routine medical care reduces medical costs by detecting \n     and treating illness and injury early, decreasing the need \n     for emergency care. These savings benefit public and private \n     payers of health insurance, including private businesses.\n       (8) The provision of individual and family sick time by \n     large and small businesses, both here in the United States \n     and elsewhere, demonstrates that policy solutions are both \n     feasible and affordable in a competitive economy. A 2009 \n     study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found \n     that, of 22 countries with comparable economies, the United \n     States was 1 of only 3 countries that did not provide any \n     paid time off for workers with short-term illnesses.\n       (9) Measures that ensure that employees are in good health \n     and do not need to worry about unmet family health problems \n     help businesses by promoting productivity and reducing \n     employee turnover.\n       (10) The American Productivity Audit completed in 2003 \n     found that lost productivity due to illness costs \n     $226,000,000,000 annually, and that 71 percent of that cost \n     stems from presenteeism, the practice of employees coming to \n     work despite illness. Studies in the Journal of Occupational \n     and Environmental Medicine, the Employee Benefit News, and \n     the Harvard Business Review show that presenteeism is a \n     larger productivity drain than either absenteeism or short-\n     term disability.\n       (11) The absence of paid sick time has forced Americans to \n     make untenable choices between needed income and jobs on the \n     one hand and caring for their own and their family's health \n     on the other.\n       (12) Nearly 40 percent of the private-sector workforce \n     (about 40,000,000 workers) lack paid sick time. Another \n     4,000,000 theoretically have access to sick time, but have \n     not been on the job long enough to use it. Millions more lack \n     sick time they can use to care for a sick child or ill family \n     member.\n       (13) Workers' access to paid sick time varies dramatically \n     by wage level. For private-sector workers in the lowest \n     quartile of earners, 68 percent lack paid sick time. For \n     workers in the next 2 quartiles, 34 and 25 percent, \n     respectively, lack paid sick time. Even for workers in the \n     highest income quartile, 16 percent lack paid sick time. In \n     addition, millions of workers cannot use paid sick time to \n     care for ill family members.\n       (14) Due to the roles of men and women in society, the \n     primary responsibility for family caregiving often falls on \n     women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of \n     women more than it affects the working lives of men.\n       (15) An increasing number of men are also taking on \n     caregiving obligations, and men who request paid time for \n     caregiving purposes are often denied accommodation or \n     penalized because of stereotypes that caregiving is only \n     ``women's work''.\n       (16) Employers' reliance on persistent stereotypes about \n     the ``proper'' roles of both men and women in the workplace \n     and in the home continues a cycle of discrimination and \n     fosters stereotypical views about women's commitment to work \n     and their value as employees.\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\n       (17) Employment standards that apply to only one gender \n     have serious potential for encouraging employers to \n     discriminate against employees and applicants for employment \n     who are of that gender.\n       (18) It is in the national interest to ensure that all \n     Americans can care for their own health and the health of \n     their families while prospering at work.\n       (19) Nearly 1 in 3 American women report physical or sexual \n     abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives. \n     Domestic violence also affects men. Women account for about \n     85 percent of the victims of domestic violence and men \n     account for approximately 15 percent of the victims. \n     Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for \n     their health or to find solutions, such as obtaining a \n     restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent \n     physical or sexual abuse.\n       (20) One study showed that 85 percent of domestic violence \n     victims at a women's shelter who were employed missed work \n     because of abuse. The mean number of days of paid work lost \n     by a rape victim is 8.1 days, by a victim of physical assault \n     is 7.2 days, and by a victim of stalking is 10.1 days. \n     Nationwide, domestic violence victims lose almost 8,000,000 \n     days of paid work per year.\n       (21) Without paid sick days that can be used to address the \n     effects of domestic violence, these victims are in grave \n     danger of losing their jobs. One survey found that 96 percent \n     of employed domestic violence victims experienced problems at \n     work related to the violence. The Government Accountability \n     Office similarly found that 24 to 52 percent of victims \n     report losing a job due, at least in part, to domestic \n     violence. The loss of employment can be particularly \n     devastating for victims of domestic violence, who often need \n     economic security to ensure safety.\n       (22) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     estimated that domestic violence costs over $700,000,000 \n     annually due to the victims' lost productivity in employment.\n       (23) Efforts to assist abused employees result in positive \n     outcomes for employers as well as employees because employers \n     can retain workers who might otherwise be compelled to leave.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that all working Americans can address their \n     own health needs and the health needs of their families by \n     requiring employers to permit employees to earn up to 56 \n     hours of paid sick time including paid time for family care;\n       (2) to diminish public and private health care costs by \n     enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for \n     themselves and their family members;\n       (3) to assist employees who are, or whose family members \n     are, victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking, by providing the employees with paid time away from \n     work to allow the victims to receive treatment and to take \n     the necessary steps to ensure their protection;\n       (4) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (3) in a manner that is feasible for employers; and\n       (5) consistent with the provision of the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution relating to equal protection of the laws, \n     and pursuant to Congress' power to enforce that provision \n     under section 5 of that amendment--\n       (A) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (3) in a manner that minimizes the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring \n     generally that paid sick time is available for eligible \n     medical reasons on a gender-neutral basis; and\n       (B) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for \n     women and men.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ndirect care registered nurse-to-patient staffing ratio requirements in \nhospitals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we mark the end of National Nurses \nWeek, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the nurses who \nserve on the front lines of our health care system. Nurses are heroes, \nnot just to their patients, but to the families and loved ones who rely \non their compassion and care.\n  While we celebrate nurses this week, we must also acknowledge that \ntoo many nurses are overworked because of staffing levels that are \nsimply inadequate.\n  For decades nurses have been telling us that we need more of them to \nprovide quality care to our loved ones, especially in hospitals. Study \nafter study has been done, we know there is a nationwide nursing \nshortage.\n  By 2020, it is estimated that the demand for full time nurses will \nexceed supply by 1 million nurses.\n  That is why I am introducing the National Nursing Shortage Reform and \nPatient Advocacy Act, which will not only help address the nationwide \nshortage of skilled nurses, it will improve the quality of health care \nfor all Americans.\n  The National Nursing Shortage Reform and Patient Advocacy Act \nchampions nursing rights, nursing ratios, and nursing reform.\n  This bill protects the rights of nurses to speak out for their \npatients and to speak out for themselves, without the fear of \ndiscrimination or retaliation, because if there is a problem in a \nhospital nurses should be able to talk about it.\n  This bill sets minimum nurse to patient ratios, because if we expect \nnurses to give patients high quality care we need to give nurses the \ntime to provide it. It lays out a transparent process for establishing \nstaffing plans in hospitals and puts forward the tools for nurses to \nreport inadequate staffing or care.\n  This bill reforms the role of hospitals not just in working with \nnurses to improve care, but also in training nurses. It creates \nmentorship and preceptorship programs to support nurses as they adapt \nto the hospital setting and grow in their profession.\n  Twelve years ago, nurses in California fought and won a major battle \nfor their patients and for themselves, and the results were minimum \nnurse to patient ratios in California hospitals.\n  I am proud to join with nurses in their effort to improve care for \ntheir patients, and introduce Federal legislation that would extend \nthese rights, ratios and reforms to nurses in hospitals across the \ncountry.\n  Reports on California ratios have only begun to show what so many of \nthe nurses I meet already know, that setting a minimum standard for \nsafe staffing can mean the difference between life and death of \npatients.\n  A 2002 study found that for every patient added to a nurse's workload \nthere is a 7 percent increase in the chance of death following common \nsurgeries.\n  In California, the hospitals that have seen the greatest effect in \nreduced mortality were the ones that started with the worst staffing \nratios.\n  We also know that hospitals are losing good nurses because of these \nstaffing shortages. A poll of nurses nationwide found that almost half \nof the nurses who plan to quit their job say that inadequate staffing \nis the reason they are leaving. The cost of replacing these valuable \nworkers has been estimated at $25,000 to $60,000 per nurse. That is an \nadded cost that we know our health care system cannot afford.\n  Too many nurses get burned out by being overloaded with too many \npatients. Too many nurses have given up on serving in hospitals because \nthe hospitals have given up on providing a better environment for both \nnurses and patients.\n  Investing more in nursing staff will help hospitals avoid costly \nmedical mistakes and provide better care for their patients and most \nimportantly, will save lives.\n  I joined many of my colleagues in supporting provisions of health \ncare reform that invested in our health care workforce. At 2.9 million \nstrong, nurses are the largest health care workforce in our country, \nand this investment is long overdue.\n  I am pleased to share that this bill has the support of the \nCalifornia Nurses Association as well as AFSCME-United Nurses of \nAmerica.\n  Nurses are not just the face of the movement to improve health care \nin our country, they are the face of health care in our country. This \nbill is for them and the patients they so faithfully serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 994. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to protect \nStates that have in effect laws or orders with respect to pay-to-play \nreform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nMenendez, Lautenberg and Durbin in introducing the State Ethics Law \nProtection Act. This legislation would ensure that States are allowed \nto pass meaningful ethics reform laws without being penalized by the \nFederal government.\n  Current law allows the Federal Highway Administration, FHWA, to \nwithhold Federal highway funds from States that ban pay-to-play \ncontracting. At least 9 States and 60 cities have enacted anti pay-to-\nplay laws. These laws vary widely, but they generally limit political \ncontributions from entities doing business with the state. The FHWA \nclaims that these laws could reduce the number of potential bidders, \nthus violating an unrestricted bidding requirement set forth in Federal \nlaw. FHWA has selectively threatened to withhold money to certain \nStates. In my home State of Illinois, the State legislature was forced \nto change its pay-to-play law just days after our former governor was \nindicted for allegedly engaging in numerous pay-to-play schemes. \nIllinois was forced to create a giant loophole in the ethics law so as \nnot to lose out on millions in Federal transportation funds.\n  States have the right to ensure their contracting processes adhere to \nthe highest ethical standards and offer the best protection to the \ntaxpayers. Selected Federal intervention is an unwarranted and \nunhelpful power grab by Federal regulators. Pay-to-play laws are \ndesigned to enhance, not undermine, competitive bidding. They are \ndesigned to ensure that the competitive bidding process is open and \nfair, not motivated by political considerations.\n  Our legislation would allow States to pass ethics laws that are in \ntheir best interests, without fear of Federal retaliation, by amending \nFHWA's contracting requirements to explicitly provide that no State or \nlocality shall be considered in violation of the competitive bidding \nrequirements based on political contributions. The legislation does not \nprescribe any new requirements for states, nor does it advocate for the \npassage of any single ethics law. The bill simply allows States to \nenact meaningful anti-corruption laws if they choose to do so. As \nFederal budgets tighten in these challenging economic times, it is \nimperative that we not hamstring States even further by denying them \nFederal funds for trying to limit public corruption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Ethics Law Protection \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PAY-TO-PLAY REFORM.\n\n       Section 112 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\n       ``(h) Pay-To-Play Reform.--A State transportation \n     department shall not be considered to have violated a \n     requirement of this section solely because the State in which \n     that State transportation department is located, or a local \n     government within that State, has in effect a law or an order \n     that limits the amount of money an individual or entity that \n     is doing business with a State or local agency with respect \n     to a Federal-aid highway project may contribute to a \n     political party, campaign, candidate, or elected official.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK:\n  S. 995. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \npublic officials from engaging in undisclosed self-dealing; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Public \nOfficials Accountability Act, to ensure that our elected leaders cannot \nuse their office for their own personal benefit. Public corruption has \nturned the ``Land of Honest Abe'' into the ``Land of Political \nCorruption.'' Illinois is the 6th most corrupt state in the Union, \nbased on the number of public corruption convictions over the last \ndecade. If just the northern district of Illinois were a state, it \nwould have had the 7th highest number of public corruption convictions \nin the country in 2009. Illinois taxpayers pay the price for this in \nthe form of a hidden public corruption tax. We need to make sure our \nlaws help Federal prosecutors crack down on public corruption and \nrestore integrity to Illinois. One such tool is the honest services \nlaw.\n  For the past 30 years, the Department of Justice has fought public \ncorruption by convicting scores of public officials who deny citizens \nthe right to ``honest services.'' We are all too familiar with \npoliticians failing to perform their public duties honestly in \nIllinois.\n  The most famous Illinois politicians to be convicted of honest \nservices fraud include former Governor Otto Kerner, late Congressman \nDan Rostenkowski, former city of Chicago official Robert Sorich, and \nformer Governor George Ryan. William Jefferson and Congressman Bob Ney \nare a few notable national figures to be convicted of this crime.\n  Back in Illinois, our former governor Rod Blagojevich is currently on \ntrial after having turned Illinois into a corrupt political circus and \na national joke. A number of charges in his original indictment were \nbased on honest services fraud, including those related to his alleged \nscheme to sell President Obama's U.S. Senate seat for his own personal \ngain.\n  Unfortunately, last year the Supreme court drastically narrowed the \nscope of the honest services law in the famous 2010 Enron decision, \nSkilling v. U.S. The Court struck down a significant portion of the law \nbecause it was unconstitutionally vague. As a result of the Supreme \nCourt review, U.S. prosecutors reindicted Blagojevich, leaving out all \nhonest services charges so as not to complicate the case. Blagojevich \nlater was convicted on just one charge.\n  The Blagojevich case was not the only one affected by the decision. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, ``In 2008 and 2009, the \ngovernment brought honest services fraud charges in more than 100 cases \na year,'' but in 2010 ``new prosecutions using the statute slowed to a \ntrickle'' due to the Supreme Court review of the issue.\n  In order to continue fighting public corruption effectively, the \nDepartment of Justice asked Congress to enact a clear and specific \nhonest services law to withstand any constitutional review. Our bill, \nthe Public Officials Accountability Act, would do just that. It would \nvery clearly reinstate the portion of the law the Supreme Court struck \ndown in terms that remove all ambiguity. The Public Officials \nAccountability Act would restore one of prosecutors' most important \ntools and decades of congressional intent to ensure elected leaders \ncannot use their office to further their own careers or pocketbooks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Officials \n     Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to require the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, in the case of airline pilots who are required by \nregulation to retire at age 60, to compute the actuarial value of \nmonthly benefits in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 60; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Act to ensure fair \ntreatment of commercial airline pilot retirees. Joining me in this \neffort are Senators Harkin and Durbin, as well as Representative George \nMiller, who is introducing the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives today.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, is the Federal agency \nthat assumes responsibility for pension plans that are terminated \nbecause they do not have enough money to pay all benefits. PBGC's \ninsurance program pays monthly benefits to the retirees that the \npension plan provided, up to the limits set by law. PBGC requires \nindividuals to retire at age 65 to receive the maximum retirement \nbenefit. For years, this law was in conflict with the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, requirement that pilots retire by age 60. For \ncommercial airline pilots caught between these conflicting policies, \ntheir retirement benefits were significantly reduced.\n  Congress partially addressed this issue with the passage of the Fair \nTreatment of Experienced Pilots Act, which was signed into law on \nDecember\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n13, 2007. The Act increased the FAA mandatory retirement age for pilots \nto age 65. However, the change did nothing to help those pilots who had \nalready retired. As such, pilots who retired while the FAA age 60 rule \nwas in effect are still denied the maximum pension benefit administered \nby the PBGC and are unable to rejoin the workforce as pilots.\n  The conflicting FAA and PBGC requirements have had a substantial \nadverse effect on thousands of retired pilots. In general, these pilots \nhave had their maximum retirement benefit reduced by one-third. For \nexample, the maximum benefit from the PBGC for someone that retired at \nage 65 in 2006 is $47,659 a year. For those who retired at age 60 of \nthat same year, the maximum is $30,978. Our legislation ends this \nunfair penalty. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Pilots \nEquitable Treatment Act would direct the PBGC to calculate pension \nbenefits based on retirement eligibility beginning at age 60 instead of \nage 65 for retired pilots whose pensions are affected by the \ndiscrepancy between the FAA and PBGC retirement requirements. We must \npass this bill to provide some relief for pilots from Aloha Airlines, \nDelta, TWA, United Airlines, and US Airways, as well as other pilots \nwho have had their pensions terminated and taken over by the PBGC and \nsuffer from this wrongly imposed penalty.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we can finally \ncorrect this wrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AGE REQUIREMENT FOR AIRLINE PILOTS.\n\n       (a) Single-Employer Plan Benefits Guaranteed.--Section \n     4022(b)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1322(b)(3)) is amended by inserting at the \n     end the following: ``If, at the time of termination of a plan \n     under this title, or at the time of freezing benefit accruals \n     under a plan pursuant to subsections (a)(1) and (b) of \n     section 402 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, \n     regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     required an individual to separate from service as a \n     commercial airline pilot after attaining any age before age \n     65, this paragraph shall be applied to an individual who is a \n     participant in the plan by reason of such service by \n     substituting such age for age 65.

Res. 12. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to give States the right to repeal \nFederal laws and regulations when ratified by the legislatures of two-\nthirds of the several States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the growing burdens \nplaced on states by our Federal Government in recent years and how we \ncan stop this trend.\n  Our States have faced many Federal mandates in recent years that have \nhurt, not helped, the citizenry of our country. In 2009 alone, the \nFederal Government issued over 3,300 new rules and regulations. This \nputs the total number of Federal rules and regulations placed on our \nStates and citizens at around 75,000 as of 2010. In addition, \nincredible price tags have been placed on our citizens due to these \nlaws and regulations. Our country is facing trillions of dollars in \ndebt and forcing further expenses onto our taxpayers is inexcusable.\n  This Federal top-down approach does not encourage a strong economy. \nStates and local governments should have the ability to address the \nneeds of their citizens in ways that actually fix the problem without \ntheir hands being tied by burdensome Federal rules, regulations, and \nlaws. I have always believed that the ingenuity of individuals should \nnot be hampered and top-down approaches do just that. As of now, states \nhave one recourse, go through the court system which is already \nbacklogged.\n  No matter who has the political power within our Federal Government, \nStates need to have the ability to force the Federal Government to \nreconsider laws and regulations that do not support them. Providing \nstates with the option of repealing any Federal law or regulation is \nthe next step. Allowing a repeal option would also institute a check \nagainst egregious congressional actions and especially un-elected \nbureaucratic action.\n  Today, I am introducing the Repeal Amendment to address this issue. \nMy colleague Representative Rob Bishop of Utah is introducing this \nimportant piece of legislation in the House of Representatives so that \nwe can give the states a real voice. Allowing States the option to say \nno will allow them the breathing room to decide what policies are best \nfor them.\n  The Repeal Amendment would allow States to remove unnecessary and \nburdensome Federal laws and regulations. When 2/3 of the States \ncollectively find a Federal law or regulation so out of touch and \ndestructive, they will have the power to repeal it if they so choose.\n  States must be given back their role as an equal partner in \naddressing the needs and issues of the people of the United States. The \ngrowing Federal Government must be put in check and I believe that the \nRepeal Amendment will do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2956-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2956-S2957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 181--DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2011, AS ``NATIONAL MPS \n                            AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Burr, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted the following \nresolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

    businesses;\n       Whereas a number of tornadoes touched down in the Virginia \n     counties of Gloucester, Goochland, Halifax, Middlesex, \n     Pulaski, Shenandoah, and Washington;\n       Whereas in April 2011, devastating storms and at least 30 \n     tornadoes resulted in 24 fatalities in the State of North \n     Carolina;\n       Whereas the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham tornado of April 27, \n     2011, which caused at least 65 fatalities and more than 1,000 \n     injuries, had a maximum width of 1.5 miles and a track length \n     of 80 miles;\n       Whereas Smithville, Mississippi, a town of fewer than 900, \n     lost 15 of its citizens, as well as its post office, school, \n     city hall, most of its churches, and almost every home;\n       Whereas an Enhanced Fujita category 5 (referred to in this \n     preamble as an ``EF5'') tornado is defined by the National \n     Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration as the rarest and most severe type of tornado, \n     with sustained winds of greater than 200 miles per hour and \n     that results in total destruction of well-built, \n     structurally-sound buildings;\n       Whereas 3 of the 5 EF5 rated tornadoes recorded in the \n     United states since 2000 occurred as part of the April 25 \n     through 28, 2011 tornado outbreak in the States of \n     Mississippi and Alabama;\n       Whereas the Washington County, Virginia tornado traveled \n     approximately 14 miles and had a maximum path width of 2 \n     miles;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service estimates that 40 \n     tornadoes hit the State of Tennessee from April 27 through \n     28, 2011;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service has confirmed that a \n     total of 15 tornadoes hit the State of Georgia throughout the \n     period of April 25 through 28, 2011, including a powerful EF4 \n     tornado which devastated the city of Ringgold, Georgia;\n       Whereas dozens of rural communities throughout the South, \n     including in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, have been decimated \n     by the devastating storms and tornadoes of April 2011;\n       Whereas more than 500 homes were damaged or destroyed in \n     the State of Tennessee as a result of the devastating storms \n     and tornadoes;\n       Whereas the massive storms impacted cities and towns in the \n     State of Alabama, including Arab, Berry, Birmingham, Concord, \n     Eclectic, Forkland, Fultondale, Hackleburg, Phil Campbell, \n     Pleasant Grove, Rainsville, and Tuscaloosa;\n       Whereas President Obama declared 10 counties in the State \n     of Tennessee to be in a state of major disaster and approved \n     the request made by Governor Haslam for Federal disaster \n     assistance;\n       Whereas the tornado that swept from Monroe County, \n     Mississippi into Marion County, Alabama and destroyed \n     Smithville, Mississippi was--\n       (1) the sixth deadliest tornado ever recorded in the State \n     of Mississippi;\n       (2) the first EF5 tornado recorded in the State of \n     Mississippi since 1966; and\n       (3) the first EF5 tornado recorded in the United States \n     since May 2008.\n\n       Whereas the massive storms and tornadoes caused widespread \n     damage

Craven, Cumberland, Currituck, Greene, Halifax, Harnett, \n     Hertford, Hoke, Johnston, Lee Onslow, Pitt, Robeson, Sampson, \n     Tyrell, Wake, and Wilson;\n       Whereas the tornado that swept from Neshoba County, \n     Mississippi to Noxubee County, Mississippi was just the \n     second EF5 tornado recorded in the State of Mississippi since \n     1966;\n       Whereas April 27, 2011, marks the third highest number of \n     tornado-related fatalities occurring in a single day since \n     March 18, 1925, when a series of tornadoes caused 747 \n     fatalities across 7 States;\n       Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, the \n     total number of fatalities resulting from the devastating \n     storms and tornadoes remains unknown;\n       Whereas the suffering and distress of thousands of people \n     affected by the storms and tornadoes is ongoing, particularly \n     for those who lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods;\n       Whereas immediate humanitarian aid is critically needed in \n     many of the devastated regions;\n       Whereas the local emergency responders, National Guard, and \n     many ordinary citizens of the affected regions have risked \n     their lives to save others;\n       Whereas throughout the crisis, doctors, nurses, and medical \n     personnel in the affected regions worked expeditiously to \n     ensure that hospitals, medical centers, and triage units \n     provided needed care;\n       Whereas many faith-based organizations and other volunteer \n     organizations and charities are supplying the victims of the \n     storms and tornadoes with food, water, and shelter;\n       Whereas the Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Virginia, and North Carolina Emergency Management Agencies, \n     the first responders in the affected communities, and \n     countless volunteers immediately came to the aid of those \n     affected by the storms;\n       Whereas the Governor of Alabama, Robert Bentley, the \n     Governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, the Governor of \n     Mississippi, Haley Barbour, the Governor of Georgia, Nathan \n     Deal, the Governor of Virginia, Robert McDonnell, and the \n     Governor of North Carolina, Beverly Perdue, reacted swiftly \n     and with great leadership in the immediate aftermath of the \n     destructive storms and tornadoes;\n       Whereas President Obama responded quickly and efficiently \n     to approve the requests made by Governors Bentley, Haslam, \n     Barbour, Deal, and Perdue for Federal disaster assistance;\n       Whereas in response to the declaration by the President of \n     a major disaster, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has made federal disaster assistance \n     available for the State of Alabama and elsewhere in the South \n     to assist in local recovery efforts; and\n       Whereas thousands of volunteers and government employees \n     from across the United States have committed time and \n     resources to help with recovery efforts: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the

commends the resiliency and courage of the people of \n     the affected States, including the people of the States of \n     Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and North \n     Carolina;\n       (3) extends the wishes of the Senate for a full recovery \n     for all those who were injured in the storms and tornadoes;\n       (4) extends the thanks of the Senate to the forecasters, \n     first responders, firefighters, law\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n     enforcement personnel, volunteers, and medical personnel who \n     took quick action to provide warnings, aid, and comfort to \n     the victims of the storms and tornadoes;\n       (5) commits to provide the necessary resources and to stand \n     by the people of the affected States, including the people of \n     the States of Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Virginia, and North Carolina, in the relief, recovery, and \n     rebuilding efforts; and\n       (6) stands with the people affected by the storms and \n     tornadoes, including the people of the States of Alabama, \n     Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and North \n     Carolina, as those people begin the healing

Res. 184\n\n       Whereas Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South \n     Dakota on May 27, 1911;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, from his early years, recognized \n     the importance of public service by becoming a registered \n     pharmacist and serving his friends and neighbors in the \n     Humphrey Drug Store in Huron, South Dakota from 1933 to 1937;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey received a Bachelor of Arts degree \n     in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1939 \n     and a Masters of Arts degree from Louisiana State University \n     in 1940, subsequently teaching political science at \n     Macalester College from 1943 to 1944 and at Macalester \n     College and the University of Minnesota from 1969 to 1970;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey served in a variety of leadership \n     positions in Minnesota during World War II, dealing with war \n     production, employment, and manpower;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey served as Mayor of Minneapolis from \n     1945 to 1948, and during his tenure as mayor, he drove \n     organized crime from the city and, among other achievements, \n     created the Nation's first municipal equal employment \n     opportunity commission;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey was a driving force behind the \n     creation of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota \n     and was a founding member of Americans for Democratic Action \n     in the aftermath of World War II;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey led forces at the 1948 Democratic \n     National Convention in Philadelphia in support of the \n     minority platform plank on civil rights and equal \n     opportunity, challenging the delegates to ``walk out of the \n     shadow of States' rights into the bright sunshine of human \n     rights,'' resulting in the convention's adoption of the \n     minority plank;\n       Whereas in 1948, Hubert Humphrey became the first Democrat \n     from Minnesota elected to the Senate;\n       Whereas during his total 23 years of service in the Senate \n     (including service from 1949 to 1964 and service from 1970 to \n     1978), Hubert Humphrey compiled a record of accomplishment \n     virtually unmatched in the 20th century, encompassing, among \n     other issues, civil and human rights, workforce development, \n     labor rights, health care, arms control and disarmament, the \n     Peace Corps, small business assistance, education reform, \n     wilderness preservation, immigration reform, and agriculture;\n       Whereas his service as floor leader during the Senate's \n     consideration of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was essential \n     to the eventual passage of the Act in the aftermath of \n     breaking the filibuster against this historic legislation;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, although a dedicated leader of the \n     Democratic Party, always sought bipartisan support for his \n     legislative goals and routinely shared credit with other \n     Senators for his legislative victories;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as Vice President of the United \n     States, loyally served President Lyndon Baines Johnson and \n     successfully carried out a number of domestic and overseas \n     assignments;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as the Democratic Party's nominee \n     for President of the United States in 1968, waged one of the \n     most courageous and hard-fought campaigns in the history of \n     the United States, losing to Richard Nixon by less than 1 \n     percentage point of the popular vote when he started the \n     campaign some 15 points behind;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey was reelected by the people of \n     Minnesota (in 1970 and 1976) to 2 additional terms in the \n     Senate, thereby continuing his extraordinary record of \n     legislative achievement with passage of such bills as the \n     Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, terminally ill with cancer, \n     pursued his active public life with great courage, fortitude, \n     and good humor, and in the memorable words of Vice President \n     Walter F. Mondale at Hubert Humphrey's memorial observance in \n     the rotunda of the United States Capitol, ``Hubert Humphrey \n     taught us how to live and he taught us how to die''; and\n       Whereas the life and service of Hubert Humphrey were \n     posthumously honored by Congress with the presentation of the \n     Congressional Gold Medal, and by the President of the United \n     States with the award of the Medal of Freedom: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career \n     of Senator and Vice President Hubert H.

Humphrey and his lifetime of \n     service to all people in the United States and to people \n     around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2958-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2958-S2959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 17--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n TAIWAN SHOULD BE ACCORDED OBSERVER STATUS IN THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL \n                      AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO)\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Brown of Ohio, \nMr. Cardin, Mr. Coats, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Kyl) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 17\n\n       Whereas the Convention on International Civil Aviation, \n     signed in Chicago, Illinois, on December 7, 1944, and entered \n     into force April 4, 1947, approved the establishment of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), stating \n     ``The aims and objectives of the Organization are to develop \n     the\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n     principles and techniques of international air navigation and \n     to foster the planning and development of international air \n     transport so as to . . . meet the needs of the peoples of the \n     world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air \n     transport'';\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, the ICAO convened a high-level Ministerial Conference \n     on Aviation Security that endorsed a global strategy for \n     strengthening aviation security worldwide and issued a public \n     declaration that ``a uniform approach in a global system is \n     essential to ensure aviation security throughout the world \n     and that deficiencies in any part of the system constitute a \n     threat to the entire global system,'' and that there should \n     be a commitment to ``foster international cooperation in the \n     field of aviation security and harmonize the implementation \n     of security measures'';\n       Whereas, the 37th ICAO Assembly in October 2010 adopted a \n     Declaration on Aviation Security largely in response to the \n     attempted sabotage of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on \n     December 25, 2009, which established new criminal penalties \n     for the use of civil aircraft as a weapon, the use of \n     dangerous materials to attack aircraft or other targets on \n     the ground, and the unlawful transport of biological, \n     chemical, and nuclear weapons and related materials, along \n     with extradition arrangements that facilitate cooperation \n     among nations in apprehending and prosecuting those who have \n     undertaken these and other criminal acts;\n       Whereas on October 8, 2010, the Department of State praised \n     the 37th ICAO Assembly on its adoption of the Declaration on \n     Aviation Security, but noted that ``because every airport \n     offers a potential entry point into this global system, every \n     nation faces the threat from gaps in aviation security \n     throughout the world -- and all nations must share the \n     responsibility for securing that system'';\n       Whereas the Taipei Flight Information Region, under the \n     jurisdiction of Taiwan, ROC, covers an airspace of 176,000 \n     square nautical miles and provides air traffic control \n     services to over 1,350,000 flights annually, with the Taiwan \n     Taoyuan International Airport recognized as the 8th and 18th \n     largest airport by international cargo volume and number of \n     international passengers, respectively;\n       Whereas exclusion from the ICAO since 1971 has impeded the \n     efforts of the Government of Taiwan to maintain civil \n     aviation practices that comport with evolving international \n     standards, due to its inability to contact the ICAO for up-\n     to-date information on aviation standards and norms, secure \n     amendments to the organization's regulations in a timely \n     manner, obtain sufficient and timely information needed to \n     prepare for the implementation of new systems and procedures \n     set forth by the ICAO, receive technical assistance in \n     implementing new regulations, and participate in technical \n     and academic seminars hosted by the ICAO;\n       Whereas the United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy \n     Review, clearly declared its support for the participation of \n     Taiwan in appropriate international organizations, in \n     particular, on September 27, 1994, with the announcement by \n     the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific \n     Affairs that, pursuant to the Review and recognizing Taiwan's \n     important role in transnational issues, the United States \n     ``will support its membership in organizations where \n     statehood is not a prerequisite, and [the United States] will \n     support opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in \n     organizations where its membership is not possible''; and\n       Whereas ICAO rules and existing practices have allowed for \n     the meaningful participation of noncontracting countries as \n     well as other bodies in its meetings and activities through \n     granting of observer status: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) meaningful participation by the Government of Taiwan as \n     an observer in the meetings and activities of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will \n     contribute both to the fulfillment of the ICAO's overarching \n     mission and to the success of a global strategy to address \n     aviation security threats based on effective international \n     cooperation;\n       (2) the United States Government should take a leading role \n     in garnering international support for the granting of \n     observer status to Taiwan in the ICAO for the purpose of such \n     participation; and\n       (3) the Department of State should provide briefings to or \n     consult with Congress on any efforts conducted by the United \n     States Government in support of Taiwan's attainment of \n     observer status in the ICAO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2959-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Res. 181\n\n                      (National MPS Awareness Day)\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') are a group of genetically determined \n     lysosomal storage diseases that render the human body \n     incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break down \n     complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be \n     stored in almost every cell in the body and progressively \n     cause cellular damage;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--\n       (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, \n     respiratory system, bones, internal organs, and central \n     nervous system; and\n       (2) often results in intellectual disabilities, short \n     stature, corneal damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, \n     speech and hearing impairment, heart disease, hyperactivity, \n     chronic respiratory problems, and, most importantly, a \n     drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited \n     treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway as of the date of \n     agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-\n     brain barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, which prevents the treatment \n     of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted \n     with MPS, and the treatments available to those individuals, \n     will be enhanced through the development of early detection \n     techniques and early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases; and\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     individuals within the medical community;\n       Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS \n     a model for the study of many other degenerative genetic \n     diseases; and\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2011, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                              S.

least 65 fatalities and more than 1,000 \n     injuries, had a maximum width of 1.5 miles and a track length \n     of 80 miles;\n       Whereas Smithville, Mississippi, a town of fewer than 900, \n     lost 15 of its citizens, as well as its post office, school, \n     city hall, most of its churches, and almost every home;\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n       Whereas an Enhanced Fujita category 5 (referred to in this \n     preamble as an ``EF5'') tornado is defined by the National \n     Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration as the rarest and most severe type of tornado, \n     with sustained winds of greater than 200 miles per hour and \n     that results in total destruction of well-built, \n     structurally-sound buildings;\n       Whereas 3 of the 5 EF5 rated tornadoes recorded in the \n     United states since 2000 occurred as part of the April 25 \n     through 28, 2011 tornado outbreak in the States of \n     Mississippi and Alabama;\n       Whereas the Washington County, Virginia tornado traveled \n     approximately 14 miles and had a maximum path width of 2 \n     miles;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service estimates that 40 \n     tornadoes hit the State of Tennessee from April 27 through \n     28, 2011;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service has confirmed that a \n     total of 15 tornadoes hit the State of Georgia throughout the \n     period of April 25 through 28, 2011, including a powerful EF4 \n     tornado which devastated the city of Ringgold, Georgia;\n       Whereas dozens of rural communities throughout the South, \n     including in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, have been decimated \n     by the devastating storms and tornadoes of April 2011;\n       Whereas more than 500 homes were damaged or destroyed in \n     the State of Tennessee as a result of the devastating storms \n     and tornadoes;\n       Whereas the massive storms impacted cities and towns in the \n     State of Alabama, including Arab, Berry, Birmingham, Concord, \n     Eclectic, Forkland, Fultondale, Hackleburg, Phil Campbell, \n     Pleasant Grove, Rainsville, and Tuscaloosa;\n       Whereas President Obama declared 10 counties in the State \n     of Tennessee to be in a state of major disaster and approved \n     the request made by Governor Haslam for Federal disaster \n     assistance;\n       Whereas the tornado that swept from Monroe County, \n     Mississippi into Marion County, Alabama and destroyed \n     Smithville, Mississippi was--\n       (1) the sixth deadliest tornado ever recorded in the State \n     of Mississippi;\n       (2) the first EF5 tornado recorded in the State of \n     Mississippi since 1966; and\n       (3) the first EF5 tornado recorded in the United States \n     since May 2008.\n       Whereas the massive storms and tornadoes caused widespread \n     damage in the Georgian counties of Bartow, Catoosa, Cherokee, \n     Coweta, Dade, Floyd, Gordon, Greene, Habersham, Harris, \n     Heard, Lamar, Lumpkin, Meriwether, Monroe, Morgan, Newton, \n     Pickens, Polk, Rabun,

Cumberland, Currituck, Greene, Halifax, Harnett, \n     Hertford, Hoke, Johnston, Lee Onslow, Pitt, Robeson, Sampson, \n     Tyrell, Wake, and Wilson;\n       Whereas the tornado that swept from Neshoba County, \n     Mississippi to Noxubee County, Mississippi was just the \n     second EF5 tornado recorded in the State of Mississippi since \n     1966;\n       Whereas April 27, 2011, marks the third highest number of \n     tornado-related fatalities occurring in a single day since \n     March 18, 1925, when a series of tornadoes caused 747 \n     fatalities across 7 States;\n       Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, the \n     total number of fatalities resulting from the devastating \n     storms and tornadoes remains unknown;\n       Whereas the suffering and distress of thousands of people \n     affected by the storms and tornadoes is ongoing, particularly \n     for those who lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods;\n       Whereas immediate humanitarian aid is critically needed in \n     many of the devastated regions;\n       Whereas the local emergency responders, National Guard, and \n     many ordinary citizens of the affected regions have risked \n     their lives to save others;\n       Whereas throughout the crisis, doctors, nurses, and medical \n     personnel in the affected regions worked expeditiously to \n     ensure that hospitals, medical centers, and triage units \n     provided needed care;\n       Whereas many faith-based organizations and other volunteer \n     organizations and charities are supplying the victims of the \n     storms and tornadoes with food, water, and shelter;\n       Whereas the Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Virginia, and North Carolina Emergency Management Agencies, \n     the first responders in the affected communities, and \n     countless volunteers immediately came to the aid of those \n     affected by the storms;\n       Whereas the Governor of Alabama, Robert Bentley, the \n     Governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, the Governor of \n     Mississippi, Haley Barbour, the Governor of Georgia, Nathan \n     Deal, the Governor of Virginia, Robert McDonnell, and the \n     Governor of North Carolina, Beverly Perdue, reacted swiftly \n     and with great leadership in the immediate aftermath of the \n     destructive storms and tornadoes;\n       Whereas President Obama responded quickly and efficiently \n     to approve the requests made by Governors Bentley, Haslam, \n     Barbour, Deal, and Perdue for Federal disaster assistance;\n       Whereas in response to the declaration by the President of \n     a major disaster, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has made federal disaster assistance \n     available for the State of Alabama and elsewhere in the South \n     to assist in local recovery efforts; and\n       Whereas thousands of volunteers and government employees \n     from across the United States have committed time and \n     resources to help with recovery efforts: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the heartfelt condolences of the Senate to \n     the families and friends of those who lost their lives, \n     homes, and livelihoods in the tragic storms and tornadoes of \n     April 2011;\n       (2) commends the resiliency and courage of the people of \n     the affected States, including the people of the States of \n     Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and North \n     Carolina;\n       (3) extends the wishes of the Senate for a full recovery \n     for all those who were injured in the storms and tornadoes;\n       (4) extends the thanks of the Senate to the forecasters, \n     first responders, firefighters, law enforcement personnel, \n     volunteers, and medical personnel who took quick action to \n     provide warnings, aid, and comfort to the victims of the \n     storms and tornadoes;\n       (5) commits to provide the necessary resources and to stand \n     by the people of the affected States, including the people of \n     the States of Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, \n     Virginia, and North Carolina, in the relief, recovery, and \n     rebuilding efforts; and\n       (6) stands with the people affected by the storms and \n     tornadoes, including the people of the States of Alabama, \n     Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and North \n     Carolina, as those people begin the healing process following \n     this terrible event.\n\n                              S. Res. 183\n\n                    (National Police Survivors Day)\n\n       Whereas the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in \n     Judiciary Square in Washington, D.C. lists on a Wall of \n     Remembrance the names of more than 19,000 law enforcement \n     officers who have died in the line of duty;\n       Whereas in the United States, 1 law enforcement officer is \n     killed every 53 hours;\n       Whereas in 2010, 152 law enforcement officers lost their \n     lives in the line of duty;\n       Whereas on May 14, 1983, on the eve of the 2nd annual \n     National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, 10 widows of \n     fallen law enforcement officers came together to discuss the \n     lack of support for law enforcement survivors;\n       Whereas 1 year later, that discussion led to the formation \n     of Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. at the 1st annual \n     National Police Survivors' Seminar, which drew 110 law \n     enforcement survivors from throughout the United States;\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. has grown to \n     serve more than 15,000 surviving families of fallen law \n     enforcement officers by providing healing, love, and the \n     opportunity for a renewed life;\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. and its 52 \n     chapters throughout the United States provide a program of \n     peer support and counseling to law enforcement survivors, \n     help survivors obtain the death benefits to which they are \n     entitled, and sponsor scholarships to enable children and \n     surviving spouses to pursue postsecondary education;\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. sponsors a year-\n     round series of seminars, meetings, and youth activities, \n     including the National Police Survivors' Seminar during \n     National Police Week, retreats for parents, spouses, and \n     siblings, and programs and summer activities for children;\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. helps law \n     enforcement agencies cope with the loss of an officer by \n     promoting the adoption of standardized policies and \n     procedures for line-of-duty deaths; and\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. inspires the \n     public to recognize the sacrifices made by law enforcement \n     families by encouraging all citizens of the United States to \n     tie a blue ribbon to their car antenna during National Police \n     Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 14, 2011, as ``National Police Survivors \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Police Survivors Day'' with appropriate ceremonies \n     to pay respect to--\n       (A) the survivors of the fallen heroes of law enforcement; \n     and\n       (B) the fallen law enforcement officers who, through their \n     courageous deeds, have made the ultimate sacrifice in service \n     to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/12/senate-section/article/S2971-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2971-S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTHORIZING USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. REID.
