Mr. President, I am delighted to be here with my \nsenior colleague, Senator Jack Reed, to welcome Geralyn Wolf, the \nBishop of the Episcopal Archdiocese of Rhode Island, who shared with us \nthe prayer this morning.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues what a wonderful addition she is \nto our Rhode Island community. She has served in Kentucky and in \nPennsylvania, but she has been in Rhode Island for many years and has \nbeen devoted to our community, particularly to the needy in our \ncommunity, to the point where at one point she spent 30 days living as \na homeless person in order to see firsthand what the resources were to \nsupport people when they faced the burden and the sorrow of \nhomelessness and to inform her actions as the bishop of our diocese.\n  She is keenly interested in the Sudan and works with priests who are \nhelping to bring Christianity to those areas as the vehicle for peace \namidst some of the worst and most horrific violence on the face of our \nplanet.\n  It gives both Senator Reed and myself great pride that she has come \ndown to Washington today to open the Senate. It is my hope, and I am \nsure Senator Reed's as well, that during the course of our \ndeliberations today we will be informed by the hopes and the sentiments \nand the confidence and the blessings she expressed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Whitehouse in \nwelcoming Bishop Wolf to the Senate today. I commend Senator Whitehouse \nfor his invitation. Bishop Wolf is not only a pastoral leader in our \ncommunity, she is also a great community leader. She not only preaches \nthe gospel, she lives the gospel.\n  As Senator Whitehouse indicated, she went on the mean streets of \nProvidence, and there are such streets in every town in this country, \nto experience firsthand the travails and the troubles of people just \ntrying to get by. That experience informed her ministry and informed \nher public positions, and we thank her for that. She has a global \nvision as well as a vision in Rhode Island. That global vision is a \nworld inspired by American actions that is peaceful and progressive and \nfinds opportunity for all.\n  So on behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I wish to thank her for \nher service, and I thank her especially for the grace she has brought \nto us today and has brought the State of Rhode Island as a result of \nher service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4567-6", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed of Rhode Island).

Mr. President, there are some in the Republican Party who \nwill not listen to the truth no matter who speaks it.\n  This is my opinion: If we allow this Nation for the first time in its \nhistory to default on our national obligations, it will not only be a \nblack mark on our reputation but also a massive financial disaster that \nwill sweep the world into global depression.\n  But it is not my opinion alone. I have come to that belief by \nlistening to the most respected voices in the business community. \nDefault, they say, is a ``risk our country must not take.''\n  They are not the only ones who believe that is true. The most \nrespected bankers have also said it. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon \nsaid default would be ``catastrophic.''\n  Investors have said it. Bill Gross, one of the world's largest mutual \nfund managers, sent us a warning yesterday. He said:\n\n       There should be no question at all. The debt ceiling must \n     be raised and not be held hostage by budget negotiations. \n     Don't mess with the debt ceiling, Washington.\n\n  That is what Bill Gross said.\n  Economists have also said it. Ben Bernanke, appointed by President \nBush as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said default would be a \n``major crisis'' that would send ``shock waves'' through the world \nfinancial markets. Yesterday, he said failure to avert default would \nmean ``huge financial calamity.''\n  Even other Republicans have said it. This is what Speaker Boehner \nsaid in April:\n\n       Not raising the debt limit would have serious--very \n     serious--implications for the worldwide economy and jobs here \n     in America.\n\n  Perhaps most telling of all, all three rating agencies have already \nsent warning shots across our bow. Last night, Moody's cautioned us \nthat America's AAA rating was already under review for downgrade. Never \nin the history of the country has that happened, that we are being \nreviewed to downgrade our debt rating. We have 3 weeks left until we \nmiss our first payment. They cited the ``rising possibility'' that we \nwill default. They said we could lose this crucial rating--which saves \nevery American money every day--even before we miss a payment.\n  Standard & Poor's has told Congress and business leaders that even if \nthe United States keeps paying creditors but delays payments such as \nSocial Security or veterans' benefits, it may cut our rating.\n  Fitch Ratings has said a default would ``threaten the still fragile \nfinancial stability of the United States and the world as a whole.''\n  So why are some Republicans in Congress still saying that a first \never default on our Nation's financial obligations would be no big \ndeal?\n  When every financial expert, investor, business leader, and banker in \nthe country--and even every reasonable member of your own political \nparty--is telling you the consequences of default would be \ncatastrophic, it is time to start listening. Why? Because default won't \njust roil the financial markets, pushing interest rates higher and tank \nthe stock markets. It will affect every American's wallet as well.\n  Here are a few of the things that will happen. Social Security checks \nand benefits to our troops would stop. Some of the most vulnerable \nAmericans would be placed at risk. Our promise to the men and women who \nprotected this Nation so bravely--and those who protect it today--would \nbe broken. We would not be able to make payments to our military.\n  Payments on our national debt would stop. American investments and \nretirement accounts could be decimated. Millions of Americans could \nlose their jobs.\n  Interest rates would rise not only for the government but for \nordinary Americans as well. Those Americans will pay more for their \nmortgages. They will pay more to use a credit card or buy a car or \nfinance a university education. They will even pay more for their \nelectric bills, groceries, and gas. The spike in interest rates and \ndamage to the U.S. dollar alone would cost the average American family \nmore than $1,500 immediately. It would be the most serious financial \ncrisis this country has ever faced, and it would come at a time when \nour economy can least afford it. In the long run, it would wind up \ncosting the government not millions, not billions, but trillions of \ndollars--a fact Republicans shouting about the debt fail to mention. \nFor every 1-percent increase in interest rates, it will cost our Nation \n$1.3 trillion--again, not million, not billion, but trillion. For every \n1-percent increase in interest rates, it will cost this Nation $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  With so much at stake, even Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader \nMcConnell seem to understand the seriousness of the situation. They are \nwilling to negotiate in good faith, which I appreciate, and the country \nappreciates.\n  Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has shown that he \nshouldn't even be at the table, and Republicans agree he shouldn't be \nat the table.\n  One House Republican told Politico, a Hill publication, last night: \n``He lost a lot of credibility when he walked away from the table. . . \n. It was childish.'' What is that all about?\n  We had negotiations going on here in Room S. 219, a short jaunt from \nhere, and he walked out on the meetings with the Vice President of the \nUnited States. It was childish.\n  Another Republican said Cantor is putting himself first. He said \nthis: ``He's all about Eric.''\n  The time for personal gain and political posturing is over. It is \ntime to put our economy and our country first. The risks we face are \nsimply too grave.\n  We don't need to take my word for it. More than 300 respected \nbusiness leaders wrote to Congress the night before last to make it \nclear how serious this crisis is.\n\n       A great nation--like a great company--has to be relied upon \n     to pay its debts when they become due. This is a Main Street \n     not Wall Street issue.\n\n  We are listening. It is time for the irresponsible voices in the \nRepublican Party who continue to deny the truth of this crisis to start \nlistening as well.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past few days, a lot of people \nhave taken it upon themselves to offer Republicans in Congress and me \nin particular their advice on the debt limit. I have listened to all of \nit very carefully. I appreciate how frustrating it is for people to \nthink that in spite of everything we know about the state of our \neconomy, and despite all the warnings we have heard about the dangers \npresented by our deficits and debt, we can't do something about it. I \nshare that frustration. No one has spent more time cajoling and \npersuading this White House of the need to do something big.\n  I was truly hopeful the President could be persuaded to view the \nupcoming debt limit vote as an opportunity to cut Washington spending \nand the debt that has ballooned since he took office, and to preserve \nentitlements at the same time. But, in the end, he wasn't interested in \ndoing something of that magnitude that would pass.\n  He gave us three bad choices: higher taxes, smoke and mirrors or \ndefault, and we refuse to accept any of them. Republicans will not be \nreduced to being the tax collectors for the Obama\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\neconomy. We will not be seduced into calling a bad deal a good deal, \nand we will not let the White House fool around with the full faith and \ncredit of the United States.\n  If the President wants to threaten seniors or veterans or rattle the \nworld economy by pretending he cannot pay our bills, he, of course, can \ndo that. But he is not going to implicate Republicans in these efforts.\n  That is why I proposed, as a last resort, a plan that would force the \nWhite House to show its hand. If the President would rather default \nthan cut back on the size and scope of government, let him explain \nthat. If he would rather preserve his vision of Washington than protect \nentitlements, let him explain that. If he and the Democratic Senate \nwould rather borrow and spend us into oblivion, they can certainly do \nthat. But do not expect any more cover from Republicans on it than they \ngot on health care--none.\n  The American people deserve to know what their elected \nrepresentatives stand for in this debate. None of these proposals that \nhave been presented up to now would do that.\n  If Democrats will not agree to reforms we need, then we should at \nleast show the public where we stand. What they wanted was a deal that \npurported to lower the debt from $26 trillion to $24 trillion over 10 \nyears, then have us give it thumbs up and call it a bipartisan victory \nfor fiscal discipline. We were not about to call this a good deal any \nmore than we were willing to call the health care bill real reform.\n  We refuse to let this President use the threat of a debt-limit \ndeadline to get us to cave on tax hikes or phony spending cuts. It is \ntime to change this debate altogether. It is time to make it clear to \nthe American people where the two parties stand in this debate.\n  Either you are with the President and his vision of a government that \ncontinues to live beyond its means or you are with those of us who \nbelieve Washington needs some strong medicine. Either you want to \nsimply borrow and spend our Nation into oblivion or you want to get our \nfiscal house in order, and the single most effective way to do that is \nwith a balanced budget amendment.\n  If the President and Democrats in Congress will not agree to cut \nback, let's force them. Let's pass a constitutional amendment that \nactually requires Congress to live within its means.\n  It is time for the American people to contact lawmakers on the \nDemocratic side and simply demand it. Republicans are unanimous in \ntheir support for a balanced budget amendment. We need 20 Democrats to \njoin us.\n  It is an uphill climb, but if the American people speak out, we can \nget it done. If the President will not agree to it, it is time we go \naround him and directly to the American people.\n  Let's keep the pressure on. Let's show the administration where the \npublic is on this issue. Let's get our fiscal house in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4569-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I realize a scheme has been concocted on \nthe debt ceiling that allows Democrats to go into this next election \ncontinuing to ensure that spending to many of their constituents is at \nlevels that please them; therefore, allowing them to run successfully \nin 2012, and that scheme also allows Republicans to run in 2012 with \nspending being the issue.\n  I think we all understand that, look, the debt ceiling is going to be \nincreased, and it is going to be increased in such a way that both \nsides of the aisle have the ability to campaign against the other \nrespective to their bases.\n  But the fact is, our great Nation is in decline because of the \nelected leaders in Washington. Our great Nation is in decline because \nof this body and the way it is acting, the House of Representatives and \nthe way it is acting, and the White House and the way it is acting.\n  This body, as we meet and go on to a spending bill, is helping our \ngreat Nation go into decline. Let me explain why.\n  Maybe the debt ceiling was the wrong place to pick a fight as it \nrelates to trying to get our country's house in order. Maybe that was \nthe wrong place to do it. The reason it was chosen is because this body \nhas not passed a budget in 806 or 807 days, and I credit both sides for \nthat. But the fact is the Senate has not passed a budget in over 806 \ndays.\n  I had a dinner this week, Monday night, with six Democrats and five \nRepublicans. I will not mention their names to impugn them in any way. \nBut all of them expressed tremendous frustration with the way this body \nis being run. Basically, most Senators in this body are nothing but \ntwo-bit pawns--two-bit pawns--as a political fight is under way \nbasically to lay out the groundwork, if you will, for the 2012 \nelection. That is what is happening right now in this body, and I think \nwe all know that.\n  Yet yesterday we voted to move to a spending bill where we, in \nessence, are acting as accomplices. We are accomplices to this--the \nPresiding Officer and myself. I voted against it. But anybody who votes \nto go to a spending bill without forcing the Senate to come to terms \nwith a budget is, in essence, an accomplice to allowing the shenanigans \nthat are taking place right now to continue. We are allowing this great \nNation to go into decline by not forcing us to make those tough \ndecisions.\n  The reason the debt ceiling was chosen is because there has not been \nany other mechanism to cause us to sit down and make those tough \nchoices as it relates to spending in our country. Because we were \nunwilling to do that, many people lined up, as a matter of fact, \nDemocrats and Republicans--there is a Gang of 6 that had been working, \nwith three Republicans and three Democrats. It is my sense that they \ntoo had planned to use the debt ceiling vote as a place to try to cause \nus to come together around something that might be sensible for our \ncountry. We have not seen the details of that. I hope we will see that \nsoon.\n  But my point is, both sides of the aisle actually had focused on this \ndebt ceiling vote--or many people on both sides of the aisle--to try to \ncause us to have the fiscal discipline we need. Obviously, with this \nnew scheme, that is not going to happen.\n  I think we all know the debt ceiling is going to be raised. Blame \nwill be assessed to either side. Both sides will use that in the 2012 \nelection, and then we will move on to another cycle where probably we \nwill continue to be irresponsible.\n  But the fact is, by moving to a spending bill without a budget--\neveryone who agrees to do that, every single person in this body who \nagrees to move to a spending bill, no matter what it is funding or no \nmatter at what level it is funding the things it is funding, every one \nof us is an accomplice in causing this great Nation to decline, every \nsingle one of us.\n  I would urge people in this body who would like to see us actually do \nour work, cause us to function the way the Founding Fathers had created \nthis body, cause us to function in a way that no longer allows our \ncountry to be in decline, I would urge everybody in this body to not \nagree to go to this spending bill and to say we will not spend any more \nof the U.S. resources--taxpayers' resources--without first agreeing to \nthose tough decisions.\n\n  I love seeing some of the masters of the universe on some of these \nfinancial programs in the morning. I heard one of them this morning on \na particular program I sometimes turn on to see what the markets are \ndoing in reaction to the ridiculous, undisciplined nature of this body, \nI heard one of them say the debt ceiling is no place--most\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\ncountries do not even vote on a debt ceiling. What they do is they vote \non budgets. In this country, we do not even vote on budgets. Of course, \nwe have figured out a way to not make any tough decision on the debt \nceiling vote either, and I understand what is getting ready to happen.\n  But, again, I say to all those folks who are not head of this body, \nwho are not in leadership, who in the bathrooms or in the halls or at \ndinner or at lunch complain about the fact that this place is \ndysfunctional, complain about the fact that they do not have the \nability to be involved in causing us to function in the way we should, \nevery single one of you, in my opinion, who votes to go to a spending \nbill today or end debate on a spending bill--in essence, allow us to \npass a spending bill--is an accomplice, is an accomplice in allowing \nthis great Nation to go into decline. That is pretty strong, but I \nbelieve it.\n  The fact is we make a big deal out of some items around here, but we \ndo not make a big deal when it comes to something we can actually \naffect and cause us as a body to do the things we need to do.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, look, I am very disappointed in the \nSenate. I am very disappointed in the White House. I am very \ndisappointed in all of us. I am very disappointed in the childish \nbehavior this body has continued to exude over the course of this \nentire year. I am very disappointed we would even consider going on \nwith spending taxpayer resources and not sitting down and making tough \ndecisions. I am very disappointed, candidly, that both sides of the \naisle only want it their way.\n  I do not think this great country was created the way it was so one \nside of the aisle got it exactly the way they wanted it. I think this \nbody was created to be ``the greatest deliberative body in the \ncountry.'' Yet we do not do that. We do not act that way. We do not \ndebate tough issues. We hide--all of us--we hide and we let our \nleadership concoct ways to keep us from doing the tough things we need \nto do.\n  The fact that we cannot even have a budget on this floor to come out \nof a committee, when, obviously, there is a majority--and I am not even \npointing fingers at the other side; I think both sides are equally \nproblematic in this because both sides, it is evident to me, are going \nto allow us to go to a spending bill today without a budget, but the \nfact that we cannot even bring a budget to the floor, when committees \nare stacked in such a manner that one side does have the majority, to \nme, is incredible.\n  If we move to a spending bill today without a budget, if we continue \nto do the things we do here, just without worrying about the \nfundamentals of what it takes for this country to be great, this body \ntoday will move one step further down the path of causing this great \nNation to go into decline, to keep us from making tough decisions, to \nallow committee heads or subcommittee heads in Appropriations to be \nable to bring forth their fruit, if you will, the things they would \nlike to spend money on.\n  By the way, I support much--I probably support everything that is in \nthis bill. I am not sure. It supports veterans. It supports military \nconstruction. But the fact is, actually, the very people this benefits, \nthe people who are veterans, the people who have given their limbs--\nsome have given loved ones--probably are embarrassed by the Senate too. \nEven though they would like to receive the benefits at some point in \ntime down the road--when these benefits come to fruition in this next \nfiscal year, they would like to receive those--they probably would \nprefer, first, that all of us in this body do our job, that we quit \nacting like the children we have been acting like this entire year; \nthat we quit calculating what we are going to do around the 2012 \nelections; that we quit hiding behind our leadership and allowing them \nto go down and negotiate grand bargains in private; that we quit, \nagain, hiding from tough decisions.\n  I hope others will join with me and that we will not end debate on \nthis bill. Let me put it this way: If we do not do that--in other \nwords, if we proceed with spending in this bill--I sure hope all those \nwho vote to do so will stop talking in private about how embarrassed \nthey are about this Senate, will stop talking in private about how they \nfeel like little pawns in a political game, will stop talking in \nprivate about how they would like to see this body start acting in the \nfashion it should act.\n  We have not done any real business this year. We all know it. We have \nnot done any real business this year because we have not wanted to take \non those tough issues. I am embarrassed by that, personally. I am \nembarrassed about the way this Senate has been conducting its business \nthis year.\n  I am not going to vote for a spending bill until we pass a budget. If \nwe had passed a budget and had the tough debates about revenues and \nexpenditures, we would not be in this no-win situation right now as it \nrelates to the debt ceiling, and we all know that. But we want to hide \nbehind that.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we all know, in the next few weeks we \nare going to have to be faced with a decision about what to do with the \ndebt limit, and of course there has been a lot of discussion around \nhere as well as between the White House and the congressional \nleadership about how best to resolve this issue.\n  I believe what it really comes down to is a question about what is \nthe best way to resolve a debt crisis. I think it creates a great \ndebate, a philosophical debate about do we need to grow government or \ndo we need to shrink government. I would argue that is kind of the \ndefining line in this debate, whether you believe the best way out of a \ndebt crisis is to expand and grow government or whether you think, as I \ndo, that we ought to make government smaller, not larger, if we are \ntrying to figure out how to get out of this particular circumstance we \nfind ourselves in right now.\n  We have a $14 trillion debt. We are going to have to increase the \nborrowing authority to get to the 2012 election by $2.4 trillion. That \nis the rate at which our debt is growing. I have said on the floor \nbefore that if you look at just the daily borrowing our Federal \nGovernment does, it exceeds the entire budget of my State of South \nDakota for a whole year. So we will borrow more in the next 24 hours \nhere in Washington, DC--about $4 billion--than the State of South \nDakota spends in an entire year. That is the dimension of the problem \nwe are facing.\n  Many of us believe the best thing we could do in order to get \nourselves on a better fiscal track is to pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Frankly, I hope we will have an \nopportunity to vote on just that sometime in this next week or the \nfollowing week. Most States around the country, including my State of \nSouth Dakota, have a balanced budget amendment in their constitution. \nIt requires them year-in and year-out to get their books balanced. They \ncannot continue to spend as if there is no tomorrow. They cannot spend \nmoney they do not have. They live within their means. That is what most \nAmericans have to do, that is what American businesses and families \nhave to do, and it certainly makes sense that we ought to be doing that \nat the Federal level.\n  I would urge my colleagues, as we look at the short-term issue, which \nis the debt limit vote, we have to figure out how we are going to get \nthe best deal we can get in the near term, but what are we going to do \nin the long term to put our country on a more sustainable fiscal \nfooting? I would argue that putting an imposed discipline on Congress, \nsuch as an amendment to the Constitution that would require us year-in \nand year-out to balance our budget, just makes sense. It is practical, \nit makes economic sense, and it certainly is discipline that has been \nlacking here in Washington, DC, for some time.\n  If you look at the States that have made hard decisions--mine is a \ngood example of that--they had to cut spending this year significantly \nto balance their budgets, but at least they are doing that. They are \nmaking these\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nhard choices and hard decisions, and that is something we have been \nputting off here for way too long.\n  I would point out to my colleagues here that as we talk about how to \nget the country back on the right fiscal track, we do have to start \nsetting priorities.\n  Well, we are not doing that. We haven't had a budget here now for 806 \ndays. It has been 806 days since the Democratic majority in the Senate \nhas allowed us to have a vote on a budget.\n  Many of us believe that in order to determine how you are going to \nspend $3.7 trillion of America's hard-earned money, you ought to have \nsome priorities. You ought to at least put a pathway out there about \nhow you are going to go about spending those dollars and setting \npriorities for the country.\n  Well, we are not doing that because we have not passed a budget in \n806 days. That is the fundamental responsibility we have as leaders. \nThe people of this country elected us to do that. We are not doing \nthat. I think that is creating uncertainty. It is creating instability \nout there around the country.\n  I met with some business owners this morning who say that in their \nparticular industry, there are people who want to invest, they want to \ncreate jobs, and they want to make capital investments. But these are \nlong-term investments, and they don't know what is happening, they \ndon't know what the policies coming out of Washington are going to be \nwith regard to taxes, spending, regulations, all of those sorts of \nthings. There is an enormous amount of uncertainty.\n  There was a survey done just recently by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nin which they asked small businesses about their future hiring plans, \nand 64 percent of the small businesses that responded to that survey \nsaid they were not going to add to their payroll this year, they were \nnot going to hire this year. Another 12 percent said they were actually \ngoing to cut jobs. Why? Half of the people who responded to the survey \nsaid: Economic uncertainty. They just flat do not know what Washington \nis going to do next. And you can't have that kind of uncertainty. What \nthe markets want, what businesses want, what investors want is they \nwant to know what the rules are going to be, and they want some \ncertainty about what is going to happen next.\n  The kind of uncertainty we are creating reaches beyond our shores \nbecause I think that if you look at what is happening in Europe today, \nthey are facing a debt crisis in many of those countries. What are the \neconomic impacts of that? Well, if you look at the interest rates in \nthe Euro zone, the 3-year government interest rates are 19.4 percent \nfor Portugal, 28.9 percent for Greece, and 12.9 percent for Ireland. \nThat is our future if we don't get our fiscal house in order.\n  What does that mean? That means that not just does the Federal \nGovernment have to pay more to borrow money, pay more in higher \ninterest costs, it also means that those interest costs--all interest \nrates in this country, whether it is for an auto loan or a home loan or \na student's college loan, they all track with the Treasury borrowing \nrates. If those rates go up, that has profound implications for our \neconomy. That means people across this country are going to pay much \nhigher interest rates. Small businesses are going to pay higher \ninterest rates to borrow money.\n  These are real-world impacts if we do not make the right kinds of \ndecisions here to get this spending and this borrowing under control. \nSo if you want to see our future, look at some of the European \ncountries. Look at what impact this is having on interest rates and on \ntheir economies. That is something our economy could not withstand.\n  We are already facing 9.2 percent unemployment. We have a need to get \npeople back to work. And what we need now is not more expanded \ngovernment and more uncertainty about what Washington, DC, is going to \ndo; we need stability, we need certainty, and we need decisions here \nwhich have a favorable impact on the private marketplace and create an \ninducement to hire people as opposed to discouraging it, which is what \nwe are seeing today.\n  I have argued down here on many occasions that this debt is really \nstrangling our economy because it is crowding out private investment. \nAnytime the government is out there borrowing money, it means there is \nless capital out there for private businesses to have access to. I \nthink the more fundamental issue in this whole debate, however--and I \nmentioned this yesterday in some remarks on the floor--is really the \nsize and scope of government and whether we want to see an expanded, \nbigger, larger government or whether we ought to try to work our way \nout of this debt crisis by actually reducing the size of our \ngovernment.\n  I pointed out that in the past couple of years alone, we have seen \ngovernment expand dramatically. In fact, nondefense discretionary \nspending in the last 2 years has grown by 24 percent. The debt has \ngrown by 35 percent in just the time this President has been in office. \nThe amount we spend on our Federal Government as a percentage of our \nentire economy has grown dramatically as well. The 40-year historical \naverage is 20.6 percent. That is what we historically, for the past 40 \nyears, have spent on the Federal Government as a percentage of our \nentire economic output. If you go back to the year 1800--hard to \nbelieve--it was 2 percent. That is what we spent on the Federal \nGovernment as a percentage of our entire economy. Of course, it has \ngrown since that time, but it has really taken off here in just the \nlast few years.\n  I pointed out yesterday as well that of the five times the budget has \nactually been balanced in this country since 1969, in every \ncircumstance it has been when government has spent less as a percentage \nof our entire economy than the average. So if the average is 20.6 for \nthe past 40 years, the times when we have actually balanced the budget, \nwe have averaged spending 18.7 percent of our GDP.\n  The point simply is this: If you want to solve this problem, it gets \nsolved on the spending side of the equation. The problem we have in \nthis country is not that we tax too little or have too little revenue, \nit is that we spend too much because this year we will spend, as a \npercentage of our entire economy, 24.3 percent. There is almost a \nquarter of the entire economy of this country now being spent by the \nFederal Government, and that will only go up over time as we see these \nnew entitlement programs, the new health care program that was created \nlast year, continue to consume more and more of our resources in this \ncountry. That means there is less and less out there for the private \neconomy where the real jobs are created.\n  If you look at just what we pay in interest costs alone and how we \nwould be influenced by a slight uptick in interest rates--there was a \ngreat op-ed written in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks back \nby Larry Lindsey, who is a former economic adviser to President Bush \nand also a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He pointed \nout that if interest rates return to their 20-year average, it would \nadd $4.9 trillion in additional borrowing costs over the next decade. \nSo everything we are talking about here in this debate about the debt \nlimit in terms of reducing spending really pales in comparison to just \na normalization of interest rates.\n  If we saw interest rates go back to what is a 20-year average, we \nwould see an additional $4.9 trillion that we would have to spend to \nfinance our debt. That is a staggering statistic. Again, I think it \nspeaks to the need for us to get our spending under control because the \namount we borrow, as it continues to ratchet up, and we continue to get \nfurther in debt, the likelihood is that our interest rates are going to \ngo up in a corresponding manner, and we will end up spending more and \nmore on higher interest.\n  I think the real issue is whether we as a nation are going to make a \nconscious decision that the way we resolve this debt crisis is either \non the spending side or on the revenue side. We heard our colleagues on \nthe other side--and we heard the President--say we need more revenue. \nIn fact, I have not been in on the discussions occurring at the White \nHouse, but it is my understanding that one of the latest proposals on \nthe table was a $1.6 trillion increase in taxes. In other words, they \nwant to add $1.6 trillion in additional tax revenues in order to get \nsome amount of spending reduction.\n  We have seen this picture before. We can go back to the 1990 budget \ndeal that President Bush made with the\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nCongress at the time which was supposed to have 2-to-1 spending cuts to \ntax increases. The tax increases occurred; the spending cuts didn't. \nThat is our history. That is why making a deal that involves massive \nincreases in taxes on our economy, on our small businesses, when we \nhave 9.2 percent unemployment is a bad idea when the problem we are \ntrying to fix is fundamentally a spending problem. It would be one \nthing if we were spending at a historical rate. If we were spending at \na rate that is 20 percent of our total economy, the 40-year average, \nthat would be different. We are spending more than 24 percent. This is \nfundamentally a spending problem that cannot be solved on the revenue \nside.\n  The only thing that increasing taxes would do is make it harder, more \nexpensive, and more difficult for small businesses to create jobs. That \nis precisely what we want small businesses to think about doing. \nInstead, 64 percent of them are saying that this next year they are not \ngoing to add to the payroll, create jobs. Why? Because of economic \nuncertainty. We need to create some certainty out there. We need them \nto know that tax rates will stay at a low level--taxes on investments \nand income. We need them to know we are committed to cutting spending \nand getting the Federal debt under control. We need them to know we are \nnot going to add massively to the cost of doing business in this \ncountry by dramatically increasing the number of Federal regulations \nwith which they have to comply.\n  I hear that everywhere I go, whether it is a farmer, rancher, or \nsmall business owner--everywhere. In a meeting I had with some small \nbusiness owners, they said the regulations are making it increasingly \ncostly and more difficult for them to create jobs. So if we get into \nthe final days of this debate and these decisions have to be made, I \nwould say that the President needs to recognize that this is not a \nrevenue issue; this is a spending issue, and he needs to step up and \nprovide leadership and a pathway for how we get our fiscal house in \norder--not by increasing taxes on the job creators in our economy, our \nsmall businesses but, rather, by getting Federal spending under \ncontrol.\n  I think we would have an incredibly warm and favorable reception from \nboth the House and the Senate, who are prepared to do business when it \ncomes to reducing spending and making government smaller, not bigger, \ndealing with this long-term structural problem that we have of a \nrunaway debt that is growing literally by the year at the tune of about \n$1 trillion annually.\n  If we don't do this, as I said before, we are looking at a future \nthat will resemble many countries in Europe. We don't want to be a \ncountry that defaults on our debt. We obviously need to address this \nissue of the debt limit. We need to do it in a responsible way that \nholds us accountable to the American people who spoke loudly and \nclearly in the last election indicating that they believe government \nhas gotten too big and is growing too fast. They want the government \nreined in.\n  The way we do that is to rein in Federal spending. That involves not \njust the discretionary spending I mentioned earlier, which has grown at \n24 percent in the last 2 years, but the long-term structural challenges \nthat we face in entitlement programs--Medicare and Social Security.\n  Republicans in the Congress are willing to lead on those issues and \nare willing to step forward and put forward a plan. The only plan put \nforward so far has come from the House Republicans, and it has been \ncriticized by a lot of Democrats in the House and Senate and also by \nthe White House. We have yet to see a plan from the other side. It has \nbeen 806 days, and we haven't had a budget presented by the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, nor has the President come forward with a plan \nthat actually does something to reduce spending and debt.\n  The President did submit a budget proposal earlier this year which \ndramatically would have increased spending and doubled the debt over \nthe next decade and dramatically increased taxes. That is the wrong \nmessage to have received.\n  The message the people of this country are sending is that we want \nWashington to focus on the spending side. We want a smaller Federal \nGovernment, not a larger Federal Government. We want the Federal \nGovernment to do what we have to do--American families and small \nbusinesses--and that is to live within its means.\n  I hope this debt debate, as it comes to a conclusion, will come to a \ngood outcome and result for the people of this country. We don't want \nto have this country in a situation where we are not making payments, \nwhere we are defaulting on our debt. But we cannot just continue this \npattern of raising the borrowing authority of this country, adding to \nthe Federal debt, without doing something to get that debt under \ncontrol, without doing something to reduce the amount this Federal \nGovernment spends every single year. Spending at 24 to 25 percent of \nour entire economy is a trend that cannot be continued and cannot be \nsustained. We need to get back to more of a historical average, where \nthe American people want us to be.\n  The reason the American people reacted the way they did in the last \nelection is they saw this government growing at a rate that made them \nvery uncomfortable and frightened. That continues to this day because \nthere is uncertainty about the country's future and an instability that \nexists today.\n  I heard from some business owners this morning. They want stability, \nsome certainty about what the rules are going to be. More importantly, \nit starts by having a Federal Government that lives within its means \nand doesn't spend money that it doesn't have and that focuses intently \non getting spending and debt under control and creating favorable \nconditions for economic growth and job creation.\n  That doesn't happen by raising government revenues, raising taxes; \nthat happens by the Federal Government exercising fiscal \nresponsibility, reducing spending, reducing debt, and keeping taxes low \non our job creators so that we can get people in this country back to \nwork. That is the correct prescription for this country. It is a \nprescription I hope the President will embrace.\n  I can say that the Republicans in the Senate--and I daresay the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives as well--are prepared to \nmeet him in working together on that challenge of reducing spending and \ndebt and creating conditions favorable to economic growth and job \ncreation and getting American people back to work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I stand here today having spent some time \nover the last few days thinking about this dispute regarding the debt \nlimit, as we are hearing from our constituents across the country who \nare looking at Washington and asking: What is going on? What are you \nguys doing?\n  It is a difficult process for people to understand. They elect us and \nsend us here to serve our country and to solve problems. Yet they read \nin the newspapers all these startling statements--the President saying \na few days ago he can't guarantee Social Security payments, others \nsaying our bond rating might be at risk. And, of course, the reality of \ndaily life is that, more than ever, Americans are finding it difficult \nto find a job, and the ones who do are working twice as hard and making \nless.\n  So things have gotten tougher over the last couple of years, \nunfortunately, and people have a right to be upset with the direction \nwe are heading. And that was one of the reasons I felt compelled to run \nfor the Senate--to come up here and be part of trying to make a \ndifference, be part of putting this country on a track that helps us to \nembrace all the things that make us exceptional and unique and continue \nto make us exceptional and unique.\n  When I look at this dispute, I see two things that are very clear. \nNo. 1, we can't continue to do what we are doing now, and anyone who \nargues we can is\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nnot being realistic and is doing a great disservice to the future of \nour country. It is this simple: You can't have a government that spends \n$1.5 trillion more than it takes in every single year. You can't have a \ngovernment that borrows 40 cents out of every dollar it spends.\n  Look what happened yesterday. Greece was downgraded. They are on the \nverge of being in default. Not Greece--I apologize. It was Ireland. Why \nis that happening in Europe? Why are these countries in trouble? It is \nnot because they refuse to raise their debt limit; it is because people \ndon't think they can pay back the money anymore. The people who lend \nthe money, the people who sell the debt, they are saying: We don't know \nhow you are going to pay us back. Your economy doesn't produce enough \nmoney. You have no plan to bring spending under control. We have lost \nconfidence in you.\n  That is the message being sent to Europe today, and if we keep doing \nwhat we are doing now, that is the message that will be sent here to \nAmerica very soon. The impact that will have not just on our country \nbut on the world is, quite frankly, devastating. That is what we are \nfacing.\n  The fundamental problem is twofold: We have a government that spends \ntoo much money--more money than it takes in--and we have a government \nthat doesn't take in enough money to pay its debts because its economy \nis not growing. That is why I have argued from the days on the campaign \ntrail to when I got elected that the way out of this problem is a two-\npronged approach. You have to do them both.\n  You have to cut spending. We have to have spending cuts and spending \ndiscipline. It doesn't all have to happen overnight, but we have to \nstop spending $1.5 trillion a year of money we do not have. We cannot \ncontinue to do that.\n  That is why I support the cut, cap, and balance plan, because it says \nwe are going to begin to cut spending this year in a real way, we are \ngoing to cap the ability of government to continue to grow its spending \nin future years, and we are going to give the States the right to \nratify a balanced budget amendment for our country that basically says: \nYou cannot spend more money than you take in. States balance their \nbudgets, businesses have to balance their budgets, families have to \nbalance their budgets. If this Federal Government doesn't begin to \nbalance its budget sometime in the near future, we may cross a line \nthat is irreversible and puts us in a place similar to what we are \nseeing in Europe today.\n  So on the spending side, it has to happen. Again, to people who \npretend we can do it overnight, I say: Of course not. It took a long \ntime to get into this predicament, and it will take a while to get out, \nbut we have to start trending in the right direction. It is critically \nimportant that some sort of spending discipline plan be put in place.\n  Look, I know this is a political place. The debate is always framed \nby politics. I, like everyone else here, fully participate in the \npolitical banter. But today, for a moment, I want to step back from \nthat and just say this. Ultimately, I want to see a solution to the \nspending plan. I will welcome that solution whether it comes from the \nWhite House, from the minority leader, or from the majority leader. I \njust want someone to step up and offer a plan that begins to bring \nspending discipline under control. I know I have endorsed one. It is \ncalled the cut, cap, and balance plan. If there is a better way to do \nit, offer it now. What are you waiting for? Now is the time to offer \nit. If someone in this building has a better way to bring spending \nunder control, now is the time to offer it. Don't negotiate in the \nshadows. All these negotiations going on we are hearing about in the \npress--where is the plan? Where is the document that tells us and shows \nus how we can bring spending under control? Now is the time to show it. \nNow is the time to do it. What are you waiting for?\n  That is on the spending side. Spending cuts are important. They are \nessential. We cannot do it without fiscal spending discipline, but that \nis not enough. We also have to grow. We have to grow. That is where the \ncrux of this debate has really gotten to. You hear in the press that \nthis fight is because certain people don't want to raise taxes on \ncertain people. That is really not what this issue is about. I think \neveryone agrees that we need growth, that government needs growth in \nits revenue so it has a way to pay down this debt. The debate is about \nfrom where this revenue comes.\n  Some argue: Well, the way you get more money for government is to \nraise taxes on people--raise taxes on very rich people. I have two \nproblems with that, and neither one is ideological.\n  The first problem is it doesn't work. You can't possibly raise taxes \nhigh enough to collect enough money to make a difference on the debt. I \nlooked at some of the tax increases the President and others have \nproposed. It adds up to less than 10 days of deficit spending. Even if \nyou raise the taxes on what they define as rich to 100 percent next \nyear, it is still not enough money to pay for just 1 year's deficit. So \ntax increases don't work because they don't work. They do not generate \nenough money to do anything.\n  The second reason I can't support tax increases is because it will \nkill jobs. And while this debt is a huge issue--it is very important--\nthe jobs issue is even more important. The No. 1 issue in Washington is \nthe debt--rightfully so because it is a huge, enormous, generational \nissue--but unemployment is the No. 1 issue in America. We are talking \nabout people who have worked hard their entire lives, who went to \nschool and did everything that was asked of them, and now they go out \ninto the job market and they can't find a job. It is especially \nastonishing among young people--25, 30 years of age--who went to \ncollege and got their degrees and now they can't find a job, certainly \nnot in the areas they studied.\n  We have to get that turned around. Every other problem we face in our \ncountry--the housing crisis and all these other problems--becomes \neasier to deal with if you have more people working, people making \nmoney, paying taxes, and spending money in our economy. So unemployment \nis what we have to get at, and we are not going to create jobs by tax \nincreases. If someone in this building, if someone in Washington has a \ntax increase that creates jobs, I invite them to offer it. We are all \nears. If someone in Washington has a tax increase that helps create \njobs, right now is the time to offer it. I would submit we will not \nfind one because there are no tax increases that will create jobs. If \nyou don't create jobs and you don't grow this economy, there is no way \nout of this debt. You can't cut your way out of it, and you certainly \ncan't tax your way out of it.\n  Does that mean we don't do anything about taxes, as I hear some \ncommentators in the press saying? Of course not. Our Tax Code is \nbroken. There are a bunch of things in the Tax Code that do not belong \nthere, and I think there is bipartisan support--whether the media tries \nto ignore it or not--in the Senate, in the House, in Washington for tax \nreform.\n  Tax reform we can get done. Tax reform means we are going to look at \nthe Tax Code, and if there are things in the Tax Code that are there \nbecause somebody hired a lobbyist and got it put in the Tax Code but it \nis not really good policy, it shouldn't be in there. And if we find \nenough of those unfair things in the Tax Code, then we can lower \neverybody's rates. We can make the rates flat, we can make the Tax Code \nsimpler and easier to comply with, and that is what we should aim for \nbecause that is what job creators tell us.\n  I swear to you, I have never met a job creator who told me they are \nlooking for a State with high taxes and burdensome regulations. I have \nnever met one. There may be one, but I invite anyone here in \nWashington, DC, to produce for us a job creator--a company or an \nindividual--who says that what they are looking for is to open a \nbusiness someplace where the taxes are high and difficult to understand \nand the regulations are expensive to comply with. And that is what we \nhave in America. You want to know why jobs aren't being created. \nBecause that is what we have in America. So if someone knows of a job \ncreator anywhere in the world who is looking for a high, complex tax \nenvironment or looking for a high regulatory environment, I would like \nto meet them because I have yet to meet a job creator who is looking \nfor that, and that is what we have.\n  I will submit to you that there is bipartisan support for the idea of \ntax reform, of simplifying our Tax Code and\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\nmaking it easier to comply with, of--if we do it the right way--\nlowering everybody's tax rates so that people have more money in their \npockets to spend into the economy and grow their business or to start a \nnew business because that is how jobs are created.\n  I know all of us would like to think that Senators and Presidents \ncreate jobs but not outside this building they do not. Jobs are created \nwhen everyday people from all walks of life decide, you know what, \ntoday I am going to open a business and operate from the spare bedroom \nof my home or out of the garage or when somebody has an existing \nbusiness and decides: I want to grow this business, so I am going to \nhire a couple more people because I have a belief this business can do \nbetter.\n  We need to get people excited about doing that again, and we are not \ngoing to get them excited about doing that again if our taxes and our \nregulations are out of control. So let's begin to focus with regard to \nthis debt limit on some of the things that there has to be agreement \non, and there are two things: We must control our spending, and we must \nput a plan in place that shows the world how America will bring its \nspending under control, and we have to do something to grow our \neconomy.\n  Ask any job creator in the real world, What are you looking for to \ngrow and create jobs? They will tell you, We are looking for \nconfidence. And we get confidence from knowing that regulations are \npredictable and easy to comply with, and the Tax Code is predictable, \naffordable, and easy to comply with.\n  I submit that if we focused on that and not all the other noise that \ngoes on in the back and forth of this place, we can actually start \nmoving toward a solution.\n  The last point I would make is the word ``compromise'' is a very \npopular word around here, and there is nothing wrong with compromise, \nso long as the compromise also happens to be a solution. Because if \nyour compromise doesn't solve the problem, you have created a new \nproblem.\n  There is nothing wrong with compromise. Maybe your ideas of tax \nreform are different than my ideas of tax reform, but ultimately we \nhave to solve the broken Tax Code. So compromise is not a dirty word, \nunless the compromise makes it worse, not better. Too often in politics \ncompromise leads to things that make things worse, not better. If you \nraise taxes in this economy, with 9 percent unemployment, you are going \nto make things worse, not better.\n  I hope we will rally in a bipartisan fashion around the concept of \ntax reform, of creating a Tax Code in America that encourages people to \ncreate jobs here once again, because if we can solve the jobs issue, if \nwe can begin to solve the unemployment issue, all these other issues we \nface as a nation become easier to face.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your attention and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are getting dangerously close to the \nAugust 2 deadline. The August 2 deadline is the deadline for America to \nincrease its debt limit or to face default on our obligations. We need \nto come together. We need to increase the debt limit, and this is an \nopportunity for us also to manage our debt.\n  We have been talking about this for a while, and I understand--and I \nthink my colleagues understand--the responsible thing for us to do is \nto use this opportunity to increase the debt limit to also craft a game \nplan to manage our national debt and our spending. We need to have a \ncredible plan. Our debt is not sustainable. We cannot continue along \nthis path. We understand that. We have to have a credible plan to \nmanage our deficit. Well, quite frankly, the Democrats have come up \nwith these plans.\n  The proposal offered by Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--and supported by all the Democrats on the Budget Committee, \nand I am proud to be a member of that committee--brings forward a \ncredible proposal that has all the elements of our budget on the \ntable. It reduces government spending. It deals with protecting the \npriorities that are important for America's growth. It invests in \neducation. It invests in innovation and in infrastructure so we can \ncreate the jobs necessary for America's prosperity. That is what that \nbudget does. It brings about more deficit reduction than the Republican \nbudget, bringing our debt under control.\n\n  We understand we need a bipartisan budget. It is not going to be just \nwhat the Democrats want. That is what the political process is all \nabout. Midterm elections: The House is controlled by Republicans. The \nSenate has a Democratic majority. We have to come together.\n  What many of us have said in this body is let's use the bipartisan \nBowles-Simpson proposal as a starting point. That has all the elements \non the table, including mandatory spending and including doing a better \njob on revenues. It is a bipartisan proposal. Democrats have said we \nare willing to work and come out with what we call the grand deal--the \ndeal that will manage our debt and all elements of the Federal budget \nwill be on the table as we talk about that.\n  But there is one option that should not be on the table, and that \noption is to allow August 2 to pass without increasing the debt limit; \nin other words, to permit America to default on its obligations. That \nis one option that cannot be on the table. Quite frankly, what concerns \nme is there seems to be a growing number of Republicans who say that is \nan option; that is OK; it will be all right for us to pass August 2 \nwithout increasing the debt limit.\n  Let me quote, if I might, from David Brooks, the conservative \ncolumnist, who said:\n\n       . . . the Republican Party may no longer be a normal party. \n     Over the past few years, it has been infected by a faction \n     that is more of a psychological protest than a practical, \n     governing alternative. The members of this movement do not \n     accept the logic of compromise, no matter how sweet the \n     terms. If you ask them to raise taxes by an inch in order to \n     cut government by a foot, they will say no. If you ask them \n     to raise taxes by an inch to cut government by a yard, they \n     will still say no.\n       The members of this movement do not accept the legitimacy \n     of scholars or intellectual authorities. A thousand impartial \n     experts may tell them that a default on the debt would have \n     calamitous effects, far worse than raising revenues a bit. \n     But the members of this movement refuse to believe it.\n\n  I know the majority leader in the House of Representatives, Mr. \nCantor, tells us there is no compromise that can pass at the present \ntime in the House of Representatives. I don't accept that. I think \nDemocrats and Republicans working together in the House can pass a \ngrand deal under the parameters that have been talked about at the \nWhite House. But what Mr. Cantor needs to do is work with the Democrats \nas well as the Republicans in the House of Representatives. We have to \ncome together, Democrats and Republicans.\n  The one part of the option that should not be on the table is to \nallow us to pass August 2 without raising the debt limit. Let me talk \nabout the consequences. I have said I believe they are catastrophic \nconsequences, and I do believe that. We know it is likely--almost \ncertain--that the rating houses will downgrade America's currency from \nthe most secure currency in the world. We would be downgraded. We run a \nreal risk as to whether the dollar will continue to be the global \ncurrency. Right now, many international transactions are related in \ndollars. We know that as it relates to energy. All of a sudden, on \nAugust 3, we run the risk that the American dollar will no longer be \nthe global currency, having a major impact on the U.S. economy.\n  J.P. Morgan tells us we could expect an immediate increase in \ninterest costs of 75 to 100 basis points. What does that mean? Well, \nfor the taxpayers of this country, it means it is going to cost\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nmore money for us to pay for our borrowing. That will raise the cost of \ninterest payments which I would suggest is a not very productive use of \ntaxpayer dollars, causing taxpayers to have to pay more for our \nborrowing. But it goes well beyond the Federal taxpayers. It affects \nevery family in America. The estimates are that the effect of the \nincrease in U.S. obligations on interest rates will have an effect on \nall borrowing. So if a person is buying a home, they can expect the \ninterest costs will increase by about $1,000 a year. If a person is a \ncredit card holder, they can expect their interest rates to go up about \n$250 a year. That is the effect it is going to have on every American \nfamily if we pass August 2 without increasing our debt limit.\n  If a person has money in the stock market, they can expect there will \nbe a reduction in the value of their wealth. We saw that happen once \nbefore when retirement account values slipped dramatically. We are at \nrisk of having that happen again if we pass August 2 without increasing \nthe debt limit.\n  The impact it will have on our economy, on jobs--we expect it will \nclearly have a negative impact on our job market. We will lose jobs and \nwe very well may go back into a recession. That is why this is \ncatastrophic if we don't deal with the debt limit in a mature way.\n  Let me cite the numbers. In the month of August, we expect we are \ngoing to have about $172 billion of revenue coming into our Treasury, \nbut we are going to have $360 billion of bills coming in--spending we \nhave already incurred that we have to pay for. There are those who say \nwe can pick which bills we want to pay and let the others go. They say \nwe will have some winners and losers. Well, I think we will have all \nlosers, because we can't pick winners and losers.\n  There are some who say, well, obviously, we will pay interest on the \nnational debt. OK, we will pay that. How about Social Security, and how \nlong can we pay Social Security? If we don't pay Social Security, what \nhappens to those on fixed incomes or, if we reduce the Social Security \npayments, how does someone who has planned their monthly budget manage \nwith getting, say, 40 percent less of their Social Security in August? \nHow do they handle their obligations?\n  Then what do we do about Medicare? Do we continue to pay Medicare at \n100 percent? Well, I assume we are going to run out of money.\n  What do we do about our military, our soldiers, who we all say we \nwant to support? Do we continue their salaries or do we reduce their \namounts by, say, 40 percent? If we pay all of those, there is no money \nleft over to pay veterans' benefits. What happens to our veterans who \nare depending on their checks to be able to meet their obligations?\n  Then what do we tell our students who are preparing to go to school \nin the fall about their Pell grants, that their Pell grants aren't \ngoing to be available and maybe they can't go to school in the fall? \nThey have to make plans right now.\n  What do we do about small business owners who are depending upon \ntheir contracts with the Federal Government in order to make their \npayroll? Is their money going to be coming in on August 3? We can't pay \nthose bills unless we raise the debt limit. It has nothing to do with \nincreased obligations of this country; we are talking about spending we \nhave already incurred, that has already been obligated, and now the \npeople who are entitled to the money are asking for their checks. What \ndo we do on August 3?\n  I don't believe we have a choice. I think we must increase the debt \nlimit. I don't think it is an option not to. No responsible legislator \nwould consider that to be an option.\n  Yes, let's use that opportunity to manage our deficit. I still hold \nout hope we can get this grand deal. It has to be fair. It has to be \nbalanced. It has to allow America to grow and it has to allow us to \ncreate more jobs. It has to invest in education and innovation and \ninfrastructure so America can compete. We know we can get that done if \nwe use a balanced approach: Reduce government spending at all levels, \nincluding the military, as we bring our troops home from Afghanistan. \nYes, we need to look at the money we spend through our Tax Code. We \nhave talked about this over and over. We need to have a balanced \napproach, a credible approach, to manage our debt. That should be our \nfirst option. But under no circumstances should we allow America to \ndefault on its obligations, causing harm to every American family.\n  I urge my colleagues to put the national interests first and to take \noff the table the default on our debt. Take that off the table. Let's \nput the national interests first and work together to bring about a \ncredible plan to manage our national debt.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this morning's Wall Street Journal has a \nheadline which I hope America will pay close attention to: ``Raters put \nU.S. on notice.'' The United States of America has a credit rating, \nmuch as we do as individuals, businesses, and families. The credit \nrating of the United States is AAA, the very best.\n  What does it mean? It means two things. First, that those who do \nbusiness with America think it is the best place to do business--the \nmost reliable economy, the rule of law, transparency. It says good \nthings about America. It translates into the lowest interest rates \ncharged when America borrows money. That is a good thing because we \nborrow a lot of money.\n  This AAA rating, of course, is something that is not guaranteed. You \nhave to work for it. Countries around the world now, particularly in \nEurope, are struggling and failing economically, some in worse shape \nthan others. In the Irish Times yesterday they referred to what they \ncalled the ``PIGS''. I had never seen that term before. It refers to \nPortugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain. They said this week Italy was \njoining the PIGS, the seventh largest economy in the world, roiling in \neuro debt, being called on to transform and change their economies and \ntheir government to deal with their national debt.\n  It is a tough time in the European Union, and the jury is still out \nabout any one of those countries and how this will end. The United \nStates is not in that situation, thank goodness. Our economy has its \nproblems. We know that: 9.2 percent of our workforce is unemployed, a \nsituation where many small businesses are still struggling, where \nfamilies struggle, many of them paycheck to paycheck, to get by. But \nstill, the fact that we have to guard our borders to keep people from \ncoming here is an indication of what America's promise means to the \nrest of the world.\n  This notice from the rating agencies that now we are on a watch, a \ncredit watch, as to whether our AAA credit rating in America should be \ndiminished\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nis serious. Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner meets with us when we go \ndown to the White House to talk about the current negotiation over the \ndebt ceiling. What he told us yesterday was that this rating is the \nproduct of two things: First, there is no clear path available to \nindicate that Congress is able to extend the debt ceiling of the United \nStates on August 2; and, secondly, there is no clear indication that \nCongress and the President are working together to deal with our \nnational deficit. Because of that, Secretary Geithner said this rating \nhas come out, and that is the reality of what we face.\n  First, a word about the debt ceiling. What is it? Most people do not \nknow, and it is understandable because it does not get much attention, \nalthough it has been around a long time. The debt ceiling was created \nin 1939. It was created because Congress decided they did not want to \nvote every time we issued a national bond or some other note. We would \nrather give our Department of Treasury the authority to issue debt \nobligations up to a certain dollar level. As the debt of the United \nStates increased and the need to borrow increased, that level increased \nas well. Between 1993 and today, we have extended the debt ceiling in \nAmerica 89 times, 55 times under Republican Presidents, 34 times under \nDemocratic Presidents, and virtually without notice. Who is the No. 1 \nPresident in the history of the United States to extend the debt \nceiling and to increase America's debt? Ronald Reagan, far and away. He \ndid it 18 times, and during the course of his 8 years in office, raised \nthe national debt ceiling by 199 percent.\n  Then you go to the next President, who raised it 90 percent in debt, \nPresident George W. Bush. So it is a bipartisan undertaking. What it \nmeans is that when needed, the Congress of the United States authorizes \nthe President to borrow the money necessary to cover what we have spent \nin appropriations from Congress, in our entitlement and mandatory \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, and the like--we have to borrow \nmoney.\n  In fact, we borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend in Washington for \neverything--40 cents for every $1. So we are looking to the people to \nloan us money on a regular basis. The No. 1 one creditor of the United \nStates, among countries, is China--ironic--our No. 1 creditor, our No. \n1 competitor. An interesting relationship.\n  The debt ceiling comes due August 2. As it has been routinely \nextended time and time again, this time is different. The House \nRepublican leadership has said: We refuse to vote to extend the debt \nceiling of the United States unless we see deficit reduction. What \nwould happen if we did not extend the debt ceiling?\n  What would happen if you did not make your mortgage payment? I think \nI would know what would happen to Loretta and me in Springfield, IL. We \nmight hear from our bank, and our bank might say: Mr. Durbin, you know, \nthe month of July has come and gone and you did not pay your mortgage \non your home in Springfield. What is up?\n  If you said: I am just not going to pay it this month, they would \nsay: That is not what you signed up for. You signed up to meet your \nobligation. So if you do not pay it, you face foreclosure.\n  But in the meantime, what have you done, what my family would have \ndone under those circumstances, is to jeopardize our credit rating. The \nnext time my family would want to borrow money for a home, the bank \nwould say: I am not sure you are such a good risk. You have missed your \nmortgage payment or, if they loaned us money, it would be at a higher \ninterest rate.\n  That is the reality of what happens if you do not extend the debt \nceiling. This situation when it comes to America is grave. It is not \njust about America paying a higher interest rate to borrow money, it is \nabout the interest rate across our country being affected. Down at the \nFederal Reserve, Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors are doing everything in their power to keep interest rates \nlow because we want businesses to expand, to be profitable, and to hire \npeople.\n  When interest rate costs go up, businesses find it more expensive to \nborrow and borrow less. Individual families find it more difficult to \nbuy the car, the home, the appliances they might need. So with interest \nrates going up as a result of our failure to extend the debt ceiling, \nwe are doing exactly the opposite of what the American economy needs \ntoday. That is why it is so serious. In fact, it could be catastrophic. \nIn a few minutes, we are going to hear from Treasury Secretary Tim \nGeithner, who is going to come before us and talk about the impact of \nfailure to extend the debt ceiling.\n  What we are doing in the White House today is negotiating with \nleaders of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, and the President to \nextend the debt ceiling because many of us believe it would be \ndisastrous. If we would default on our debt, we call into question the \nfull faith and credit of the United States of America. At the end of \nthe day, we would find ourselves with a self-inflicted wound to the \nAmerican economy: raising interest rates and making it more difficult \nto come out of this recession.\n  We are trying to reach an agreement, and it has been hard going. We \nhave had five face-to-face meetings in the White House so far. \nYesterday's was reported in the news as contentious, and it was. The \nPresident has said he believes our first obligation is to get the \nAmerican economy back on track and Americans back to work. We should \nnot do anything in the course of our business that would make that more \ndifficult. I could not agree with him more.\n  The highest priority in America is putting Americans back to work in \ngood-paying jobs right here at home. The highest priority in America is \nallowing small businesses to expand, to do more business, and hire more \npeople. That is what we ought to be about. If we fail to extend the \ndebt ceiling, it makes it more difficult to reach those goals.\n  I listened as Presidential candidates of the other party in Iowa say: \nIt does not matter. Default on the debt. Let's see what happens. That \nis the most--let me think of a good word here--naive comment on our \neconomy I can imagine. The people who are making it have no business \naspiring to the highest office in the land. We need to accept this \nresponsibility and deal with this debt ceiling honestly. We need to \nextend it so there is no question about the credit rating--the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America.\n\n  Secondly, we need to get serious about this deficit. I know the \noccupant of the chair has strong personal feelings about this. She has \nintroduced legislation dealing with this deficit and how we can cope \nwith it in the Senate and in the House. I have been part of the \nPresident's deficit commission. I have been engaged with colleagues of \nboth political parties on how to take it further. Our goal is, very \nsimply stated, I believe and those who are engaged in these \nconversations believe we can reduce the debt of the United States by up \nto $4 trillion over the next 10 years. We can do it in a sensible, \nthoughtful way, with shared sacrifice across America.\n  We need to put everything--and I underline the word ``everything''--\non the table. Spending programs are the start. We should go to them and \nroot out what we consider to be wasteful, unnecessary, fraudulent, and \nabusive practices in our spending, whether it is in the Department of \nDefense or any other agency of government.\n  When the Department of Defense came before the Bowles-Simpson \ncommission, we asked them how many private contractors work for the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Their answer: We have no idea.\n  We said: Give us a range.\n  They said: The range is somewhere between 1 million and 9 million \npeople working for the Department of Defense--maybe.\n  That is unacceptable. We can do better. Our brave men and women in \nuniform deserve better, and so do the American taxpayers.\n  We must put all spending on the table, reducing spending where we \ncan, where we must, to move toward $4 trillion in deficit reduction. \nThen we need to put entitlement programs on the table. This is where \nmany Democrats get nervous because you are talking about things that \nmean a lot to us--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, for example. \nI am as committed to those programs as any Member of the Senate. I \nbelieve we can protect the\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nbasic benefits under those programs and still find ways to make them \nstronger and longer.\n  Social Security, untouched, will make every promised payment, with \ncost-of-living adjustments, for the next 25 years. You can't say that \nabout much in Washington. You can't say that about any program other \nthan Social Security. We can do better by making minor, small changes \nin Social Security today and putting the savings back into Social \nSecurity, and then we can say it will last 75 years, which means \neverybody going into the workplace, starting their work career in \nAmerica, will know they can count on Social Security to be there when \nthey need it. That is an attainable goal, and if we face it honestly, \nwe can do it.\n  When I was elected in 1982 and came to office in 1983, we were facing \nbankruptcy in Social Security. We came together with a bipartisan \napproach and passed it. We bought literally 52 years of solvency for \nSocial Security, and not a single Member lost the next election because \nwe did it in a bipartisan fashion, determined to make Social Security \nstronger. We can do it again.\n  Medicare--same story. Medicare, of course, provides health care for \nthe elderly and disabled in America. It is extremely expensive because \nhealth care costs keep going up. Are there ways to reduce the costs of \nMedicare so that the people who are deserving of care--seniors and the \ndisabled--will have it available to them?\n  On January 1 of this year, 9,000 Americans turned the age of 65; on \nJanuary 2, another 9,000; and then every day since--every day for the \nnext 19 years. The boomers have arrived. They have paid into Medicare \nand Social Security their entire lives, and they expect America to keep \nits promise. And we will. But we can look at Medicare and find ways to \nmake that program more cost-efficient. There are certainly ways that \nare obvious.\n  Under the Medicare prescription drug program, we currently don't have \na Medicare option. All we have is private health insurance company \noptions. Let Medicare bargain with pharmaceutical companies to buy in \nbulk and bring down the cost of drugs for seniors, thus reducing their \nout-of-pocket costs and our costs as taxpayers. The pharmaceutical \nindustry hates that the way the Devil hates holy water. The fact is \nthat when you put Medicare in there, like the Veterans' Administration \nis in there, it can make a difference.\n  We need to include spending, entitlements, and revenue. I hope we can \ndo it on a bipartisan basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4577-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I am pleased to present \nthe fiscal year 2012 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill to the Senate. The bill was \nunanimously reported out of the committee on June 30. It is a fiscally \ndisciplined and bipartisan measure, and I hope all Senators will \nsupport it.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Kirk, for his contributions in \ncrafting this bill. He has taken a very active role on the \nsubcommittee, and it has been a pleasure to work with him. I also thank \nChairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran, as well as Leader Reid and \nMinority Leader McConnell for their support and assistance in moving \nthis bill forward.\n  The MILCON-VA appropriations bill provides crucial investments in \ninfrastructure for our military, including barracks and family housing, \nmission critical training and operational facilities, schools and \nhospitals, and childcare and family support centers. It also fulfills \nthe Nation's promise to our vets by providing the resources needed for \ntheir medical care and benefits.\n  Madam President, the bill before the Senate today totals $142 \nbillion, of which $72.5 billion is discretionary funding. We are all \nmindful of the severe economic problems facing this Nation, and this \nbill reflects that reality. It is $1.25 billion below the budget \nrequest and $618 million below the fiscal year 2011 enacted level. I \ncan assure my colleagues there are no congressional earmarks in the \nbill.\n  As always, protecting essential benefits and health care for veterans \ntops my list of priorities. With an aging population of veterans \nrequiring increased services, and a surge of combat veterans from the \nIraq and Afghanistan wars entering the system, the demand for VA health \ncare services has increased dramatically in recent years. The number of \nIraq and Afghanistan veterans in the VA health care system will exceed \nhalf a million in 2012, a 106-percent increase since 2008.\n  The sluggish economy is exacerbating the pressure on the VA as more \nand more out of work or underemployed veterans turn to the VA for their \nhealth care.\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\n  This bill provides $58.6 billion for VA discretionary funding, $2.3 \nbillion over current funding. Nearly 90 percent of the funding--$50.6 \nbillion--is for veterans health care. The bill also includes $52.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 2013 advance appropriations for veterans medical \ncare.\n  The bill includes $2.9 billion, as requested, to meet the health care \nneeds of veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, a $594 \nmillion increase over the current funding. This funding includes \nresearch and treatment programs for mental health issues, including \ntraumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  One of the very few areas in which the bill provides an increase in \nfunding is VA medical research, which is funded at $581 million, $72 \nmillion over the budget request, to restore funding to the current \nlevel. This program funds a broad array of vital research efforts \nincluding mental health, spinal cord injury, burn treatment, polytrauma \ninjuries, and sensory loss.\n  The bill includes $4.9 billion for health care and support services \nfor homeless veterans. Ending homelessness among veterans is a top \npriority of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, and it is a goal fully \nsupported by the committee. As a result of programs the Secretary has \ninstituted, and the robust funding provided in recent MilCon/VA bills \nto implement them, the average number of homeless veterans on any given \nnight has dropped from 195,000 6 years ago to 75,600 this year. The \nfunding in this bill provides the resources to continue to make headway \non this very important initiative.\n  As a Senator from a rural State, I am pleased to report that the bill \nalso includes $250 million for programs, such as mobile clinics and \ntelemedicine services, to support rural and Native American veterans. \nThis continues the rural health initiative that I initiated in the \nfiscal year 2009 MilCon/VA bill, and reflects the importance that both \nCongress and the VA place on meeting the needs of veterans who live in \nrural areas and must often travel hundreds of miles for treatment at a \nVA facility.\n  The bill also includes $52 million for collaborative efforts with the \nIndian Health Service to ensure that Native American veterans receive \nthe care that they have earned. I am encouraged by this funding and by \nthe fact that the VA created an Office of Tribal Government Relations \nearlier this year to expand outreach to American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians. Access to health care among Native \nAmericans is a major problem in South Dakota and other rural States, \nand I believe that collaboration between the VA and the Indian Health \nService is essential to leverage the resources and services of both \nagencies.\n  Information technology, or IT, represents another important \ninvestment in this bill. The bill provides the full $3.2 billion as \nrequested in the budget to develop electronic health care records, \npaperless claims systems, and seamless integration of medical and \nservice records with the Defense Department. Secretary Shinseki and \nformer Defense Secretary Robert Gates worked very closely over the past \nyear to develop a framework for implementing a joint VA-DOD electronic \nhealth care record system. Their leadership and determination to \novercome bureaucratic hurdles to a find a joint electronic solution to \nthe current maze of paperwork involved in transferring health records \nfrom DOD to VA was key to making progress on this long-stalled effort.\n  The Secretaries have announced that the Departments have agreed to \npursue a number of integrated development approaches including the \ndecision to share common data centers and to utilize open source \nsoftware development. I hope that implementing a joint electronic \nhealth record system remains a top priority for Secretary Panetta as he \nassumes the leadership of the Defense Department.\n  There are several other notable VA programs funded in this bill, \nincluding $270 million for women's veterans programs, $6.9 billion for \nlong term care for veterans, and $112 million for the VA Inspector \nGeneral's Office. Each of these programs meets an emerging requirement \nfor the VA.\n  As more and more women join the ranks of America's veterans entitled \nto VA health care, their unique needs require a reevaluation and \nreemphasis of services offered in VA clinics and hospitals.\n  Long-term care for veterans is also emerging as a mounting need for \nveterans, including both the growing population of aging veterans as \nwell as severely wounded veterans from the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  With the growth and complexity of VA services, it is essential to \nmaintain vigilant oversight of VA programs. The committee, therefore, \nhas provided $112 million for the Office of Inspector General, $3 \nmillion over the budget request, to support robust oversight by the \ninspector general.\n  The bill also provides the full budget request for both major and \nminor construction as well as the full advance appropriation request \nfor medical facilities. However, I have deep concerns about the VA's \nbudget request in all three areas. With this year's budget submission, \nthe Department also transmitted its 10-year Strategic Capital \nInvestment Plan. The plan identifies a requirement of between $53 \nbillion and $65 billion over the next decade to address critical \ninfrastructure needs. Yet, the combined request for both major and \nminor construction is $400.8 million below the fiscal year 2011 enacted \nlevel. Additionally, the advance request for medical facilities \nincludes $600.2 million for nonrecurring maintenance at existing \nclinics and hospitals, a $510 million decrease from what is being spent \nthis year.\n  While I understand that the budget crisis facing the country requires \nsacrifice and belt tightening from all sectors, funding decreases of \nthis magnitude given the requirements and the age of VA facilities is \nalarming. I urge the Department to develop and submit a comprehensive \nplan with next year's budget submission identifying specific ways in \nwhich to adequately finance VA's infrastructure needs.\n  In addition to the above mentioned items, the budget submission \nincluded a request to establish a $953 million contingency fund to be \navailable for medical care if a larger than expected number of veterans \nturns to the VA for health care as a result of the lagging economy. The \ncontingency fund was to be composed of carryover funds already \navailable to the VA as a result of the Federal pay freeze plus $240 \nmillion in fiscal year 12 funding.\n  Instead of creating a loosely defined contingency fund based on an \nuntested projection of the VA's standard modeling formula, the \ncommittee has directed the Department to use $664 million in carryover \nfunds made available by the Federal pay freeze, as well as additional \ncarryover funds projected to reach $500 million by the end of fiscal \nyear 12, to address this contingency, should it arise.\n  With little room to maneuver on the VA side of the ledger, the vast \nmajority of the savings in the bill comes from incrementing or \ndeferring funding for certain military construction projects. The bill \nprovides $13.7 billion for military construction, $1 billion below the \nrequest. The MilCon reductions in the bill are restricted to the active \nduty components. The Guard and Reserve components, Family Housing, BRAC \nand other accounts are fully funded at the President's request.\n  The MilCon portion of this bill mirrors the Senate Defense \nauthorization bill, which was unanimously reported out of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on June 16. Every military construction \nproject funded in this bill is authorized in the authorization bill. In \nfact, if you do the math, 52 Senators in this Chamber have already \nvoted in favor of the MilCon portion of this bill.\n  Because of the constrained budget environment, the bill does not \nprovide any increase in funding for military construction projects. \nSeveral Senators urged the committee to provide additional funding for \nsuch things as Army Guard readiness centers or various unfunded \nrequirements of the services. In normal times, the committee would \nwholeheartedly support these efforts, but given the austere budget \ncircumstances, there was simply no money to fund these initiatives.\n  In addition to MilCon and VA, the bill includes $221 million for \nseveral related agencies, including $77 million for the American Battle \nMonuments Commission as requested; $45.8 million for Arlington National \nCemetery as requested, and $67.7 million for the Armed Forces \nRetirement Home as requested. The bill also provides $30.8 million for \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\nfor Veterans Claims, which is $25 million below the request. The \nreduction reflects the committee's decision to defer funding for a \nproposed courthouse for the Court until uncertainties surrounding the \ncost and location of the project can be resolved.\n  Madam President, I again thank my ranking member for his support in \ncrafting this bill. I also thank the staff of the subcommittee--\nChristina Evans, Chad Schulken and Andy Vanlandingham of my staff; \nDennis Balkham and D'Ann Letteri of the minority staff, and former \nminority staffer Ben Hammond--for their months of hard work and \ncooperative effort to produce this bill.\n  Again, this is a well-balanced and bipartisan bill. It provides \nresources vital to the well being of our troops and their families, and \nto the millions of veterans who have served and sacrificed for their \nNation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield the \nFloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I first came to Capitol Hill in 1984 \nduring Ronald Reagan's first term. I believe it was Chairman Hatfield \nrunning the committee on the Senate side and Jamie Whitten on the House \nside. I care very much about the appropriations process and the \nAppropriations Committee because I think we spend less with a higher \ndegree of transparency when we consider appropriations bills in regular \norder, as this one now is.\n  This bill funds our veterans programs and our military construction \nneeds mainly for the Active-Duty and Reserve Americans who wear the \nuniform--or wore the uniform--upon which all of our freedoms and the \nindependence of our country depends. Today, there are over 20 million \nveterans, and this bill cares for them in a bipartisan way. We owe \nthese veterans just about everything--for our independence and \nfreedom--and this bill cares for them.\n  Now, why, in this difficult and partisan time, is this bill coming up \nin this way? Why is it that we have every Republican on the \nsubcommittee and the full committee in favor of this legislation? It is \nbecause the chairman made the decision, that I strongly supported, to \nmark to the House level. When we marked to the House level, we opened \nthe door for full bipartisan support for this needed bill.\n  We present to the Senate this bill for full consideration, taking \ninto account all of the requests of Members in their budget submission. \nBut let me emphasize that not only are we slightly below the House \nspending level in discretionary budget authority, there are no earmarks \nin this bill, reflecting the new wave of reform that has come to the \nAppropriations Committee--both the House and the Senate.\n  We have made a tough set of spending decisions in this bill. We have \ncome in $1.2 billion below President Obama's spending request. We came \nin $620 million below last year's level. I was a bit surprised we were \nable to do this--and that we did--but we are even $2.6 million below \nthe House Republican-approved level in the bill put together by \nChairman Culberson.\n  This bill spends in discretionary budget authority less than the \nHouse of Representatives, and I will just point out that when the House \ntook up this legislation, over 400 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives--Republicans and Democrats--supported this legislation, \nand only five Members of the House voted against this legislation. That \nis why this legislation enjoys such tremendous bipartisan support on \nour side.\n  This bill would not be possible without the outstanding work of \nChairman Johnson and his staff, his military experience and, most \nimportantly, his son's military experience. On behalf of the veterans \nof his State, he has done a very good job, with my full support. We \ntake care of our veterans and their benefits, their health care, and \nthe construction of medical facilities in this legislation.\n  Madam President, many veterans live in urban areas, but also a great \nmany live in rural and even highly rural areas. This bill pays \nattention to their needs thanks to the chairman, and also I want to \nhighlight the work of the Senator from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, in the \ndecisions we made in this bill to make sure veterans who live in the \nState of Alaska will not, in many cases now, need to leave the State \nfor their veterans care.\n  We have also worked diligently with our veterans service \norganizations, and I would highlight this bill has now been endorsed by \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, by AMVETS, by the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America. I take the last endorsement very seriously, \nhaving, as a reservist, served in Afghanistan myself.\n  Chairman Johnson highlighted the funding levels in this bill, which I \nthink are quite important, but I would also like to highlight several \npolicy issues in this bill. No. 1, originally, the administration--our \ncommander in South Korea--put forward an idea to bring almost 50,000 \nAmerican dependents to South Korea to build homes and hospitals and \nschools. But the cost could be upwards of over $20 billion to transfer \nthat many Americans to the Korean peninsula.\n  Given this time of deficits and debt, and given this enormous bill, I \nthink DOD is rethinking this proposal, as they wisely should. I think \nthis bill lays out a set of concerns over where we go with such a \nspending decision.\n  With regard to Guantanamo--very important to me--originally there was \na proposal to transfer the al-Qaida core of terrorists to my State, to \nThompson, IL. This bill wisely concludes the overwhelming bipartisan \nprovision prohibiting the construction or renovation of any facility in \nthe United States or its territories for individuals detained at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  With regard to Guam, while the Navy is attempting to move more than \n17,000 marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam, the plan that \nChairman Johnson and I have seen has serious problems. Therefore, there \nare no projects in this bill associated with this very complicated \nmove.\n  We did fund the Air Force request for projects related to the Strike \ncapability for the bed down of Strike and intelligence capabilities, \nbut the rest we are looking for further information.\n  Also, with regard to our military infrastructure in Germany, we \nbelieve there is a better need for accounting of funds that we provide \nfor facilities, and, as a result, we cut about $37 million from the \nrequested projects.\n  With regard to charter schools and improving education for our \nmilitary families, we think the children of servicemembers have a \nunique situation and fewer choices when choosing schools. So we have \nasked the Department of Defense to conduct a study and tell this \ncommittee where charter schools could make a positive difference.\n  I will highlight here my work with my fellow Senator, Mr. Durbin, on \npotential charter school operations serving the men and women and the \nfamilies of the Great Lakes community in northern Illinois.\n  I raise the one particular issue important to me, which is that over \ntime we are planning on spending upwards of $20 billion, as we should, \non the new facilities for Guam. But I think if we are going to make \nthat kind of investment in Guam, we need to make sure those facilities \nare there when the United States needs them most in a military \ncapacity, which is during combat. That is why it is so essential to \nprovide also for the missile defense of Guam, and, I would say, for the \nmissile defense of Guam on platforms that cannot be sunk. That is why \nwe are calling on the Department of Defense not to ignore plans to \nprovide for the missile defense of Guam, and, I would say to emphasize, \na land-based solution that is more survivable.\n  We also highlighted more scrutiny on the budget request, especially \nwith regard to funding for general officers quarters. I will say that \nin my review, along with the chairman, we saw a disciplined budget \nrequest largely by the Air Force and the Navy to house our Air Force \ngenerals and admirals; but I have been disappointed with the Army, \nwhich originally came forward with a request for $1.4 million to \nupgrade a general's garden in Germany. Luckily, the Army has pulled \nback that request, and we are looking for further scrutiny to make sure \nthat general officer quarters budget requests are in line with the \npractice of the sister services of the Air Force and the Navy.\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\n  This bill also handles issues with regard to the VA, especially on \ninformation technology. This bill fully funds the account and \nencourages the Department to pursue open-source, off-the-shelf \ntechnology for electronic health records, and I think that is critical \nto maintaining cost containment as we go forward.\n  I will also say we have been urging the Department of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs to come up with one common electronic medical record. \nThe vision here is that when an American joins the U.S. military, that \nrecord then follows that servicemember through, at minimum, for \nexample, a 3-year enlistment, and then a 60-year to 90-year time as a \nveteran. It should be a common record. I hope the two Secretaries, \nPanetta and Shinseki, move to finally make sure that becomes a reality.\n  With regard to the contingency fund in this bill, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs requested a contingency fund in the event they needed \nadditional funds. We do not support establishing this fund but did \nallow the Department to keep $664 million it received last year in \nadvance appropriations for the now-prohibited pay raises. This should \nbe adequate to ensure our veterans are not only cared for but will give \nthe VA some flexibility during the period of conflict in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  This bill also emphasizes caregivers who give care to our wounded \nveterans, veterans who live in rural areas, and veterans who are sent \nto facilities a long distance from their home, as I mentioned, in the \nState of Alaska. We also highlighted the issue of claims processing so \nour veterans could finally receive the compensation they deserve in a \nreasonable amount of time.\n  I want to echo the chairman's thanks to the staff, especially led by \nTina Evans on the Democratic side and Dennis Balkham on the Republican \nside.\n  In short, this is a very good bill. It represents the Senate moving \nforward under regular order. It represents greater transparency to the \nappropriations process.\n  I would highlight, we have cut or reduced funding in 24 separate \nmajor areas, and these were hard choices to make. We did them in line \nwith the decisions made by the authorizing committee under Chairmen \nLevin and McCain's leadership. We also completely denied funding for a \nproposed brandnew building to house the Court of Veterans Appeals. In \nthis time of deficit and debt, I think we should hold off.\n  In sum, this bill represents cooperation between Republicans and \nDemocrats. This bill represents budget control and cooperation between \nHouse and Senate. This bill represents cooperation and coordination \nbetween the authorizing Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee, and this bill, underlined with the endorsement of major \nveterans service organizations, represents a commitment to our \nveterans.\n  I think we should move forward. I know later we will consider a point \nof order with regard to not taking up a bill prior to the adoption of a \nformal budget. I would hope that common sense would prevail here; that \nbecause this is one of those rare measures where we are marking up to \nthe House level that only five Members of the House voted against at \nthat level, that all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats on the \nsubcommittee voted for this legislation, and yesterday 89 Members voted \nin overwhelming bipartisan fashion for cloture to bring this bill up so \nwe can get the Senate moving again, that we can get the appropriations \nprocess moving again, that we can stand by our men and women in uniform \nwho need these facilities, and our veterans, and that, yes, we can \ncontrol spending in full agreement with the House of Representatives \nbut still move the Senate forward.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \nexcellent presentation. They are excellent Senators. And, from all that \nappears, they produced a piece of legislation that will be positive for \nour country. But the pending measure, H.R. 2055, An Act Making \nAppropriations for Military Construction, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and related Agencies, offered by the Senators, would \nappropriate Federal funds for the year 2012. However, the Senate has \nnot yet adopted a concurrent budget resolution for 2012, and there is \nno 302(a) allocation in place for that fiscal year.\n  Section 303(c) of the Congressional Budget Act prohibits \nconsideration of any appropriation bill until a concurrent resolution \non the budget has been agreed to and an allocation has been made to the \nCommittee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2012, or any subsequent \nyear.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to \nsection 303 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the point of \norder under section 303 of that act for H.R. 2055, and any amendments \nthereto and motions thereon.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I object and would debate the issue.\n  I make this motion for a very important reason, not directly related \nto the quality of the work of Senator Johnson and Senator Kirk in \nproducing this bill, but a very important question concerning the \nbudget of the United States.\n  We have in the United States Code a budget act. The budget act says \nyou shouldn't be bringing forth appropriating bills until you have a \nbudget. That is pretty simple, that is pretty commonsensical, and it is \nthe correct way to do business. We haven't had a budget for 806 days \nnow. The reason we are spending this country into bankruptcy is we have \nhad no budget. This year, the majority has not even sought to bring one \nto committee, and certainly not brought one on the floor.\n  The Democratic leadership said it would be foolish to pass a budget. \nWell, I don't think it is foolish to pass a budget. I think our lack of \nbudget is the reason we have gotten out of control in what we are \ndoing. So that is the reason why I made the objection.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to enter into \na colloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would say this is a very important \nmatter, and I don't like to have to take this action, but I believe it \nis the right action.\n  I see on the floor Senator Corker from Tennessee. He was mayor of the \ncity of Chattanooga and as mayor he produced budgets and actually did \none of the greatest jobs of any mayor of the United States, the truth \nbe known, in making that city the fabulous place it is today. He is a \nbusinessman also.\n  I ask Senator Corker, what are his thoughts at this point in time \nabout the state of the financial management of the taxpayers' money \nbeing handled by the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his comments and leadership on \nthe Budget Committee.\n  To the two gentlemen, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, I thank them for their work in appropriations. This \ndiscussion on the floor has absolutely nothing to do with work they \nhave done. I understand actually the top line they are using is within \nthe budget that was passed through the House.\n  The reason I am here today, though, is for this reason: There aren't \nmany Senators on either side of the aisle who believe the Senate is \nfunctioning in an appropriate manner. I can't go to the dining room or \nany other place, walk down the hall, get on the subway, without some \nSenator saying, Can you believe how this place is operating? Our \nallowing spending bills to come to the floor and to be voted upon \nwithout having budgets basically makes us an accomplice in allowing \nthis place to continue to be dysfunctional.\n  We are having a showdown over the debt ceiling because there isn't \nany other place to have a showdown. I realize many people have decided \nthat is not the appropriate place, and there has been a scheme \nconcocted to sort of\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nallow both sides to have it as they may and try to fight this out in \nthe electoral process down the road instead of dealing with some of the \ntough issues we ought to deal with now.\n  But it seems to me that what we do by going on about our business in \nthis way is we act as accomplices to the dysfunctionality of the \nSenate. It is my belief this Senate, by virtue of the way we are \nacting, is making this great Nation weaker. That is what we are doing. \nThis Chamber we are standing in right now is causing this great Nation \nto decline because we are unwilling to come down here. I would say, \ncandidly, leadership on both sides of the aisle doesn't want us to come \ndown and make tough decisions. Either side wants it 100 percent their \nway. But we realize that to move things ahead, you have got to \nskirmish, you have got to fight, you have got to debate. Sometimes you \nhave to do some things you don't want to do to move the country ahead. \nBut we are avoiding that, and what we are doing today is moving \npossibly to an appropriations bill, a spending bill, without a budget.\n  I can't imagine in a country spending $3.7 trillion, 40 percent of it \nthat we don't have, that we are going to move to spending bills without \nresolving these particular issues. So I am extremely disappointed.\n  I know I have been saying some pretty strong things on the floor, but \nit is because I am concerned about this country. I know everybody here \nis concerned about this country. It is not as if those of us who have \nbeen talking about this issue are the only ones. That is not the image \nor perception I am trying to project. I think sometimes we go to sleep \nat the switch. We go about our business almost as zombies down here, \ncontinuing to allow this dysfunctionality to occur.\n  I am all in support of the movement put in place here to basically \nnot allow this to go forward because we don't have a budget. That is \nthe appropriate place for us to be.\n  I hope the Senate, in spite of the fact this appropriations bill \nfunds some things that candidly we all support--we want to see veterans \nget benefits. But those veterans, many of them, lost limbs doing tough \nthings for our country, and they are watching potentially us not having \nthe courage to do tough things on the floor that might flesh this out, \nthat might cause us to actually take a tough position on the floor. \nBut, oh, that might affect electoral politics down the road, so instead \nof doing that, we will go 806 days without a budget.\n  Look, I am disappointed. I am disappointed in all of us on both sides \nof the aisle. I do not think we should be going to a spending bill \nuntil we do the tough business that we were sent here to do as \nSenators.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Before recognizing other Senators, I briefly ask \nSenator Corker, having been a businessman and a mayor and having \nobserved the political scene in the country, is the Senator aware of \nany government entity--city, county or State--that systemically, almost \nstructural, is borrowing 40 cents out of every $1 they spend? Can he \nremember any time in Tennessee, in any city or State, that ever ran \nsuch a deficit?\n  Mr. CORKER. No, I cannot. The fact is, that is why recent polls show \nAmericans have about a 20-percent approval rating of Congress. What I \nwould say, based on what I know, based on what we are getting ready to \ndo on the floor today, 20 percent is way too high. The fact is we do \neverything we can to avoid tough decisions in public, tough decisions \nin public where we have to take a stand.\n  That is what we were elected to do. That is what the veterans who \nreceive benefits, if this bill passes, did. That is what we are not \ndoing. My guess is they will be willing to wait until this bill \npasses--it doesn't fund things until next year--and allow us to make \nthe tough decisions we need to make as we flesh out a budget, as we \nwork out among ourselves to finally come to a place we agree upon in \nfunding this government.\n  I certainly appreciate the leadership of the Senator. I know others \nwant to speak at this moment and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Corker. I just would say the spasm that \nis occurring in the Senate, the frustration that is boiling up, is not \nfor light or transient reasons. It is a big deal when the U.S. \nGovernment has been for months and will continue to be borrowing about \n40 percent of every $1 we spend, running up the largest deficits the \nNation has ever seen. The law says, the United States Code says you \nshould have a budget.\n  When you set a budget, you take all the bills that are out there and \ntell them how much money they have to spend so the total amount of \nmoney at the end does not exceed a dangerous level for the country. \nThat is what a budget does.\n  We are going to seek and repeatedly call to the attention of this \nSenate that we have the cart before the horse. We are spending money \nwithout a budget and we are going to have to have a budget or else we \nare not in control of our spending. Once you have a budget, it takes 60 \nvotes to violate the budget. You can stick to it if you make up your \nmind to do so. We do not have to violate it and burst the budget. That \nis what we are talking about today. It is a matter of great \nseriousness. I am pleased my colleague, Senator Rand Paul from \nKentucky, who was elected last fall to this body, is here. I know he \ntalked about the State of the American economy and our debt during that \ncampaign.\n  I ask the Senator, what are his thoughts as we approach this moment?\n  Mr. PAUL. I wish to join in the sort of the outrage that we would \nconsider spending money without having a plan. Who spends money with no \nplan as to how much you are going to spend or a plan as to what the \nrepercussions are for spending money you do not have? We are spending \n$100,000 a second. By the time I finish this sentence, we will have \nspent $\\1/2\\ million.\n  Of that $100,000 a second, we are borrowing $40,000 a second. The \nPresident is asking us now--you all heard about it, the debate is on--\nthe President is asking us to add $2 trillion of spending and \nborrowing, of borrowing and spending--$2 trillion. How long will it \nlast? We do not know because there is not a budget, but there is going \nto be an estimated $2 trillion that will be spent in the next year that \nwe do not have.\n  What does that mean to a country? There are estimates that our \ndeficit now, which approaches the size of our economy, is costing us 1 \nmillion jobs a year. What does that mean? That also means less revenue, \nwhich means worse deficits. It is all compounding upon itself.\n  We have a rule and a law within the Senate--is it called the budget \nresolution from 1974?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Budget Act.\n  Mr. PAUL. In this, it had some rules. Right now we are discussing: Do \nwe need new rules to do something about the deficit? This was a rule \nthey thought about back in 1974. It was supposed to make things better. \nBut it shows the rules only work if we obey them. We will be in \ndefiance of this rule. That is the question I have for Senator \nSessions: Will we be in defiance of our own rules if we go forward with \nan appropriation without a budget?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It absolutely will. It sets forth precisely the \nlanguage. It requires this. It is pretty clear. I don't think there is \nany doubt about it: Until the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year has been agreed to and an allocation has been made to the \nCommittee on Appropriations of the Senate under section 302(a) for that \nyear, it shall not be in order for the Senate to consider any \nappropriations bill.\n  That is pretty clear. I am pleased to see the Senator is a doctor, \nnot a lawyer, but I believe almost anybody could understand that point.\n  Mr. PAUL. What was the intention, though? What was the intention that \nrule would do? By having a budget was it supposed to limit, then, what \neach appropriations bill for each subject would be allowed to spend?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. I am sure in 1974 they were concerned \nabout the process in the Senate. They decided to try to bring order to \nit. They decided to require the budget be passed which sends a message \nover to the Appropriations Committee. This is a subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee producing their MILCON proposal.\n  They then give them numbers which they are supposed to stay within. \nIf\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nthey do not, it requires a 60-vote total to proceed above the budget \nnumber. It is a way to bring integrity to the system.\n  Mr. PAUL. So by invoking this rule from the 1974 Budget Act, the \nSenator's intention has nothing to do with the bill presented before \nus, it has to do with whether we should be responsible as a government, \nhave a budgetary plan, know how much money comes in, know how much \nmoney is being spent, and do the responsible things the American people \nexpect of us.\n  I am concerned what happens if we keep on this path. If we keep \nspending money at the rate we are spending it, within about a decade \nentitlements and interest consume the whole budget, that is, if \ninterest rates do not go up. As you noticed the other day when Larry \nLindsey wrote about it in the Wall Street Journal, he said if interest \nrates go up to where they have historically been, we will add another \n$5 trillion. My fear is the economy will not withstand it, our country \nwill not withstand it, and we need to have somebody to say enough is \nenough.\n  The country needs to have a plan. We need to budget how much money \ncomes in and how much we can spend. I think this is a good first step.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I cannot think of a more important \ntime in history for us to return to the tried and true budgetary \nprocess than at a time in which we are spending to a degree that is \nirresponsible, above anything we have ever done before. It is \nthreatening the American economy. It is not a light, little problem. It \nis a serious problem. We are going now 805, 806 days without a budget. \nThat is part of the problem.\n  We are going to continue to work to insist that we proceed in the \nregular order under a budget. The House has passed a budget. The \nRepublican House passed one by April 15, as the law requires. We have \nnot even had a markup in the Budget Committee because the Democratic \nleadership has decided it is not fun to vote on a budget. You have to \nshow your cards. You have to show where you are going to raise taxes, \nwhere you are going to cut spending, and how much the deficit is going \nto be after it is all over.\n  President Obama's budget received such a poor reception because it \nwas so unbalanced and irresponsible that, I guess, maybe they decided \nit would be foolish, as the leader said, for the Senate to even produce \none. That is not a good reason.\n  I know it might be appropriate that we yield at this point to our \ncolleagues and let them share any remarks they have.\n  Mr. PAUL. I have a question before we finish. The question I have is: \nWe have not had a budget in 2 years. When is the last time we had \nappropriations bills and are we working in the committees? See, the \npeople expect us to come up here and do our jobs and I think our job is \nin committee. We deliberate over a budget in your Budget Committee. \nOver appropriations, are we deliberating over appropriations or have we \nhad any committee hearings over the debt ceiling or how we could cut \nspending in order to spend so much money we do not have? Are we in the \nprocess of doing what we are supposed to be doing in committee?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't believe we are, but I have to give this \nsubcommittee credit. I am told that the appropriations bill now before \nthe Senate is the first stand-alone appropriations bill brought to the \nfloor of the Senate since 2008.\n  When I came here, we would try to pass all our appropriations bills, \nat least a number of them, before the August recess and all by \nSeptember 30. When we did not, we were embarrassed. In the last several \nyears, everything has been cobbled into one big continuing resolution \nand moved in a block.\n  I guess I say to my colleagues as I yield the floor, thank you for \nproceeding at a pace to get a bill forward. It is not your fault that \nwe have not had a budget at this point in time.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kirk \nwould like to speak in favor of the motion to waive and I yield him as \nmuch time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank our ranking Republican member on the \nBudget Committee because in normal circumstances I would be strongly \nsupporting him and agree with him. The irony is, this legislation \nconforms to a budget, it conforms to the Paul Ryan House budget and \nfits under the 302(b) allocation; that is, the amount of money the \nHouse granted to the House Appropriations Subcommittee that wrote this \nbill. When this bill passed our very conservative House of \nRepresentatives, only five Members of the House voted against it. All \nthe leading Members of the House voted for it.\n  We talk about needing to make tough decisions. I appreciate the \nMembers and their praise for the underlying legislation because we made \nsome tough decisions. We looked at the President's request and we made \na number of cuts.\n  In Alaska, at Fort Wainwright, we cut $57 million from their aviation \ncomplex; in Germany, at Gemersheim Central Distribution Facility we cut \n$21 million; also, at that same facility, their infrastructure we cut \nby $16 million; at Fort Bliss, for the maintenance facility, we \nterminated funding for that, also for their infrastructure proposal; at \nFort Belvoir, road and infrastructure projects, we terminated that \nproject. In Honduras, at Soto Cano, we made a $5 million reduction; in \nCalifornia, the Coronado Fitness Center for North Island, we made a $14 \nmillion reduction; in California, at Bridgeport, for a multipurpose \nbuilding, an addition, we made a $3 million reduction; in the Persian \nGulf, in Bahrain, for the bachelors' enlisted quarters, we terminated \nfunding for that for this fiscal year; also, in Bahrain, a waterfront \ndevelopment, also terminated that; in the Marianas, at the North Ramp \nutilities, we also terminated that. That was a $78 million \nreduction. In Marianas, at the north ramp facility, we also terminated \nwith a $78 million reduction; also in the Finnegan Water Utilities, \nended funding for that project. In Guam, at the Guam Strike Fuel \nSystems Maintenance Handler, we cut funding in half, saving $64 \nmillion. In Nebraska, at Offutt, we made a $30 million reduction for \ntheir replacement facility No. 1. In Al Udeid in Qatar, we terminated \nfunding for the Blatchford-Preston Complex. In Utah, at Hill Air Force \nBase, we terminated funding for the F-35 ADAL Hangar. In Colorado, at \nBuckley, we made a $70 million reduction in their Mountainview \nOperations Facility. In Maryland, at their joint base Andrews, their \nambulatory care center suffered a 150-percent reduction. In Maryland, \nat Fort Meade, the high-performance computing factory, we terminated \nfunding for that facility. In Texas, joint base San Antonio, the \nambulatory care center, we cut funding in half, saving $80 million. In \nTexas, at Fort Bliss, at the hospital replacement facility, we reduced \nfunding by $27 million. In Utah, Camp Williams, the data center, we cut \nthat funding in half, saving $123 million.\n\n  In total, we made the reductions in 24 separate programs including \ncanceling the building I talked about, a whole new court for the Court \nof Veterans Appeals. That is why this legislation came in $2.6 million \neven below the House, why it is $1.2 billion in budget authority below \nthe President and $620 million below last year's budget authority, \nreminding Members there are no earmarks in this legislation.\n  Eighty-nine Members voted for cloture on this legislation yesterday, \nwhich is why we brought it up. My hope is those 89 Members vote for \ncloture again on this underlying motion. I think most of our Members on \nmy side, the Republican side, are going to vote for this budget point \nof order once we get to that, and I completely understand. I will \nprobably be supporting him on other bills. The only commonsense point I \nwill make here is that because we are at the House budget level and \nbecause the House has adopted them, this conforms to the Paul Ryan \nbudget, I think we should move forward, especially as our ranking \nmember wisely said, this is the first appropriations bill coming up \nseparately since 2008, and I will say you make specific reductions to \nreal spending when you actually bring up a bill, as Chairman Johnson \nhas decided to do with my backing.\n  I yield to Chairman Johnson and thank him for the time.\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I yield the floor and \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see Senator Lee from Utah. Senator Lee is a new \nSenator. He campaigned throughout his State and talked about the kind \nof issues we are dealing with today. I would yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. LEE. We have now been operating for more than 800 days without a \nbudget having been passed. We are operating at the direction of the \nparty in control of this body on autopilot. It is easy to operate on \nautopilot. In many ways it is far easier than operating not on \nautopilot, especially when we are spending more than $1.5 trillion a \nyear more than we are bringing in, more than $1.5 trillion every year \nmore than we have, continuing to bury our children under a mountain of \ndebt. When you are on autopilot, you don't have the same constraints, \nthe same hard choices, the same prioritization demands that need to be \nmade that Americans make every single day as they manage their homes, \ntheir lives, their families, their businesses--and State and local \ngovernments. This is unfortunate. It is unnecessary, and it is \nshameful. It should not continue to operate this way. An enterprise as \nlarge as the Federal Government, which brings in $2.2 trillion every \nsingle year, having access to more money than perhaps any other \ninstitution on Earth, ought to be able to operate with a budget. It \nought to be able to pass a budget. It ought not be operating on \nautopilot so as to insulate itself from critiques justifiable and \nunjustifiable alike, from those who would say: Why are you doing it \nthis way? Why are you doing it that way? To have a debate, a \ndiscussion, that is necessary. It necessarily surrounds the budgeting \nprocess in any legislative body, in any republic around the world.\n  In the process of operating on autopilot, we are severely \nexacerbating our deficit problem with our national debt now totaling \nnearly $15 trillion. What then is the solution? I believe the solution \nto our current problem, especially as we approach the debt limit, \ninvolves the cut, cap, and balance approach, including passage by both \nHouses of Congress of the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, one that would \nrequire, in addition to our making immediate short-term cuts and \nadopting statutory spending caps designed to put us on a firm, smooth \nglidepath toward a balanced budget, that we also pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. All of these would be passed as \nconditions precedent to our raising the debt limit, which many of us \nare willing to do, if necessary, to get those measures passed. We are \nnot willing to raise it without those measures first being passed \nbecause we cannot continue to perpetuate this problem, one which we \noperate on autopilot while burning $1.5 trillion a year that we do not \nhave.\n  This is crowding out other priorities. It is crowding out other \ninvestment in our economy. It is killing jobs. It is jobs we need to be \nfocused on because that is what the American people are focused on. \nThey are worried about their ability and the ability of their friends \nand family members, many of whom are unemployed, to be able to provide \nfor their children, to pay their rent, to buy their groceries. These \nare things every American ought to be able to have access to and would \nhave access to if only they had access to jobs. But at a time when we \nare spending at such a rate as we are, when we borrowed to such a \ndegree that we have that our debt-to-GDP ratio is at about 95 percent, \nwe are killing as many as 1 million jobs every year in America as long \nas we remain in that danger zone. This simply cannot continue.\n  Another thing we face right now that is something I find completely \nunacceptable is the fact that amidst all of this debate and discussion \nwe have had in recent weeks about the debt limit, amidst the offer on \nthe part of what are now most of the Republicans in the Senate to raise \nthe debt limit under the circumstances I have outlined, the President \nof the United States responded to those offers by threatening--\npromising, perhaps--to cut Social Security to current retirees if the \ndebt limit is not immediately raised and raised only consistent with \nthe conditions that he is demanding right now. I fail to understand why \nthe President of the United States would prefer to make so hasty, so \ncruel, and so reckless a threat as withholding Social Security checks \nfor current retirees before looking at any other Federal program.\n  Look, we borrow at a rate of about $125 billion a month. That is a \nlot of money. A lot of people don't make that much money in a whole \nyear. As we are borrowing at that rate, we have to take into account \nthe fact that Social Security benefits cost the U.S. Treasury about $50 \nbillion a month. It is $50 billion out of $125 billion each month that \nwe borrow, assuming that is the portion we borrow. Meanwhile, we are \nbringing in $200 billion a month in tax revenue. So there is more than \nenough tax revenue there to cover not only Social Security benefits but \nalso interest on debt and a number of other things as well. That begs \nthe question: Why are Social Security beneficiaries the first to be \nthreatened? Why is it their checks that the President is threatening to \nwithhold first? There is no explanation to this that he has offered, \nand I hereby demand one.\n  I think our current retirees deserve more than to be used as pawns in \na high-stakes political game, one that uses fear and uncertainty and \ndoubt rather than reason and discussion and debate and willingness to \ncompromise. The need for this has never been greater. The consequences \nfor disregarding the need for debate and discussion have never been \nhigher. I urge my colleagues and I urge all Americans to work together \nto find a solution to this, a solution that need not involve and should \nnot involve threatening America's most vulnerable, including retirees, \nwho rely each month on Social Security, withholding those benefits \nsimply because the President of the United States is unwilling to \ncompromise, is unwilling to meet the conditions many Republicans in \nthis body have acknowledged are their conditions precedent for raising \nthe debt limit.\n  There is a way forward. There is a road that will take us home, and \nthe road home can be found in the Cut, Cap and Balance Act. This is not \njust the best proposal, this is the only proposal that currently has \nsignificant public support from a substantial number of Members of this \nbody. Sometime today or tomorrow, companion legislation will be \nintroduced in the House of Representatives, and we will be moving \nforward. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this, and I urge my \nfellow Americans to carefully consider these and to urge their \nrepresentatives and their Senators to embrace them and to adopt them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Lee for his leadership on this cut, \ncap, and balance plan. I think it would change the debt trajectory of \nour country and put us on a path to prosperity rather than a path to \ndecline and deficit and maybe financial crisis.\n  Indeed, Mr. Erskine Bowles and Mr. Alan Simpson, the co-chairmen of \nthe debt deficit commission appointed by President Obama, told us \nearlier this year in the Budget Committee that this Nation has never \nfaced a more predictable economic crisis. What he is saying was the \nspending course we are on is so out of sync with reality, it is \ninevitable we will pay a price economically for that. So part of the \nreason we are where is because we have not had a budget in over 2 \nyears. If you don't have a budget, it makes it harder for the American \npeople to ascertain whether you are spending more than you ought to be \nspending, and the whole process is able to be pursued without public \nknowledge and full disclosure when you don't have a budget.\n  Every President is required by the same Budget Act to submit a \nbudget. I think there is no President who has failed to comply with the \nBudget Act and does not require that you go to jail if you violate it. \nIt would probably be better off if that had been the case. But the \nPresident submitted a budget earlier this year in February. It was, I \nbelieve, the most irresponsible budget ever presented to Congress at a \ntime when systemic, structural deficits of trillions of dollars, the \nlikes of which we have never, ever had before--at a time when we needed \nto confront that and discuss it as a people, as a nation,\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nhe submitted a budget that increased taxes significantly, increased \nspending even more, and increased the deficit, not reduced it.\n  Eventually it came up for a vote. I brought it up for a vote since my \ncolleagues wanted to vote down the House budget that was a responsible \nbudget. It would actually change our debt course, reduce spending by $6 \ntrillion. They brought that up and it got 40 or so votes, but it did \nnot pass. I then brought up President Obama's budget, in a Senate with \na majority of Democratic Members, and it failed 0 to 97. Mr. President, \n97 to 0, because it didn't deserve a single vote, but it had one \ncharacteristic about it that was important. It actually had numbers in \nit. I guess the budget staff--they always produced a budget--before the \nspin doctors at the White House realized it, they sent out a budget \nprojecting the President's future plans for America. For example, at a \ntime when we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar, the President \nproposed next year to increase the Education Department. Ninety percent \nof our education funds are from the States, and they always take care \nof that, and we provide certain Federal funds that can be an asset to \nthem sometimes. Sometimes it is a liability, frankly. But at any rate, \nhe asked for a 10.5-percent increase in Education, a 9.5-percent \nincrease to the Energy Department, which spends most of its time \nblocking the production of energy rather than producing more lower \ncost, cleaner energy for the country. It proposed a 10.5-percent \nincrease in the State Department budget, and it proposed--hold your \nhats--a 60-percent increase in transportation. Much of that was for \nhigh-speed rail so everybody can walk--80 percent of Americans, \napparently, can walk to a train station and travel on the high-speed \nrail. We don't have the money for that. States are rejecting the money. \nThey run the numbers. They know it is not going to be feasible and that \nit is just an overreach.\n\n  I guess what I am saying is that somebody in this country does not \nget it. I thought the American people sent a message loud and clear \nlast year when they sent a lot of new Members to Congress, such as \nSenator Paul and Senator Lee, who were shocked at it and talked to \ntheir constituents and came to Congress to do something about it.\n  We haven't even brought up a budget. Why didn't Senator Reid and the \nDemocratic leadership decide to bring up a budget? Well, if they bring \na budget, then they have to show what they believe. They have to \npropose a solution to the problem. Well, what was their plan? Because \nthey called up the House budget and voted it down--every Democrat voted \nit down--and they never produced one of their own. When I brought up \nPresident Obama's budget, they voted it down. So we have not seen one \nreal solution.\n  They have been talking about, oh, they will do this and that. Senator \nDurbin said we can change Social Security some--we can do something \nabout Medicare. Let's see your plan. Let's see it. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee says he has a budget. He has a budget, and he leaks \nout portions of it, but nobody sees the real budget. There are certain \nnumbers and visions and ideas, and he claims they have a budget. But if \na person is unwilling to produce the budget and have a hearing in the \nBudget Committee, then I think they don't have one. It is not a budget. \nI don't know what it is, but it is not a budget.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Cornyn, who has been a member of the \nBudget Committee. I know he is knowledgeable about these issues, and I \nam pleased to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to express my \nappreciation for the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator \nSessions, and to express many of the same concerns I know he has \narticulated.\n  One of the most basic responsibilities of any business or family or, \nfrankly, of Congress itself is to pass a budget. But, as the Senator \nfrom Alabama pointed out--and it has been pointed out time and time \nagain--Congress has failed for more than 800 days--800 days--to perform \none of its most basic and fundamental responsibilities, and that is to \ntake up and pass a budget.\n  Even though we haven't passed a budget and taken up a budget, that \ndoesn't mean the spending has stopped. Indeed, the spending goes on in \na reckless sort of way. We have spent $7.3 trillion since the last \nbudget was passed, and we have increased the national debt by $3.2 \ntrillion.\n  Now the Senate is considering a spending bill, an appropriations \nbill, before we have even passed a budget. It strikes me that is \nexactly backward. We should be passing and debating a budget first \nbefore we then take up appropriations bills. This is not the way \nCongress should operate.\n  Now, taxpayers who might be watching this on C-SPAN or elsewhere or \nin the gallery may be asking themselves, well, how can Congress spend \nmoney without having a budget in place, because we know a budget is a \nvery important form of self-discipline. It requires us to identify what \nour priorities are. What are the things we have to spend money on? What \nare things we would like but we can put off until tomorrow or next \nyear? What are the things we would like to have but we really can't \nafford? The fact is, Congress has been operating in an undisciplined \nand extravagant sort of way not with our money but with the taxpayers' \nmoney and, even worse, with the money these young men and women who are \nsitting in front of me are going to have to pay because our legacy to \nthem will be a burden of debt which will limit their opportunity and \ntheir prosperity.\n  As Senator Sessions, our ranking member, has pointed out, this is not \nonly a bad idea, this is not only bad policy, this is not only a breach \nwith our precedent and policies, there is, in fact, a Budget Act rule \nthat prohibits what is going on; that is, spending money without a \nbudget in place. It violates the Senate rules.\n  Everybody knows spending money without a budget in place is not \nfiscally responsible. Of course, I would say to the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota, we all support our military and our \nveterans, and there is no greater responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment than to defend our citizens and to make sure the needs of \nour troops and veterans are met. But Congress should not, in the \ninterest of doing something that is important, circumvent its own \nrules.\n  Taxpayers deserve transparency. With transparency comes \naccountability. And without a budget, taxpayers get neither.\n  We know what has been going on in the absence of Congress doing its \njob. Indeed, the President's own proposed budget would have vastly \nexpanded the debt and the deficits, and that is why it lost when we \nbrought it to the floor and said we want to vote on it. It lost 97 to \n0. No member of the opposing party, the President's own party, voted \nfor the President's proposed budget because it was irresponsible. It \ndid nothing to solve the problem of reckless spending, deficits, and \nunsustainable debt.\n  So what are we left with? Well, we are told that on August 2 the \nSecretary of the Treasury says we will run out of money. Rather than \nhaving a budget debated and voted on in front of the American people \nwhere every American citizen could watch it and see what is going on \nand call our offices and express their concerns either supporting that \nbudget or saying, no, Members of Congress ought to change it by \noffering an amendment, what we are given now by the President is secret \nnegotiations behind closed doors. I assume it will be rolled out at \nsome point, and we will be told: Take it or leave it. August 2, we are \nout of money. And Mr. Senator, Madam Senator, Madam Congressperson, you \ncan't do your most fundamental job; that is, have a debate in the light \nof day in front of the American people.\n  Now, does this ring a bell? It seems to me this is starting to be a \nhabit--a bad habit. It started with the health care bill. It was rammed \nthrough Congress. It was a product of secret negotiations. All sorts of \nspecial deals were cut behind closed doors. Only now are we really \nbeginning to see what the consequences of those special deals were and \nthe costs that were vastly underestimated in the health care bill.\n  I hate to say this, but President Obama has failed to lead on the \ndebt ceiling. First, we know he called for a clean up-or-down vote \nwithout any cuts or any entitlement reform. That is\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\nthe first thing he called for. Thank goodness he has moved away from \nthat position, but there are problems yet. But when he was a Senator in \n2006, he said, ``Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \ninternationally.'' At the time, he also said, ``It is a sign that we \nnow depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to \nfinance our Government's reckless fiscal policies.'' That was back in \n2006 when then-Senator Obama made those statements. So today we are \npresented with a much different officeholder--the President of the \nUnited States--who is now demagoging those who hold the same truths he \nespoused himself in 2006, back when our debt and our deficits were much \nsmaller than they are today.\n  This isn't a matter of the President not understanding the problem we \nfind ourselves in because he appointed a bipartisan commission, the \nSimpson-Bowles commission, that reported back in December in a report \ncalled ``A Moment of Truth'' which laid out in sobering detail the \nunsustainability of our national debt, the reckless spending that had \ngone on, and the borrowing from the Chinese and other governments. But \nrather than the President taking up the report of his own fiscal \ncommission, he simply ignored it. He ignored it in the State of the \nUnion Message. He certainly ignored it in his proposed budget, which \nwas dead on arrival over here, without a single Democrat voting for it.\n  In essence, the President has outsourced his leadership \nresponsibilities to others. We know the President's current proposal, \nif one can call it that--and, frankly, the devil is in the details, and \nwhile the House has passed a budget, while the Simpson-Bowles \ncommission has made a recommendation, as well as the Domenici-Rivlin \nbipartisan recommendation, we have yet to see the President's plan. \nYes, he has held press conferences, he has bashed those rhetorically \nwho have held the very same position he held in 2006, but he has failed \nto lead and offer a plan to deal with this impending crisis.\n  In fact, the President's current rhetoric--I don't think we can \ndignify it by calling it a plan--is significantly to the left of his \nown bipartisan Simpson-Bowles recommendations. He is certainly to the \nleft of Simpson-Bowles when it comes to spending--calling for much more \nspending, no cuts but continued spending. He is to the left of Simpson-\nBowles when it comes to taxes, when ``more'' is the only word he seems \nto know when it comes to taxes--more taxes. In fact, when the President \nsays we are going to cut $1 trillion, let's say, or $2 trillion, but we \nare going to raise taxes $$2 trillion, what does that net? That means \nno net change in the size of the Federal Government, and that means no \nreal downpayment on our national debt or deficit. It is a sleight of \nhand. It is phony. It is designed to give the appearance of doing \nsomething serious while doing nothing serious at all.\n  We know the President has failed to lead in other ways. He has \ndelegated or outsourced his responsibility to the Vice President. It \ntook only a few weeks ago for the President to finally step up and \nengage personally, and we find that more often than not he proposed \nphony solutions such as changing the depreciation schedule for \ncorporate jet owners, dealing with the tax treatment of oil and gas \ncompanies, and changing an accounting rule called ``last in, first \nout.'' But the facts are that those changes, even if adopted, would be \na drop in the bucket. They would do nothing significant or serious to \ndeal with our huge deficits and our unsustainable debt.\n  Unfortunately, the President's own personal engagement is frequently \nnothing more than personal attacks. His recent press conferences have \nbeen full of name-calling and straw man attacks that are, frankly, \nbeneath the dignity of the office of President of the United States. \nInstead of being a Commander in Chief, it is more like he has decided: \nI am going to be campaigner in chief. I am not going to deal with the \nproblem. I am going to just look at winning the next election. Then we \nread yesterday that even in private the President is throwing temper \ntantrums like he did yesterday and stomping out of the meeting at the \nWhite House--again, failing to show leadership.\n\n  But the most cynical thing the President has done, the most cynical \nabdication of leadership he has displayed so far is his new threat to \nhold seniors, our veterans, and our troops hostage unless Congress will \nagree to job-killing tax increases immediately. This is shameful \nbehavior.\n  We all know that even if the August 2 deadline passes without a deal, \naccording to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the U.S. Treasury will still \nhave enough revenue--about $172 billion--to pay for Social Security \nbenefits, to pay for Medicaid and Medicare, to pay Active-Duty \nmilitary, and other national priorities. Let me repeat: The only reason \nseniors and our troops will see their checks stop coming is if the \nObama administration decides to make other spending a priority, if the \nObama administration chooses to hold our troops and seniors hostage \njust so they can raise taxes.\n  This is another amazing display of cynicism, or I guess the most \ncharitable way I can say it: short term memory. The President himself \nsaid last December the reason we should not raise taxes in a fragile \neconomic recovery is because it would be bad for job creation. It would \nfurther discourage job creation at a time when we need jobs badly.\n  Well, let me say just a word about tax increases and why this side of \nthe aisle believes so strongly that tax increases are not the answer to \nour debt crisis.\n  As one President famously said:\n\n       The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the \n     middle of a recession because that would just suck up--take \n     more demand out of the economy and put businesses in a \n     further hole.\n\n  Well, the President who said that was President Barack Obama back in \n2009. The President makes our case for us.\n  Another President said low taxes help ``millions of entrepreneurs . . \n. hire new workers.'' Oh, yes, that was again President Barack Obama \nwhen he signed the extension of tax relief last December.\n  Then there was another President, somebody our Nation holds in high \nregard, who happens to have been a Member of the other political party, \nwho said:\n\n       The final and best means of strengthening demand among \n     consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private \n     income and the deterrents to private initiative which are \n     imposed by our present tax system. . . .\n\n  That was President John F. Kennedy in 1962. President Kennedy also \nsaid:\n\n       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too \n     high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way \n     to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates \n     now. . . .\n\n  He said--and he was exactly right:\n\n       Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax \n     reduction can pave the way to that employment.\n       The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget \n     deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding \n     economy which can bring a budget surplus.\n\n  He had it exactly right. We need to not only cut spending, but we \nneed to grow revenue. The best way to grow revenue is to get more \ntaxpayers, to get more people back to work. The reason Federal revenue \nis so low is not because tax rates are too low or people are not taxed \nenough, it is because too many people are out of work.\n  When people do not have a job, they do not pay taxes, they do not pay \ntheir home mortgages, and they lose their homes. We are for more people \ngetting back to work. We have tried the failed stimulus, the goal of \nwhich was to keep unemployment below 8 percent. We know that failed. \nYet we racked up another $800 billion in debt.\n  So why don't we try the old-fashioned way: take our boot off the \nnecks of the job creators in America to make it easier, not harder, to \ncreate jobs, to provide incentives for entrepreneurs to start new \nbusinesses, to help existing small businesses expand their business. \nBut they cannot do it, and they will not do it with uncertainty about \ntheir taxes, with the regulatory overreaching and other policies coming \nout of Washington, DC.\n  Republicans are holding the line against the President's demand for \nhigher taxes for a very simple reason. President Kennedy was right \nabout taxes back in 1962, and President Barack Obama was right about \ntaxes as recently as last December. Unfortunately, he has changed his \nmind, or he has forgotten the position he took just last December.\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\n  Republicans do not want tax increases, and we do not want to see the \nFederal Government default on its obligations. So we have an obligation \nto come up with an affirmative plan, a positive plan to solve the \nproblem. I believe we have done so.\n  The first is a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nthat is cosponsored by every Republican on this side of the aisle. The \nlast time we voted on a balanced budget amendment in the Senate was \n1997--before I got here--where 11 Democrats voted to support that \nconstitutional amendment. I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us \nin doing not an extraordinary thing, not a heroic thing--it is a very \nordinary but a very commonsense thing--and that is to make sure the \nFederal Government learns to live within its means and not spend money \nit does not have. We hope they will join us.\n  Part of that plan is also the cut, cap, and balance legislation I \nhave cosponsored and that I hope the House of Representatives will take \nup and send over here soon. This legislation is a plan that avoids \ndefaulting on our obligations. It prevents more taxes, particularly \nduring a fragile economic recovery. It cuts reckless spending, and it \ngets our fiscal house in order.\n  What is painfully apparent is we are running out of time, and I am \nnot just talking about the August 2 deadline. Yesterday, Moody's \nInvestors Services said it was reviewing the Nation's top-notch, AAA \ncredit rating for a potential downgrade.\n  If credit agencies downgrade our debt, it will cost more for us to \nborrow from the Chinese and our other creditors. As we know, because of \nFederal Reserve policies, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates \nbelow historic norms. If those were to grow to historic norms because \nour debt has been downgraded by the credit agencies--or for any other \nreason--the interest on our national debt alone will crowd out other \npriorities for our Nation. It will make it less likely we can afford to \ndo what we need to do to defend our national security or to provide the \nvery safety net that our Democratic colleagues claim to care so much \nabout. We will not have the money to do it because we will not have \nacted responsibly in dealing with the deficit and the debt today.\n  I urge my colleagues to heed these warnings and to join us in cutting \nspending and to get our debt under control. In the end, everyone will \ncome out a winner if we accomplish that goal. This is not a Republican \nplan. This is not a Democratic plan. This is what is right and good and \nnecessary for the United States of America, and so that generations in \nthe future can enjoy the same opportunity and prosperity we ourselves \nhave enjoyed. Heaven help us--Heaven help us--if we fail to take \nadvantage of this opportunity and to deal responsibly with this \nimpending crisis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. This is \nvery serious business we are engaged in. The strength of his comments, \nthe method of delivery, and the content are indicative of the serious \nchallenges we are facing.\n  For example, under the budget that was submitted to us, the only \nbudget we have seen so far from the President, the interest on our \ndebt, according to the Congressional Budget Office--that used their 10-\nYear budget and calculated we are paying about $214 billion in interest \ntoday on our debt--in the 10th year of President Obama's budget, as \nSenator Cornyn said, the interest would crowd out other things. It \nwould be $940 billion--1 year's interest.\n  When we borrow money, we pay interest just like individuals do when \nthey borrow money. We are borrowing so much money that we are doubling \nthe debt again in our country in 10 years. The interest on it will \ncrowd out other things. For example, it would be more than Social \nSecurity, more than our Medicare, more than our Defense Department \nspending in that year.\n  So I thank the Senator for sharing that.\n  I see Senator Johnson, and I would be pleased to yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nhis courtesy and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will just wrap up and close at 2 \no'clock. I understand under our agreement that 2 o'clock will start the \ntime allocated for the Democratic speakers as they may appear, and \nthere would be time at 3 o'clock under my control for Republican \nspeakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding, although the Chair \nis told the agreement has not been formalized as yet. But the Chair \nunderstands that is the agreement. The Senator from Alabama is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. That is all right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Very good.\n  So I will wrap up and ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes \nunder my control at 3 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Well, the fundamental problem is that our Democratic leadership has \ndecided it would be foolish to have a budget, even though it is \nrequired by law. They have refused to produce a budget now for 806 \ndays--over 2 years. Last year, Senator Conrad produced a budget in \ncommittee, and it was voted on and brought to the floor, but the \nmajority leader refused to even bring it up for debate and vote.\n  This year I suppose it was that the majority leader decided we would \nnot even have one in committee. So we have not commenced any action to \npass a budget. But now we are proceeding to spend money. We are \nproceeding to pass legislation that would expend taxpayers' money \nwithout a budget. That is not good policy by any standards, whether we \nhave a law or not. But we actually have a law that requires us to have \na budget first. That is why I found myself having to raise a budget \npoint of order.\n  We were not elected to shut down the committees, to violate the \ncongressional process of deciding how money should be spent, to cede \nour constitutional responsibility to some secret meeting somewhere so \nthey can produce some sort of bill and drop it in the Senate on August \n1, presumably, and then demand that we pay for it.\n  Because, look, you have to look behind the numbers. Just because the \nPresident says his budget does one thing, his plan does another thing, \ndon't you think we ought to check it out?\n  One of the most stunning statements I have ever heard from a \nPresident and from the Budget Director was heard earlier this year \nafter the President presented his budget. He and the Budget Director \npublicly--and the Budget Director in committee--said: Our budget will \nhave us live within our means and pay down the debt.\n  They used those words. So anybody hearing that thinks: Gosh, I am \nglad the President prepared a budget that will have us live within our \nmeans and pay down our debt. We have been spending too much money.\n  What is the truth? The truth is, the lowest single annual deficit in \n10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysts, would \nbe $740 billion.\n  The highest President Bush ever had was $450 billion. That was too \nhigh. This year it will be $1,500 billion, and I would point out that \nin the outyears $740 billion was about year 6. The 7, 8, 9, 10 numbers \nare going up again, and CBO says in the 10th year, the deficit under \nthe President's budget will be $1.2 trillion. So this is not good. We \nneed to get our house in order.\n  We are going to insist that we do it in the right way. That is why I \nhave objected to proceeding to spending bills without a budget. It is \ntime for the majority leader to bring us into session. Let's have a \nbudget. Let's see where people stand. Let's make the tough decisions. \nLet's vote on it. Let's allow ourselves to be held accountable by the \npeople who sent us here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the media has been focused on our \ndifferences. But I think there is one thing that every single member of \nthis body agrees on, we have to address the long-term debt and \ndeficits.\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\n  Like many Members of this Chamber, I have repeatedly called for a \nbipartisan package that includes reforms to everything deficit related. \nThat means cuts to spending, domestic, defense, and mandatory, as well \nas increased revenues. I have supported attaching deficit reduction \nmeasures to the vote on the debt limit. And I believe reducing the \ndeficit is critical to strengthening the long-term health of the \neconomy.\n  But I also believe that everyone--everyone--has to come to the table \nto find a compromise solution that will get this done. Democrats know \nthis, that is why time and again we have offered compromise plans, \nincluding more than a trillion dollars in spending cuts. It is \ndisappointing that politics are keeping some from negotiating in good \nfaith. That is a disservice to the American people.\n  I have spoken before about what some people are trying to a protect, \ntax breaks for big oil, for hedge fund operators and for yacht owners. \nI would like to speak now about what some are willing to risk to \nprotect those tax giveaways. What happens if we do not increase the \ndebt limit and meet the United States' financial obligations.\n  First of all, raising the debt limit does not mean spending more. Our \nspending is set by Congress's annual budget process.\n  Raising the debt limit means paying our government's bills. Our \ngovernment. It is not the Democrats' government, it is not President \nObama's government. It belongs to all of us. We are talking about \nservicing savings bonds issued under President Reagan. Supporting an \nArmy first sent to Afghanistan under President Bush.\n  Paying Social Security checks, food inspectors, and air traffic \ncontrollers. This is about the full faith and credit of our government.\n  Failure to raise the debt limit means default. It means the United \nStates would not meet its obligations. What would happen?\n  Warren Buffett said it would be Congress's ``most asinine act ever.''\n  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said it would lead to ``a huge financial \ncalamity.''\n  Economist and former Reagan adviser Larry Kudlow said default would \nbe ``catastrophe.''\n  The biggest concern these experts name is the potential for a global \nfinancial crisis. Companies, pension funds, and governments across the \nworld hold U.S. savings bonds. A default could trigger a crisis worse \nthan the one in 2008, which itself triggered the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression.\n  We are just now climbing out of the hole caused by the last financial \ncrisis. We cannot risk another one.\n  Let me read from a letter sent to Congress earlier this week by \nhundreds of America's top businesses and business organizations, \nincluding the Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Roundtable, \nand great New Hampshire companies like Cirtronics and Control Air:\n\n       We believe it is vitally important for the U.S. government \n     to make good on its financial obligations. . . .\n       It is critical that the U.S. government not default in any \n     way on its fiscal obligations. A great nation--like a great \n     company--has to be relied upon to pay its debts when they \n     become due. This is a Main Street not Wall Street issue. \n     Treasury securities influence the cost of financing not just \n     for companies but more importantly for mortgages, auto loans, \n     credit cards and student debt. A default would risk both \n     disarray in those markets and a host of unintended \n     consequences. The debt ceiling trigger does offer a needed \n     catalyst for serious negotiations on budget discipline but \n     avoiding even a technical default is essential. This is a \n     risk our country must not take.\n\n  Again, this is not my opinion. This is the opinion of business \nleaders. We should listen to them.\n  In a recent op-ed in USA Today, the Chamber and the Financial \nServices Forum spelled out why they believe a default would result in \n``hundreds of thousands of lost jobs every year.''\n  First, they point out that a default would halt critical government \noperations, far more abruptly than we have seen in past standoffs over \nthe budget. They say:\n\n       The U.S. Treasury is expected to take in about $170 billion \n     in tax revenue in August, but needs to pay $300 billion in \n     expenses. The resulting $130 billion deficit would require \n     the government to pick which programs--Medicare, Medicaid \n     stamps, unemployment insurance--to pay for and which not to \n     fund. And there would be little money left to pay our troops \n     or to run the courts, the prison system, the FBI, or other \n     essential operations.\n\n  They go on to note that default would make our government debt and \ndeficit problem worse.\n  Yesterday, Moody's, the credit rating agency, put the United States \ngovernments' credit rating under review. If Moody's were to downgrade \nour credit rating, investor confidence in U.S. bonds would be shaken, \nand it would be more expensive for our government to borrow money.\n  This is something that I understand viscerally because, as Governor \nof New Hampshire, we worked closely to try to avoid the rating agencies \ndowngrading the State's borrowing so that we would not have to pay more \nmoney. JP Morgan estimates that the higher interest rates caused by \ndefault could increase our annual deficits by a staggering $75 billion \nevery year. Just from higher interest rates. If we are serious about \nreducing the deficit, this is the wrong way to go.\n\n  That is why we need to find a compromise solution. We have in the \npast. The debt limit has gone up under every President in modern times. \nPresident Nixon raised it nine times. President Clinton raised it four \ntimes. Since President Kennedy, the most frequent and largest increases \ncame under President Reagan. He raised the debt limit 18 times, by a \ntotal of 199 percent. I don't think anyone here thinks President Reagan \nwas a champion of big government.\n  I believe that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand the importance of getting this done. I believe many of them \nbelieve in the value of compromise. We all have to be at the table. We \nall have to be ready to compromise to reach a solution.\n  I ask my colleagues to do what is right and put politics aside, for \nthe good of the economy and of the country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to follow up a little bit on \nwhat the Senator from New Hampshire just spoke about; that is, the \nabsurdity, the absolute absurdity of what is going on in Washington \ntoday.\n  Our Nation used to have a two-party system in this country, but it is \nincreasingly apparent that one of our two parties has morphed--has \nmorphed--into some kind of a quasi-religion driven by one ideology: \npreserving and expanding tax breaks for the wealthy and for big \ncorporations.\n  To that end, many Republicans in Congress are perfectly willing to \npush the United States of America into defaulting on its debt \nobligations with dire economic consequences. This is a very dangerous \ndetour in our Nation's political and economic life. But just as \ndangerous, just as dangerous as the prospect of a default on our debt \nobligations is the Republican's determination to defund and dismantle \nas much of the Federal Government as possible. To that end, they are \ndemanding deep, Draconian cuts to Federal funding and investment at a \ntime when unemployment is already sky high and rising, and when our \neconomy remains fragile.\n  To justify these deep cuts, Republicans with this new ideology have \narticulated an absurd economic theory--absolutely absurd. They claim \nslashing Federal funding and investments by trillions of dollars will \nsomehow magically create jobs.\n  I don't know of any Main Street economist, or anybody with an ounce \nof common sense, who agrees with this bizarre theory. To the contrary, \neconomists warn us that this is absolutely the wrong time to be \nslashing Federal investments. Why? For the obvious reason that deep, \nshort-term cuts to Federal spending will dramatically reduce demand in \nthe economy, thus reducing employment even further.\n  Already this year, cuts to government spending at the State and local \nlevels have destroyed an estimated 500,000 public sector jobs, and that \ngoes along with an undetermined number of private-sector jobs. \nEconomists understand that terminating the jobs of teachers, police \nofficers, and other essential public employees has a negative impact on \nthe economy just as eliminating private-sector jobs do. Nonetheless, as \nif they live in kind of a parallel, upside down universe, Republicans \ninsist that slashing Federal funding and investment will create\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\njobs. Let's test that theory in one area of Federal investment. Let's \ntake transportation funding. Everybody understands that our \ntransportation infrastructure is woefully inadequate. It is in a state \nof increasing overload and disrepair. Most people understand that \nramping up investments in modernizing our highways, bridges, and public \ntransit systems would strengthen our economy and create millions of \njobs. These are the veins and arteries of our commerce.\n  What have the Republicans in the House proposed? Last week, the \nRepublican leader put forward a new transportation authorization bill \nthat would slash current investments in transportation by more than \none-third--a one-third cut in transportation. Will this create jobs, as \nthe Republicans claim? Of course not. The Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee estimates that the House bill would destroy more than \n490,000 highway construction jobs and close to 100,000 transit-related \njobs--mass transit.\n  This is pure folly. This is a classic example of what happens when \nideological obsessions cause Members of Congress to be blind to \npractical, commonsense realities.\n  I have repeatedly come to the floor to advocate for a balanced \napproach to bringing deficits under control, one that includes some \nspending cuts and revenue increases. At the same time, economists warn \nus that we need a deficit reduction plan that defers the lion's share \nof spending cuts and tax increases for several years, allowing our \neconomy to recover before the negative impacts are felt.\n  I must also ask: Why are we proposing to slash all this funding for \nhighways, schools, and infrastructure here at home, while we continue \nto spend untold billions of dollars to build highways, schools, and \ninfrastructure in Afghanistan? A lot of people ask me: Senator Harkin, \nyou say you are willing to cut spending. Where? Let's start here, with \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We are spending $168 billion in Iraq and \nAfghanistan this year alone. This year--fiscal year 2011--we are \nspending more than $13 billion to train the Iraqi and Afghan security \nforces--$13 billion. OK. What did we spend in America to retrain our \nworkers so they can get new jobs? Less than $10 billion. We are \nspending more money to train Afghan and Iraqi security forces than we \nare to retrain our own workers all over America, at a time when 24 \nmillion Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Yet we are spending \n$168 billion a year on Afghanistan and Iraq. I applaud the President \nfor his actions, but quite frankly, they don't go far enough. The \nPresident should have a faster timeframe for our troops to get out of \nAfghanistan. I have said that publicly many times. If we want to save \nsome money, save that $1 million it costs to keep one soldier in \nAfghanistan, get them back here. We went to Afghanistan to get the \nTaliban out, get al-Qaida out, and get Osama bin Laden. We got Osama \nbin Laden, Al-Qaida is no longer in Afghanistan, and the Taliban is \ngone. Why are we still there? Why are we still spending about $14 \nbillion a month in Afghanistan?\n  Again, we need a balanced approach. Spending cuts alone won't do the \njob. I think the Republicans have just proved this. The Republicans \nhave proved that spending cuts alone will not get the job done. Why do \nI say that? Look at the so-called Ryan budget. It dismantles Medicare, \nguts Medicaid, and makes severe cuts across the Federal budget. Yet it \nstill adds trillions of dollars to the deficit for years to come--\nlargely because it refuses to touch tax breaks for the well-to-do or to \nraise other revenues from corporations.\n  The Republicans have said they don't want to raise taxes on the so-\ncalled job creators. They don't want to raise taxes on job creators. To \ncall trust fund millionaires and Wall Street money manipulators ``job \ncreators'' is laughable. Meanwhile, to call many large corporations in \nthe United States ``job creators'' is increasingly questionable.\n  Actually, in one respect, you can indeed argue that America's big \nbrandname corporations--GE, Microsoft, and so on--are ``job creators.'' \nThe problem is that they are not creating many jobs here in the United \nStates. They are creating jobs overseas and eliminating them here. The \nU.S. Commerce Department data shows that during the 2000s, U.S. \ncompanies--multinational companies--cut their workforce here at home by \n2.9 million, and they increased their workforce overseas by 2.4 \nmillion. They are creating jobs, all right--just not here in America. \nTo add insult to injury, there are provisions in the United States Tax \nCode that promote this kind of behavior--the kinds of tax breaks that \nRepublicans insist on preserving.\n  They don't want to tax job creators. Yet we have shown that these big \nmultinationals are creating jobs overseas. I wish to--and I am sure the \noccupant of the chair would also--close some of those loopholes so \nthere is not a tax benefit to shipping jobs overseas. The Republicans \nsay, no, they don't want to do that.\n  In the month of May, U.S. trade deficit soared to more than $50 \nbillion--the highest level in nearly 3 years--in 1 month. In May, our \ntrade deficit--out of that $50 billion--for one country, China, was a \nstaggering $25 billion. You might say, what does that mean? Those \nfigures represent a transfer of millions of jobs and billions in wages \nfrom the United States to China or other countries abroad. We need to \nseriously examine our trade and tax policies, which continually send \nour jobs and wages overseas. We need to stop bowing before the \nsacrosanct altar of ``free trade'' as if it doesn't even warrant our \nexamination. Instead, we need to ask how we can make our trade policy \nwork for the middle class--for instance, by defending America's right \nto oppose currency manipulation and abusive trade practices.\n  We ought to talk about fair trade, fair trade, fair trade, not free \ntrade, free trade, free trade. You see where free trade gets us if we \ndon't stand up to other countries that manipulate their currencies, \nsuch as China, where we are shipping all our jobs and money.\n  As I have said, our fragile economy is at the point of maximum \ndanger. This Congress is at a historic decision point with regard to \nraising the debt ceiling and bringing deficits under control. However, \nas we have seen played out in the press, in the media, standing in the \nway of a rational, reasonable compromise is congressional Republicans' \nideological obsession with preserving tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires at any and all costs. They are threatening to force us to \ndefault on the national debt.\n  I will close with this. I heard our distinguished minority leader, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, say this was now Obama's economy and the \nproblems we have are because of Obama. He has been President for almost \n3 years--about 2\\1/2\\ years now. Therefore, he says he owns that. You \nknow, this is kind of an interesting world we are living in. We have a \ndebt ceiling, and why has the debt gone up? Because we borrowed money--\na lot of money. The Congressional Budget Office says the debt we have \ntoday comes from. Remember, 10 years ago, we had a surplus, a budget \nsurplus, one of the largest in our Nation's history left after \nPresident Clinton. Then President Bush comes into office, the \nRepublicans take over the House and Senate, and they ram through a \nmassive tax cut, which takes the surpluses and gives them mostly to the \nwealthy in our country. Then 9/11 happened and we entered into two \nwars--totally unpaid for--and we borrow it from China, or wherever, to \npay for two wars.\n  Then we had a Medicare drug prescription benefit--most of which \nbenefits go to the drug companies, by the way--and we didn't pay for \nthat. We borrowed money for that also. So the debt we are grappling \nwith today is because of policies enacted by a Republican President and \na Republican Congress. They ran up the debt. Now they don't want to pay \nfor it. This is not President Obama's debt at all. This is what happens \nwhen you have almost 8 or 9 years of uninterrupted borrowing and \nspending by President Bush and the Republican Congress. This is their \ndebt.\n  Again, I call upon reasonable, responsible Republicans to come \nforward and give up on this ideological obsession, this new theology \nthat says: no tax reform, no raising of revenues from anyone, even \nthose who can afford it the most.\n  I remain an optimist. It is not too late for reason to prevail. We \nhave heard loudly and clearly from the extremists and ideologs, who \nwould bring\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\ndown our economic house rather than agree to any compromise. Now it is \ntime for decent, patriotic Americans to speak up and say enough. We can \nand must come together around a balanced plan to bring our deficits \nunder control, and we must uphold the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today, as have so many other \nSenators, because I am concerned about what I have been hearing about \nthe threat of default that is now just over 3 weeks away--what I have \nheard both here in Washington and in Delaware.\n  This looming default crisis is one of the most grave and predictable \nthreats to our economy and our country I have ever seen. It is no \nlonger floating at a distance just over the horizon, or something we \ncan debate academically, the impact of which we may yet avert. It is \nhere now. We are on the edge. Given the difficulties this body can have \nin moving something through in a matter of days, we are very close to \nthe absolute last day when we can consider options and a path forward. \nDefault is right before us and it must be dealt with.\n  I rise not to add to the political rhetoric--there has been plenty of \nthat--nor do I rise to try and elicit panic or fear in the broader \npublic.\n  I rise because the folks of Delaware--the people from whom I have \nbeen hearing--just don't know what to believe. They know our deficit \nspending and our national debt are out of control, and they are deeply \nconcerned. That is good. I share that concern. I share that commitment \nto making certain we reduce our spending and we deal with our deficit \nbecause deficit and debt at the size we have today can harm our economy \nfundamentally. They are a basic challenge to our national security, to \nour success, and to our growth going forward. But I also rise because \nthere is no faster way to ensure that our economy will never get back \non track, that our country will never reach its full potential than to \nlet our Nation default on its financial obligations.\n  We need to deal with this default crisis in a responsible and \npragmatic way to create a real and lasting solution. We must restore \ncertainty to our markets to help get our economy going again. And what \ndo we hear from business, businessmen large and small all over the \ncountry? Certainty. We need predictability and certainty in the \nmarkets. Well, nothing is creating uncertainty more than this grinding \nlack of resolution to the vote to raise our Nation's debt ceiling.\n  I wish to take a few moments, if I could, to talk about the reality \nof this impending crisis, and I would like to look at a few of the \nmyths I hear at home that need to be cleared up.\n  First, some Members of this body and the other House of Congress, \nsome folks running for President, and some people in the press have \nsuggested that a default will cause only minor economic disruption, if \nany at all. Economist after economist, think tank after think tank, \nstudy after study has shown in the last few weeks that nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  There are predictable consequences of default that will affect every \nAmerican--Americans in every State, at every income level. More than \nany, I worry about the working families or those currently out of work \nwho are already struggling through the greatest recession we have known \nin my lifetime. One report suggests 640,000 people will lose their jobs \nin the months after default. Economists confirm that the cost of home \nmortgages, car loans, and interest rates will go up for everything. The \ncost of food, gas, and everyday items for families all over this \ncountry will go up in real and concrete ways.\n  More importantly, if we default on America's mortgage, the impact in \nterms of the increased cost of borrowing for our whole country and for \nall of our families won't just be brief, it will be lasting because it \nwill hang with us on our credit score as a nation for years. To the \nfolks watching, if you think it is difficult to find a job or to help \ngrow a business to help deal with the daily cost of living now, just \nwait until we default on America's mortgage and the cost of borrowing \nfunds to do anything--to create new jobs or to help pay your bills as a \nfamily--goes up.\n  Default will have real and lasting economic consequences that will \nhaunt this economy and haunt the working families of this Nation for \nyears.\n  The second myth is that we can just stop spending money without real \nconsequences. Some in this very Chamber have suggested that when we get \nto August, there will still be plenty of money coming in to service the \ndebt, so there is no real threat of default, and that what we need to \ndo is a relatively simple exercise of just deciding which things we \nwill stop paying.\n  This second myth goes that the Treasury Department will just start \npicking winners and losers: They will pay Social Security but forgo \nMedicare; they will pay our troops but pink-slip our Federal civilians; \nthey will fund the Pentagon but forget the Department of Education--\nnever mind the ethical quandaries, the long-term disservice such action \nwould have on our economy and our country. Frankly, the truth is that \nit is not even clear they have the legal authority to do so in the \nTreasury Department, to pick these winners and losers on a week-by-week \nbasis.\n  Let's just choose one example of the studies done on this myth that \nwe can simply pay the debt service and a few big things and the \nconsequences of the rest would be fine. According to the Bipartisan \nPolicy Center, beginning in August, if we continue to make payments, \nobviously on interest on the debt but also on Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, all defense contractors, and unemployment \ninsurance--so the really important things--and we just stop paying the \nrest, our troops on Active Duty; all of our veterans programs; all of \nlaw enforcement, including, for example, the FBI; the whole Federal \ncourt system; the FAA, which monitors air traffic; the FDA, which \ninspects food quality and safety; and a host of dozens of other Federal \nprograms would come to a halt within days.\n  The consequences to the safety of our families, to the strength of \nour economy, to the confidence of our country, and to our role at home \nand abroad would, in my view, be tragic--almost catastrophic. So even \nif we could avoid technically defaulting for a few days or weeks by \ncontinuing to service our debt, the costs and consequences of these \nother ``easy choices'' would be dramatic, difficult, and lasting.\n  According to Steve McMillin, who was the former Deputy Director of \nOMB under President Bush--he was recently quoted on this topic:\n\n       I would say the options Treasury has if the debt limit is \n     not raised are all very ugly.\n\n  Let me give a third myth. As I was talking with some small business \nowners in Delaware over the past week, some suggested they really felt \nwe needed to go ahead and take the tough medicine of defaulting and cut \nup the President's credit card, stop the President from spending.\n  While I share their concerns about the very real and very significant \nthreat posed by our deep deficits and share the view that we must cut \nspending--as all of us who are Democrats on the Budget Committee have \nsaid now publicly, we are committed to a balanced approach that \nsignificantly cuts Federal spending--the metaphor of cutting up the \ncredit cards is wrong. It is not just wrong, it is desperately wrong \nand misleading. Our Nation defaulting on its debt is not like cutting \nup a credit card and stopping the future spending; it is much more like \ndefaulting on a mortgage; it hurts our credit rating and hinders our \nability to borrow. As we have been told before, every 1 percent \nincrease in interest rates will cause our national debt to go up $1.3 \ntrillion over 10 years. According to some economists, increased \ninterest rates could last for a decade or more.\n  No, the obligations that come due August 2 are the obligations that \nhave already been undertaken. As Senator Harkin said before me, it is \nRepublicans, both President and Congress, and Democrats, both President \nand Congress, over the last decade who have moved us into a bigger \nhouse as a\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\ncountry. It is the cost of two wars, the cost of an expanded Medicare \nPart D, the cost of expanding investment in our country--the cost of \nthis bigger house that is now coming due. For us to stop paying that \nmortgage would have the same consequences for our country as it would \nfor any family because when you default on your mortgage, it is not \nlike cutting up a credit card, it affects your credit rating, and it \naffects your ability to borrow and your ability to do anything more for \nyour family for years to come. So, too, would the consequences be for \nthis country, and we cannot afford to let our country become a bad \ninvestment.\n  Lastly, some have suggested that August 2 is not a serious deadline, \nthat somehow Secretary Geithner must have some other rabbit in the hat \nor some escape hatch.\n  Back in January, Secretary Geithner sent a letter to all in Congress \nsuggesting that we would, in fact, run out of money on May 16, and the \ngovernment--the Treasury Department--would then have to start taking \nextraordinary measures to avoid default. In fact, he detailed in six \npages all the extraordinary measures that would be required. And he was \nright almost literally to the day about when that transition occurred \nand when those extraordinary measures needed to be deployed.\n  The time runs out August 2, but if for some reason you don't believe \nthe deadline presented to us by our very own Secretary of the Treasury \nand the Treasury Department, look at what the three bond rating \nagencies are already saying about the impending default. Moody's, S, \nand Fitch have all threatened to downgrade America's rating from AAA--\nthe most secure, most stable in the world. S suggested last week a \ndowngrade to D, to junk bond status. I suggest America is not a junk \nbond nation. It puts us at risk as a nation, as a people, and as an \neconomy when we are mentioned in the same sentences as Ireland, as \nGreece, as Italy--countries currently wrestling with fundamental \nfailures to meet their obligations as a country. We are better than \nthat.\n  All of us in this Chamber--all of us--are challenged to come together \nto put our economy and our country back on solid footing, to restore \ncertainty to the markets, and to give confidence to retirees, to \nfamilies, to parents raising children, and to small businesses by \ngetting serious about putting a plan on this floor next week and \npassing it because, frankly, if we allow this country to default on its \nsovereign debts, to fail to meet its moral commitments, both financial \nand to the people of the United States, the consequences will be \ndesperate and lasting.\n  I suggested a few weeks ago that we should consider seriously the \nBipartisan Policy Center's proposal--the so-called SAVEGO--which would \npick up where the pay-as-you-go discipline of the 1990s started and \nmodernize it for our current situation. If we cannot get a \ncomprehensive $4 trillion balanced deal together on this floor and \npassed, let's at least get a downpayment and enforce a budget mechanism \nthat would ensure that a comprehensive deal is accomplished over the \nnext decade. SAVEGO, which I recommend to everyone in this body, would \nlock in savings over the next decade, force both parties to stay at the \ntable, and urge us to meet the targets we all know we need to meet: to \nreduce our deficits, to stabilize our debts, to strengthen our country, \nand to move past this tragic narrow debate over August 2 and our \nNation's mortgage.\n  We need to focus not on the next election cycle, not on the partisan \nback-and-forth that might win an advantage for one party over another \nor one person over another in this Chamber for 2012, but we need \ninstead to focus on the next generation, on the future.\n  The only way forward, in my view, is to honor our moral commitments \nas a nation to the men and women who rely on Medicare and Medicaid and \nSocial Security, on the safety of our troops, and on the investments we \nmake in the future, and to continue to honor our obligations as a \nnation. To do anything less is to dishonor the sacrifice of those who \nhave served us in the past and to ignore the very real needs of the \nworking families all over this country who look to us for leadership \nand sacrifice to put us on a sustainable path forward.\n  Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are at a pivotal moment in American \nhistory, and I think many Americans are confused and perplexed and \nangry and frustrated as to where we are today and how we got to where \nwe are and what the consequences of decisions made in the past and that \nare being made right now will mean to their families. Let me just take \na minute and try to give my view as to how we got to where we are and \nwhat our options are.\n  As you have just stated, Mr. President, and Senator Harkin before \nyou, anyone who talks blithely about defaults and saying it is not a \nbig deal for this country clearly does not understand what he or she is \ntalking about.\n  This is the greatest Nation in the history of the world. This is a \nnation whose faith and credit has been the gold standard of countries \nthroughout the world. This is a nation, since George Washington, which \nhas paid out every nickel it has borrowed, which is, in fact, why it is \nthe great Nation it is and why we have the strongest economy in the \nworld today, troubled though it may be.\n  The idea for some people to simply say: Oh, not a big deal; we are \nnot going to pay our debt, nothing to worry about, those are people who \nare wishing our economy harm for political reasons, and those are \npeople whose attitudes will have terrible consequences for virtually \nevery working family in this country in terms of higher interest rates, \nin terms of significant job loss, in terms of making a very unstable \nglobal economy even more unstable.\n  This country, which has paid its debts from day one, must pay its \ndebts. I can't say it any more clearly than that.\n  Our Republican friends, especially our rightwing friends who now \ncontrol the House of Representatives, have given us an option and here \nis their option. What they have said is: We want to do deficit \nreduction, and this is how we are going to do it. We are going to end \nMedicare as we know it and force elderly people, many of whom don't \nhave the money, to pay substantially more for their health care. So \nunder their plan, when a person is 70 and they get sick and they don't \nhave a whole lot of income, they don't know what happens to them. They \nforgot to tell us. But what they did tell us is Medicare is not going \nto be there for them. They told us that tomorrow, if their plan was \npassed, they are going to have to pay a heck of a lot more for the \nprescription drugs than they are paying today. Oh, you don't have the \nmoney? Hey, that is not our problem.\n  They told us we are going to make savage cuts in Medicaid, throw \nmillions of kids off health insurance, when 50 million Americans have \nno health insurance today. They want millions more without any health \ninsurance.\n  If your mom or dad is in a nursing home and that nursing home bill is \npaid significantly by Medicaid and Medicaid isn't paying anymore, they \nforgot to tell us what happens to your mom or dad in that nursing home. \nWhat happens? What happens today if one is unemployed and not able to \nget an unemployment extension? What happens to the middle-class family, \ndesperately trying to send their kids to college and we make savage \ncuts in Pell grants and they can't go to college? What does it mean for \nthe Nation if we are not bringing forth young people who have the \neducation they need? They forgot to tell us that. If you are one of the \ngrowing numbers of senior citizens in this country who are going \nhungry, they want to cut nutrition programs.\n  On and on it goes. Every program that has any significance to working \nfamilies, the sick, the elderly, children, the poor, they are going to \ncut, and they are going to cut in a savage way. They are going to do \nthat in the midst of a recession, where real unemployment is already at \n15 percent and the middle class is disappearing and poverty is \nincreasing. That is their idea.\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\n  When we say to them: Well, hey, the very rich are doing phenomenally \nwell; the top 1 percent now earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent; the top 400 wealthiest families in this country have more \nwealth than the 150 million Americans--don't you think maybe it is \nappropriate that when the rich are getting richer and their tax rates \nhave gone down, their effective tax rates are the lowest in modern \nhistory, when major corporations are making billions of profits and in \nsome cases not paying a nickel in taxes, don't you think maybe it is \nfair that they contribute to deficit reduction rather than just the \nelderly and the sick and working families, they say: No. We have a line \nin the sand, and if it means this country will default on its debt for \nthe first time in history, that is OK. But we are absolutely going to \ndefend the richest people in this country, millionaires and \nbillionaires, and make sure they don't pay a nickel more in taxes. We \nare going to make sure there is no tax reform so we can continue to \nlose $100 billion every single year because wealthy people and \ncorporations stash their money in tax havens in the Cayman Islands or \nBermuda, and that is just fine. We will protect those tax breaks while \nwe savage programs for working families.\n  Those are the choices our rightwinged Republican friends are giving \nus: defaults with horrendous economic consequences for working families \nin this country and, in fact, for the entire global economy or massive \ncuts to programs working families desperately need.\n  Neither of those options is acceptable to me, and neither are those \noptions acceptable to the vast majority of the people in this country. \nEvery single poll I have seen says that the American people want shared \nsacrifice. They don't want or believe that deficit reduction can simply \ncome down on the backs of the weak and the vulnerable, the elderly, the \nchildren, and the poor; that the wealthy and large corporations also \nhave to participate.\n  I must, also, in all honesty, tell you I have been disappointed by \nthe President's role in these discussions and some of his ideas. He has \nbrought forth an idea which I categorically reject, that we should make \nsignificant cuts in Social Security; that when someone reaches the age \nof 85, they would lose $1,000 as opposed to what they would otherwise \nhave gotten. This Senator is not going to balance our budget on the \nbacks of an 85-year-old person who is earning $14,000 a year--not with \nmy vote.\n  This Senator does not agree with the President that we raise the \neligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67 because I don't know what \nhappens to millions of people who work their whole lives, finally reach \n65 anticipating Medicare, but it is not going to be there for them. So \nI very strongly disagree with the President on those initiatives.\n  Let me tell you that elections have consequences, and I think many \npeople now are beginning to catch on to that. It is no secret our \nrightwinged Republican colleagues did very well in November 2010. They \ncaptured the House of Representatives, and now, 1 year-plus later, for \nthe first time in the history of this country, we are on the verge of a \ndefault.\n  I would close by saying to people all over this country, if you \nbelieve we have to start investing in America and creating the millions \nof jobs this country desperately needs, elections have consequences.\n  If you believe we have to address the deficit crisis in a way that is \nresponsible, in a way that asks the wealthy and large corporations also \nto play a role, in a way, as Senator Harkin mentioned a moment ago, \nthat calls for cuts in defense spending and bringing our troops home as \nsoon as possible from Afghanistan and Iraq, you have to be involved in \nthe political process, in my view.\n  A group of people in the House whose views represent a small minority \nof the American people are holding this Congress hostage, and it is \ntime for the American people to stand and say enough is enough. The \nfunction of the Congress is to represent all our people and not just \nthe wealthiest and most powerful.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask that the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor as someone who is \nback in my home State every weekend. As I talk to people and say: What \nis on your mind, they say what is on their mind are jobs, the economy, \nthe Nation's debt, and the Nation's spending. I say: What do you think \nabout things going on in Washington? They say the problem with \nWashington is it taxes too much, borrows too much, and the government \ngrows bigger every day, and they say: What are we going to do about it? \nWhen we talk about the debt, the people of Wyoming have a clear \nunderstanding that the number is very large.\n  They say: What about the budget? As we get into the discussion, it \ncomes down to: What budget? Where is the budget? It has been 800 days \nsince a budget has gone through this body--over 800 days. You are \ntalking more than 2 years. Why is that?\n  There was a vote on the budget earlier this year. There was the \nPresident's so-called budget, lost 97 to 0. Not even one Democrat voted \nfor what the President had proposed. The news magazine The Economist \ncalled it a dishonest budget. In Wyoming, we balance our budget every \nyear. We do not have a debt like the country has, the country with its \n$14 trillion debt. In Wyoming, the debt is zero because year after year \nwe balance our budget, live within our means, spend only what comes in, \nand actually have money left over that we can invest in the people of \nour State. That is because from the beginning, when the constitution of \nour State was written, included right there in the constitution was a \ncomponent saying: You shall balance the budget every year. Do not spend \nmore than you have coming in.\n\n  To do that, one of the most useful things is that there actually be a \nbudget, something to live within, something to look to as a guidepost, \nas a roadmap. I am still looking for one in this body. Where is it? Why \nhave we not seen one? That is why I am coming to the floor today with a \nnumber of my colleagues to say: What is going on that it has been over \n800 days with no budget, no opportunity to have the American people \nlook to a roadmap to see where the country is headed?\n  We hear all the discussion about, are we headed to a default? What \nabout the debt limit? What about the ceiling--is that going to be \nraised? The people say: What is the plan? What is the spending plan? \nWhat is the savings plan? I do not hear one coming for the majority \nparty. I do not see one from the majority leader. I do not see one from \nthe Budget Committee. I do not see one from the President. They are \nhaving discussions at the White House about how to try to get spending \nunder control. Where is the President's plan?\n  What I hear from the President is that he wants to raise taxes. The \npeople of Wyoming would say the best way for more revenue to come in is \nnot to raise taxes on the people who are working, it is to put some of \nthose 9.2 percent of Americans who are looking for work, put them to \nwork, and then that money will come in as they pay taxes.\n  I come today to the floor with a number of my colleagues--Senator \nSessions, the Senator from Alabama has arrived--and we are going to be \nengaged in a colloquy to discuss some of these issues.\n  We ought to be focusing on these 9.2 percent of Americans who cannot \nfind work, millions of Americans who cannot find jobs. When I talk to \nthe job creators, they are saying it is the President's position and \nhis policies that have made matters worse--made matters worse with \nincreasing health care costs as a result of the health care law, made \nmatters worse as a result of the regulations that came out of \nWashington that add costs onto businesses, and making it worse in \nincreased energy costs as the President continues to send energy jobs \noverseas, as he makes it harder and harder to explore for American \nenergy.\n  I ask my colleague, Senator Sessions, to give us his thoughts, if I \ncould, on the concerns we face as a nation without a budget, without a \nplan,\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\nwithout a roadmap, at a time of astronomical deficits, huge numbers, \nnumbers that are too high for people even to understand and comprehend.\n  (Mrs. McCASKILL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Barrasso and his \nleadership on so many issues in this Senate.\n  It is a sad event that we are now filing an objection to the movement \nof an appropriations bill because it violates the Budget Act contained \nin the United States Code. The Budget Act says you shall not move \nforward with an appropriations bill if you have not first passed the \nbudget.\n  I ask my friend from Wyoming, as an accomplished orthopedic surgeon \nand physician and from his personal experience in the legislature in \nhis State, does it strike him that when you are in the most serious \ndebt crisis that perhaps the Nation has ever had from a structural, \nsystemic point of view, that we ought to follow the law, we ought to \nfirst decide how much money we can afford to spend next year and then \nallocate that money to the various spending appropriations committees \nso they can produce a plan that would live within that budget? Is that \nthe commonsense way we should proceed?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would say absolutely yes. If you are \na family in Wyoming, I don't care if you are living in Casper or living \nin Kemmerer, either way you know you need to live within some construct \nof how much is coming in, how much you can spend--live within a budget. \nFamilies have budgets. They live within their budgets. The State of \nWyoming has a budget. We have a balanced budget component of our \nconstitution. It not only says we have to have a budget, it says we \nhave to balance it. If you do not have a budget to begin with, I cannot \nunderstand how you can balance it.\n  Is it any surprise that we are $14 trillion in debt and we are \nborrowing $4 billion a day, $2 million a minute in this country, and we \nare borrowing a lot of it from China? It would seem we ought to be \nfollowing the law--have a budget and then live within the budget, and \nit needs to be a responsible budget consistent with what is coming in.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We appreciate our colleagues who worked on this bill, \nbut there are more appropriations that should be done this year. How \ncan they be continued without a budget? You say we spent within the \nPresident's numbers or the House numbers, but those have not been \napproved in the Senate. We have no votes in the Senate. It is not a \nbinding number.\n  The truth is, what we need to do is what the House did, I believe. I \nask Senator Barrasso, isn't it true that the Republican House, with a \nnew leadership, came in, they faced up to the 10-year budget window we \nhave, they laid out a plan for 10 years, and it cut spending by $6 \ntrillion? It actually simplified our Tax Code substantially and reduced \ncertain taxes, focusing on tax reductions that create growth so we \ncould have more income generated. And, whether you agree with it or \nnot, by April 15 they did all this, which is what this code says. \nDoesn't the Senator think they have done their duty? What would he say \nabout the failure of the Senate to even attempt to present a budget?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The House has approved a budget. They presented a \nbudget, debated a budget, discussed a budget, and passed a budget. \nThere has been nothing in the Senate for over 800 days.\n  On the weekends, people at home tell me: We have to stop spending \nmoney we do not have. We expect better. We expect better of those who \nare elected to go to Washington and represent us. We expect better.\n  They also believe that the money they are sending to Washington--it \nis their money, not Washington's money--the money they are sending to \nWashington, people do not believe they are getting value for their \ndollar. If you asked ``Of every dollar you are sending in, how much \nvalue are you getting back,'' it is an alltime low--50 cents on the \ndollar. People don't think they are getting value.\n  People want an efficient government. That is not what they are \nfinding today. They are finding amazing amounts of waste, fraud, and \nabuse. Fundamentally, they are not finding a budget, a roadmap, a plan, \nand then life within that. That is why I come to the Senate floor with \nmy colleague from Alabama today to say the law is specific--not just in \nthe State of Wyoming but also in the United States--that we need to \nhave a budget.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The law is specific, and the need is there whether we \nhad a law or not. The law doesn't require families to have budgets, but \nfamilies who are smartly managing their money have budgets. Businesses \nhave budgets. No law requires them to have budgets, but it is because \nit is the only way to manage your money. It is an unacceptable \nsituation in which we find ourselves.\n  Let me ask the Senator, I want to try to boil it down to the nub, why \nwe have not done it, why the majority in the Senate has not proceeded \nwith a budget.\n  Let me just say that a budget is considered so important that, unlike \nother legislation, it can be passed with a simple majority. It cannot \nbe filibustered. It has priority process to be moved rapidly on the \nfloor. It cannot be blocked. The goal is that you could pass a budget. \nEven a party, if they wanted to do it on a straight party-line basis, \nwith over 50 votes could pass a budget.\n  I am trying to focus on whether there is something broken about the \nSenate. Is there something broken that causes us not to be effective? \nIs there something broken in the way we operate that would have kept \nthe Budget Committee from bringing a budget forward and voting on it in \ncommittee and passing it out of committee? They did that last year. Is \nthere any reason the Senator can think of, of a substantive nature, \nthat would have blocked that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would say the only reason I know is someone \nintentionally does not want to bring a budget to the floor of the \nSenate. If a budget were on the floor of the Senate, then we could look \nthrough it, read it, people at home could look through it, have some \ninput, call, write, talk to us at townhall meetings, and say we ought \nto try to amend this proposal to spend less money over here, more money \nover there, and try to decide the best way to work together as a nation \nto improve opportunities for people in this country.\n  That is what a family budget does. They don't have to by law, but \nsmart families do that. They make plans, they think ahead, and not just \n3 months or 6 months, families look ahead and put money aside for \ncollege opportunities. They think about whether they will need a new \ncar, a roof sometime down the line--what will they need? That is what a \nbudget is all about.\n  I see no reason fundamentally why there is no budget proposed by the \nmajority party here on the floor for all of the country to take a look \nat, all of the country to say: Yes, change this, more here, less there, \nprioritize, and let the country work.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, unless you are unwilling to \ntell the American people where you stand, unwilling to put real numbers \non paper--you prefer to say: American people, don't worry about it; we \nare meeting in secret over here. Don't worry about it; we have the Vice \nPresident, and he called some Senators together, and he is going to fix \nit. You guys who serve on committees and the Finance Committee where \ntaxes have to be voted on, should be voted on are no longer relevant. \nThe system is broken.\n  They are saying: We are not going to go along with this, and it is \nnot because it will not work, it is because the budget presented by the \nPresident, the only budget we have seen here increased taxes \nsubstantially, it increased spending even more than that, and it \nincreased the debt more than if we had done nothing over the 10 years.\n  I see our colleague, Senator Toomey, a new Senator but not new to the \nbudget process because he was a member of the Budget Committee in the \nHouse.\n  What I am frustrated about, and I believe people should be frustrated \nabout, is this policy decision by the leadership in the Senate that it \nwas foolish to produce a budget. That is not a sign that the Senate is \nbroken; it is a sign that the leadership is broken. It is a sign the \nleadership does not have the courage to actually stand before the \nAmerican people and produce a plan, because it either would raise taxes \ntoo much, not cut spending enough, or\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\nraise the debt too much. I think that is irresponsible, but I have to \nsay, Senator Toomey, a new member of our Senate, has produced a budget. \nHe laid it out right at our committee, and he was prepared, as a member \nof our committee, to produce his budget and advocate for it. You know \nwhat happened? We did not meet. I cannot call the committee into \nsession. I am the ranking Republican. Senator Toomey cannot call the \ncommittee into session and have a vote. They decided not to meet, not \nto do their duty. They are going to meet in secret somewhere and have \ntheir little discussions about what they want to do, and the people who \nare elected to be accountable to the American people for what we do \nwith their money are standing around wondering what is happening. \nForgive me if I am not happy. I do not think it is right. I think it is \nweakening the Senate. I believe our constitutional responsibility is \nnot being fulfilled if we end up with some big deal bill on August 1, \nand we are told it has to be passed by August 2, and you can find out \nwhat is in it after we pass it. I am not there. Count me out.\n\n  We had more people wanting to get on the Budget Committee this year. \nThey were so excited. It was the most wanted committee to be on in the \nentire Senate, and we have not done anything. The Senator was selected \nto be on the committee, which is a tribute to his experience, and I \nguess I would ask, how does the Senator feel about where we are?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator for raising this issue because I do \nthink this is a very important issue. Many of us wanted to be on the \nBudget Committee because we see what a critical moment our country is \nin. We see the very dire straits we have put ourselves in because of \nthe fiscal irresponsibility of Washington, and some of us believe we do \nnot have a lot of time to get this in order. So I was looking forward \nto the opportunity to serve on the committee that would design the \nblueprint for our entire fiscal policy for this year and hopefully \nbeyond.\n  I think this is a fundamental responsibility, frankly, of any \nresponsible organization, to have a budget. I ran a small business for \nyears, my own little business. We always had a budget. The corner pizza \nshop has a budget. We are the biggest enterprise in the world, the U.S. \nGovernment. We spend $3.6 trillion, and for the majority party to \nchoose--I have to say cynically--not to even write a budget, to \nabdicate that fundamental responsibility to lay out for the American \npeople how much money they want to spend, on what they want to spend \nit, where the money is going to come from, to abdicate that \nresponsibility is shocking.\n  To make matters worse, they have a statutory obligation to do this, \nso it is actually also illegal, and here we are without a budget. We \nare about to run out of this year's funding. When we come back from the \nAugust break, we are going to be passing some huge omnibus. Who knows \nwhat is in that. We have a broken-down process. I believe it has \ncontributed to where we are today with this debt limit.\n  By the way, a brief aside, if I could, about this debt limit issue. \nWe had a discussion today in the Banking Committee--Federal Reserve \nBoard Chairman Bernanke was there to testify--and it was a useful \ndiscussion. Unfortunately, after I left the committee, I learned later \nSenator Schumer began to discuss some of my remarks with Chairman \nBernanke, and in the process he grossly mischaracterized what I said. I \nam quite sure Senator Schumer would never intentionally mischaracterize \nthe remarks of one of his colleagues. So what I wish to do is clarify \nwhat was actually said so that in the future it won't be \nmischaracterized. I had observed that the Treasury will have more than \nenough cash coming in in the form of tax receipts to pay the interest \non our debt in the event that we didn't raise the debt ceiling on \nAugust 2. I immediately went on to say, and I will now quote myself, if \nyou will allow. I said:\n\n       Now, I don't know of anybody that suggests that we can or \n     should go indefinitely without raising the debt ceiling, and \n     I have argued that we would certainly be much better off \n     reaching an agreement and raising the debt ceiling prior to \n     August 2.\n\n  That was characterized by Senator Schumer as follows and I will quote \nhim. He said:\n\n       For a smart guy--\n\n  He was referring to me, believe it or not.\n\n       I mean, to say we can pay the obligations and not pay the \n     rest and that that is just fine. Wow, I'm sort of surprised \n     at it.\n\n  Well, obviously I never said it was fine. What I have said is we have \na dire crisis on our hands and we need to do something about it, and I \ndon't know we are going to get another opportunity than the opportunity \nover this question of whether and when and by how much we will raise \nthe debt limit, but I am not going to sit by idly, and I am not going \nto go along with some deal that raises the debt limit without making \nthe real cuts in spending we need and the real process reform.\n  As Senator Sessions knows, some of us have advocated that there be a \nsimple deal, if you will, preferably one that we would discuss in \npublic, one we would have a debate over, one we would have a vote on. \nThe deal is simply this: We will agree to raise the debt limit by the \nfull amount the President has requested, provided only that the \nPresident agree to put us on a path to a balanced budget. That is it. \nWe call it cut, cap, and balance. It has some immediate cuts. It has \nspending caps that put us on the path to a balanced budget, and it \ncalls for the adoption of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  We had a Democratic President named William Clinton who, together \nwith the Republican Congress in the 1990s, acknowledged the importance \nof reaching a balanced budget. None of us think we can do it overnight. \nNone of us are calling for that. But back then in the 1990s they \ndecided they would strive for it and, in fact, they achieved it. We \nreached a balanced budget and ran a modest surplus.\n  All I am asking today as we confront this issue and as we contemplate \nsaddling ourselves and our kids and grandkids with a debt more than we \nhave now, what I am suggesting is at the same time we take the measures \nnecessary to get us out of this mess, to prevent us from going further \ndown this unsustainable path and to get to the point where we don't \ncontinue running deficits, a path to a balanced budget. Cut spending \nnow, statutory spending caps, and a balanced budget amendment. We now \nhave a big majority of Republican Senators who cosponsored this bill \nthat would raise the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion, provided we get \nthese changes. I am increasingly optimistic the House might very well \npass a bill that would raise the debt limit contingent only on this \npath to a balanced budget.\n  While we are down here today, I think this is what we ought to be \ntalking about. We should not go on to an appropriations bill that has \nno context because there has been no budget. We ought to be focused on \ngetting this problem solved and then get back to the regular order of \nhaving a budget that defines the level of spending and where that money \nis going to come from and allows us to pursue the ordinary \nappropriation process so we can exercise our constitutional \nresponsibility to control the purse strings of this Federal Government.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for raising this issue. This is a very \nimportant issue, and I agree with the Senator wholeheartedly that it is \na travesty that we don't have a budget in this body. I certainly hope \nwe don't go further down this path.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. He has been such \na fabulous addition to the committee, talented and experienced and \nworked so hard that he has actually laid out a budget himself. The \nPresident has 500 people. The Congress here has a lot of staffers. \nSenator Toomey has produced a budget. The House has produced a budget, \nbut we have not seen one here.\n  I am pleased my colleague, another member of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Ron Johnson, is here. He is a business person who traveled his \nstate and talked with his constituents about his concerns about the \ndebt this country faces.\n  I am pleased to hear Senator Johnson's thoughts at this time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank the Senator. First of all, I thank \nthe Senator for his leadership on this issue. I share your concern \nabout the dysfunction of not only this body, our Budget Committee, but \nWashington in general. I mean, Washington is broken.\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nWe are currently conducting business as usual here in Washington, and \nit is bankrupting our Nation.\n\n  Certainly having spent 34 years as a manufacturer, I recognize you \nhave to have a good process if you are going to have a good product. \nAnd because our process here is so broken, that is one of the reasons \nwe are bankrupting this Nation--because we don't have a good process. \nIt is, to me, unbelievable that in the Senate we haven't passed a \nbudget now in--what is it--805 or 806 days? Over 2 years we have not \npassed a budget yet in this body. As an accountant--that is my \nbackground--I had to produce a budget on time for a wide variety of \nsizes of businesses, and it is simply unbelievable to me when I know \nhow hard individuals and businesses work to produce a budget. And, by \nthe way, they generally present those budgets on time. They don't miss \nthe budget dates. But they actually produce a budget, and there is an \nawful lot of work that goes into those budgets.\n  I come here after 34 years in business, and I come here to the Senate \nunderstanding, again, not because I want to be a Senator but because I \nrealize we are bankrupting this Nation, that America is in peril. I get \nhere, and I hope to get on the Budget Committee so I can actually start \nsolving this problem. I get on the Budget Committee, and I am ready to \nroll up my shirt sleeves and start working on the problem. What did we \nhold? I think we had six hearings on the President's budget, a budget \nthat was so unserious that it lost in this body 0 to 97. Not one Member \nof the President's own party thought it was serious enough or maybe it \ndidn't spend quite enough for them. Maybe it didn't tax enough for \nthem. But, for whatever reason, not one member of the President's own \nparty decided to vote for that budget. I think that is a stunning \nrepudiation.\n  It is very disappointing, quite honestly, because right now, as our \ncountry faces bankruptcy, we are hungry for leadership and we are not \ngetting any. The fact is if the President were serious about addressing \nthis issue, if he were serious about attacking this problem, he would \nhave been coming to us months ago to negotiate in good faith to prevent \nthe bankrupting of America, but that hasn't happened.\n  So what is happening now? For the last few weeks we have been holding \nsome secret meetings, far from the view of the American public. I am \nnot sure, is that how we are going to solve the financial future of \nAmerica? I came here to work. I came here to be engaged in debate. I \nwas hoping we would have a very open process under general order, but \nthat is not what is happening. What I am afraid is we are going to end \nup with a deal that is going to be dropped in our laps with a couple of \ndays to go, like with the health care law, like Dodd-Frank. All of a \nsudden we get these thousand-page bills dumped in our laps with no time \nto review, and then you start to see the unintended consequences. That \nis a real shame.\n  I just came from a press conference where every Member of the \nfreshman class--we had a meeting this morning--and we were talking \nabout, what can we do? I mean, we all came here in a very sincere \ndesire to actually solve the problem. One of the things we talked about \nis how President Obama, rather than being serious about this, rather \nthan tackling the problem, is willing to scare seniors and members of \nour military. We thought that was over the line. So we sent a letter to \nthe President today asking: Please, step to the plate. Seriously \naddress the problem. Stop scaring our seniors. Work with us. We want to \nhelp you solve the problem.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I thank him for his great group of \nfreshmen Senators who have added so much common sense to our problem. \nWe were not elected to preside over the financial decline of America. \nWe were not elected to skirt the law. We were not elected to shut down \ncommittees, to shut down debate, to cede our constitutional \nresponsibility to secret meetings and closed-door proceedings. We were \nelected to do our duty, and there is no higher duty than to protect the \nAmerican people from a clear and present danger. For that reason, I \nwill oppose cloture on today's motion to waive section 303(c) of the \nBudget Act. I will vote to sustain the budgetary point of order, and I \nwill encourage my colleagues to support my amendment raising that \nbudget point of order to a threshold of 60 votes.\n  This is only the beginning of our fight. There will be more votes, \nmore objections, more points of order working with my colleagues. I \nwill give all that I have to help put this country on a sound, honest, \nfinancial path. Washington must recognize that America's strength does \nnot lie in the size of our government, but in the scope of our freedoms \nand in the hearts of our people. The debt we have today is already \npulling down our economic growth. Experts tell us we have lost 1 \npercent of economic growth because our debt exceeds 90 percent of our \ntotal economy--90 percent of GDP. It is 95 percent of GDP right now. We \nwill reach 100 percent of GDP by the end of this year. That alone \nreduces growth, according to the experts. Secretary of the Treasury \nGeithner said he thought that was an excellent study that found that \nfact.\n\n  What does 1 percent growth mean? Well, instead of the first quarter \nhaving 1.8 or 2 percent growth, we would have had 3 percent growth. If \nwe had 3 percent growth instead of 2 percent growth, 1 million more \njobs would be added per year, based on just the alteration of the \ndifference between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth.\n  We have to face these problems. I hope our colleagues are reaching a \ndecision about how to proceed that can be successful. We have to make \nprogress this year. We are going to have to sustain progress for a \ndecade. If we do so, we will put this country on the right path. If we \nget that debt down--it is not too hard to do it--we will start seeing \nour growth come back, more jobs being created, more wealth being \ncreated, more taxes being paid, less help to people who are in need \nbecause they are now working when they weren't.\n  So I thank the Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to share these \nremarks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer and receive a vote on an amendment to this bill \nwhich relates to a 303(c) point of order that requires adoption of a \nbudget resolution prior to the consideration of any appropriations \nbills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, the amendment is not \ngermane to the bill. I am trying to keep this bill bipartisan and free \nof extraneous matters. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the motion to \nwaive section 303 of the Budget Act and to allow the Senate to move \nforward with its consideration of the MilconVA appropriations bill. I \nwould like to say for the record that I agree with the Senator from \nAlabama that it would be preferable for the Senate to have passed a \nbudget resolution prior to its consideration of individual \nappropriations bills.\n  In fact, on March 10 of this year, I stated my strong desire to move \nall of the fiscal year 2012 bills through regular order, which of \ncourse begins with the passage of a budget resolution and adoption of \nour 302(a) allocation. Unfortunately, such is not the case this year. \nAs we are all painfully aware, the current impasse over the budget is a \ndirect result of the unwillingness of some in Congress to negotiate a \ncomprehensive solution to our long-term deficit problem.\n  We are all well aware of these realities. It is my strong belief, \nhowever, that we must not allow the needs of our military or our \nveterans to be held hostage by the current budget stalemate. And while \nit is true that we do not have an overall allocation for discretionary \nappropriations, for the MilconVA bill we were able to agree with our \nHouse colleagues on an acceptable allocation. Therefore, there is\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nno reason to delay consideration of this bill.\n  It is important that all of our colleagues understand that what we \nare recommending is not unprecedented. In fact, the Senate has acted on \nappropriations legislation absent a budget resolution four times in the \npast decade, including twice under Republican control. It is my strong \ndesire, as I believe it is the desire of every member of the \nAppropriations Committee, that we move our bills under regular order. \nHowever, with less than 90 days left in the fiscal year and no budget \nresolution in sight, efforts need to be made to ensure the livelihood \nof our veterans and their families are not disrupted.\n  This is not a controversial bill. It passed out of the full committee \nunanimously, by a vote of 30-0. Yesterday, 89 Senators voted in favor \nof the motion to proceed to the bill. Finally, my colleagues should \nknow that many of the provisions of this bill were voted on in the \nArmed Services Committee which was also passed unanimously, by a vote \nof 22-0. That is a great deal of support for moving forward with this \nmeasure. And, I am aware of no serious opposition to the substance of \nthe bill.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nwaiving the budget point of order and allowing the Senate to move \nforward with its consideration of the fiscal year 2012 Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, there is a cloture \nmotion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to waive the points of order under section 303 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 for H.R. 2055, and any amendments or \nmotions thereto, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

That is not going to work anymore. It is going to \naffect Democrats and Republicans.\n  Madam President, this will be the last vote of the week. We will more \nthan likely be in session tomorrow. There will be no votes tomorrow. If \nthere are people who want to offer amendments, the two managers of this \nbill, Senator Johnson and Senator Kirk are here. They are here tonight. \nThis vote coming up will be the last vote of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. VITTER.

The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I am pleased that we are beginning \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2012 Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill.\n  This bill passed out of the Committee on Appropriations by a \nunanimous vote of 30 to 0. It is the hope of the committee that such \nstrong, bipartisan support will continue as the full Senate debates \nthis measure and that we will be able to consider germane amendments in \na reasonable period of time, pass the bill, and move on to a conference \nwith the House.\n  As we continue to debate the larger fiscal challenges our Nation \nfaces, I note that the level of funding in the Senate mark of this \nMILCON-VA bill is consistent with the level of funding in the House-\npassed measure.\n  I thank Chairman Johnson and Vice Chairman Kirk for their brilliant \nwork in producing a bill that provides essential support to our \nveterans, our Active-Duty military, and their families. The resources \nprovided in this bill will fund vital construction projects and will \nensure that our wounded veterans and warriors receive the excellent \ncare they deserve.\n  It is good we are moving the first of our fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations bills under regular order. As I have said on numerous \noccasions, the best way to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is spent \nwisely is to move our 12 bills through the committee, the full Senate, \nto a conference with the House, and through final passage in both \nChambers.\n  Our ability to work together on this important bill serves as a \nreminder that bipartisan compromise can be achieved by the Congress, \neven in the most difficult of budget environments. It is my hope that \nthe spirit of bipartisanship embodied in this bill will serve as a \nmodel for the remaining fiscal year 2012 appropriations process.\n  I congratulate Chairman Johnson and Vice Chairman Kirk for their \nefforts. I look forward to returning to the floor at the earliest \npossible date with the next appropriations measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii for his kind word about the management of this bill. I join him \nin his congratulations to the two managers. We appreciate their hard \nwork.\n  The committee had extensive hearings and review of all the \nappropriations bills we are going to be taking up--a public hearing \nprocess, open for comments, with opportunities for people to express \ntheir views. They have done that in a diligent, careful, and \nresponsible manner. I think it is a credit to the Senate that we have \nconsidered this bill today. We look forward to continuing to work our \nway through all the appropriations bills that come under the \njurisdiction of the committee. I especially thank my friend from Hawaii \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING Betty Lou Reed\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, while we are waiting for authors of their \namendments to come to the floor to speak on a point of personal \nbusiness, I wanted to rise to eulogize one of my mentors in politics.\n  State Representative Betty Lou Reed died this week. She was somebody \nmany of us in northern Illinois looked up to. Betty Lou Reed served \nfrom her home community of Deerfield, IL. She knew Senator Everett \nDirksen well and helped in his campaigns for reelection. She was \nsomeone who practiced the art of politics from the fiscally \nconservative side but the ideological center. She was someone who was a \nrole model for many of us at the township, the State, and especially at \nthe Federal level.\n  I first met Betty Lou after she had retired from our State \nlegislature in Springfield, IL, when she served as the district \ndirector for Congressman John Porter. I remember a long visit with her, \nas she was showing me the congressional district where I grew up, from \na political point of view.\n  As we passed by the Zion nuclear reactor, she said: Whatever your \nfeelings from college, buddy boy, here we are pro nuclear power. And \nshe began to introduce me to the politics, especially of Lake County, \nIL.\n  Betty Lou Reed was someone who liked to drink her bourbon and branch \nwater, as she called it, regularly in the evening, telling old war \nstories about how things were done in Springfield, IL. She was always \nkind and considerate, and I never heard a swear word from her, ever--\ndespite the rough language that is used both in Springfield and in \nChicago.\n  Her husband was a staunch supporter of hers and always available for \nthe continuous set of parades and public meetings she went to. She \nguided us, especially in the consideration of the first Base \nRealignment and Closure Committee in which Ft. Sheridan--in Illinois, \nnext to her home district--was the poster child for disposal, given its \nhigh value and golf course next to Lake Michigan. We went through a \nnumber of proposals, such as bringing in a prison or homeless shelters, \net cetera, but finally came to a mutually agreed-upon solution of a set \nof public buildings, parks, and additions to Lake Forest, Highwood, and \nHighland Park.\n  Probably her greatest legacy was in supporting and teaching a young \nCongressman from our area, Congressman John Porter, the ropes and \nguiding him through difficult elections and tough partisan times. I \nserved as Congressman Porter's chief of staff while she, as she put it, \ngarnered the real votes back home and took care of business.\n  Betty Lou lost her husband a while ago, and she passed away this \nweek. Many of us in northern Illinois remember her not just as a \ntrusted public official and congressional staff member but as someone \nwho taught us the ropes--even those of us from Chicagoland--and how to \nexercise the art of politics, maybe more gently and with better \nlanguage than our predecessors.\n  I very much will miss Betty Lou Reed. I know Congressman Porter \nshares this sentiment, as do many of the staff and the political \nfamilies of northern Illinois, and I wanted to take this moment today \nin the Senate to mark her passing and say how very much we will miss \nher.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know we are on the MILCON \nappropriations bill, but I did not want to lose the opportunity to talk \nabout a pressing issue before the country today; that is, how we will \nwork to resolve the Nation's obligations to its creditors and what the \nfailure of doing that means to the Nation and to each and every \nAmerican. I rise to ask a simple question of my Republican colleagues: \nWhen is an entitlement not an entitlement? Apparently, given the \nrhetoric\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\nand actions of some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the \nanswer would be that an entitlement is not an entitlement when it \nbenefits an entitled class of wealthy Americans. In the Republicans' \nideological haze that is swirling around Washington these days, it is \nonly an entitlement when it goes to the middle-class families, to \nstudents, to seniors, to the disabled, to the downtrodden, and the \ndispossessed.\n  Those entitlements, according to the Republicans, should be on the \nchopping block. But entitlements to the wealthy can never be on the \ntable, despite the fact that our current Tax Code allows the wealthiest \n400 taxpayers in America to pay a smaller percentage of their income in \ntaxes than the average New Jersey family--less than the average New \nJersey family.\n  What Republicans will ultimately do, their goal in this debt \nnegotiation, is outlined in the House-passed budget that ends Medicare \nas we know it, the baseline of retirement security for our seniors, \nwhat was the retirement security of my mother in the twilight of her \nlife as she struggled against Alzheimer's, after having worked a \nlifetime to help build a family and be part of contributing to a \ncommunity. She would not have lived in the dignity she deserved in the \ntwilight of her life but for Medicare as we know it--and it makes a \nmiddle-class life in America more expensive and less accessible.\n  It seems to me the policies of our Republican friends would make sure \nthe rich get even more rich at the expense of the middle class. They \nthink the rich are entitled to all the tax loopholes they get but \nseniors and the disabled, they do not need the health benefits they are \ngetting. We call this leadership? Do they call it leadership, to stand \non ideology and send this Nation into default?\n  Default basically means being a deadbeat. I think average Americans \nunderstand what being a deadbeat is all about. We teach our children to \nmeet their responsibilities. We say do not incur a debt, but if you \nincur that debt, meet your responsibility--pay it. But now we have \nleaders in this Nation who say let's have this Nation be a deadbeat, \nand we would leave a senior citizen who lives--I know some of our \nfriends here who may not have an appreciation of this--who lives month \nto month only on Social Security, standing hopelessly on the front \nporch waiting for a check that may not come. You call that leadership?\n  We call it leadership to risk increasing interest rates on mortgages \nwhen families are struggling to pay at the current rates on student \nloans, on car payments, on credit cards that middle-class families can \nill-afford now? They call it leadership to risk leaving a wounded \nveteran without a benefit check or active military men and women, their \nfamilies, without a paycheck?\n  They call it leadership to risk a spike in prices that increases the \ncost of groceries and gas and potentially costs a middle-class family \nin New Jersey an additional $1,500? They call it leadership to risk an \nend to unemployment benefits to States, leaving those already \nstruggling in this economy at risk of losing what little they have?\n  They call it leadership to risk Medicaid payments to States for \ndisabled seniors in nursing homes who have no other options but \namazingly allow a millionaire who owns a stable of racehorses a \ndepreciation allowance on the Tax Code on those racehorses? That is an \nentitlement we should not touch? That is leadership? Bottom line, it is \nestimated that about $125 billion worth of bills, on average, may have \nto be put off if we don't deal with meeting the Nation's obligations.\n  It is not leadership if the dollar plummets and America loses. It is \nnot leadership if no one follows but the far rightwing of the \nRepublican Party. If we are going to balance the budget by limiting \nentitlements and subsidies and earmarks, perhaps we should begin with \nthose entitlements in the Tax Code that benefit those who are the \nwealthiest in the country. Perhaps we should look at ending \nentitlements for rich oil companies that receive $2 billion a year. \nThey receive in just two tax breaks that the code gives them $21 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Yet, oh, no, we can't touch that, but \nwe can tell some senior that, in fact, they have to be on the chopping \nblock; that Medicare has to end as we know it.\n  How about $6 billion for ethanol producers or how about the racehorse \ndepreciation allowance or the billions year after year that defense \ncontractors think they are entitled to? How about investing in new \nbridges and tunnels and a new state-of-the-art transportation system in \nNew Jersey instead of Kandahar?\n  Our friends on the other side who believe we should balance the \nbudget by spending cuts alone are more than willing to bargain away \nstudent loans, bargain away prescription drug coverage, even bargain \naway nursing home care for the elderly parents to protect entitlements \nfor big oil companies, billionaire corporate executives who travel the \nworld in private jets, and millionaires who believe they are entitled \nto all of the tax loopholes they are getting now after the biggest tax \ncut in history--entitled to tax cuts but not obligated to create \nAmerican jobs, contrary to the false rhetoric we hear from the other \nside about a correlation between entitlements for the wealthy and job \ncreation.\n  The hard rightwing of the Republican Party has come to the table \nwilling to give up nothing--unwilling to accept an offer by the \nPresident and Democrats of trillions of dollars in spending cuts, \npotential savings in entitlement programs, and tax reform options, all \nof which they have been demanding, unless we agree to protect the \nentitlements that exist for the wealthy. Not even a single penny on the \nrevenue side of the option. Don't touch those entitlements for the big \nfive oil companies. Don't touch the entitlements for the corporate \njets. Don't touch the entitlements for the racehorses. Don't touch any \nof those entitlements giving the tax breaks and having a code where an \nincredible universe of corporations in America don't even pay at the \nend of the day by using all of the provisions of the code, anything \ntoward the common good.\n  They come to the table with nothing. They look America in the eye and \ntell us we cannot cut subsidies to big oil companies. We cannot put \nentitlements to the wealthy on the table because in their ideological \nhaze, they conveniently, through this political sleight of hand, label \nany attempt to end those tax breaks, those entitlements, as a tax \nincrease on what they like to call the job creators. Their excuse for \nsuch an irresponsible bargaining position: trickle-down economics. I \nhave heard this so many times over the time I have been in Congress. \nBut the problem is nothing has ever trickled down. Yet those same \nentitlements for the entitled, the $5 trillion entitlement the Bush tax \ncuts would cost going forward over the next decade that we are told at \nthe outset would create jobs, would turn out to be the greatest failed \njobs program in American history.\n  I look at how those tax breaks are skewed to the wealthiest. I \nunderstand the opportunity to help middle-class families, and I promote \nthat because they are the ones who spend in this economy and create \ndemands. But the way those tax cuts are skewed to the wealthiest, $5 \ntrillion, I ask my friends: Where are all the jobs that were supposedly \ngoing to be created as a result of that? Where are all the jobs these \nRepublican entitlements to the wealthy are supposed to produce? Where \nare they? When middle-class Americans are struggling to make ends meet, \npay the bills, keep their jobs, their health care, their homes, \nentitlements to the entitled are the most reckless kind of spending.\n  This is the irresponsible Republican entitlement spending that should \nbe on the table, the very entitlement spending that contributed to our \ncurrent debt, and yet our friends on the other side continue to protect \nthese entitlements.\n  They will not vote to raise the debt limit unless we cut entitlements \nfor the working middle-class families of this country, but they protect \nentitlements for the wealthiest Americans. They are holding a gun to \nour heads at a critical time in our economic history, but we need only \nto look back at how often Republicans, themselves, have raised the debt \nlimit.\n  As we can see from this chart, to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, \nGeorge W. Bush had seven increases of the debt ceiling, increasing it \nby 90 percent for the largest increase in history, a total of over $5 \ntrillion that includes the entitlements for the wealthy that they\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nwill not put on the table in the name of shared sacrifice even if it \nmeans America defaults on its debt and becomes a deadbeat and sends a \nripple-effect throughout the world and its economies that come back \ncrashing on our shores in the United States. So it is amazing me.\n  Ronald Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times. Mr. President, 18 \ntimes in 8 years, a total percentage increase of 199 percent, amounting \nto $1.8 trillion, which in today's dollars would be $4 trillion. Mr. \nPresident, 18 times, Ronald Reagan. George Bush, 7 times, for $5.3 \ntrillion.\n  That amount, by the way, under the Bush years, ends up being, what. \nWhat is it equal to? The Bush tax cuts, $5 trillion.\n  They will not raise the debt limit to protect the good faith of the \nAmerican financial system, to protect middle-class families who have \nalready lost so much under Republican economic policies that led us to \nthe brink of economic disaster. The whole confluence of what happened \nin September of 2008 where we had these Bush tax cuts totally unpaid \nfor, denying the Federal Treasury those moneys, at a time in which we \nhad two wars raging abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new entitlement \nprogram unpaid for, and a marketplace that instead of being a free \nmarket--which I support--became a free-for-all market in which investor \ndecisions ended up becoming a collective risk to the entire country, \nand that is what we have been facing.\n  Instead of meeting this responsibility, they favor cuts in \nentitlements to the seniors, to the disabled, to families struggling to \nmake ends meet, to students seeking to get the college education that \ncould help fuel America's prosperity. That is what we saw in the House \nRepublican budget that passed but are willing to decimate our Nation's \neconomy to protect entitlements for the rich. They have dug in their \nheels and walled off irresponsible, unnecessary tax breaks for big oil \ncompanies. They have walled off entitlements to multibillion-dollar \ncorporations and millionaires who need no entitlements because they \nbelieve--blinded by their ideological haze--the rich are entitled to \ntheir outrageous giveaways even if it means ballooning the deficit and \nsending the Nation into default on its debt. Entitlements for these \nspecial interests, cuts for everyone else.\n  Republicans prefer to talk about cutting entitlements rather than \nwhat it really means--rather than cutting Social Security, rather than \ncutting Medicare, rather than cutting Medicaid--because cutting \nentitlements seems so esoteric. It is not very personal. But we all \nknow our families, our mothers and fathers who may be getting their \nhealth care on Medicare or one of them who may be sitting in a nursing \nhome on Medicaid or a poor child who is getting their health care being \ntaken care of on Medicaid, we know our friends and neighbors with \ndisabilities, and we understand what those challenges are.\n  Let's be clear. The only entitled people Republicans are talking \nabout in this debate are those who already enjoy enormous benefits \nunder the Tax Code, both individually and corporations that feel \nentitled to these pretty outrageous tax breaks.\n  Oil companies, as I heard from the executives who appeared before the \nSenate Finance Committee, clearly feel entitled to $21 billion in \nsubsidies. Millionaires and billionaires think they are entitled to the \nBush tax cuts. Corporate titans think they are entitled to tax breaks \nfor their private corporate jets, and Republicans think these are the \nonly entitlements worth protecting.\n  It is time to stop trying to balance the budget on the backs of \nseniors and middle-class working families. It is time to stop \nprotecting government handouts to the entitled class at the expense of \nthe middle class and telling America in good economic times that it \nstimulates the economy and in bad times that it is a job creation \npolicy.\n  The truth is, it is neither. It is simply an entitlement program for \nan entitled small class of Americans who are not struggling to make \nends meet or pay the mortgage or afford health care or find another \nminimum wage job to put food on the table. This stark contrast of \nwealth in the Nation is in the numbers.\n  The 400 wealthiest taxpayers--those who get the most out of \nRepublican entitlements--had an average income in 2008 of $270 million, \nalmost $300 million. That amounts to an hourly wage of about $31,000 an \nhour. Their average tax rate was about 18 percent. In contrast, the \nmedian New Jersey household earned about $64,777 the entire year as \nopposed to just 2 hours. That equated to 2 hours for the richest 400 \npeople, and yet they paid an average of 21.2 percent. They paid a \nhigher percentage of less of their wages than those 400 top earners in \nthe country.\n  A first lieutenant at Fort Dix, NJ, earned about $52,000. He paid an \naverage tax rate of 18.9 percent. So I ask, looking at these numbers, \nwhat should be on the table and what should not? The fact is, we are \noffering solutions. We are simply asking for fairness and for our \nfriends on the other side to bring something to the table other than a \npolitical ideology and an unrealistic ultimatum, all in order to \nprotect an entitled class that needs no protections. I don't usually \nagree with the conservative columnist David Brooks, but as I have said \non this floor before, I agree with him when he says, ``The members of \nthis movement talk blandly of default and are willing to stain their \nNation's honor . . .\n\n  They are willing to stain their Nation's honor.\n  I agree when he wrote that ``if the debt talks fail independent \nvoters will see Democrats as willing to compromise but Republicans were \nnot.''\n  Although this is not even about that. At the end of the day, this is \nabout the Nation. This is about our economy. This is about trying to \nget people back to work. This is about trying to ensure families can \nrealize their hopes and dreams and aspirations. This is about the \nUnited States of America, a beacon of light to the rest of the world, \nthe gold standard in terms of credit and meeting its obligations, \ncontinuing to be that gold standard and that beacon of light or \nbecoming a deadbeat in the world.\n  I would go even further and say the American public will see right \nthrough these efforts to protect entitlements for a privileged class \nwhile those Americans who struggle every day to build the foundation of \nAmerica, the cuts go on their backs. They come to the table with \nnothing other than an ideological fixation that prevents them from \nnegotiating in good faith, prevents them from putting the interests of \nthe country ahead of their narrow political interests.\n  I have read some of the comments about this issue as it relates to: \nWell, you know, do we end up giving President Obama the ability to get \nreelected? This is not about President Obama. This is about the United \nStates of America. This is about our country. This is about being \nresponsible at one of its most critical times. This is about getting \nthe country back on track. It is about giving the private sector faith \nand confidence that we are not going to default on our debt, that we \nare going to meet our obligations. It is about telling investors in the \nworld the United States is still a good place to invest. And when those \ninvestments are made, jobs are created, people go to work, once again \nthey have the dignity of work taking place; they are able to spend in \nthe economy, the economy grows, that creates other jobs, other \nopportunities, and we move toward fulfillment once again of the great \nAmerican opportunity.\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is a debate about each and \nevery one of us. The sooner our friends realize it is not about a \npolitical equation, it is not about who wins and loses in a political \ncontext, it is about the Nation, the better. If we can fix our \nattention to the needs of the Nation, then I have to believe we can \nmeet this challenge in a balanced way. Clearly, if Ronald Reagan raised \nthe debt ceiling 18 times and if George Bush raised it 7 times, then \nthis time, the first time under President Obama it needs to be raised, \nwhich is merely to pay the obligations we already have, I have to \nbelieve responsible people will come forward and say yes and do it in a \nway that isn't on the backs of middle-class working families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, per the request of Senator Kyl's office, I \nask unanimous consent that a letter from myself and Senator Kyl to the \nAttorney General be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2011.\n     Hon. Eric Holder,\n     Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: As you know, several weeks \n     ago, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York \n     indicted various individuals associated with online poker \n     sites for violations of various laws. Additional indictments \n     were unveiled in Baltimore at the end of May.\n       These indictments came after many years in which the \n     entities operated Internet poker websites to Americans in an \n     open and notorious way with apparently no repercussions from \n     law enforcement. Leading up to the indictments, this lack of \n     activity by law enforcement led to a significant and growing \n     perception that operating Internet poker and other Internet \n     gambling did not violate U.S. laws, or at least that the \n     Department of Justice thought that the case was uncertain \n     enough that it chose not to pursue enforcement actions. In \n     turn, this perception allowed this activity to spread \n     substantially, so that at least 1,700 foreign sites continue \n     to offer Internet gambling to U.S. players. We think it is \n     important that the Department of Justice pursue aggressively \n     and consistently those offering illegal Internet gambling in \n     the United States.\n       In addition, we have two further concerns: the spread of \n     efforts to legalize intra-state Internet gambling and the \n     spread of efforts to offer such intra-state Internet gambling \n     through state-sponsored lotteries.\n       We believe that the Department of Justice's longstanding \n     position has been that all forms of Internet gambling are \n     illegal--including intra-state Internet gambling, because \n     activity over the Internet inherently crosses state lines, \n     implicating federal anti-gambling laws such as the Wire Act. \n     Yet efforts are underway in about a dozen states to legalize \n     some form of intra-state Internet gambling. In many cases, \n     Internet gambling advocates in those states cite the silence \n     of the Department of Justice in the face of these efforts as \n     acquiescence. In fact, we have heard that at a major \n     conference in May, several officials from various state \n     lotteries boasted that they have obtained the Department of \n     Justice's effective consent by writing letters of their plans \n     that stated that if no objection was received they would \n     proceed with their Internet gambling plans--and no objection \n     has been received despite many months or years.\n       This is troubling. We respectfully request that you \n     reiterate the Department's longstanding position that federal \n     law prohibits gambling over the Internet, including intra-\n     state gambling (e.g., lotteries). Conversely, if for some \n     reason the Department is reconsidering its longstanding \n     position, then we respectfully request that you consult with \n     Congress before finalizing a new position that would open the \n     floodgates to Internet gambling.\n       Finally, we would like to work with you to strengthen the \n     penalties for those who violate the law and to see what \n     modifications would be helpful to the Department to enhance \n     its ability to fight Internet gambling.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Jon Kyl\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4605-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4605-S4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERALD M. CHASE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay tribute \nto a dedicated public servant from my home state of Michigan. Gerry \nChase has devoted his professional life to helping others and improving \nthe quality of public health in northern lower Michigan for nearly four \ndecades, and I am pleased to recognize his life's work as he retires \nfrom public service this month. Through his many initiatives as the \nPublic Health Officer for Northwest Michigan, Gerry has impacted many \nby working tirelessly to better the lives of the residents of Antrim, \nCharlevoix, Emmet, and Otsego Counties.\n  Gerry accepted the position of public health officer in 1974 at the \nurging of his mentor Roy R. Manty. Shortly after earning his bachelor \nof arts and a master's in public health from the University of \nMichigan, Gerry embarked on what he initially thought would be a short-\nterm assignment, but would become his life's work. Thirty-seven years \nlater, Gerry can look back with pride on a fulfilling and impressive \nrecord of accomplishment.\n  Charged with the responsibility of promoting wellness, preventing \ndisease, and providing quality healthcare, Gerry has been at the \nforefront of some of the more complex and daunting public health \nissues, leading an agency that has grown from 17 in the mid-1970s to \nmore than 200 employees today. Among Gerry's countless accomplishments \nas public health officer is an initiative to provide dental care to \nover 20,000 low-income residents, an effort to increase the number of \npoor women eligible for cost-free breast and cervical cancer \nscreenings, and the establishment of a multicounty workplace smoking \nban.\n  Through these accomplishments and many more like them, residents of \nthese counties are living healthier and better. In 2007, Gerry was \nawarded the Roy R. Manty Distinguished Service Award, Michigan's top \npublic health award. This honor, which bears the name of his mentor, is \ngiven to a person that embodies the ``values, dedication and spirit \nManty brought to public\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nhealth,'' which is a fitting tribute for a man that has dedicated his \nlife to the public good.\n  Gerry is also a loving and devoted husband to his wife of 45 years, \nKay, and an outstanding role model for his children, Gerald, Harold, \nand John, and for his grandchild, Taylor. In fact, I am reminded every \nday of his efforts in this regard through the work of his son, Harold, \na member of my staff for the last 15 years. Gerry has been an active \nmember of his community as well, helping to develop the Northwest \nAcademy, a charter school in Charlevoix County, leading a troop of Boy \nScouts, and serving as a Big Brother.\n  Gerry has set a high standard and has left a lasting footprint which \nwill endure for many years to come. I know my colleagues will join me \nin congratulating Gerry on his many impressive accomplishments over the \nlast thirty-seven years. I wish him the best as he begins a new chapter \nin life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4606-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANK SPRINGOB\n\n Mr. KOHL.

I am honored to have the opportunity to \ncongratulate my friend and great member of law enforcement, Chief \nSpringob, on his retirement.\n  From an early age, Frank Springob was destined to become a police \nofficer. Growing up on Milwaukee's south side, Frank spent a lot of \ntime visiting his local police station and officers who became Frank's \nfirst mentors. Frank began his career as a police clerk trainee and \nwith an unparalleled commitment to community service, spent the next 29 \nyears working his way up through the ranks of the Greenfield Police \nDepartment, until he was appointed Greenfield's chief of police in \n1994.\n  Throughout his career, Frank remained endlessly committed to helping \nimprove the lives of the residents he swore to protect and serve. \nDuring his time on the police force, Frank has seen the population of \nthe city more than double. His encyclopedic knowledge of law \nenforcement and the history of the city helped ensure that the people \nof Greenfield received a special brand of policing--one focused, above \nall else, on helping people.\n  During his time as chief, Frank has overseen the development and \nconstruction of the Law Enforcement Center, while maintaining one of \nthe best, most cost effective departments in the State of Wisconsin. \nStill, Frank's greatest legacy as chief of police will be the team of \nofficers he has helped shape and the incredible work they will continue \nto do serving the residents of Greenfield.\n  Chief Frank Springob is an outstanding example of a true public \nservant and his dedication to protecting others has set a standard that \nwe can all admire. The city of Greenfield and the State of Wisconsin \nhave benefitted greatly from his service and I am proud to offer these \nwords in recognition of his extraordinary career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4606-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE SMOKY TOAST CAFE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, while the news these days all too \noften highlights the negatives in our economy, such as the plight of a \nhigh unemployment rate and weak growth, we should also be reminded that \nsome people are making the best of a bad economy and taking a risk by \nstarting new businesses. One couple in downeast Maine has made the \nincredible transition from operating a boatbuilding shop to starting a \nnew restaurant all in the course of less than a decade. Instead of \ncomplaining about the calamitous economic times, they did something to \ncontinue their passion of entrepreneurship. That is why today I wish to \nhonor the Smoky Toast Cafe located in Jonesboro, which opened last year \nto much acclaim.\n  Tracy Watts and William Faulkingham started their boat-finishing \nbusiness, Jonesboro Custom Finish Shop, nearly a decade ago. During the \nbooming economy of the early 2000s, business was good and their docks \nwere never dry, with customers constantly bringing in boats for \nfinishing and renovations. The company finished a variety of \nwatercraft, ranging from lobster boats and commercial vessels to canoes \nand sport fishing boats. With orders coming in on a regular basis, \nWilliam and Tracy never lacked for work. Regrettably, that all changed \nwhen the economic downturn struck late last decade, as thousands of \nsmall businesses in Maine and the rest of the country saw demand slack \noff and the need for their services diminish.\n  But instead of waiting around for the economic winds to shift, the \nenergetic founders of this boatbuilding business changed course \naltogether and found a new calling--off the water--in the restaurant \nindustry. Tracy and William built the Smoky Toast Cafe on the same land \nwhere Jonesboro Custom Boats had previously operated. Using the skills \nthey had honed over time William's handiness and Tracy's cooking--they \nstarted over from scratch. Now more than a year into this new endeavor, \nthe business is off to a strong start. After all, no matter how hard \ntimes may be, quality food always sells.\n  But William and Tracy also know that starting a new business in this \nclimate will take even more hard work. They have built a loyal \nfollowing among the downeast community of fishermen and harvesters, and \nopen their doors at 5 a.m. to welcome these dedicated individuals with \nhearty breakfasts and fresh baked muffins and breads. The Smoky Toast \nCafe is also open for lunch, offering standard favorites as well as \nMaine seafood dishes. The restaurant is also utilizing social media, \nsuch as Facebook and Twitter, to promote itself and bring in new \ncustomers, by posting daily specials and company news items.\n  Small businesses like the Smoky Toast Cafe are the main generators of \njobs and economic growth in this country and will be the drivers of our \nrecovery. The commitment to entrepreneurship displayed by Tracy and \nWilliam is a remarkable example to aspiring business owners who are \nconsidering whether or not to take the risk in starting their own \ncompany.

A bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct to repeal distributions for medicine qualified only if for \nprescribed drug or insulin; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan \nbill, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2011. This bill would \nrepeal the portion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nwhich requires individuals to have a prescription to spend the money \nthey have saved in their Flexible Spending Accounts.\n  Flexible Spending Accounts, FSAs, Health Savings Accounts, HSAs, and \nother medical savings arrangements provide plan participants with an \naffordable, convenient and accessible means to manage their health care \nexpenses.\n  More than 35 million Americans participate in FSAs and more than 10 \nmillion Americans participate in a HSA. These accounts allow plan \nparticipants to set aside their own dollars on a pre-tax basis to pay \nfor health care expenses, giving individuals control over health care \ndecisions and how to pay for that care.\n  A key benefit of these plans prior to enactment of the Patient \nProtection\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nand Affordable Care Act, PPACA, was the ability for participants to use \nthe dollars they set aside in these plans to pay for the cost of over-\nthe-counter medications.\n  However, under PPACA, plan participants may no longer use funds from \nthese accounts to purchase over-the-counter medications, unless they \nhave a prescription for the medication.\n  This prohibition takes away choice from individuals about how to \nmanage their health care expenses and adds yet another burden to \nphysicians, as some plan participants will seek a prescription for \nover-the-counter medications. And, worst of all, it injects increased \ncosts into our health care system.\n  Rather than promoting cost-effectiveness and accessibility, this \nprovision instead directs participants to potentially more costly, less \nconvenient, and more time-consuming alternatives. Further, it injects \nunnecessary confusion and complexity into a system that was previously \nstraightforward and easy for consumers to utilize.\n  This bill repeals Sec. 9003 of the PPACA and restores the ability of \nplan participants to use the funds in their FSA, HRA, HSA or Archers \nMSA to purchase OTC medications, allowing them to better manage the \ncost of their health care expenses.\n  A family physician from Leawood, Kansas told me, ``I am pleased that \nlegislation is being introduced to reverse this policy. Many of my \npatients face undue burdens purchasing needed medications that are \nessential to their health maintenance and overall wellbeing. Reversal \nof this policy will allow my patients to continue to purchase the \nnumerous beneficial over-the-counter products that are so important in \nour daily lives and will eliminate a substantial administrative burden \non my practice.''\n  In Kansas, and throughout the U.S., a broad coalition of groups \nsupport this legislation, including the U.S. Chamber, NFIB, pharmacist \ngroups, drug store organizations and consumer groups.\n  I would invite my colleagues to join me in this effort by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 1369. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nexempt the conduct of silvicultural activities from national pollutant \ndischarge elimination system permitting requirements; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, over the last several months, this body has \nbeen focused on issues pertaining to our economy, such as the ailing \njobs market and our debt and deficits. That is as it should be. \nHowever, while these important issues have commanded most of our \nattention here in the United States Senate, that is not to say that \nother matters and conflicts have suddenly taken a back seat to them. \nEven as we vigorously debate our economic future, home-state and \nregional issues continue to command our attention. It is one of those \nregional issues that brings me to the floor today.\n  Two months ago, a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe 9th Circuit handed down a final decision that could have far \nreaching negative impacts on public and private forests, and the \ncommunities that rely on them, throughout the United States. In the \ncase of Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Brown, the Court \nruled that logging road runoff when managed with a system of ditches \nand culverts and deposited into rivers and streams qualifies under the \nClean Water Act as point source pollution. This means that storm water \nwhen mixed with dirt and rocks will now be subject to some of the most \nstringent environmental protection laws in the United States. America's \nFederal forests are already heavily litigated, but with one fell swoop, \nthis decision threw out over 35 years of precedent, opening the door \nfor even more litigation on Federal forest lands, and subjecting \nprivate and state forest lands to the same specter.\n  There was a time when forest jobs supported millions of Americans and \ntheir communities. But a lot has changed since then. Endless \nlitigation, cheap imports, disease and a general shift in Federal \nforest management policy have drastically changed the landscape for \nforest jobs and the families and communities that rely on them. Working \non the forests used to make up a considerable amount of the tax base in \nmany rural communities, particularly in my State of Idaho. However, \nthat has shrunk dramatically in recent decades.\n  Forest communities that were once prosperous now find themselves in a \nstate of perpetual economic jeopardy, with young people searching for \nemployment elsewhere and tax bases that can barely cover the cost of \nbasic public services. This has become so dire that in 2000, Congress \nhad to pass legislation to provide funding to rural communities with \nFederal public lands to make up for lost revenues from timber harvests \non those lands.\n  Given all of this, I am disappointed that another impediment is being \nadded to the economic survival of our forest communities.\n  This decision will impact both public and private forests. In the \ncase of Federal forests, we have millions upon millions of acres that \nare in need of active management and restoration. Our Federal forests \nhave suffered from under management, disease, wild fires and other \nfactors, and to address these problems, the U.S. Forest Service needs \nto be able to get to work on much needed fuels reduction, thinning and \nother forest health projects. But litigation has made that very \ndifficult, and this decision is only going to make it worse.\n  Then, there are private forests. The people who own, manage and work \non these private forests need roads to have access to them. But, this \njudicially-mandated permit requirement will inevitably lead to \nincreased costs for businesses that are already operating on the \nmargins. Furthermore, this decision will impose the Federal Government \ninto the management of private lands as these permits, even if issued \nby a State agency, will be subject to Environmental Protection Agency \noversight under the Federal Clean Water Act, as well as citizen suits \nthat are intended to further reduce timber harvests.\n  We need to do something about this unfortunate and unwise decision \nout of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As such, I am introducing \nlegislation along with my friends Senator Wyden, Senator Risch and \nSenator Begich to overturn it. This legislation is entitled the \nSilviculture Regulatory Consistency Act of 2011. Our forests and the \ncommunities that they have long supported are already in considerable \njeopardy, and we need to do everything in our power to help these rural \ncommunities. Passing this legislation is only one step in that process, \nbut it is a very necessary one.\n  I hope that the Senate can pass this bipartisan legislation as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleagues from \nIdaho, Senator Crapo and Senator Risch, and my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Begich, to correct a regulatory problem that left uncorrected \nwill bury private, State and tribal forest lands in a wave of \nlitigation. If we have learned anything from the court battles that \nhave contributed to the widespread gridlock and mismanagement of our \nFederal forests, it is that this is not the best path to ensure our \nforests' future and should be considered only as a last resort. Now \nthose battles threaten to spill over onto private forest lands.\n  Since the advent of the Clean Water Act, Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have held that most silviculture activities were \nnonpoint sources for purposes of the act and would be best regulated at \nthe State level, under the States' individual forest practices laws. \nUnder this rule, known as the ``silviculture rule, `` silvicultural \nactivities, such as nursery operations, site preparation, reforestation \nand subsequent treatment, thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire \ncontrol, harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road construction \nand maintenance, from which there is natural runoff, were regulated \nthrough the Clean Water Act by States best management practices.\n  This rule for forest roads has now been explicitly invalidated by the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, which--in a series of two decisions--\nimplicitly undermined the long-held ``silvicultural rule,'' stemming \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\nlitigation over the use of forest roads in Oregon State-owned forests.\n  According to the Ninth Circuit, stormwater runoff collected and \ndirected by a system of ditches and culverts creates a discrete point \nsource and therefore, must be regulated as industrial stormwater \nrunoff. This judicial interpretation of the Clean Water Act means that \nevery source of runoff on forest roads will now require an industrial \nstormwater runoff permit. Not only will new roads need to be permitted, \nbut the hundreds of thousands of miles of existing roads in Oregon and \naround the country, on both public and private lands, will now need to \nbe reviewed and issued permits.\n  If this one court's decision to overturn 35 years of widely-accepted, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, policy is allowed to stand, \nprivate, State, and tribal forest owners will also likely be subjected \nto litigation as part of the permitting process or through lawsuits \nunder the citizen suit provisions of the Clean Water Act. The outcome \ncould well deny States the use of their forests which they depend on to \npay for schools and services, while significantly depressing the \ninvestment required to sustain private forestry.\n  If this decision is allowed to stand, every use of forest roads will \nrequire permitting and will therefore be subject to challenge by \ncitizen lawsuits. This will not only overburden landowners and managers \nin the Ninth Circuit states by adding significant compliance and \npermitting costs, it will create an opportunity for administrative \nappeal and litigation every time a permit is approved.\n  Initially, the court's ruling will apply solely to my region of the \ncountry, but we can expect lawyers to quickly beat a path to other \nFederal courts and the EPA itself, seeking to extend the ruling to all \nother forested regions of the country, and giving an immediate and \nperhaps permanent competitive advantage to our foreign competitors who \nhave far lesser environmental standards and enforcement.\n  The fact of the matter is that forests and forest roads--even private \nones--have multiple economic and environmental uses and users--from \nwildlife habitat to recreation to timber production--over decades long \ngrowing and harvesting cycles. The ``silviculture rule'' existed \nbecause forestry is different from other industries, even other \nagricultural production. This is why, in this instance, I believe the \ncourts have gone too far in reinterpreting the law and why legislation \nis needed to make the long-accepted ``silvicultural rule'' the legal \nbasis for Clean Water Act regulation of forestry practices.\n  The Clean Water Act is one of the cornerstones of environmental \nprotection. In the past two Congresses, I cosponsored the Clean Water \nRestoration Act because I believed that the U.S. Supreme Court went too \nfar in reinterpreting decades of Clean Water Act law by excluding \nwetlands and intermittent streams that had long been protected under \nthat law. Here too, I believe that the courts have gone too far in \nreinterpreting what has been a longstanding understanding of how \nsilvicultural activities should be regulated. The Ninth Circuit \nconcluded that only Congress can authorize EPA's original reading of \nthe law. Senators Crapo, Risch, Begich and I are introducing \nlegislation today in response to that conclusion.\n  That is not to say that the persons who orchestrated this litigation \nwere not well-intentioned in their desire to address the water quality \nissues that can arise from silviculture, as they can in virtually every \nother agricultural activity. Rather, I believe they had the best of \nintentions. In fact, I share their intentions. I have labored for \ndecades and will continue to work to address the poor condition of \nforest roads on Federal lands. I will also be the first to argue that \nthe Federal Government has much to do in that regard. Efforts can also \nbe made on State and private lands. In many instances, what is needed \nis simply more technical assistance and financial incentives to help \nlandowners and managers that are seeking to do the right thing. I \ncertainly care about keeping the pristine quality of our streams and \nthe impacts that sediment can have on salmon and aquatic creatures. It \nis part of the reason why I have championed wilderness and wild and \nscenic river legislation to protect Oregon's special places, including \nits beautiful waterways.\n  But I can't agree with their decision to first fight this out in \ncourt. Their litigation tries to impose an outcome on my region without \never attempting to address the concerns and needs of the thousands of \npeople in my State who earn their living as responsible stewards of \nprivate forest land. Oregon is still struggling to come back from the \neconomic crisis and many of our forested counties continue to suffer \nfrom double digit unemployment. Where will the 120,000 people in Oregon \nwho make their living on private forest land go when private lands \nexperience the same gridlock as their Federal land counterparts? How \nwill small woodlot owners in Oregon--mostly mom and pop investments--\nsurvive when subjected to Federal regulation and lawsuits for the first \ntime in our State's history? How many millions of acres of private, \nshareholder-owned forest land will be converted to nonagricultural \npurposes when companies are no longer able to carry out needed forest \nmanagement? To my knowledge, the litigants did not make a meaningful \neffort to address any of those challenges before initiating the lawsuit \nthat now threatens to throw my State into a dangerous economic \ntrajectory.\n  I should point out that this issue transcends partisan concerns, as \nevidenced by the prominent Democrats who have found common ground with \nRepublicans on this issue. Oregon's Governor, John Kitzhaber, one of \nthe most prominent environmental champions in the Nation, has \nconsistently fought against the Northwest Environmental Defense Center \nruling and continues to do so. Senator Begich, who is known for his \nthoughtful and balanced approach to natural resource issues, joins me \nas an original cosponsor. On the House side, I am joined by Democratic \nCongressman Kurt Schrader, who knows better than most the unintended \nconsequences of well-intentioned, but poorly aimed efforts at \nregulation.\n  To my friends in the environmental community who raise legitimate \nconcerns about a range of issues surrounding this policy I encourage \nyou to sit down with us in a dialogue, at both the Federal and State \nlevels. Bring your ideas for how we can monitor and protect water \nwithout sacrificing what remains of Oregon's forest industry. You will \nbe heard and I stand ready to work with you. But it is not enough to \nsimply dictate outcomes. We have to first look for solutions that avoid \nthe epidemic of litigation and appeals that threaten the sustainability \nand survival of our timber industry. You are, of course, right to \nexpect that we arrive at those solutions within a reasonable period of \ntime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1370. A bill to reauthorize 21st century community learning \ncenters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor the Afterschool for America's Children Act, which I am \nintroducing today with Senators Murkowski and Murray.\n  Across the country, afterschool programs help keep children safe and \nhelp them learn through hands-on academic enrichment activities that \nare disappearing from the regular school day.\n  Numerous studies have shown that quality afterschool programs give \nstudents the academic, social and professional skills they need to \nsucceed. Students who regularly attend have better grades and behavior \nin school, and lower incidences of drug use, violence and unintended \npregnancy.\n  Over the past 10 years, the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, \nCCLC, program has helped support afterschool programs for millions of \nchildren from low-income backgrounds, including over 1.6 million \nchildren last year.\n  Unfortunately, the demand for affordable, quality afterschool \nexperiences far exceeds the number of programs available. The 2009 \nreport, America After 3PM, found that while afterschool programs are \nserving more kids than ever, the number of unsupervised children in the \nUnited States has increased. More than 18 million children have parents \nwho would like to enroll their child in an afterschool program but \ncan't find one available.\n  For over 10 years, federally funded afterschool programs have played \nan important role in the lives of so many children and families. The \nAfterschool for America's Children Act, AACA, would strengthen the 21st \nCCLC program, leaving in place what works and\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nusing what we have learned about what makes afterschool successful to \nimprove the program.\n  The AACA would modernize the 21st CCLC program to improve States' \nability to effectively support quality afterschool programs, run more \neffective grant competitions and improve struggling programs. In \naddition, this legislation helps improve local programs by fostering \nbetter communication between local schools and programs, encouraging \nparental engagement in student learning, and improving the tracking of \nstudent progress.\n  Afterschool programs have such a diverse group of supporters, from \nlaw enforcement to the business community, because these vital programs \nhelp keep the children of working parents safe while enriching their \nlearning experience and preparing them for the real world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Murkowski and Murray in \nsupporting the Afterschool for America's Children Act to ensure that \n21st CCLC dollars are invested most efficiently in successful \nafterschool programs that keep children safe and help them learn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1371. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, I am introducing the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act \nof 2011.\n  For nearly a decade, I have worked to correct a serious flaw in our \nfisheries management system, which denies the fishermen of my state a \nvoice in the management of many of the stocks that they catch and rely \nupon for their livelihoods.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \nestablished eight regional fishery management councils to give \nfishermen and other stakeholders the leading role in developing the \nfishery management plans for federally regulated species. As such, the \ncouncils have enormous significance on the lives and livelihoods of \nfishermen. To ensure equitable representation, the statute sets out the \nstates from which appointees are to be drawn for each council.\n  Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the State of Rhode Island was granted \nvoting membership on the New England Fishery Management Council, NEFMC, \nas NEFMC-managed stocks represent a significant percentage of landings \nand revenue for the State. However, while Rhode Island has an even \nlarger stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery it does not have voting \nrepresentation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, MAFMC, \nwhich currently consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, \nDelaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n  Rhode Island's stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery is hardly \nincidental. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, data, Rhode Island accounts for approximately a \nquarter of the catch from this fishery, and its landings are greater \nthan the combined total of landings for the States of New York, \nDelaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. In act, \nonly one State, New Jersey, lands more MAFMC regulated species than \nRhode Island.\n  This legislation offers a simple solution. Following current \npractice, the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two \nseats on the MAFMC for Rhode Island: one seat appointed by the \nSecretary of Commerce based on recommendations from the Governor of \nRhode Island, and a second seat filled by Rhode Island's principal \nstate official with marine fishery management responsibility. To \naccommodate these new members, the MAFMC would increase in size from 21 \nvoting members to 23.\n  Pursuant to a provision included in the Magnuson-Stevens \nReauthorization Act of 2006 at my request, the MAFMC reported to \nCongress on this issue in 2007 and confirmed that there is a precedent \nfor this proposal. As the report notes, North Carolina's \nrepresentatives in Congress succeeded in adding that State to the MAFMC \nthrough an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996. Like \nRhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's landed fish \nspecies were managed by the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote on the \ncouncil.\n  With mounting economic, ecological, and regulatory challenges, it is \nmore important than ever that Rhode Island's fishermen have a voice in \nthe management of the fisheries they depend on. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Whitehouse and my other colleagues to restore a \nmeasure of equity to the fisheries management process by passing the \nRhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhode Island Fishermen's \n     Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The findings are as follows:\n       (1) Rhode Island fishermen participate in fisheries managed \n     by the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and the \n     Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC).\n       (2) Rhode Island currently has voting membership on the \n     NEFMC under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act but does not have voting membership on the \n     MAFMC.\n       (3) Rhode Island lands more MAFMC-managed stocks than any \n     other MAFMC member except the State of New Jersey.\n       (4) A higher percentage of Rhode Island's commercial \n     landings (by weight or value) traditionally have come from \n     species that are managed by the MAFMC as compared to species \n     managed by NEFMC.\n       (5) MAFMC has found that Rhode Island's circumstance \n     parallels that of Florida and North Carolina, which each have \n     voting membership on two different fishery management \n     councils.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITION OF RHODE ISLAND TO THE MID-ATLANTIC FISHERY \n                   MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.\n\n       Section 302(a)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``States of'';\n       (2) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``except North \n     Carolina,'';\n       (3) by striking ``21'' and inserting ``23''; and\n       (4) by striking ``13'' and inserting ``14''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1372. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding environmental education, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to provide new support for environmental education in our \nNation's classrooms. I thank Senators Kirk, Bingaman, Cardin, Durbin, \nGillibrand, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Murray, Sanders, and \nWhitehouse for agreeing to be original cosponsors of the No Child Left \nInside Act of 2011. Given the major environmental challenges we face \ntoday, our bill seeks to prioritize teaching our young people about \ntheir natural world. For more than three decades, environmental \neducation has been a growing part of effective instruction in America's \nschools. Responding to the need to improve student achievement and \nprepare students for the 21st century economy, many schools throughout \nthe Nation now offer some form of environmental education.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many \nschools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental \nprograms. As a result, fewer and fewer students are able to take part \nin related classroom instruction and field investigations, however \neffective or popular. State and local administrators, teachers, and \nenvironmental educators point to two factors behind this recent and \ndisturbing shift: the unintended consequences of the No Child Left \nBehind Act and dwindling sources of funding for these critical \nprograms.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today would address these two\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nconcerns. First, it would provide a new professional development \ninitiative to ensure that teachers possess the content knowledge and \npedagogical skills to effectively teach environmental education in the \nclassroom, including the use of innovative interdisciplinary and field-\nbased learning strategies. Second, the bill would create incentives for \nstates to develop a peer-reviewed comprehensive statewide environmental \nliteracy plan to make sure prekindergarten, elementary, and secondary \nschool students have a solid understanding of our planet and its \nnatural resources. Lastly, the No Child Left Inside Act provides \nsupport for school districts to initiate, expand, or improve their \nenvironmental education curriculum, and for replication and \ndissemination of effective practices. This legislation has broad \nsupport among national and state environmental groups and educational \ngroups.\n  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of \nthe dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science \nFoundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will \nmore frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental \nissues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and \nunderstand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and \nglobal scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a \nconcerted, systemic approach to environmental education . . .''. In the \nprivate sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an \nenvironmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term \nsuccess. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental \npractices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for \nthe future.\n  Environmental education is an important part of the solution to many \nof the problems facing our country today. It helps prepare the next \ngeneration with the skills and knowledge necessary to be competitive in \nthe global economy. Studies have shown that it enhances student \nachievement in science and other core subjects and increases student \nengagement and critical thinking skills. It promotes healthy lifestyles \nby encouraging kids to get outside.\n  In Rhode Island, organizations such as the Rhode Island Environmental \nEducation Association, Roger Williams Park Zoo, Save the Bay, the \nNature Conservancy, and the Audubon Society as well as countless \nschools and teachers, reach out to children to offer educational and \noutdoor experiences that these children may never otherwise have, \nhelping to inspire them to learn. Partnering with the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Education, these organizations have developed a statewide \nenvironmental literacy plan.\n  Similar efforts are taking place across the Nation. According to the \nNational Association for Environmental Education, 40 states have taken \nsteps towards developing similar plans to integrate environmental \nliteracy into their statewide educational initiatives. Despite these \nextraordinary efforts, environmental education remains out of reach for \ntoo many kids.\n  That is why I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the \nNo Child Left Inside Act of 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \ninternational tax avoidance and restore a level playing field for \nAmerican businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nInternational Tax Competitiveness Act, legislation that will protect \nAmerican businesses and workers by ensuring that they can compete on a \nlevel playing field with competitors who are using tax evasion to boost \nprofits and ship jobs and dollars overseas.\n  This bill targets companies that cheat the Federal Government out of \nbillions of dollars a year in revenue by taking advantage of tax \nloopholes. This legislation is designed to put an end to the practice \nwhere American companies avoid domestic taxes by moving their \nheadquarters to a post office box overseas, while their executives and \nmuch of their workforce remain here in the United States. If you \nbenefit from the protection of American laws and the talent of the \nAmerican workforce, you should also pay taxes here in the United \nStates.\n  In March, the television program 60 Minutes aired a story on tax \navoidance\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\nthat centered on Zug, a town in Switzerland. While Zug has only 26,000 \nresidents, it is home to nearly 30,000 corporations, many of which \noperate out of mailboxes. This is because the tax rates in Zug are low \nand companies can create phony headquarters there that allow them to \navoid higher taxes in their home country.\n  The International Tax Competitiveness Act also discourages tax abuse \nrelated to transfer pricing. Sometimes, a company will produce a \nproduct here in the United States, taking advantage of generous \nresearch and development subsidies, and then sell it to a foreign \nsubsidiary for pennies on the dollar. The royalty payments and profits \nthen flow to that foreign company in a low tax jurisdiction, cheating \nthe American government out of this revenue. This legislation would \nrecognize many of these transactions for what they are . . . blatant \nabuse of the tax code, and treat profits as American-earned for tax \npurposes.\n  At a time when members of Congress are working hard to balance the \nbudget and reduce our debt, everyone must contribute to the effort and \nour laws must be obeyed. It is not fair to cut funding for valuable \nhealthcare and education programs in an effort to cut spending, while \nallowing corporations to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.\n  I want to thank my counterpart from the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, for his leadership in that body on this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation and thank the chair for allowing me to speak on \nthis issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 1375. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits based upon stock option compensation \nexpenses be consistent with accounting expenses shown in corporate \nfinancial statements for such compensation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with my \ncolleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, to eliminate the federal tax break \nthat gives special tax treatment to corporations that pay their \nexecutives with stock options. The bill is called the Ending Excessive \nCorporate Deductions for Stock Options Act, and it has been endorsed by \nthe AFL-CIO, Citizens for Tax Justice, Consumer Federation of America, \nOMB Watch, and Tax Justice Network-USA. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, eliminating this corporate tax break would bring \nin almost $25 billion over 10 years.\n  The existing special treatment of corporate stock options forces \nordinary taxpayers to subsidize the salaries of corporate executives. \nThe subsidy is a consequence of the current mismatch between U.S. \naccounting rules and tax rules for stock options, which have developed \nalong divergent paths and are now out of kilter. Today, U.S. accounting \nrules require corporations to report stock option expenses on their \nbooks when those stock options are granted, while federal tax rules \nprovide that they use another method to claim a different--and \ntypically much higher--deduction on their tax returns when the stock \noptions are exercised. The result is that corporations can claim larger \ntax deductions for stock options on their tax returns than the actual \nexpense they show on their books, creating a tax windfall for those \ncorporations.\n  Stock options are the only type of compensation where the tax code \nlets a corporation deduct more than the expense shown on their books. \nFor all other types of compensation--cash, stock, bonuses, and more--\nthe tax return deduction equals the book expense. In fact, if \ncorporations took tax deductions for compensation in excess of what \ntheir books showed, it could constitute tax fraud. The sole exception \nto that rule is stock options. It is an exception we can no longer \nafford.\n  When corporate compensation committees learn that stock options can \ngenerate tax deductions that are many times larger than their book \nexpense, it creates a huge temptation for corporations to pay their \nexecutives with stock options instead of cash. Why? Because \ncompensating executives with stock options instead of cash can produce \na huge tax windfall for the corporation. By taking advantage of federal \ntax laws that have not been updated for four decades, corporations can \nclaim tax deductions at rates that are often 2 to 10 times higher than \nthe stock option expense shown on their books.\n  Stock options are paid to virtually every chief executive officer, \nCEO, in America and are a major contributor to sky-high executive pay. \nStock options give the recipients the right to buy company stock at a \nset price for a specified period of time, typically 10 years.\n  Since the 1980s, CEO pay has increased at a torrid pace. In 2010, \naccording to Forbes magazine, executives at the 500 largest U.S. \ncompanies received pay totaling $4.5 billion, averaging $9 million per \nCEO. Thirty percent of that pay was comprised of exercised stock \noptions which were cashed in for an average gain of about $2.7 million, \nbringing total pay to its highest level since before the recession. The \nhighest paid executive in 2010 was the CEO of United Health Group, who \nreceived $102 million in total pay. Of that pay, almost all of it--$98 \nmillion--came from exercising stock options.\n  During the recession from 2007 to 2009, while many stock prices \ndropped in value, 90 percent of corporations awarded stock options to \ntheir executives. Because of the depressed stock prices at the time, \nmost of those stock options were recorded on the corporations' books as \na relatively small expense. Fast forward to 2010, and even in this \nstruggling economy, as stock prices have begun to increase, those same \nstock options are seeing major jumps in their value, far above their \nbook expense.\n  For example, in a recent study conducted by the Wall Street Journal, \nthe CEO of Oracle Corporation was granted stock options in July 2009, \nwith an estimated value of $62 million. Two years later, those options \nare estimated to be worth over $97 million, a gain of $35 million in \njust two years. Other corporate executives have experienced similar \nincreases in their stock option holdings. For example, according to the \nWall Street Journal analysis, the CEOs of Abercrombie and Fitch Inc., \nNabors Industries, Ltd., and Starbucks Corporation all saw jumps in the \nvalue of stock options awarded during the financial crisis of more than \n$60 million each. The former CEO of Occidental Petroleum, Ray R. Irani, \nreceived a compensation package valued at $76.1 million, including \nstock option awards valued at $40.3 million.\n  These huge increases in the dollar value of the stock option awards \nmean skyrocketing tax deductions for corporations doing so well that \ntheir stock prices have climbed. The deductions will reduce the taxes \nbeing paid by these successful companies, depriving the U.S. treasury \nof needed revenues.\n  The average worker, by the way, has not experienced any increase in \npay. From 2009 to 2010 alone, CEOs at the 500 biggest U.S. corporations \nsaw a 12 percent increase in compensation, but median income has been \nstagnant. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 8 percent \nof workers in private industry received stock options as part of their \ncompensation package. For CEOs, however, more than 90 percent of those \nin the S 500 received stock options in the 12 months starting October \n1, 2008.\n  The financial tycoon J.P. Morgan once said that executive pay should \nnot exceed 20 times average worker pay. But since 1990, CEO pay has \nincreased to a level that is now nearly 300 times greater than the \naverage worker's salary. The single biggest factor fueling that massive \npay gap is stock options which are, in turn, generating huge tax \ndeductions for the corporations that doled them out.\n  This bill would end the loophole that allows a corporation to deduct \non its taxes more than the stock option expense shown on its books. \nOver a 5 year period, from 2005 to 2009, the latest year for which data \nis available, IRS tax return data shows that corporate stock option tax \ndeductions have exceeded corporate book expenses by billions of dollars \nevery year, with the size of the excess tax deductions varying from $12 \nbillion to $61 billion per year. These excessive deductions mean \nbillions of dollars in reduced taxes for\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\ncorporations wealthy enough to provide substantial stock option \ncompensation to their executives, all at the expense of ordinary \ntaxpayers.\n  We cannot afford to continue this multi-billion dollar loss to the \nU.S. Treasury, and tax fairness means ordinary taxpayers should not \ncontinue to be asked to subsidize corporate executive salaries. That is \nwhy the bill I am introducing today would change the tax code so that \ncorporations can deduct only the stock option expense actually shown on \ntheir books.\n  To get a better understanding of why this bill is needed, it helps to \nhave a clear understanding of how stock option accounting and tax rules \nfell out of sync over time.\n  Calculating the cost of stock options may sound straightforward, but \nfor years, companies and their accountants engaged the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board, or FASB, in an all-out, knock-down battle \nover how companies should record stock option compensation expenses on \ntheir books.\n  U.S. publicly traded corporations are required by law to follow \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which are issued by \nFASB which is, in turn, overseen by the SEC. For many years, GAAP \nallowed U.S. companies to issue stock options to employees and, unlike \nany other type of compensation, report a zero compensation expense on \ntheir books, so long as on the grant date, the stock option's exercise \nprice equaled the market price at which the stock could be sold.\n  Assigning a zero value to stock options that routinely produced huge \namounts of executive pay provoked deep disagreements within the \naccounting community. In 1993, FASB proposed assigning a ``fair value'' \nto stock options on the date they were granted to an employee, using \nmathematical valuation tools. FASB proposed further that companies \ninclude that amount as a compensation expense on their financial \nstatements. A battle over stock option expensing followed, involving \nthe accounting profession, corporate executives, FASB, the SEC, and \nCongress.\n  In the end, after years of fighting and negotiation, FASB issued a \nnew accounting standard, Financial Accounting Standard, or FAS, 123R, \nwhich was endorsed by the SEC and became mandatory for all publicly \ntraded corporations in 2005. In essence, FAS 123R requires all \ncompanies to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value on \ngrant date of all stock options provided to an employee in exchange for \nthe employee's services.\n  Opponents of the new accounting rule had predicted that, if \nimplemented, it would severely damage U.S. capital markets. They warned \nthat stock option expensing would eliminate corporate profits, \ndiscourage investment, end stock option compensation, depress stock \nprices, and stifle innovation. But none of that happened.\n  2006 was the first year in which all U.S. publicly traded companies \nwere required to expense stock options. Instead of tumbling, both the \nNew York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ turned in strong performances, as \ndid initial public offerings by new companies. The dire predictions \nwere wrong. Stock option expensing has been fully implemented without \nany detrimental impact to the markets.\n  During the years the battle raged over stock option accounting, \nrelatively little attention was paid to the taxation of stock options. \nSection 83 of the tax code, first enacted in 1969 and still in place \nafter four decades, is the key statutory provision. It essentially \nprovides that, when an employee exercises compensatory stock options, \nthe employee must report as income the difference between what the \nemployee paid to exercise the options and the market value of the stock \nreceived. The corporation can then take a mirror deduction for whatever \namount of income the employee realized.\n  For example, suppose a company gave options to an executive to buy 1 \nmillion shares of the company stock at $10 per share. Suppose, 5 years \nlater, the executive exercised the options when the stock was selling \nat $30 per share. The executive's income would be $20 per share for a \ntotal of $20 million. The executive would declare $20 million as \nordinary income, and in the same year, the company could take a tax \ndeduction for $20 million.\n  The two main problems with this approach are, first, that the \ndeduction amount is out of sync--and usually significantly greater \nthan--the expense shown on the corporate books years earlier and, \nsecond, the $20 million in ordinary income obtained by the executive \ndid not come from the corporation itself. In fact, rather than pay the \nexecutive the $20 million, the corporation actually received money from \nthe executive who paid to exercise the option and purchase the related \nstock.\n  In most cases, the $20 million was actually paid by unrelated parties \non the stock market who bought the stock from the executive. Yet the \ntax code currently allows the corporation to declare the $20 million \npaid by third parties as its own business expense and take it as a tax \ndeduction. The reasoning behind this approach has been that the \nexercise date value was the only way to get certainty regarding the \nvalue of the stock options for tax deduction purposes. That reasoning \nlost its persuasive character, however, once consensus was reached on \nhow to calculate the value of stock option compensation on the date the \nstock options are granted.\n  So U.S. stock option accounting and tax rules are now at odds with \neach other. Accounting rules require companies to expense stock options \non their books on the grant date. Tax rules require companies to deduct \nstock option expenses on the exercise date. Companies report the grant \ndate expense to investors on their financial statements, and the \nexercise date expense on their tax returns. The financial statements \nreport on the stock options granted during the year, while the tax \nreturns report on the stock options exercised during the year. In \nshort, company financial statements and tax returns use different \nvaluation methods and value, resulting in widely divergent stock option \nexpenses for the same year.\n  To examine the nature and consequences of that stock option book-tax \ndifference, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, initiated an investigation and held a hearing in June 2007. Here \nis what we found.\n  To test just how far the book and tax figures for stock options \ndiverge, the Subcommittee contacted a number of companies to compare \nthe stock option expenses they reported for accounting and tax \npurposes. The Subcommittee asked each company to identify stock options \nthat had been exercised by one or more of its executives from 2002 to \n2006. The Subcommittee then asked each company to identify the \ncompensation expense they reported on their financial statements versus \nthe compensation expense on their tax returns. The Subcommittee very \nmuch appreciated the cooperation and assistance provided by the nine \ncompanies we worked with. At the hearing, we disclosed the resulting \nstock option data for those companies, including three companies that \ntestified.\n  The data provided by the companies showed that, under then existing \nrules, eight of the nine companies showed a zero expense on their books \nfor the stock options that had been awarded to their executives, but \nclaimed millions of dollars in tax deductions for the same \ncompensation. The ninth company, Occidental Petroleum, had begun \nvoluntarily expensing its stock options in 2005, but also reported \nsignificantly greater tax deductions than the stock option expenses \nshown on its books. When the Subcommittee asked the companies what \ntheir book expense would have been if FAS 123R had been in effect, all \nnine calculated book expenses that remained dramatically lower than \ntheir tax deductions. Altogether, the nine companies calculated that \nthey would have claimed about $1 billion more in stock option tax \ndeductions than they would have shown as book expenses, even using the \ntougher new accounting rule. Let me repeat that--just 9 companies \nproduced a stock option book-tax difference and excess tax deductions \nof about $1 billion.\n\n  KB Home, for example, is a company that builds residential homes. Its \nstock price had more than quadrupled over the 10 years leading up to \n2006. Over the same time period, it had repeatedly granted stock \noptions to its then CEO. Company records show that, over 5 years, KB \nHome gave him 5.5 million stock options of which, by 2006, he had \nexercised more than 3 million.\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n  With respect to those 3 million stock options, KB Home recorded a \nzero expense on its books. Had the new accounting rule been in effect, \nKB Home calculated that it would have reported on its books a \ncompensation expense of about $11.5 million. KB Home also disclosed \nthat the same 3 million stock options enabled it to claim compensation \nexpenses on its tax returns totaling about $143.7 million. In other \nwords, KB Home claimed a $143 million tax deduction for expenses that \non its books, under current accounting rules, would have totaled $11.5 \nmillion. That is a tax deduction 12 times bigger than the book expense.\n  Occidental Petroleum disclosed a similar book-tax discrepancy. That \ncompany's stock price had also skyrocketed, dramatically increasing the \nvalue of the 16 million stock options granted to its CEO since 1993. Of \nthe 12 million stock options the CEO actually exercised over a 5-year \nperiod, Occidental Petroleum claimed a $353 million tax deduction for a \nbook expense that, under current accounting rules, would have totaled \njust $29 million. That is a book-tax difference of more than 1200 \npercent.\n  Similar book-tax discrepancies applied to the other companies we \nexamined. Cisco System's CEO exercised nearly 19 million stock options \nover 5 years, and provided the company with a $169 million tax \ndeduction for a book expense which, under current accounting rules, \nwould have totaled about $21 million. UnitedHealth's former CEO \nexercised over 9 million stock options in 5 years, providing the \ncompany with a $318 million tax deduction for a book expense which \nwould have totaled about $46 million. Safeway's CEO exercised over 2 \nmillion stock options, providing the company with a $39 million tax \ndeduction for a book expense which would have totaled about $6.5 \nmillion.\n  Altogether, these nine companies took stock option tax deductions \ntotaling about $1.2 billion, a figure nearly five times larger than the \n$217 million that their combined stock option book expenses would have \nbeen. The resulting $1 billion in excess tax deductions represents a \ntax windfall for these companies simply because they issued lots of \nstock options to their CEOs.\n  Tax rules that produce huge tax deductions that are many times larger \nthan the related stock option book expenses give companies an incentive \nto issue massive stock option grants, because they know it is highly \nlikely the stock options will produce a relatively small hit to the \nprofits shown on their books, and are likely to produce a much larger \ntax deduction that can dramatically lower their taxes.\n  The data we gathered for just nine companies found excess stock \noption tax deductions of $1 billion. To gauge whether the same tax gap \napplied to stock options across the country as a whole, the \nSubcommittee asked the IRS to perform an analysis of what, back then, \nwas newly available stock option data.\n  The data is taken from tax Schedule M-3, which corporations were \nrequired to file for the first time in 2004, with their tax returns. \nThe M-3 Schedule asks companies to identify differences in how they \nreport corporate income to investors versus what they report to Uncle \nSam, so that the IRS can track and analyze significant book-tax \ndifferences.\n  The M-3 data showed that, for corporate tax returns filed from July \n1, 2004 to June 30, 2005, the first full year in which it was \navailable, companies' stock option tax deductions totaled about $43 \nbillion more than their stock options expenses on their books. Similar \ndata over the next 5 years, with the latest available data from tax \nreturns filed from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009, showed that corporate \nstock option tax deductions as a whole exceeded their book expenses \nevery year by billions of dollars, with the size of the excess tax \ndeductions varying from $12 billion to $61 billion per year. These \nexcessive deductions meant billions of dollars in reduced taxes for the \nrelevant corporations each year.\n  In addition, the IRS data showed that the bulk of the stock option \ndeductions were taken by a relatively small number of corporations \nnationwide. For example, in 2005, 56 percent of the excess tax \ndeductions were taken by only 100 corporations, while 76 percent were \ntaken by 250 corporations. In fact, over the 5 years of data, just 250 \ncorporations took two thirds to three quarters of all of the stock \noption deductions claimed in those years. That is just 250 corporations \nout of the more than 5 million corporations that filed tax returns each \nyear. In other words, the IRS data proves that the corporate stock \noption tax loophole actually benefits a very small number of \ncorporations.\n  Claiming massive stock option tax deductions enabled those \ncorporations, as a whole, to legally reduce payment of their taxes by \nbillions of dollars each year. Moreover, under current tax rules, if a \nstock option deduction is not useful in the year it is first available, \nthe corporation is allowed to add the deduction to its net operating \nlosses and use the deduction to reduce its taxes for up to the next 20 \nyears, an unbelievable windfall. It is a corporate loophole that just \nkeeps going.\n  There were other surprises in the stock option data as well. One set \nof issues disclosed by the data involves what happens to unexercised \nstock options. Under the current mismatched set of accounting and tax \nrules, stock options which are granted, vested, but never exercised by \nthe option holder turn out to produce a corporate book expense but no \ntax deduction.\n  Cisco Systems told the Subcommittee, for example, that in addition to \nthe 19 million exercised stock options previously mentioned, their CEO \nheld about 8 million options that, due to a stock price drop, would \nlikely expire without being exercised. Cisco calculated that, had FAS \n123R been in effect at the time those options were granted, the company \nwould have had to show a $139 million book expense, but would never \nhave been able to claim a tax deduction for this expense since the \noptions would never have been exercised. Apple made a similar point. It \ntold the Subcommittee that, in 2003, it allowed its CEO to trade 17.5 \nmillion in underwater stock options for 5 million shares of restricted \nstock. That trade meant the stock options would never be exercised and, \nunder current rules, would produce a book expense without ever \nproducing a tax deduction.\n  In both of these cases, under current accounting rules, it is \npossible that the stock options given to a corporate executive would \nhave produced a reported book expense greater than the company's tax \ndeduction. While the M-3 data indicates that, overall, accounting \nexpenses lag far behind claimed tax deductions, the possible financial \nimpact on an individual company with a large number of unexercised \nstock options is additional evidence that existing stock option \naccounting and tax rules are out of kilter and should be brought into \nalignment. Under our bill, if a company incurred a stock option \nexpense, it would always be able to claim a tax deduction for that \nexpense.\n  Another set of issues brought to light by the stock option data \nfocuses on the fact that the current stock option tax deduction is \ntypically claimed years later than the initial book expense. Normally, \na corporation dispenses compensation to an employee and takes a tax \ndeduction in the same year for the expense. The company controls the \ntiming and amount of the compensation expense and the corresponding tax \ndeduction. With respect to stock options, however, corporations may \nhave to wait years to see if, when, and how much of a deduction can be \ntaken. That's because the corporate tax deduction is wholly dependent \nupon when an individual corporate executive decides to exercise his or \nher stock options.\n  Our bill would require that, when the company gives away something of \nvalue, it reflects that expense on its books and claims that same \nexpense in the same year on its tax return. The company, and the \ngovernment, would not have to wait to see if and when the stock options \ngiven to executives were exercised. As with any other form of \ncompensation, the company would use the FASB accounting rules to \ndetermine the value of what it is giving away, and take the equivalent \ntax deduction in the year the compensation was provided.\n  UnitedHealth, for example, told the Subcommittee that it gave its \nformer CEO 8 million stock options in 1999, of which, by 2006, only \nabout 730,000 had been exercised. It did not know if or when its former \nCEO would exercise the remaining 7 million options, and so could not \ncalculate when or how much\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nof a tax deduction it would be able to claim for this compensation \nexpense.\n  If the rules for stock option tax deductions were changed as provided \nfor in our bill, companies would typically take the deduction years \nearlier than they do now, without waiting to see if and when particular \noptions are exercised. In addition, by requiring stock option expenses \nto be deducted in the same year they appear on the company books, stock \noptions would become consistent with how other forms of compensation \nare treated in the tax code.\n  Right now, U.S. stock option accounting and tax rules are mismatched, \nmisaligned, and out of kilter. They allow companies collectively to \ndeduct billions of dollars in stock option expenses in excess of the \nexpenses that actually appear on the company books. They disallow tax \ndeductions for stock options that are given as compensation but never \nexercised. They often force companies to wait years to claim a tax \ndeduction for a compensation expense that could and should be claimed \nin the same year it appears on the company books.\n  The bill being introduced today would cure those problems. It would \nbring stock option accounting and tax rules into alignment, so that the \ntwo sets of rules would apply in a consistent manner. It would \naccomplish that goal simply by requiring the corporate stock option tax \ndeduction to reflect the stock option expenses as shown on the \ncorporate books each year.\n  Specifically, the bill would end use of the current stock option \ndeduction under Section 83 of the tax code, which allows corporations \nto deduct stock option expenses when exercised in an amount equal to \nthe income declared by the individual exercising the option, replacing \nit with a new Section 162(q), which would require companies to deduct \nthe stock option expenses as shown on their books each year.\n  The bill would apply only to corporate stock option deductions; it \nwould make no changes to the rules that apply to individuals who \nreceive stock options as part of their compensation. Those individuals \nwould still report their compensation in the year they exercise their \nstock options. They would still report as income the difference between \nwhat they paid to exercise the options and the fair market value of the \nstock they received upon exercise. The gain would continue to be \ntreated as ordinary income rather than a capital gain, since the option \nholder did not invest any capital in the stock prior to exercising the \nstock option and the only reason the person obtained the stock was \nbecause of the services they performed for the corporation.\n  The amount of income declared by an individual after exercising a \nstock option will likely be greater than the stock option expense \nbooked and deducted by the corporation which employed that individual. \nThat's in part because the individual's gain often comes years after \nthe original stock option grant, during which time the underlying stock \nwill usually have gained in value. In addition, the individual will \ntypically exercise the option and immediately sell the stock and \ntherefore receive income, not just from the corporation that supplied \nthe stock options years earlier, but also from the third parties \npurchasing the resulting shares.\n  Consider the same example discussed earlier of an executive who \nexercised options to buy 1 million shares of stock at $10 per share, \nobtained the shares from the corporation, and then immediately sold \nthem on the open market for $30 per share, making a total profit of $20 \nmillion. The individual's corporation didn't supply that $20 million. \nJust the opposite. Rather than paying cash to its executive, the \ncorporation received a $10 million payment from the executive in \nexchange for the 1 million shares. The $20 million profit from selling \nthe shares was paid, not by the corporation, but by third parties in \nthe marketplace who purchased the stock. That's why it makes no sense \nfor the company to declare as an expense the amount of profit that an \nemployee--often a former employee--obtained from unrelated parties in \nthe marketplace.\n  The executive who exercised the stock options must still treat any \nresulting profit as ordinary income for the reasons given earlier: the \nexecutive received the shares at a below market cost, solely because of \nwork that the executive performed for the corporation in return for the \nstock option compensation.\n  The bill we are introducing today would put an end to the current \napproach of allowing a corporation to take a mirror deduction equal to \nthe ordinary income declared by its executive. It would break that old \nartificial illogical symmetry and replace it with a new logical \nsymmetry--one in which the corporation's stock option tax deduction \nwould match its book expense.\n  I call the current approach a case of artificial symmetry, because it \nuses a construct in the tax code that, when first implemented 40 years \nago, enabled corporations to calculate their stock option expense on \nthe exercise date, when there was no consensus on how to calculate \nstock option expenses on the grant date. The artificiality of the \napproach is demonstrated by the fact that it allows corporations to \nclaim a deductible expense for money that comes not from company \ncoffers, but from third parties in the stock market. Now that an \naccounting consensus determines how to calculate stock option expenses \non the grant date, however, there is no longer any need to rely on an \nartificial construct that calculates corporate stock option expenses on \nthe exercise date using third party funds.\n  It is also important to note that the bill would not affect in any \nway current tax provisions that provide favored tax treatment to so-\ncalled Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the tax code. Under \nthat section, in certain circumstances, corporations can surrender \ntheir stock option deductions in favor of allowing their employees with \nstock option gains to be taxed at a capital gains rate instead of \nordinary income tax rates. Many start-up companies use these types of \nstock options, because they don't yet have taxable profits and don't \nneed a stock option tax deduction. So they forfeit their stock option \ncorporate deduction in favor of giving their employees more favorable \ntreatment of their stock option income. Incentive Stock Options would \nnot be affected by our legislation and would remain available to any \ncorporation providing stock options to its employees.\n  The bill would make one other important change to the tax code as it \nrelates to corporate stock option tax deductions. In 1993, Congress \nenacted a $1 million cap on the compensation that a corporation can \ndeduct from its taxes, so that other taxpayers wouldn't be forced to \nsubsidize corporate executive pay. That cap was not applied to stock \noptions, however, instead allowing companies to deduct any amount of \nstock option compensation from their tax obligations, without limit.\n  By not applying the $1 million cap to stock option compensation, the \ntax code created a significant tax incentive for corporations to pay \ntheir executives with stock options. Indeed, it is common for \nexecutives to have salaries of $1 million, while simultaneously \nreceiving millions of dollars more in stock options. History has \nsubsequently shown that the $1 million cap--established to stop \nordinary taxpayers from being forced to subsidize enormous paychecks \nfor corporate executives--is effectively meaningless without including \nstock options.\n  Further, while corporate directors may be comfortable diluting their \nshareholders' interests while doling out massive amounts of stock \noptions, that still does not mean that ordinary taxpayers should be \nforced to subsidize the large amounts of stock option compensation \ninvolved. The bill would eliminate this unwarranted, favored treatment \nof executive stock options by making deductions for this type of \ncompensation subject to the same $1 million cap that applies to other \nforms of compensation covered by Section 162(m). It is also worth \nnoting that, if the cap were applied to stock options, it would not \nprevent stock option pay from exceeding $1 million--it would simply \nensure that those stock option awards were not made at the expense of \nordinary taxpayers.\n  The bill also contains several technical provisions. First, it would \nmake a conforming change to the research tax credit so that stock \noption expenses claimed under that credit would match the stock option \ndeductions taken under the new tax code section 162(q).\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nSecond, the bill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt \nregulations governing how to calculate the deduction for stock options \nin unusual circumstances, such as when a parent corporation issues \noptions on its shares to the employee of a subsidiary or another \ncorporation in a consolidated group, or when one corporation issues \noptions on its shares to employees of a joint venture.\n  Finally, the bill contains a transition rule for applying the new \nSection 162(q) stock option tax deduction to existing and future stock \noption grants. Essentially, this transition rule would ensure that \nstock options issued prior to the enactment date of the legislation \nwould remain tax deductible and ensure all corporations can start \ndeducting stock option expenses on a yearly schedule.\n  The transition rule has three parts. First, it would allow the old \nSection 83 deduction rules to apply to any option which was vested \nprior to the effective date of the new stock option accounting rule, \nFAS 123R, and exercised after the date of enactment of the bill. The \neffective date of FAS 123R is June 15, 2005 for most corporations, and \nDecember 31, 2005 for most small businesses. Prior to the effective \ndate of FAS 123R, most corporations would have shown a zero expense on \ntheir books for the stock options issued to their executives and, thus, \nwould be unable to claim a tax deduction under the new Section 162(q). \nFor that reason, the bill would allow these corporations to continue to \nuse Section 83 to claim stock option deductions on their tax returns.\n  For stock options that vested after the effective date of FAS 123R \nand were exercised after the date of enactment, the bill takes another \ntack. Under FAS 123R, these corporations would have had to show the \nappropriate stock option expense on their books, but would have been \nunable to take a tax deduction until the executive actually exercised \nthe option. For those options, the bill would allow corporations to \ntake an immediate tax deduction--in the first year that the bill is in \neffect--for all of the expenses shown on their books with respect to \nthese options. This ``catch-up deduction'' in the first year after \nenactment would enable corporations, in the following years, to begin \nwith a clean slate so that their tax returns the next year would \nreflect their actual stock option book expenses for that same year.\n  After that catch-up year, all stock option expenses incurred by a \ncompany each year would be reflected in their annual tax deductions \nunder the new Section 162(q).\n  This transition rule is a generous one, but even with it, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has estimated that closing the corporate stock \noption tax deduction loophole would produce $24.6 billion in corporate \ntax revenues over 10 years.\n  Over the last 5 years, the stock option book-tax gap has ranged from \n$12 billion to $61 billion per year, generating deductions far in \nexcess of corporate expenses. Corporations have avoided paying their \nfair share to Uncle Sam by simply giving their executives the right to \ntap huge sums of money from the stock market. It is a tax policy that \nforces ordinary taxpayers to subsidize outsized executive compensation \nand that favors corporations doling out stock options over paying their \nexecutives in cash.\n  Right now, stock options are the only compensation expense where the \ntax code allows companies to deduct more than their book expense. In \nthese times of financial distress, we cannot afford this multi-billion \ndollar loss to the Treasury, not only because of the need to reduce the \ndeficit, but also because the stock option tax deduction contributes to \nthe anger and social disruption caused by the ever deepening chasm \nbetween the pay of executives and the pay of average workers.\n  The Obama administration has pledged itself to closing unfair \ncorporate tax loopholes and to returning sanity to executive pay. It \nshould start with supporting an end to excessive stock option corporate \ndeductions. I urge my colleagues to include this legislation in any \ndeficit reduction package this year, or to pass it separately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/14/senate-section/article/S4620-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 553.
