Yesterday Senate Republicans once again rejected the idea \nthat millionaires and billionaires should contribute their fair share \nto help the country prosper. Republicans sent a message to millions of \nhonest hard-working Americans who will file their taxes today: It is \nfair for Warren Buffett to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. And \nthat is not fair.\n  Republicans said that it is fair for Mitt Romney to pay a lower tax \nrate than his cleaning lady or his chauffeur. That is not fair. My \nRepublican colleagues believe it is fair for hedge fund managers and \nexecutives to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and waitresses \nand busdrivers. But that is something you do not have to take my word \nfor; that is what President Ronald Reagan called a system of \nunproductive tax loopholes that allows some of the truly wealthy to \navoid paying their fair share.\n  In 1985 Ronald Reagan knocked the web of loopholes that allowed \npeople making hundreds of millions of dollars each year to pay lower \ntax rates than construction workers or janitors. President Reagan \ncalled it crazy, and, to his credit, he worked with a couple of \nDemocrats--Senator Bradley of New Jersey and Congressman Gephardt of \nMissouri--and came up with the Bradley-Gephardt Tax Fairness Act. It \nworked well for a long time, but we have allowed other things to get in \nthe way of that good Bradley-Gephardt legislation. Now we are back to \nwhat Ronald Reagan was talking about those many years ago.\n  This broken system made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing \nwhile a busdriver was paying 10 percent of his salary. That is what \nPresident Reagan said. But the same system is in place today, as I have \njust explained, and, as that radical liberal Ronald Reagan said, that \nis just crazy. Those were his words.\n  Yesterday my Republican colleagues used some strong words to oppose \nthe Democrats' plan to fight the inequality. Republicans called our \ncommonsense proposal to ensure that no one making more than $1 million \na year pays a lower tax rate than a truckdriver, a secretary, or a \npolice officer--they called it class warfare. It is not class warfare \nbut class welfare--welfare for the wealthy at the expense of the middle \nclass. It is class welfare, not warfare.\n  Republicans are pushing a budget that would end Medicare as we know \nit--just passed the House--slashing nursing home coverage for the \nelderly, decimating Pell grant funding, and kicking 200,000 children \nout of the Head Start Program.\n  They are calling our proposal class warfare. I wish that were the \nmost ridiculous thing they have said about\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nour proposal to bring a measure of fairness to America's tax system, \nbut far from it. One Member of the Senate leadership equated this \nmeasure to shooting ourselves in the head. The Paying a Fair Share \nAct--the Buffett rule--would have ensured that millionaires and \nbillionaires paid at least as much as their secretaries, assistants, \nand even their nannies. Yet Republicans think asking those lucky \nmillionaires and billionaires to contribute their fair share is just \nlike shooting the country in the head. That is what they said.\n  Our legislation would have protected 99 percent of small business \nowners and maintained deductions for charitable giving, and it would \nhave been a small but meaningful step to reduce our deficit at a time \nwhen every penny--in this case, every billion--counts.\n  It does not seem radical to me to ask Warren Buffett, who made almost \n$63 million in 2010, to pay a higher tax rate than his secretary. The \nPresiding Office can remember when he came and spoke to a group of \nassembled Democrats. He carried around with him his tax returns for the \nlast several years. He is the one who told us how much he made in 2010, \nand he lamented the fact that he was paying the tax rate that he was.\n  Well, it does not seem radical to me, it did not seem radical to \nRonald Reagan, and it does not seem radical to three-quarters of the \nAmerican people who support our legislation. The wealthiest Americans \ntake home a greater percentage of our Nation's income than anytime in \nnearly a century. Yet they enjoy the lowest tax rate in more than five \ndecades--the lowest tax rate. So it is no surprise that Americans \nbelieve millionaires should shoulder their fair share. Even two-thirds \nof millionaires and a majority of Republicans around the country agree \nit is time to fix a system rigged to favor the richest of the rich. \nRepublicans in Congress are the only ones not on board on this issue.\n  If you need evidence that millionaires and billionaires can afford to \ncontribute a little more, consider this one simple fact: Last year \nthere were 7,000 people who made more than $1 million who did not pay a \nsingle penny of Federal income tax--not a penny. Thanks to Republicans, \nthese lucky millionaires and billionaires can keep gaming the system \nwhile middle-class workers keep picking up the tab.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2346-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I highlighted some of the \ntremendous challenges we face in our country and this President's \nrefusal to face them with the seriousness they demand.\n  At a moment when the Federal debt makes us look a lot like Greece, \nPresident Obama spends his time running around stumping for a tax hike \nthat he knows will not help and that he knows will not pass. On gas \nprices, the President's response has been to call for a tax hike on \nenergy manufactures, which, if anything, will drive the price of gas \neven higher and which he knows will not pass.\n  Now we hear that the President is announcing some kind of task force \non oil speculation today--in other words, the same thing Washington \nDemocrats always call for when gas prices go up. If I were to guess, I \nwould say today's proposal by the President probably polls pretty well, \nbut I guarantee you it will not do a thing to lower the price of gas at \nthe pump. It never has in the past. White House officials admit as \nmuch. So why would it now?\n  The Democrats' favorite policy adviser, Warren Buffett, weighed in on \nthe issue a few years ago. Here is what Warren Buffett had to say about \nit. Asked about the role speculation in the oil markets plays in \ndetermining price, he said, ``It's not speculation, it's supply and \ndemand.'' That is Warren Buffett on speculation relating to the oil \nmarkets. ``It's not speculation,'' Warren Buffett said, ``it's supply \nand demand.'' But, of course, that is not the point for this White \nHouse. President Obama only seems to care about Warren Buffett's \nopinion if it polls well.\n  The President's goal here is not to do something about the problem, \nit is to make people think he is doing something about the problem \nuntil the next crisis comes along. And that is the larger problem, that \nwe have a President who is more concerned with looking as if he is \ndoing something than in actually doing what is needed to tackle the \nchallenges we face. We have a President who told us that he was a \ndifferent kind of politician doing the same old things and using the \nsame old talking points politicians in Washington have been peddling \nfor literally years--for years. I mean, weren't these kinds of gimmicks \nand stale talking points precisely what President Obama campaigned \nagainst 4 years ago? I thought he was offering something new, something \ndifferent.\n  I think the Associated Press summed up the President's latest \nproposal pretty well this morning. The White House plan, which Obama \nwas to unveil Tuesday, the AP said, is more likely to draw sharp \nelection-year distinctions with Republicans than to have an immediate \neffect on prices at the pump. Well, AP pretty well summed it up. They \nsaid it is more about drawing a distinction. Look, we do not need new \ndistinctions, we need solutions. Americans need lawmakers who are more \nconcerned with facing up to the problems we face than getting \nreelected. They need a President who thinks about solving a problem, a \nPresident who thinks solving a problem involves more than giving a \nspeech about it and pointing the finger at whatever does not poll well \nthat particular day.\n  As I said yesterday, the President seems to have forgotten why he was \nelected in the first place. He seems to have forgotten his own campaign \nrhetoric: that he was going to be different, that he would bridge \ndifferences, that he would bring people together. The reality could not \nbe more different or more disappointing. The sad truth is that it is \nall politics, all the time in this White House. They are out of ideas. \nThey have nothing new to offer. Today's announcement is all the proof \nyou need of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2346-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the weekend the United States, \nBritain, France, China, Russia, and Germany returned to the negotiating \ntable with Iran for the first time since January 2011. Reports indicate \nmodest progress was made, and a second round of talks has now been \nscheduled for May.\n  While these negotiations represent an opportunity to achieve a \npeaceful outcome regarding Iran's nuclear program, the United States \nand our allies must guard against Iranian delays. Iran has a history of \nusing negotiations as a stalling tactic. While our negotiators talk, \nthe centrifuges keep spinning. That is the crux of the problem--Iran's \nnuclear program continues.\n  According to the most recent report in February from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has produced more than 5,400 \nkilograms of low-enriched uranium and more than 100 kilograms of \nuranium enriched to a level of 20 percent. Enriching uranium to a level \nof 20 percent represents 85 to 90 percent of the work needed to reach \nweapons-grade fuel. Iran is also preparing additional cascades used to \nproduce enriched uranium, which will accelerate the speed at which it \ncan stockpile nuclear material. In total, Iran has enriched enough \nuranium\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\nthat, upon further processing, could build three to four nuclear \nweapons.\n  In response to Iran's continued nuclear program and its defiance of \nUnited Nations' Security Council resolutions, the United States and \nmany of our allies have adopted sanctions on Iran. Sanctions are having \na significant impact on the Iranian economy. In March, Iran's oil \nexports fell nearly 300,000 barrels per day or 12 percent, according to \nforeign reports. Iran's currency has lost roughly half its value in the \npast year, and inflation is more than 20 percent. The new European \nUnion sanctions are scheduled to take effect this summer. These would \nmake it even more difficult for Iran to ship oil globally.\n  Once the EU sanctions go into effect in July, the Congressional \nResearch Service estimates that oil sales could fall by up to 40 \npercent.\n  In addition, a major Chinese insurance provider has announced it will \nno longer insure ships carrying Iranian oil. These are important \ndevelopments that will increase economic pressure on the Iranian \nregime. Yet neither sanctions nor past negotiations have stopped Iran's \nnuclear program and its quest for a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran's nuclear program threatens American interests. First, Iran's \npursuit of nuclear weapons increases the risk of global nuclear \nproliferation, which would jeopardize the security of the United \nStates. The last two nations to acquire nuclear weapons--Pakistan and \nNorth Korea--have presented numerous challenges to American security \ninterests.\n  North Korea provoked international condemnation last week when it \nlaunched its rocket. In Pakistan, a December report in the Atlantic \ncalled into question the security of that country's nuclear arsenal, \nstating that Pakistan regularly transports nuclear weapons through city \nstreets without much security.\n  If Iran obtains a nuclear weapon other nations in the Middle East may \nsoon follow. Saudi Arabia has already said it will consider seeking \nnuclear capability if Iran's program is not stopped.\n  Second, a nuclear Iran could increase its support of terrorism. Iran \nis already one of the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism, \nfunneling money and weapons and supporting training for terrorist \ngroups, including Hezbollah and Hamas. With a nuclear weapon Iran and \nits terrorist allies may be emboldened to carry out even more attacks. \nFurthermore, what would prevent Iran from giving nuclear weapons to one \nof the terrorist groups it supports, sharing its capabilities with one \nof the terrorist groups?\n  Third, a nuclear Iran could exert more influence over world oil \nmarkets. A direct link exists between volatile oil prices and Iran's \nnuclear program. Prices have risen when tensions have increased, and \nwhen tensions recede prices typically decline. American consumers and \nbusinesses are directly affected by these volatile prices that \nnegatively impact our economic well-being.\n  Although Saudi Arabia has pledged to boost production to make up for \nthe loss of Iranian oil on the market, this will reduce spare \nproduction capacity and leave our country and the global economy \nvulnerable to any reduction in supplies, whether from conflicts within \noil-producing nations or from natural disaster.\n  Finally, a nuclear Iran would threaten the safety of American troops \nserving abroad in the Middle East. For years Iran has fought American \npresence in the Middle East and has supported terrorist groups who have \ntargeted and killed American troops. American officials believe Iran \nsupported the terrorists responsible for the 1996 attack on a U.S. \nmilitary residence in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 of our servicemen.\n  Iran also has long-range missiles that could hit U.S. military bases \nin the region, including ones in Turkey, Afghanistan, Bahrain, and \nKuwait. Iran's nuclear program also threatens the existence of our \nally, Israel.\n  The President of Iran has called for Israel to be ``wiped off the \nmap.'' If Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, its leaders would have the \ncapability to do the destructive things of which they speak. \nUnderstandably, Israel is worried. Israelis know all too well the price \nof war because they have witnessed war and destruction. They know what \ncan happen when evil men gain the ability to carry out evil deeds.\n  While some would have us believe Iran is Israel's problem, we should \nnot be fooled. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens all nations \nthat care about global peace and stability. We cannot leave Israel to \ndeal with this crisis alone. American leadership is needed now more \nthan ever to stop Iran. We can begin by passing the Iran Sanctions \nAccountability and Human Rights Act. This legislation, which came \nthrough the Banking Committee, on which I serve, earlier this year \nstrengthens and expands existing sanctions and for the first time makes \nit official U.S. policy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. \nThe administration and President Obama must also fully enforce U.S. law \nand penalize those who violate U.S. sanctions.\n  In addition, the U.S. should use current negotiations to bring about \nan end to Iran's nuclear program. As a party to the nonproliferation \ntreaty, Iran must adhere to its obligations under that treaty and \nprovide transparency to international inspectors.\n  The longer Iran's nuclear program continues, the greater the danger \ngrows for the United States and all nations. Last month, Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in Washington. He is an incredible \nleader, and his speech to Congress last year was one of the best I have \never heard. While speaking in Washington last month, he laid out very \nclearly why a nuclear Iran would be such a grave danger. He said for \nthe last 15 years he has been warning the world about a nuclear Iran.\n  We must not be fooled by negotiations that only stall and continue to \ncreate the opportunity for greater disaster down the road. Prime \nMinister Netanyahu said no one would be happier than he if Iran gave up \nits nuclear quest. But there are many around the world who would be \nhappy because we all know the world would be a far safer, more peaceful \nplace without a nuclear Iran. While we all desire a peaceful \nresolution, negotiations must not be a stalling tactic or an excuse for \ninaction.\n  Thursday of this week is Holocaust Remembrance Day. As we pause to \nremember and reflect on this past tragedy, the United States must act \nto prevent a nuclear Iran and the real possibility of a future tragedy. \nThe world cannot again look the other way.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2347-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2347-S2348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AID TO EGYPT\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment that \nwould end aid to Egypt until they end the prosecution of our U.S. \ncitizens. I offered this amendment earlier this spring when Egypt was \ndetaining our citizens--these prodemocracy workers--and was not letting \nthem leave the country. Since then, they have let them leave the \ncountry but sort of in an insulting fashion in the sense they have let \nthem leave when we paid, basically, ransom. We had to pay about $5 \nmillion in ransom--$300,000 per person--to let these people leave \nEgypt.\n  So they came home, but Egypt still could only get its aid if the \nadministration certified they were pro democracy. Within days, \nSecretary Clinton did release the aid and said they were achieving \ntheir democratic goals. I wrote a letter to Secretary Clinton asking \nher not to do this because the prosecutions still go on. These American \ncitizens who were allowed to leave the country had to pay $300,000 in \nbail but they also had to sign a statement saying they were coming back \nfor the trial.\n  Everybody said, well, I doubt they are ever going back to Egypt for \nthese show trials. But it gets worse. It turns out in December of last \nyear, President Obama signed an Executive order--this is Order No. \n13524--that gives Interpol, the international police organization, \nimmunity in our country. We also have an extradition treaty with Egypt,\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nmeaning if you are accused of a crime in Egypt, we can send you back.\n  The danger is whether these prodemocracy workers are safe in the \nUnited States. We have Interpol agents in the United States who now \nhave immunity and we have an extradition treaty with Egypt. There are \ndefinitely problems with allowing this to go on. This is an indication \nto me that maybe Egypt is not pursuing democratic goals, and that \ncertifying them as a democratic country is perhaps not in our best \ninterest, and maybe sending nearly $2 billion of taxpayer money to \nEgypt, which continues to prosecute our citizens, is not a good idea.\n  Let me give an example of what Interpol is doing. Interpol recently \ntook a Saudi journalist from Malaysia and sent him back to Saudi \nArabia. Do you know what the crime was? He was accused of blasphemy. He \nwas accused of the religious crime of apostasy. Do you know what the \npenalty in Saudi Arabia for blasphemy is? The death penalty. So we are \nnow using an international police agency to go into a sovereign nation, \nwhere someone is accused of a religious crime and is sent back to a \ncountry where they can be put to death. This alarms me.\n  People say, oh, that could never happen in America. Well, right now, \nthe President has allowed Interpol, through an Executive order, through \nthe President's signature, to have diplomatic immunity in our country. \nFor all I know, Interpol could be at this very moment looking for \nAmerican citizens in this country and trying to get those people and \nextradite them to Egypt. This is a problem. This is why you don't want \nan international police force to operate within your sovereign Nation. \nThere can be cooperation, but you don't want impunity and immunity for \nan international police force within your borders.\n  So I will introduce again an amendment to this bill and this \namendment will say no aid to Egypt until they end this prosecution; no \naid to Egypt until they end these red letter warrants they have asked \nfor on U.S. citizens to be extradited to Egypt. We can't allow U.S. \ncitizens to be sent to a foreign country to be tried in that country \nwhere blasphemy is a crime. Those are not American values, those are \nnot American ways, and we cannot allow U.S. citizens to be subject to \nforeign laws and foreign crimes.\n  I will ask today for a vote on an amendment that will end Egyptian \naid or at least delay Egyptian foreign aid until they relinquish this \nprosecution of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2348-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \ninvoked on the motion to proceed to S. 1789 is agreed to. The motion to \nreconsider the vote is agreed to, and the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto S. 1789, upon reconsideration. The Chair directs the clerk to read \nthe motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 296, S. 1789, a bill to \n     improve, sustain, and transform the United States Postal \n     Service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge all of our colleagues to \nsupport the pending cloture motion filed by the leaders so we can begin \na debate that will help decide whether the U.S. Postal Service--this \niconic American institution created more than two centuries ago, \nembedded in the Constitution, created in the age of inkwells and quill \npens--will survive in the age of e-mail and the Internet.\n  To me, this cloture vote should be an easy one because if we vote \nagainst cloture, we are essentially saying two things: One is we don't \nwant to do anything. If we don't do anything, the Postal Service is \ngoing to run out of money and hit its borrowing limit later this year, \nforcing us to miss payments and unnecessarily begin to shut back or \nclose down operations, which is the last thing the country needs at \nthis point.\n  Frankly, the other thing we will do if we think we should do nothing \nis to leave the Postmaster General, the Postal Service, with an \nunlimited right to take steps that I believe a majority of Members of \nthis body don't want to be taken precipitously without considering the \nalternative. That alternative is closing thousands of post offices \naround the country, including small towns in rural areas, and \ndramatically and quickly cutting back on the number of mail processing \nfacilities, and therefore the standards by which mail is delivered and \nthe speed with which it is delivered in this country. So I hope our \ncolleagues consider this an easy vote, which is simply not to turn away \nfrom the crisis the Postal Service is in.\n  Senator Collins and I are joined by Senator Carper and Senator Scott \nBrown. We have a substitute that is a bipartisan proposal that I think \nwill help save the post office but also force it to begin to make tough \ncost-efficient steps to keep itself in fiscal balance.\n  Let me give a sense of the scope of this matter. The Postal Service \ntoday, if it were a private corporation, would be the 35th largest \ncompany in the United States based on revenue, putting it just ahead of \nApple. It would be the country's second largest employer just behind \nWalmart. The 32,000 post offices in America represent more domestic \nretail outlets than Walmart, Starbucks, and McDonald's combined.\n  These are big numbers, and the post office has a storied history. But \ntoday it is a troubled business and, frankly, on the verge of \ninsolvency if we don't act--in part because of the recent economic \nrecession but mostly because of the transformational impact of the \nInternet. The Postal Service has had a 21-percent drop in mail volume \nin the past 5 years, and, of course, a corresponding cut in revenue. As \nmore businesses and communication move online, mail volume is \ninevitably going to continue to decrease.\n  In fiscal year 2011 the Postal Service took in $65.7 billion but had \nexpenses of $70.6 billion. This $5 billion loss would have actually \nbeen twice that if Congress had not delayed the due date for a \nstatutorily required payment to the retiree health plan due at the end \nof the fiscal year. That followed record losses of $8.5 billion in \n2010. This simply cannot continue. As I said earlier, if nothing is \ndone, the Postal Service will not have enough money to pay its bill.\n  Please vote for cloture. We have a good, solid substitute that is a \nmajor reform with some due process that will make the post office \nleaner and more efficient. It will dramatically reduce the number of \nemployees and the number of facilities the post office maintains, but \nit will do so in a way that I think is evolutionary and not Draconian \neither to the Postal Service or the impact it would have on the \nmillions of people who depend on the post office and will continue to \nevery day.\n  There are a lot of different ideas about how to fix the post office. \nSome people don't want us to make any changes, and that is the road to \nbankruptcy. Some people want us to make Draconian changes right away, \nand I don't think that is appropriate. So I ask for a vote for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with the \nchairman of the Homeland Security Committee in urging all of our \ncolleagues to cast a vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to this \nvitally important bill.\n  There are many different views on how to save the Postal Service, but \nthere can be no doubt that the Postal\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nService is in crisis. We are at a critical juncture. Without passing \nlegislation, the Postal Service will simply be unable to meet its \npayroll, perhaps as soon as this fall. We simply cannot allow that to \nhappen.\n  The Postal Service is vital to our economy. It is the linchpin of a \ntrillion-dollar mailing industry that employs nearly 8.7 million \nAmericans in fields as diverse as printing, catalog companies, paper \nmanufacturing, and newspaper and magazine publishers. These industries \nand the jobs they sustain are in jeopardy. If we fail to act, we will \ndeliver a crippling blow to the Postal Service.\n  As Senator Lieberman has indicated, the Postal Service is in crisis. \nIt has lost more than $13 billion just in the past 2 years. First-class \nmail volume has dropped by 23 percent over the past 5 years and 12 \npercent over the past 2 years. The Postal Service has a debt to the \nU.S. Treasury of $13 billion and will max out its credit limit of $15 \nbillion this year.\n  We have to address this crisis. It would be irresponsible for Members \nto simply vote no on the motion to proceed if they have other ideas on \nhow to address this crisis. I have urged a full and open and fair \namendment process so that Members can bring forth their alternative \nplans for saving the Postal Service. We simply cannot allow the Postal \nService to fail. The stakes are too high for our economy and for \nAmericans across this country.\n\n  Finally, I would remind my colleagues that the Postal Service's roots \ngo back to our Constitution. This is an organization that is vital to \nour heritage and to our future. I urge a ``yes'' vote for the motion to \nproceed.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time on our side.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 296, S. 1789, the 21st Century Postal \n     Service Act.\n         Harry Reid, Thomas R.

On this vote, the yeas are 74, the nays are \n22. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, upon reconsideration, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank our \ncolleagues for a very strong vote which says to me that Members of the \nSenate, across party lines, understand that the Postal Service is a \nhistoric and also important part of America's future. It needs to \nchange. It is in the midst of a real and dangerous fiscal crisis. We \nmay differ about how to react to that crisis, but this strong cloture \nvote says to me that three-quarters of the Members of the Senate at \nleast are ready and eager to debate and to pass something that will \nsave the Postal Service from bankruptcy and the implications that would \nhave for our economy overall. The billions of dollars or hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of our economy that depend on the mail would be \ncompromised, and our economy and jobs would be further hurt.\n  I hope that as the day goes on--obviously, with the strong vote for \ncloture, we now proceed to a 30-hour period of debate on the matter, \nbut I certainly hope that as the day goes on and the members of both \ncaucuses and the leaders talk we can find a mutually agreeable path not \nto spend the 30 hours on the debate on this motion to proceed but that \nwe go right to the bill.\n  At that point, Senator Collins and I, along with Senator Carper and \nSenator Scott Brown, will file a bipartisan substitute amendment which \nwe have worked on which we hope will be the pending matter and then \nhave an opportunity for people who have a different point of view about \nhow to deal with this fiscal crisis of the post office--not to avoid \ndealing with it--people will have an opportunity to present amendments, \nand the body will work its will, which is the most important thing.\n  There are too many great national problems the Congress is not \ndealing with because of partisanship, because of ideological rigidity, \nbecause of an unwillingness to do what has to be done in our system of \ngovernment, which is to compromise--not to compromise your principles \nbut to understand that in a representative body such as the Senate, \nrepresenting a country as big and as diverse as ours, you rarely can \nexpect to get 100 percent of what you want. The aim should be to make \nprogress, to get at least 50 percent of what you want and to let the \nother side get some of what they want as well.\n  So I would like to deliver now an opening statement and then hope \nthat the ranking member, Senator Collins, will do the same on the bill, \nthe substitute, which is S. 1789.\n  I am convinced that the substitute will help make the Postal Service \nleaner, nimbler, and more cost efficient, while still maintaining the \nservice we Americans need to live our daily lives and to keep our \neconomy going. But I want to be clear: This bill alone is not going to \nsave the U.S. Postal Service. The changes occurring around it and \nwithin it are too deep. It will represent a very significant step \nforward. It will save the Postal Service, as we will indicate as this \ndebate goes on, save billions and billions of dollars annually, and put \nthe Postal Service back on the road to fiscal balance.\n  I view this bill as a bipartisan compromise, as the middle way \nbetween two different approaches to the fiscal crisis at the Postal \nService, one that to a certain extent wants to wish it away, to say \nthat really nothing has to change and we just have to find more ways--a \ndifferent business model--we\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nhave to find more ways for the Postal Service to make money, and we can \njust keep on doing business as we are doing. The end result of that is \nthat either the Postal Service will collapse of its own weight or the \nFederal Government--the taxpayers--will be expected to bail it out, and \nI don't think that is what the American people want us to do. So one \nway is to do nothing.\n  The other way is to impose what I would call kind of an immediate \noverreaction--close thousands of post offices that people depend on \nacross the country, close hundreds of mail processing facilities, which \nwill mean that people will not be able to get their mail and businesses \nwill not be able to realize the expectation of timely delivery of the \nmail. And it will have a negative impact on this economy of ours which \nis still struggling to come out of a recession.\n  We are offering a middle way here that will provide real and \nsubstantial savings from the current operating picture of the post \noffice, which is in severe debt and lost more than $13 billion over the \nlast 2 years, but will do it with due process, will do it in a way that \nrequires the post office to look at every alternative before closing \npost offices that are so important to people in most every area of our \ncountry.\n  This bill, in other words, is an important beginning, and it will \nallow the Postal Service more time to continue working with its \ncustomers, its employees, Congress, and others to develop a balanced \napproach to what we need it to do in an age when almost every piece of \ncommunications that can be digitized is being digitized and sent over \nthe Internet.\n  But if I may, I would like to step back and offer just a little bit \nof history because we are dealing with a current problem, but there is \na rich history when you talk about the U.S. Postal Service.\n  It is kind of an accidental irony, a coincidental irony of the Senate \nbill numbers that this bill turns out to be S. 1789 because 1789 was \nthe year the first Congress under the Constitution was seated. Among \nthe duties of that founding body was the charge under article I, \nsection 8, and I quote, ``to establish Post Offices and Post Roads.'' \nIn fact, in the list of congressional powers detailed under section 8, \ncreating the postal system comes before the creation of an army, a \nnavy, or Federal courts. That is how important the Founders felt this \npublic function would be to our new government, particularly in a \ndemocracy, how important communication was, and, in a country that had \nambitious economic and commercial dreams right from the beginning, that \nthe ability to communicate through a post office would be critically \nimportant to commerce and job creation.\n  In the Revolutionary era, it was the post office, under the direction \nof our first Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin, that sped \ncommunications among the members of the Continental Congress and the \nAmerican Revolutionary military as well as delivered letters and \nnewspapers from across our fledgling Republic that helped keep the \ncitizens of our new country abreast of events in faraway cities and \ntowns.\n  If you read some of the histories of the Revolutionary War, some of \nthe great biographies done of the founding generation of Americans, \nthat extraordinary and gifted group, you see the role the post office \nand postal communications played in their ability to keep in touch with \neach other. And some of the most important communications occurred, for \ninstance, between the government and the military.\n  Ever since that early period of American history, the post office has \nhad a tradition of aiding progress and innovation. Maps from the early \ndays of our Republic show that many of the roads we still depend on \ntoday--if I may be parochial, I will cite I 95 in Connecticut and a lot \nof other places along that path--still follow and in some cases are \nbuilt on top of old post roads.\n  The job of maintaining Samuel Morse's first telegraph line between \nWashington and Baltimore was entrusted to the post office. And it was a \nformer Postmaster General who helped Morse expand his transformational \nnetwork of telegraphs and communications to other cities in our \ncountry. But that network grew slowly, so to keep our Nation connected \nwith its frontiers way out in places such as Montana, I might say to \nthe occupant of the chair, the post office helped sponsor the Pony \nExpress. That was a great early example of what we talk about a lot but \ndo not do as much as we should--public-private partnerships. The Pony \nExpress filled a necessary gap in communications until the telegraph \nfinally spanned our Nation coast to coast.\n  The post office's subsidies for airmail in the early days of aviation \nhelped jump-start the fledgling airlines and air freight industries, \nwhich, of course, we all depend on so much today.\n  I will not repeat what I said in my statement about the scope of the \nPostal Service today when I spoke earlier in support of the vote for \ncloture, but I will just repeat and say that if the post office were a \nprivate corporation, it would be the 35th largest company in the United \nStates just ahead of Apple; that is, by revenue. It would be the \ncountry's second largest employer just behind Walmart. Its 32,000 post \noffices across America represent more domestic retail outlets than \nWalmart, Starbucks, and McDonald's combined.\n  But perhaps because of some of that, certainly notwithstanding it, \nthe post office is today a troubled business. I want to speak honestly \nand directly. It is on the verge of insolvency if we do not act. Part \nof the problem more recently, obviously, is the impact of the economic \nrecession we are in, but the big problem is one that is not going to \nget better; that is, business loss to the Internet has led to a 21-\npercent drop in mail volume in the past 5 years and a slump in revenue \nas a result. You have to be unrealistic to say anything other than that \nthis trend is going to continue and that mail volume will continue--\nfirst-class mail volume will continue to decrease. As I mentioned, \nthere has been $13 billion in deficit in the last 2 years--running a \ndeficit in the last 2 years at the post office. It would have been $5 \nbillion more if Congress had not come along and delayed the due date \nfor a statutorily required retiree health care prefunding payment that \nwas due at the end of the last fiscal year.\n  This simply cannot continue. This is one of those bills that come \nalong not because you are excited about doing it but because you have \nto do it. If we do not act, I repeat, two things are going to happen: \nEither the Postal Service will become insolvent and have to cut back \nits operations or the Postmaster will use authorities he has under the \ncurrent law to close a lot of post offices and mail-processing \nfacilities and cut back service. And I know Members across party lines \ndo not want that to happen precipitously.\n  Let me now describe some of the major parts of the substitute \nbipartisan bill that has come out of our committee.\n  The bill includes the two measures that will relieve some of the \nimmediate financial pressure on the Postal Service. The first is based \non an Office of Personnel Management determination that the Postal \nService has overpaid its contributions to the Federal retirement system \nby roughly $11 billion. Call it a misunderstanding, call it a clerical \nerror--it is fortuitous for the Postal Service and the trouble it is \nin. Our bill directs OPM to refund this money to the Postal Service and \nthen directs the Postal Service to use this money to provide retirement \nincentives to employees and to pay off some of its debt.\n  Let me explain what I mean about those incentives. S. 1789, the \nsubstitute, would direct the Postal Service to use part of these \nrefunds in the Federal Employee Retirement System to reduce its labor \ncosts, which make up about 80 percent of its budget. There is no way \nthe Postal Service is going to get back in balance without continuing \nto do what it has been doing, by tens of thousands, reducing the number \nof employees it has. But the aim here is to do that as a result of a \nvoluntary buyout program.\n\n  The fact is that approximately half of the Postal Service's current \nworkforce is eligible for either full or early retirement, and if \n100,000 workers took advantage of the program--which is below the full \namount eligible--the Postal Service would save $8 billion a year. That \nis the single most significant saving item in the package that we bring \nbefore you today. We set a goal here, which is that the Postal\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nService should aim to reduce its workforce with this incentivized \nretirement program by approximately 100,000 workers or 18 percent of \nits current workforce.\n  Our bill also reduces the amount the Postal Service must pay into its \nretiree health benefits account over the next 40 years. The current \nformula of scheduled payment was part of postal reform passed some \nyears ago. We conclude that the payments required are larger than \nnecessary to sustain the viability of the retiree health benefits plan, \nso we mandate an updated amortization schedule to fund postal retirees' \nhealth care in the future. It is not just an arbitrary number. We think \nthat means the Postal Service is likely to see a significant cut in its \nannual $5 billion bill to prefund retiree health care, which, of \ncourse, would take further stress off the Postal Service's annual \noperating budget. We expect, as the debate goes on, to have as close as \npossible an exact projection of how much that change would save for the \nPostal Service itself.\n  Now let me talk about some of the proposals that the Postal Service \nand Postmaster have made that have been most controversial.\n  First, Saturday deliveries and canceling most Saturday deliveries. \nThe Postal Service has said it can save $3.1 billion a year by \ncancelling Saturday deliveries to individual homes and businesses. It \nis not something you want to do, but if you are looking to get this \ninstitution back into balance and keep it alive, it is one of the \nthings we are probably going to have to do. The Postal Rate Commission \nagrees that ending most Saturday deliveries will save a lot of money, \nbut says their savings estimate is $1.7 billion a year versus the $3.1 \nbillion figure from the Postal Service.\n  Either way, we are talking about a substantial reduction in costs, \nand one we may have to face. Our bill recognizes that ultimately it may \nwell be necessary to switch to 5-day delivery. I say it is going to be \nnecessary to switch to 5-day delivery. But we require the Postal \nService to follow a certain path over the next few years before that \nsignificant step--6 to 5 days--is carried out.\n  They first have to determine, according to the bill, if the other \ncost-saving measures in the bill have made canceling Saturday service \nunnecessary. We can hope that would happen, but I am skeptical that it \nwill.\n  If a 5-day schedule is deemed necessary, the Postal Service must then \nsubmit a plan to Congress, the GAO, and the Postal Rate Commission on \nhow it plans to cushion the negative effect on the businesses and \ncommunities it serves.\n  GAO and the PRC will then submit their own studies to Congress on \nthis matter. If the PRC and the Comptroller General conclude that the \nchange is necessary to allow the Postal Service to achieve long-term \nfinancial solvency, then 2 years from adoption the Postal Service will \nimplement a 5-day delivery schedule.\n  What about the closing of post offices, which has created a lot of \nconcern all across America in response particularly to the Postmaster \nannouncing a list of 3,700 post offices that are possible candidates \nfor closure? One of the things we found in response to this is exactly \nwhat I have found over the years in Connecticut. The local post office \nis not just a place where mail and packages pass through; it becomes a \nlocal institution of community significance. It is hard to convince \npeople they should be closed. People are attached to their local post \noffice, not just in small towns and rural areas--especially there--but \nin a lot of other places, including cities and neighborhoods in a State \nsuch as my own State of Connecticut.\n  The reality is we cannot afford to continue to have as many post \noffices as we do, operating in the way they do. So our bill would \nimprove the present law covering post office closures. It doesn't \nprohibit them, but it requires more public participation and due \nprocess, and it requires the Postal Service to issue comprehensive \nretail service standards to ensure that communities throughout the \ncountry have access to retail postal services if their current post \noffice needs to be closed--in other words, to look for ways to \nconsolidate retail postal services. Perhaps they can put the retail \npostal service in a State or local government office building or \nperhaps put it in a retail establishment or a Wal-Mart or whatever to \nmake sure that the services are maintained in a more cost-effective \nway, even if the local post office is not.\n  The bill also requires that the Postal Service take steps before \nclosing a post office that it does not now have to take, including \noffering a community these other options I have talked about, such as \nkeeping the post office open with more limited hours or permitting \nprivate contractors or rural carriers to provide the services the local \npost office is now providing.\n  Another one of the controversial proposals the Postmaster made is to \nclose 232 of its current 461 mail processing facilities--not the post \noffices, but the places the mail goes to be processed so it can get \nfrom where it is sent to where it needs to be delivered. The truth is \nthere is excess capacity in this system now, and the Postal Service has \nto eliminate some of that excess capacity.\n  However, the bipartisan substitute proposal basically requires that \ncare be taken so this is done in a way that does not compromise the \nservice standards necessary to maintain the current customer base. In \nother words, we have to reduce expenditures, but if we do it \nprecipitously, as some of our colleagues will propose amendments to do, \nthe net effect is that less people will use the post office, because \nthey will not get the needed service and, as a result, revenues will \ndrop, and probably even greater.\n  The substitute amendment, therefore, permits the Postal Service to \neliminate excess capacity in the mail processing system but again \nrequires the Postal Service to maintain a modified overnight delivery \nstandard--a bit reduced from what it is now, but still there, \nparticularly for the local delivery areas.\n  The maximum standard delivery time--and most people probably don't \nknow this--the Postal Service accepts a maximum delivery time of 3 days \nto deliver a letter mailed anywhere in the continental U.S.; it has to \nbe delivered anywhere else in the continental U.S. within 3 days. That \nwill remain unchanged. The Postal Service would be required to maintain \na sufficient number of processing facilities to meet these delivery \nstandards but could otherwise close unneeded facilities.\n\n  So far, I have talked about the cost side of the ledger. S. 1789, the \nsubstitute, also gives the Postal Service tools to bring in fresh \nrevenues by offering new products and services, specifically \nauthorizing contracting with State and local governments to issue State \nlicenses, authorizing for the first time the Postal Service to do what \nsome of the private shippers do--shipping beer, wine, and distilled \nspirits, and provide notary services or provide specialized Internet \nservices.\n  Our bill would also create an advisory commission of prominent \ncitizens and charge them, within a set period of time, to reconsider \nthe Postal Service's current business model and provide it with a \nstrategic blueprint for the future that will enable it to both continue \nto exist and provide the services people want, but to do so in a way \nthat balances its budget.\n  Finally, it creates a chief innovation officer at the Postal Service \nwhose job is to continue to find ways to innovate and build on not only \nthe constitutional responsibility to maintain the Postal Service and \npost offices but to do so in a way that is innovative and builds on the \nirreplaceable assets the Postal Service has, particularly the capacity \nto deliver to the last mile anywhere in this country.\n  These reforms are necessary. They will make the post office smaller \nand more cost efficient. As a result of this bill, there will be fewer \nemployees at the post office and fewer facilities. You have no choice \nbut to bring that about.\n  But this bill will keep the Postal Service alive. I think it will \nkeep it well and it will put it on a path to surviving forever but in a \ndifferent way, because the environment in which it is operating, \nbecause of the Internet, simply has changed. Despite its shrinking \nstream of posts and parcels, here is the reality we are dealing with \nand what would be affected if the Postal Service is to begin cutting \nback its operation.\n  The Postal Service still delivers 563 million pieces of mail every \nday. Only the Postal Service, for the price of a\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\nstamp, will go literally that last mile to ensure delivery to every \nbusiness and residence in America, using burros in the Grand Canyon and \nsnowshoes in Alaska, doing whatever is necessary to make that happen.\n  What Federal agency, if I can go to another service the Postal \nService gives, could process--think of the unthinkable--6.7 million \npassport applications a year if the Postal Service weren't there.\n  These are some examples and suggestions of the fact of what is \npossible but also proving that the Postal Service is not just a relic \nof the 18th century; it is a pivotal part of the 21st century.\n  The computer age poses unique challenges to the Postal Service, and \nthe day may come when we will send and receive mail, get most of our \nmagazines and books, and pay our bills on electronic devices that are \nreliable and secure. But honestly the day will never come when we can \nsend physical things across the Internet between homes and businesses--\nsuch as medicine, clothing, household and business supplies, and even \nspare parts for those computers we use so much.\n  The Postal Service is unique, and its network of support facilities \nand dedicated employees stands ready to deliver to every home, store, \nbusiness, and factory in America. That is why we have to act to make \nsure it continues to be able to do that.\n  Let me go back to the first Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin, \nwho always had a lot of good things to say that even seem relevant \ncenturies after. Franklin said, ``By failing to prepare, you are \npreparing to fail.'' This bill offers preparations to succeed, to make \nsure the Postal Service never fails.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Today, the Senate begins debate on reform legislation to \nsave an American institution--the U.S. Postal Service. Our Founding \nFathers recognized the importance of having a postal service. Article \nI, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to establish \npost offices. The Postal Service is also required by law to provide the \nentire population of the United States with adequate and efficient \npostal services at a fair and reasonable rate. This is called the \nuniversal mandate, and it ensures that the Postal Service cannot leave \nbehind rural States and small towns.\n  The Postal Service, which has delivered news to generation after \ngeneration of Americans, is at great risk of not being able to make its \npayroll by this fall, according to the Postmaster General himself. My \npoint is that this crisis is very real. The Postal Service is in debt \nto the U.S. Treasury by $13 billion. By the end of the year, it is \nlikely to reach its statutory debt limit of $15 billion. Driving this \ncrisis are many factors, not the least of which is that the volume of \nits first-class mail has fallen by 26 percent since 2006 and continues \nto decline as this chart shows. Reflecting that sharp drop in volume, \nrevenue has plummeted from $72.8 billion in 2006 to $65.7 billion in \n2011.\n  The Postal Service is part of our culture and economic fabric. Its \nfailure would deliver a crushing blow to our economy at a time when the \neconomy is already fragile, and it would be particularly harmful to \npeople living and working in rural America. That means we must pass a \nbill. Doing nothing is only an option if we are willing to let the \nPostal Service fail. That is the choice we face. Failure would imperil \na vital component of our economy, for the Postal Service is the \nlinchpin of a $1 trillion mailing and mail-related industry that \nemploys nearly 8.7 million Americans in fields as diverse as direct \nmail, printing, catalog companies, magazine and newspaper publishers, \nand paper manufacturing, to name just a few. In my State, nearly 38,000 \nMainers work in jobs related to the mailing industry, including \nthousands at our pulp and paper mills, such as the one in Bucksport, \nME, which manufactures the paper for Time magazine.\n  The rapid transition from traditional mail to electronic \ncommunication has come at an enormous cost to the Postal Service. The \nloss of so much mail, coupled with unsustainably high labor costs and \nexacerbated by the worst recession in decades, has left the Postal \nService on the brink of collapse. Despite these headwinds, the \nPostmaster General is inexplicably forging ahead with plans to abandon \ncurrent mail service standards in favor of reduced access, slower \ndelivery times, and higher prices. His plans, I fear, will force many \nof the Postal Service's best customers to pursue delivery alternatives. \nI cannot think of another major business in serious financial trouble \nthat would risk alienating its remaining customers by slashing service \nand raising prices. That is a recipe for disaster.\n  We recently learned the Postal Service's own preliminary analysis--\nsubmitted secretly to its regulators--reveals that the destructive \nservice reduction plan to slow mail delivery and shut down postal \nplants will lead to a more than 9-percent decrease in first-class mail \nand a 7.7-percent reduction in all mail. The Postal Service itself made \na preliminary estimate that the first year losses alone would be $5.2 \nbillion. That would consume a major portion of any supposed savings \nintended by the Postal Service's plan.\n  Of course, now that these numbers have become public, the Postal \nService is backpedaling rapidly and criticizing its own estimates, \nclaiming the survey questions gave the respondents--postal customers--\ntoo much information about the drastic nature of the proposed service \nreductions before asking if these mailers would likely pull out of the \nsystem in response to these changes. If the Postal Service is aware of \na legitimate methodological flaw in the study, then I would urge a \npublic release of the study and an explanation for why it was submitted \nto the regulators if, in fact, it is so flawed.\n  The findings of the survey do not surprise me. They are consistent \nwith what I am hearing from major postal customers. Mailers are all too \naware of the destructive course postal leaders are pursuing. Once \ncustomers turn to communication options other than the mail system, \nthey will not be coming back, and the Postal Service will be sucked \nfurther and further into a death spiral. Companies large and small that \nrely on the mail tell me if service continues to deteriorate, they will \nconduct more business online and encourage their customers to switch to \nonline services for bill paying and other transactions.\n  Let me give an example from Bangor, ME, which illustrates this \neconomic reality. A small business owner from the hometown in which I \nam living now sent me an e-mail he received from the company that \nprocesses his payroll. In the e-mail, the payroll company reminds the \nsmall business owner that the Postal Service intends to close a nearby \nprocessing center in Hampden, ME. The payroll firm recommends the best \noption for the small business would be to move to an electronic option \noutside the mail system. It also offered another option of using \nnonmail delivery or pickup services.\n  My point is this example reflects the realities of commerce. Degrade \nservice or raise prices and we don't get more revenue, we get fewer \ncustomers and less revenue.\n  One bright light for me, with respect to the bill we are considering, \nis that we first should do no harm in the form of hastening the volume \ndecline through ill-conceived policy changes. That is why the \ndownsizing of the labor force and excess capacity the Postmaster \nGeneral has stated are critical to saving the Postal Service must be \ncarried out in a way that preserves service and does not inflict \navoidable harm on dedicated postal workers.\n  There are naturally strong opinions on what should be done to save \nthe Postal Service, and the bill and the substitute we are bringing to \nthe floor is the product of careful consideration of those competing \npositions and priorities. As with any bipartisan compromise, this is \nnot the bill each of us alone would have crafted, but we came together \nbecause our goal of saving the Postal Service is so important. Senator \nLieberman, Senator Scott Brown, Senator Carper, and I consulted \nextensively with postal customers, both business and residential, with \npostal workers, with the Postmaster General, the GAO, the \nadministration, and local communities deeply committed to preserving \ntheir postal facilities. We have\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\ndeliberated together literally day after day, meeting after meeting on \nthese complex issues. The product of these deliberations--the 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act--provides the right tools to the Postal \nService, with the right checks and balances, to set it back on course.\n\n  First, let me give our colleagues some background. The first thing we \ndid was analyze the Postal Service's costs. The fact is labor-related \nexpenses are responsible for 80 percent of the Postal Service's costs. \nIt is always painful to recognize that workforce costs are simply too \nhigh, especially when the employees are as dedicated as those working \nat the Postal Service. Avoiding reductions in these expenses is simply \nnot an option as we hope to save as many jobs as possible, both within \nthe Postal Service and within the broader mailing community. But we can \ndo so in a compassionate, fair way.\n  Our bill would transfer to the Postal Service the nearly $11 billion \nit has overpaid into the Federal Employees Retirement System. We would \ndirect the Postmaster General to use a portion of this money for \nretirement and separation incentives in order to reduce the size of the \nworkforce compassionately. Let me emphasize--because there are \nmisunderstandings on this point--the refund from FERS--the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System--is not taxpayer money. It was contributed \nby the Postal Service using ratepayer dollars. It is an overpayment \nthat was identified and confirmed by the actuaries at OPM and verified \nby the GAO.\n  In fact, GAO recently confirmed OPM's assessment that this figure now \nhas risen to nearly $11 billion. We would encourage early separation \nand retirement incentives, capped at the current Federal limit of \n$25,000, combined with retirement incentives, such as giving an extra \nyear of service credit if the postal worker is in the CSRS system--the \nold Civil Service Retirement System--or 2 years if the worker is in the \nFERS system. That would allow the Postmaster General, by his estimate, \nto compassionately reduce the workforce by about 100,000 people, a goal \nhe has said in the past was necessary to achieve solvency.\n  Let me give our colleagues another important fact. More than one-\nthird of all postal workers are already eligible for retirement, so \nthese incentives should be effective and, as the chairman indicated, \nwould save an estimated $8 billion a year.\n  The bipartisan legislation also includes a new requirement that \narbitrators rendering binding decisions in labor disputes consider the \nfinancial condition of the Postal Service. I know it may defy belief \nthat an arbitrator would not automatically consider the looming \nbankruptcy of the Postal Service when ruling on contract disputes, but \nsome previous arbitrators have disregarded this factor in their \ndecisions because the requirement to consider it was not explicitly \nlisted in law. We would remedy this problem.\n  For the first time in 35 years, the bill also brings sorely needed \ncommonsense reforms to the Federal workers' compensation program--not \nonly at the Postal Service but across the Federal Government. But why \nis this particularly important to the Postal Service? Forty percent of \nworkers who are on the long-term rolls for Federal workers' comp are \npostal workers. The Postal Service contributes about $1 billion a year \nin Federal comp costs.\n  This program, intended as assistance for injured workers to help them \nrecover and return to work, currently has more than 10,000 postal and \nFederal employees age 70 or older, 2,000 of whom are postal employees. \nThey receive a higher payment on workers' comp than they would under \nthe standard retirement program, even though it is obvious at that age \nthey would not be returning to work. In fact, 430 of these workers, \nFederal and postal, are over 90 years of age and 6 workers are 100 \nyears old or older. These employees clearly are never going to return \nto work, and they should be switched to the normal retirement system.\n  It is unfair to employees who are working to the normal retirement \nage. It does not serve injured workers well. It also imposes an \nenormous financial burden on the Postal Service.\n  Our bill, I would note, in its workers' comp reforms, is very similar \nto the reforms proposed by the Obama administration. It would make \nbenefit levels more comparable to what the majority of States are \noffering their workers. Let me describe just a few more of these \nissues.\n  First, for people past retirement age the median annual workers' \ncompensation benefit is 26 percent higher than the median benefit \nreceived by Federal and postal workers who retire under the regular \nretirement system. Thirty-nine of the 50 States pay their workers' comp \nrecipients two-thirds or less of their salary. Yet most Federal \nbeneficiaries receive 75 percent of their salary, and that is tax free.\n  The program has also been shown to be highly vulnerable to fraud and \nabuse. That is not good for workers who are truly injured and need the \nhelp of this program. Let me mention two flaws. The program relies \nheavily on self-reported data, and it does not now require the use of \nindependent physicians to assess the initial or continued eligibility \nof claimants. These vulnerabilities are not hypothetical, but they \nsurely are costly.\n  The IG of the Department of Labor reports that the removal of a \nsingle fraudulent claim saves on average $300,000 to $500,000. When the \nIG reviewed over 10,000 claimant files a decade ago, there were \nirregularities in almost 75 percent of the cases. That resulted in \nbenefits being reduced or ended for more than 500 claimants, saving \nalmost $5 million a year in benefits that otherwise would be paid.\n  I note that the Obama administration has proposed many similar \nchanges and also has recommended that they apply across the board so we \ndo not have two different systems. We agree.\n  I want to move to another issue about which there has been a lot of \ndiscussion. The Postal Service blames some of its financial woes on a \n2006 requirement to prefund its retiree health plan--a requirement the \nPostal Service endorsed at the time, I might add. The Postal Service \ncurrently owes $46.2 billion to cover the costs of the promises it has \nmade to provide health care to future retirees. That unfunded liability \nis not going away. Nevertheless, the payments for retirement health \nbenefits could be eased by coming up with a new amortization schedule \nthat stretches out the payments. That is what we have done.\n  We have established a 40-year amortization schedule for the unfunded \nliability, and we would also reduce the requirement that the fund reach \n100 percent of the liability. We have changed that to 80 percent, which \nis more consistent with what is done by the private sector.\n  I note this would reduce the annual payment by approximately $2 to $3 \nbillion while still keeping promises to workers and avoiding a taxpayer \nbailout. Our bill gives authority to the Postal Service to save money \nthrough greater efficiency in its operations. We do so in a way that \nensures that rural America will not be left behind. As the Presiding \nOfficer is well aware, across America communities are up in arms over \nthe Postal Service's plans to close about 3,200 post offices. It has \nbecome clear to me, in looking at the specifics, that common sense \noften is not applied in these decisions.\n  We do not mandate that every single post office remains open nor do \nwe dictate that an arbitrary number should close. Instead, our bill \nrequires the Postal Service to work with the Postal Regulatory \nCommission to establish for the first time clear standards for what \nconstitutes reasonable access to postal services for communities and \nfor customers. These would be developed by considering important \nfactors, including distance, travel time, access to transportation, \nweather, and geography.\n  That means if the Postal Service tries to close a post office and \nthat closure would result in this new service standard being violated, \nthe community, under our bill, could appeal the closure to the \nCommission. If the Commission agrees, its binding decision would \nrequire the service to be preserved.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator Tester, and Senator Moran from Kansas \nhave worked very hard on the language in this provision. I thank them \nfor that. What is more, the bill requires the Postmaster General to \nwork with communities to offer cost-saving alternatives to full-time, \nfull-service post\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\noffices in lieu of totally shuttering a beloved post office in the \nheart of town.\n  There are so many options the Postal Service could use. For example, \nmoving the post office into a retail store, providing hours part time--\nsay at 7 to 9 in the morning, when people are going to work, or 5 to 7 \nin the evening when they are coming home. We need to be creative. In \nrecent months we have seen the Postal Service announce a number of \nDraconian measures, including the closing of hundreds of processing \nplants and implementing disastrous service standards changes, including \na proposal to do away with overnight delivery, one of the real \nadvantages the Postal Service has.\n  Our bill takes a better approach that helps the Postal Service \nrightsize its excess capacity while still maintaining what is one of \nits most valuable assets: its ability to deliver mail overnight to many \nareas.\n  Let me give another example. The Postal Service has proposed closing \none of two processing plants in the State of Maine, the one that is \nlocated in Hampden, ME, in the central eastern part of our State. That \nmeans for northern Maine communities that are sending mail between \nthose communities, the letter would have to take a roundtrip of more \nthan 600 miles to be processed and returned. That makes no sense at \nall. It clearly will lead to a marked slowness in delivery, a \ndeterioration in service, and, I would argue, probably to more costs. \nThat plant could be downsized, but it should never be closed.\n\n  There are so many options that need to be pursued by the Postal \nService in order to prevent service from deteriorating and delivery \ntimes from lengthening because, once again, that will drive more mail \nout of the system, and that is the last thing the Postal Service needs.\n  I would say that many postal employees have pointed out to me, as has \nthe inspector general, that there are excessive bureaucratic costs at \nthe Postal Service. For example, the Postal Service--even though it is \ninsisting on closing all these facilities--already has over 67 million \nsquare feet of excess property that it has yet to dispose of. The bill \nrequires the Postal Service to devise a plan to close and consolidate \nthese administrative offices around the country and to start \nimplementing that plan within the year.\n  We have also encouraged collocation of postal facilities with other \nFederal agencies, an idea that Senator Carper had to minimize excess \ncapacity. We also authorized the Postal Service to convert delivery \nfrom front door to the curb where it is practical and cost effective. \nThe Postal Service inspector general has estimated this could save as \nmuch as $4.5 billion a year.\n  Another controversial issue that we tackle in this bill is the \nPostmaster General's proposal to eliminate Saturday delivery. I have \nsaid repeatedly that I believe abandoning Saturday delivery will once \nagain drive mail out of the system and do more harm than good. Our \ncompromise prohibits eliminating Saturday delivery for at least 2 years \nso that cost-cutting reforms can be implemented. If at that point to \nachieve solvency the Postal Service needs to go to 5-day delivery, it \ncan do so if it proves it has done everything else to cut its excessive \ncosts. Again, reducing service should be the last resort, not the first \noption. Our hope is that the cost-cutting tools we provide the Postal \nService in this bill will allow this service reduction to be avoided.\n  There is much more in this bill which we will discuss as the debate \ngoes on. Today is just the first step in what I know is going to be a \nlong journey. But the point is we must pass a postal reform bill. The \nHouse also has a bill that awaits floor consideration, and more \ncompromises will have to be made along the way. But we cannot forget \nthe urgency of this task.\n  I ask my colleagues to work with us during the upcoming floor debate, \nand I urge their support for final passage. The fact is it is up to us \nto preserve this vital American institution, the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2354-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this time to inform my colleagues \nof a hearing that took place this morning before the Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, chaired by Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin has been a leader \nin this body on making sure we have a committee that focuses on the \nissues of human rights. Today's hearing on racial profiling, ending \nracial profiling in America, was the first hearing we have had in \nCongress on racial profiling since the attack on our country on \nSeptember 11. I congratulate Senator Durbin for holding this hearing. I \nthought the hearing was very informative as to a problem we have in \nAmerica on the use of racial profiling.\n  I know the Nation has been focused on the tragedy that took place in \nSanford, FL, in which 17-year-old Travon Martin was killed, a clearly \navoidable death, by Mr. Zimmerman. We first and foremost want to make \nsure justice prevails in this case. I know there is a case pending in \nFlorida. We are all going to be watching that very carefully. There is \na Federal investigation underway by the Department of Justice to look \ninto circumstances concerning Travon Martin's death, to see what role \nrace played in regard to that tragedy, not only as it related to Travon \nMartin's death but also as to the investigation that ensued.\n  A few weeks ago, I spoke about this issue at the Center for Urban \nFamilies in Baltimore. That is a group that is interested in urban \nfamily life. We came together shortly after Travon Martin's tragic \ndeath to talk about what had happened.\n  I was very much moved by so many people who came forward at that \nmeeting and explained how they had been victims of racial profiling. A \nyoung woman talked about the time she went to a basketball game with \nher father and her father was pulled over and stopped by police for no \napparent reason other than the color of his skin and how that impacted \nthis girl, seeing her father held, unable to go to the basketball game. \nThese types of victimization occur too frequently in our community, \nwhere people are picked out solely because of their race, their \nreligion, their ethnic background.\n  We have a problem in this country, and we need to do something about \nthat. The question that needs to be answered in regard to Travon Martin \nis was he initially pursued because of the color of his skin. Would Mr. \nZimmerman have done the same if it was a White child rather than an \nAfrican American?\n  In October of 2011, I introduced S. 1670, the End Racial Profiling \nAct. I am proud to have many colleagues as cosponsors, including \nSenator Blumenthal, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator John Kerry, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Levin, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Mikulski, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Stabenow, and \nSenator Mark Udall. I thank my cosponsors for joining me in this \nlegislation.\n\n  This legislation would make it clear that racial profiling will not \nbe allowed in this country. Racial profiling is un-American. It is \nagainst the values of our Nation. It is contrary to the 14th amendment \nof the Constitution, which\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nprovides for equal protection under the law. It is counterproductive, \nand it doesn't keep us safe. We are using valuable police resources in \na way that is wasting those resources. It is sloppy police work if you \ntry to identify a problem by race rather than looking for good police \nwork to identify the real perpetrator of a crime. It also creates a \nmistrust in the community they are trying to protect, a community that \nthey need to help and to cooperate with as far as keeping the community \nsafe. For all of those reasons, racial profiling should have no place \nin modern law enforcement. We need a national law.\n  I was impressed that in the hearing today there was general consensus \nthat we have a problem in this country, that there is a problem of law \nenforcement using racial profiling, which should not be done. The bill, \nS. 1670, would prohibit the use of racial profiling. By making a \ndecision based upon race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion, \nbasically what you are doing is subjecting an individual to a \nspontaneous investigation. That should have no place. What we are \ntalking about is someone being stopped for a routine traffic stop, \nsubjected to a search, interrogated, or investigated based on that \nperson's race or the scope and substance of law enforcement activities \nfollowing an initial investigative proceeding are determined because of \nrace. That should have no place in America.\n  My legislation would apply to all levels of government, not just \nFederal but State and local law enforcement. It requires mandatory \ntraining. And here is an issue on which I think we should all agree. \nPerhaps the tragedy that happened with Trayvon Martin would not have \nhappened if Mr. Zimmerman had been trained on the issues of what is \ngood police work and what is not good police work and how racial \nprofiling needs to be eliminated. We feel very strongly about the need \nfor mandatory training.\n  The legislation requires data collection by local and State law \nenforcement. State and local law enforcement must maintain adequate \npolicies and procedures designated to eliminate profiling, and they \nmust eliminate any existing practices that present or encourage racial \nprofiling.\n  The Department of Justice has granted authority to make grants to \npromote best practices, so one jurisdiction can learn from another as \nto what the best practices are in order to make sure that this practice \nis not being used and that we are doing everything possible to keep \ncommunities safe by good police work, not by sloppy police work.\n  I wish to point out that the overwhelming majority of people who are \nin law enforcement do it the right way. We have dedicated men and women \nwho work every day to keep us safe--our first responders. We owe them a \ndebt of gratitude, we owe them our support, and we cannot say enough \ncomplimentary things about what they do every day by putting their \nlives on the line to keep us safe. So for the sake of what is right for \nAmerica and for the sake of the overwhelming majority of the people who \nare professionals in law enforcement, we need to make it clear that \nracial profiling has no role in American law enforcement.\n  I am proud of the many groups that are supporting this legislation, \nincluding the NAACP, the ACLU, the Leadership Conference of Civil and \nHuman Rights, and numerous other organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks the list of organizations that are \nsupporting the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me conclude by quoting our former colleague Senator \nKennedy, who said that civil rights is the great unfinished business of \nAmerica. Let's continue to fight to make sure we have equal justice \nunder the law for all Americans. That is what the legislation I have \nintroduced will do. The End Racial Profiling Act will continue us on \nthat journey to provide equal justice in the law to all Americans.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Group Endorsements of End Racial Profiling Act\n\n\n                         National Organizations\n\n       A.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue we are debating right now is an \nissue of enormous consequence for the American people, for our economy, \nfor rural America, and for the hundreds of thousands of workers in the \nU.S. Postal Service. I thank Senators Lieberman, Carper, Collins, and \nBrown for the important work they have done in moving this legislation \nforward.\n  Let me begin by saying the debate we are having is not whether the \nPostal Service in the digital age should change. Everybody agrees the \nPostal Service should change. The question is what kind of change do we \nwant, what kind of change is good for the American economy, and what \nkind of change is good for our country.\n  Last year--I think about 9 or 10 months ago--the Postmaster General \ngave us his view of change. There was concern about some of the \nfinancial problems facing the Post Office. He came up with a proposal \nthat would do the following: What he said is we should close more than \n3,600 mostly rural post offices. In my State, I think the number of \nrural post offices is about 15. All over this country post offices, in \nso many ways, serve a function beyond delivering mail or selling \nstamps. In many ways, post offices become the center of a small town. \nThe Postmaster General's proposal was to shut down more than 3,600 \nmostly rural post offices.\n  Furthermore, he wanted to shut down about half of the mail processing \nfacilities in America--somewhere around 250 of them--and when we do \nthat, by definition we slow overnight delivery standards for first \nclass mail. So at a moment when the Postal Service is being challenged \nby e-mail in the digital age--instantaneous communication--he was \nproposing to slow down mail delivery.\n  He also proposed to end Saturday mail service and reduce the postal \nworkforce in the midst of a horrendous recession by some 220,000 \nworkers, going from 550,000 down to about 330,000.\n  I find it a bit ironic that a couple of months ago we had a great \ndebate here--and I think bipartisan support--to make sure veterans get \nthe jobs they need. Many of the people who work in the Postal Service \nare, in fact, veterans. They are doing a good job. When we downsize the \nPostal Service, as the Postmaster General proposed, by 220,000 workers, \nwe are downsizing many of our veterans.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate and the House and I are strongly \nopposed to what the Postmaster General brought forth and we have been \nworking with him and his staff to improve this plan. Frankly, I think \nwe are making some progress. Obviously, the key danger of what the \nPostmaster General has proposed is that if we slow down mail delivery \nstandards, what ends up happening is that individuals and businesses \nwill be rethinking whether they want to use the Postal Service and \nwhether they want to go elsewhere. So what we could very well begin is \nwhat we call a death spiral: slow down mail delivery service, \nbusinesses stop using the Postal Service, less revenue comes in, more \ncuts are made, more delays, more slowdowns. We think that is a bad \nidea.\n  Again, I believe, and I think everybody in this Senate believes, we \nneed a new business model for the Postal Service in the digital age. \nSome of us believe we can bring forth a new business model which does \nnot necessitate hundreds of thousands of job losses and cuts, cuts, and \ncuts.\n  Among other things, I wish to point out that a recently disclosed \nstudy by Opinion Research Corporation, commissioned by the Postal \nService itself, found the Postal Service would lose nearly $2 billion \nby eliminating overnight delivery standards. Let me repeat: A study \ncommissioned by the Postal Service found that ending overnight delivery \nstandards and shutting down half of the mail processing plants in \nAmerica would cost the Postal Service nearly $2 billion. The answer is \na lot to do with what I said: If we slow down service, fewer and fewer \npeople are going to be using the Postal Service.\n  For the last several months I have been working with several dozen of \nmy colleagues in the Senate to oppose those cuts. I thank Senator \nLieberman and Senator Carper for their support, as well as Senator \nCollins and Senator Brown. We have been working with them, and what we \nbasically did is come up with a good bill that is much better than the \nPostmaster General had originally proposed, and we think we can do \nbetter. In fact, we have been working, and I think it is fair to say we \nhave made some significant improvements which have been incorporated in \nthe substitute amendment that is before us. Let me begin by touching on \nsome of the improvements that I think we have brought about.\n  The managers' amendment brings more protection for rural post \noffices. I come from a rural State. I know how important rural post \noffices are, and the managers' amendment provides more protection for \nthese rural post offices.\n  No. 1: The substitute amendment would prevent the Postal Service from \nclosing any post offices until it has established a set of service \nstandards that would guarantee all postal customers regular and \neffective access to retail postal services nationwide on a reasonable \nbasis. The Postal Service is required to establish the standards within \n6 months. The service standards would be required to take into account \ncertain factors. In other words, what we are talking about here is that \nbefore a rural post office can be shut down, certain standards are \ngoing to have to be addressed. They are:\n  A, a consideration of the reasonable maximum time a postal customer \nshould expect to travel to access a postal retail location. In other \nwords, if we shut down a post office and somebody has to go 20 miles \nand spend money on gasoline, and an enormous amount of time, it doesn't \nmake sense to shut down that rural post office;\n  B, furthermore, we want to look at the age and disability status of \nindividuals in the area. If there are elderly people, if there are a \nlarge number of disabled people and we shut down that postal service, \nthose folks are going to be, for all intents and purposes, isolated. \nDon't shut down that postal service;\n  C, there would be a requirement that the Postal Service serve remote \nareas and communities which have transportation challenges. If I live \nin a community and I don't have a car, how do I get to a post office \nthat is 5 miles away?\n  D, the effects of inclement weather or other natural conditions that \nmight impede access to postal services. In other words, if people live \nin a climate where they have a whole lot of snow, how are they going to \nget to another post office?\n\n  I see the majority leader standing. Does the leader wish to address \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I have some procedural matters to do, if the Senator from \nVermont wishes to finish his statement.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will be another 5 or 10 minutes. I will yield to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I finish \nmy procedural matters, the Senator from Vermont be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be \nyielded back and the motion to proceed to S. 1789 be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I now ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in \norder to S. 1789 or the Lieberman-Collins substitute amendment No. 2000 \nbe those that are relevant to the bill or the substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Egypt \ncurrently gets $2 billion from our country from the U.S. taxpayer. My \nquestion is, should we be sending $2 billion a year to Egypt when they \nseek to continue to prosecute American citizens.\n  Recently, President Obama's administration freed up that money and \nsaid Egypt is pursuing democratic aims, so\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nwe freed up the $2 billion. How did Egypt respond to this? Egypt \nbasically thumbed their nose at us. Egypt said we are now issuing \ninternational warrants to get American citizens, extradite them, take \nthem back to Egypt for a political show trial. So we give money to a \ncountry that insults us.\n  I think this should end. I think this deserves 15 minutes of Senate \ntime to discuss whether America has money to be sending to Egypt when \nwe have 12 million people unemployed in this country, and whether we \nhave needs here at home that need to be met before we send $2 billion \nto Egypt which turns around and insults us by prosecuting American \ncitizens.\n  I respectfully object and seek a vote on this amendment that would \nend their aid if they do not end the prosecution of American citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we speak, there are 8 million Americans \nwho are dependent on the Post Office. These are people who have jobs as \na result of the Postal Service. We need to do a postal reform bill. \nDoing nothing is not an option.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set up a procedure to allow the \nSenate to consider amendments relevant to the postal reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to object, the Post Office is losing $4 \nbillion a year, and I sympathize. But at the same time we are losing $4 \nbillion, we are sending $2 billion to Egypt. We have problems in our \ncountry and we don't have the money to send to Egypt, so I would say it \nis relevant. It is relevant whether, when we have limited resources, we \nsend $2 billion to Egypt, or whether we try to fix the problems we have \nat home. I would say bring some of that money home and that might help \nus fix the Post Office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. PAUL. I continue my objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2357-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2357-S2370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    21ST CENTURY POSTAL SERVICE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Contracting Provisions..................................701''.....\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, relevance is a fair standard. A lot of \namendments can be offered. Very few couldn't be offered unless it were \nsomething dealing with foreign policy on the Postal Service bill. A lot \nof people want to offer amendments dealing with situations all over the \nworld. That is why we struggled, for example, to get the Iran sanctions \nbill moving. A standard of relevance merely asks that we stay on the \nsubject--a subject this morning to which 74 Senators agreed to proceed \nto.\n\n  I regret my friend has objected to this request. But I hope my friend \nfrom Kentucky will go home and explain to the people who are dependent \non those small post offices around the State of Kentucky and those \nprocessing centers that this bill has not been resolved because of him.\n  If we do nothing, there will be the wide-range closing of post \noffices. We have more than 30,000 post offices in America. Many of them \nwill be closed. We have hundreds and hundreds of processing centers. \nThey will be closed. The Postal Service, as we have known it, is a \nfleeting moment in the eyes of Americans when they cannot get their \nmedicine they want, they cannot get the mail they want. The volume is \ndown a lot. But that is what this bill is about: to address some of the \nproblems we have with what we need to have happen as a new Postal \nService.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Lieberman, has worked \nextremely hard. Senator Collins has spent lots and lots of time on this \nissue. Of course, Tom Carper, who has a tremendous interest in this, \nhas been working on this issue for a long time.\n  It is a shame we have had this objection. It leaves me with \nabsolutely no alternative but to fill the amendment tree and make sure \nwe stick on the subject of postal reform. I remain hopeful we will be \nable to work together to get an agreement for consideration of \namendments related to this most important task: saving the Postal \nService.\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\n           Committee-Reported Substitute Amendment Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I have been authorized by the chairman of the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to withdraw the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, I have another matter of business, but I \nwish to say to all Senators here, not just the Senator from Kentucky \nwho objected to a reasonable manner to proceed on this measure--all \nStates are going to be dramatically impacted by virtue of his \nobjection. Post offices in Nevada will be closed and in Minnesota, \nMassachusetts, Tennessee, unnecessarily.\n  We need to be able to work through this. I do not know how anyone \ncould object to a standard as we have had, as I have proposed: relevant \namendments. It is too bad. Eight million people depend on the Postal \nService. That is 8 million people who work as a result of the Postal \nService. Mr. President, 500,000 people work for the Postal Service \ndirectly. So we have an obligation to do something about this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n  Even though my friend, who is one of the leaders of the tea party \nmovement around the country, has thrown a monkey wrench into what we \nare doing on a postal bill--moving to some foreign relations matter--it \nis too bad.

Mr. President, what we have just witnessed is an example \nof why the Senate is too often tied into knots. We have a bill that is \ncritical to every one of our States that is pending, the postal reform \nbill. The leader tried to move this bill forward by saying: Let's stick \nto amendments relevant to the bill, which is a pretty broad standard, a \nlot broader than a germaneness standard. Then there is an objection to \nthat because there is another matter which the Senator from Kentucky \nrightfully has an interest in. We all have an interest in various \nmatters around here, many of which are $2 billion or more in terms of \ncost. But that amendment by the Senator from Kentucky is not relevant \nto this bill, and unless, he says, he gets his way and has a 15-minute \ndebate on a $2 billion subject, he is going to object to us addressing \na subject which involves every one of our States.\n  This is why we have so many difficulties, at times at least, moving \nforward in the Senate. Because any one of us at any time can object to \nmoving legislation that is relevant and amendments that are relevant in \norder to get his or her way on a totally unrelated amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, since I have been referred to, may I \ninterject with a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I asked to be yielded 2 minutes. That would be up to the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. PAUL. Could I interject with a----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I just wish to simply say that then what happens is that \nthen the majority leader is forced to fill the tree. That creates \nproblems on the other side because the tree is filled. But that is in \nresponse to an unwillingness on the part of the Senator to let us \nproceed on a bill which is important to every one of us with relevant \namendments. So we have a response from that Senator to the \ndetermination of the majority leader to move forward with a bill that \naffects all of us. Objecting to a UC, the majority leader is forced to \nfill the tree, and we are off and running.\n  So for 2 days around here--for 2 days around here now--we are going \nto go through the same thing we go through almost every single week. We \nwill have amendments which will be sought to be offered. We have to set \naside amendments. We get to a cloture vote. We end up with a far more \nrestrictive standard than if we were allowed to proceed with relevant \namendments. We end up with a germaneness standard, a lot narrower than \nthe relevance standard which was proposed by the majority leader.\n  This was a self-defeating action, I believe, in objecting to a \nunanimous consent proposal which would allow us to proceed with \nrelevant amendments. It does not accomplish the aim of the Senator from \nKentucky because we are not going to get to that subject, and all it \ndoes is restrict the rest of us who are trying to offer relevant \namendments in the next few days. It is a real example of what the \nproblem is around this Senate.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question? Since I am being \ncharacterized, I would think I would be allowed a response.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, regular order. Under the order that was \nentered, the Senator from Vermont is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has requested 2 or 3 minutes to make a \npoint, and I am happy to yield some of my time, after which I would get \nthe floor back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I object in order to ask a \nquestion as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That the Senator from Tennessee be recognized \nand then that the Senator----\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I wish to ask a question, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I apologize to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I do apologize to my friend from Tennessee.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  I want to just continue and talk about what the managers' amendment \ndoes. I went over a number of criteria by which it strengthens our \nability to protect rural post offices, and that is something I think \nmany of us from rural America want to see happen. We understand how \nimportant rural post offices are to the heart and soul of small \ncommunities.\n  The Lieberman-Collins bill took us a good way forward. This amendment \ngoes further.\n  I should say that while I think the managers' amendment is a step \nforward in almost every instance, I believe that through the amendment \nprocess we can strengthen the bill even further. I intend to be working \nwith many of my colleagues to do just that.\n  So we talked a little bit about strengthening the ability of rural \npost offices to continue to exist.\n  Second issue: The managers' amendment protects regional overnight \ndelivery standards. The managers' amendment requires that the Postal \nService retain a modified overnight delivery standard for 3 years, \nensuring that communities across the country continue to receive \novernight delivery of first-class mail--a very significant step forward \nfor small businesses and for people throughout our country.\n  A maximum delivery standard of 3 days would also be maintained for \nfirst-class mail sent anywhere in the continental United States. \nOriginally, the Postmaster General had suggested maybe we could \nlengthen the time from 3 days to 5 days. We keep it at 3 days.\n  The retention of--and this is important for every Member of the \nSenate concerned about the employment situation--the retention of a \nmodified overnight delivery standard would result in at least 100 mail \nprocessing facilities remaining open that are now scheduled to be \nclosed.\n  No. 3, the managers' amendment makes it harder to eliminate 6-day \ndelivery. The substitute amendment would prohibit the Postal Service \nfrom implementing any plan to eliminate Saturday delivery for at least \n2 years. After 2 years, Saturday delivery could only be eliminated if \nthe Postal Service has first attempted to increase revenue and cut \ncosts through other means and the GAO and the Postal Regulatory \nCommission conclude that eliminating Saturday delivery is necessary for \nthe long-term solvency of the Postal Service.\n  Fourth, and very important--something I and many other Members feel \nstrongly about--the Postal Service needs a new business model. Let me--\nand I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, has been \nvery interested in all these postal issues. Right now, if one walks \ninto a post office and they say to a postal clerk: Hi. I would like to \ngive you $2 to notarize this letter, the postal clerk would say: It is \nagainst the law for me to do that. I can't take your $2.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Postal Clerk, can you make 10 copies of this letter?\n  Nope; it is against the law for me to do that.\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\n  Rural Postal Clerk, I would like a fishing license or a hunting \nlicense. Can you help me with that?\n  I cannot do that. It is against the law.\n  I want to mail this box of wine and beer.\n  I cannot do that. It is against the law.\n  So what we want to do is take away many of the restrictions that have \nbeen imposed on the Postal Service by Congress and give them the \nflexibility to be more entrepreneurial to bring in more revenue. In \naddition to that, this managers' amendment creates a blue ribbon \nentrepreneurial commission. What that is about is that today we have, \nas the majority leader indicated, some 32,000 post offices in America. \nToday letter carriers are delivering mail to about 150 million doors in \nAmerica. That is a huge infrastructure.\n  If we have some pretty smart entrepreneurial types telling us what we \ncan do in addition to what we are doing now--what the letter carriers \ncan do, what the post offices could do, what the Postal Service can do \nin terms of new products and services--can we bring in more revenue? I \nthink we can. That is what the commission is going to be looking at.\n  Let me say a few words about the financial condition of the Postal \nService. No one debates first-class mail is down. A lot of people now \nuse e-mail and the Internet rather than first-class mail. There is no \ndebate about that. But what many people, including many Members of \nCongress, do not fully understand is the major crisis. The major \nfinancial crisis facing the Postal Service is the fact that they have \nan onerous burden of having to provide $5.5 billion every single year \nin future retiree health benefits--$5.5 billion every year--which was \nimposed upon them in 2006.\n  According to the inspector general of the Postal Service, the $44 \nbillion in that account right now is all that it needs because when \nthat $44 billion accrues interest over a 20-year or so period, it will \nhave enough money to pay out all of the future retiree health benefits \nthat it has to do. Furthermore, there is, in general, no disagreement \nthat the Postal Service has overpaid into the Federal Employees \nRetirement System by about $11 billion and to the Civil Service \nRetirement Service about $2 billion. In other words, the Postal Service \nis owed about $13 billion.\n  So to conclude, let me say this: The Postal Service performs an \nenormously important function for millions of individuals and for our \neconomy as a whole. As the majority leader indicated, there are some 8 \nmillion jobs in a variety of industries dependent upon a strong Postal \nService.\n  I believe if the Senate is prepared to be bold, to do the right \nthing, we can save jobs. We do not need to lay off or to downsize the \nPostal Service by over 200,000 workers. We do not need to shut down \nover 3,000 rural post offices. We do not need to shut down half of the \nprocessing plants in America and slow down mail delivery service \nleading to an eventual death cycle for the Postal Service.\n  So the task before us is a huge one. To tell you the truth--and I \nspeak as an Independent, the longest serving Independent in \ncongressional history--this is not a Democratic issue; this is not a \nRepublican issue. Republicans and Democrats have rural post offices. \nAll know how important they are. All want to save jobs in the middle of \na recession. All want the Postal Service to be strong.\n  So I would hope we can work together. We had a good vote a few hours \nago--74 votes. I would hope we could work together to save the Postal \nService, make it strong, and make sure it is there for our kids and our \ngrandchildren.\n  At this point, if the Senator from Tennessee would like some time, I \nam happy to yield to him 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Vermont. This is a body that \noperates by unanimous consent, which is a hard thing to get accustomed \nto until you have ever been a part of it. That means any one of us can \nstop the Senate from opening or having a prayer or saying the Pledge of \nAllegiance or going to a bill.\n  What I am about to say, I do not want in any way to diminish the \nrights of any Senator, such as the Senator from Kentucky, to have an \nopportunity to object to a unanimous consent request. But when everyone \nhas a lot of rights, unless we have some agreement, it is hard to get \nmuch done.\n  I have been sometimes critical of the majority leader, but I have \nalso tried to support and praise him for things he has done when I can \nbecause I know that either being the Democratic or the Republican \nleader is not an easy job. So I want to commend the majority leader for \noffering to accept all relevant amendments, which is a broad category, \nand this bill seems particularly appropriate for that because we have \ncompeting visions for what to do about the post office.\n  It has gone through committee, the regular order, and the bill is \nbipartisan. There are not a lot of partisan differences. There are a \nlot of differences, and they need to be worked out. We have probably 2 \nweeks to do it. So this is a ripe situation for that if we can get \nconsent to do it.\n  I am disappointed the majority leader felt he had to go on and offer \ncloture to move on because he already had control of the situation with \nthe right to fill the tree. So I would hope we could respect the right \nof the Senator from Kentucky and that of other Senators to offer \nunanimous consent--to object to unanimous consent agreements but see if \nwe cannot find some way to move ahead with an agreement on relevant \namendments.\n  That means the majority leader does not pick the amendments; we all \nget to offer them if they are relevant. The majority leader has a \ndifficult job. So I hope as he reflects on this matter he will consider \nthat it is much easier to get an agreement for relevant amendments in \nour caucus--I do not know what it is like in the Democratic caucus--if \nwe are able to talk it through a little bit and secure consent for that \nbefore it is offered.\n  That would be the job of Senator McConnell, the Republican leader. So \nhere we are. We were on the postal bill for 5 full minutes, and now we \nare off on a wrong track. We can move back very easily. The majority \nleader has the ability to control any amendment through his filling the \ntree and does not need the cloture amendment. Hopefully, the Senators \non this side will carefully consider the offer of all relevant \namendments. That would give us a chance to offer many amendments.\n  It is the right of any Senator to object. But as one Senator, I \nappreciate the gesture, and I hope the majority leader will give \nSenator McConnell an opportunity, if he wants it--I am just speaking \nfor myself--if he wants it, to work through our caucus and see if we \ncan get a relevant amendment agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I would yield to the \nSenator from Michigan for 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor his constructive comments. He and I have spoken about trying to \nwork on a relevant standard at the beginning of a bill as a way of \nmoving a bill forward with the greatest possible leniency, without \ngetting into totally nonrelevant subjects.\n  I thought his comments were constructive. I wanted to thank him for \nit. I hope we can continue to work together on this relevance course, \nwhich is perhaps the best way to get us out of the kind of knots that \nwe are frequently tied in. I want to thank my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I concur with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. Listen, we need to step back and move back a little \nbit. This is a bill of which I am a cosponsor. I work very hard. I note \nin the majority leader's comments he referenced Senators Carper, \nLieberman, and Collins. But I spent an equal amount of time working on \nthis bill and I am a cosponsor. I care very deeply about our postal \nworkers and the security and the viability of the post office itself.\n  I am hopeful also that the majority leader will step back because \nbefore we left we had 2 great weeks of working on relevant issues. We \nhad the insider trading bill, which passed 96 to 3. The leader allowed \nus to have a couple of days to get our Members in order, not 4 hours.\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n  We should have the ability, when we have amendments or issues that \ninvolve our Members--they should have the right to bring them forward \nin any form they want, and we should have the ability to get together \nwith them before we move on to another totally different, very \nimportant issue, such as the Violence Against Women Act, of which I am \nalso a cosponsor. So I do not care which one we go to.\n  But this one is relevant. It is time sensitive. It needs to be \naddressed right away. I have been honored to work with Senator Carper \nonce again and Senator Lieberman once again and Senator Collins once \nagain, working on something that can be very important and will be very \nimportant for our country.\n  We are here today because the post office is clearly at a crossroads. \nThey are in deep trouble. For more than two centuries it has played a \nkey role in both our economy and our communities, and for decades \ncommunities large and small and citizens far and wide have come to \ndepend on the regular and dependable mail service 6 days a week for a \nreasonable price.\n  It is plain and simple that in the past a steady volume of mail has \nprovided that adequate revenue. But things have changed. Yet in the \nface of the technological changes and difficult economic conditions, \nfirst-class mail volume, as we know, has dropped by over one-quarter in \nthe last 5 years. It is forecasted to do the same thing over the next 5 \nyears, and the business model that proved successful for generations is \nnow sinking the Postal Service in a pool of red ink.\n  As we all know, they have lost over $13 billion--billion dollars--in \nthe last 2 years. They are almost on the verge of bankruptcy. As we \nknow, the workforce is too big, costs are too high, and operations are \nbeing maintained that are unequal to the revenue that is actually \ncoming in. We need to stop that right away. The number of delivery \naddresses increases every day, and the Postal Service's liability to \nits employees grows each and every day. The longer we wait, the more \ndifficult it becomes. We are up against a deadline. We do need to work \ntogether in a bipartisan, bicameral manner.\n  This is not about Democrats and Republicans or Independents. It is \nabout us as a body showing once again--trying to reestablish that trust \nwith the American people--that, my goodness, the Senate can do things \ntogether, as we did with the crowdfunding jobs bill, as we did with the \nArlington Cemetery bill, as we have done with the 3-percent \nwithholding, and as we have done most recently with the insider \ntrading. We can do these things. This is a no-brainer.\n  Everybody here agrees we need to save the post office, and we all \nhave some very real concerns: rural concerns, city concerns, everybody \nhas concerns. We should have the ability to have these aired, and we \nneed to do it right now.\n  I would once again encourage the majority leader to step back from \nthe path he has chosen to move on to another bill because one Member \nhad a deep concern about what is happening in Egypt, as many of us do. \nWould it hurt to give him his 15 minutes and then move on? I just do \nnot get it. It is such a disservice to the American people.\n  We need to put the Postal Service on the path to solvency right \naway--right away. The bill that has been brought here has been worked \non between our four offices probably 300 or 400 hours easy. Throw in \nthe office hours for all our staff, it is probably upwards of 1,000 \nhours we have been working on this bill.\n  This is something I speak to our constituents of, working with \nCongressman Lynch in Massachusetts and others, to try to make sure we \ncan have a plan, a good base, a good starting point. We may not agree \non everything. But I will tell you, we all agree we need to save the \nU.S. Postal Service. We need to give them the tools and the resources \nto do their job and be viable and competitive into the new century. We \nall agree on that.\n  So we have a little hiccup, then we are going to move on to another \nbill. Once again, it is just as important, and I am happy to move on to \nit. I am a cosponsor. But come on. We deserve to give the American \npeople better. We should be doing better. We need to recognize and \naddress right away the serious financial condition of the post office \nand provide it with the flexibility to cut costs but do so in a way \nthat is responsible to its employees and considerate of the customers \nwho are continuing to use their service, to grant them the ability to \nfind ways to increase revenue and innovate without competing with \nprivate industry or giving them an unfair advantage over private \nindustry. That is a good thing.\n  We also want to make sure rates do not rise abruptly. That is also a \ngood thing. We need to ensure that the Postal Service maintains a \ncertain standard of service so it will have business and individuals \nwho want to continue to use that service.\n  It is a delicate balancing act, with little disagreement on that. \nThere is also little disagreement that the current size in both \nworkforce and postal operations is neither sustainable nor required for \nthe long term. We must reduce costs and we need to have greater \nefficiencies, and they must be found if the Postal Service is to \nsurvive and thrive in the future. The Postal Service still plays a \nsignificant role in our economy; we all know it. There is a standard \nthey have to hit, and we all demand it.\n  I fear that if we don't pass this bill, the Postal Service will \ncontinue to advocate for a more aggressive approach. We are up against \na deadline. If we fail to address this, the Postmaster General will \nhave the ability to do things that I think will not be in the best \ninterests of everybody in this Chamber and the American citizens. We \ncan provide different tools that he would be able to use, and we would \nbe able to have input on that.\n  In Massachusetts, the Postal Service has made plans to close four \nmain processing facilities and dozens of post offices. Yet there has \nbeen a lack of detailed explanation provided to government leaders--me \nand others--and employees or the surrounding communities to fully \njustify these changes as both necessary and prudent. We can do better \nand should do better.\n  Eliminating the overnight delivery standard or days of delivery will \nbe transformational shifts in service. We don't know whether those are \nappropriate. Little is known about the combined impact these major \nchanges will have on the postal customers or future revenues.\n  Mr. President, as we know, volume declines means decreased revenue \nfor some and driving costs up and getting those costs under control are \ndriving users away at alarming rates. These plans require a thoughtful \nconsideration of alternative solutions, public input, and cautious \nimplementation. We have, in fact, done that with our bill. We have sat \ndown, as I said, for more hours than I can tell you trying to work \nthrough every issue. We have met with the players ad nauseam to try to \nmake sure we address each and every consideration, including Members of \nthis Chamber. There are Members on the other side who have their own \nideas how to fix this. We have amendments here, also, and people want \nto address their issues.\n  Since when do we bring up a bill and do it in a day--especially \nsomething like this, which is so massive and affects so many people and \nan entire industry. We are going to do it in a day or 2 days. Even when \nwe did insider trading, we did it in 4 or 5 days. This bill, I figure, \nis a good 6 to 8 days of hard-core debating, letting people come up \nwith ideas for trying to rescue this important industry.\n  I and others in this Chamber want the postal employees to be treated \nfairly. We recognize their dedication and their service in this bill. \nWe have over 100,000 employees eligible for retirement today. Rather \nthan advocating for layoff authority, our bill provides a means for the \nPostal Service to increase attrition rates through buyouts and \nseparation incentives to leave the post office voluntarily and with \ndignity. That is deeply important to me.\n  Additional provisions in the bill include long-overdue improvements \nto the Federal Workers' Compensation Program, a more affordable \nschedule of prefunding the retiree health benefit trust fund, and \nencouraging eligible retirees to join the Medicare rolls.\n  These are no doubt difficult times for the Postal Service, and some \nvery tough choices are going to be made. So far in this legislative \nsession, the Senate has shown that there are issues, as\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nI said in my presentation, on which we can find bipartisan solutions. \nIn closing, I am confident this is one of them, and I look forward to \nhaving our bill heard and we get back on track, have the leader step \nback and allow us to come up with an agreement of relevant amendments \nand do the people's business.\n  I am grateful for the leadership Senators Lieberman, Collins, and \nCarper have shown on this issue over the years. I look forward to \nworking on this bill with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator speaks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to follow the remarks of the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                     Student Loan Affordability Act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are engaged in a very important debate \nwhile the clock is ticking on literally the future of the postal \nservice.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to another issue that is rapidly \napproaching. On July 1, if we do not act, the interest rate on \nsubsidized student loans will be doubling from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent, impacting more than 7 million students, including more than \n36,000 in Rhode Island.\n  I have introduced legislation--the Student Loan Affordability Act--to \nstop the doubling of student loan interest rates as of July 1 of this \nyear. Many of my colleagues have already joined me, including Senators \nBegich, Sherrod Brown, Durbin, Franken, Tim Johnson, Klobuchar, Leahy, \nMurray, Sanders, Schumer, Stabenow, Whitehouse, and Wyden, as \ncosponsors of the legislation. I thank them and urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n  If we don't act, the average borrower will have to pay approximately \n$2,800 more in interest on their loans. Students who take out the \nmaximum $23,000 in subsidized student loans could owe approximately \n$5,000 more over the 10-year repayment period. Students and families \nsimply cannot absorb these costs in this tough economy and in the face \nof rising tuition and dwindling State support for higher education.\n  This particular measure will hit middle-income families very hard \nbecause they are the ones who rely significantly on these subsidized \nstudent loans. The subsidized student loan program is a need-based \nfinancial aid program. To get the low rate and the in-school interest \nsubsidy, students must demonstrate economic need. Nearly 60 percent of \nthe dependent students who qualify for these loans come from families \nwith incomes of less than $60,000. That is literally the middle class \nand the working poor of this country.\n  This is an issue of fairness. At a time, ironically, of historically \nlow interest rates, when the Federal Reserve has set the target \ninterest rate for Federal funds between 0 and .25 percent--the Fed is \nlending money to banks at near zero percent. We, at the same time, are \nasking middle-income families to pay twice as much, 6.8 percent--a huge \ndiscrepancy--in the loans they pay for education.\n  We also recognize--all of us--that the key to our future is an \neducated America. It seems that given the interest rate environment, \nwhere banks can get money overnight at near zero percent interest and \nwe are telling students they have to pay 6.8, not 3.4, it doesn't make \nsense. It is in our national interest to ensure that students not only \nget educated but don't leave school with a mountain of debt.\n  We need more students graduating from our colleges, universities, and \nprofessional schools because that will power our economy in the future. \nWe won't be globally competitive if we don't do this.\n  In 1980 the gap between the lifetime earnings of a college graduate \nand high school graduate was 40 percent. In 2010 it was 74 percent. By \n2025 it is projected to be 96 percent. The message is clear: If you \ncannot get postsecondary education, you are virtually going to be \ncondemned to being far behind in terms of income and ability to support \nyour family. Researchers have found that since at least the 1980s, we \nhaven't been producing a sufficient number of college-educated workers \nto meet the demand of industry. If you go to businesses throughout \nRhode Island and the Nation, they will tell you they have jobs for \nwhich they cannot find the people with the high-level skills needed to \nfill them. So every available criterion argues strenuously for this \nlegislation.\n\n  In Rhode Island, we have 41 percent of our working adults who have \ncollege degrees. By 2018 it is estimated that 61 percent of the jobs \nthere will require some postsecondary education. We have a 20-percent \ngap that has already opened in the next 4 years, and we have to fill \nit. The wrong way to fill it is to make college more expensive.\n  I recently had a roundtable with all of the presidents of my \nuniversities and colleges in Rhode Island. They said that keeping this \ninterest rate relatively low is absolutely critical. They are all \nworried about the fact that by July 1, unless we act, we will see a \ndoubling of this interest rate.\n  Frankly, this is an issue that has had bipartisan support. In 2007, \non a very strong, bipartisan basis, we enacted the College Cost \nReduction and Access Act, cutting the interest rate from 6.8 to 3.4 \npercent. In the Senate, the legislation passed on a 79-to-12 vote, with \nmore than two-thirds of Republican Senators--34 out of 49--supporting \nit. President George W. Bush signed it into law.\n  We have to revive, before July 1, that bipartisan spirit that \nmotivated the initial legislation so that we can avoid doubling the \ninterest rate college students will pay for these loans. It is a matter \nof major priorities for us--not just for a short time but for the \nfuture of the country. We have 75 days. The clock is ticking. We have \nto move. If we don't, millions of middle-class students and families \nwill be denied the opportunity to effectively get a higher education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on our failure to move \nforward with debate and discussion and amendments on this very \nimportant bill. The sponsors of the legislation and I may have very \ndifferent proposals to address this compelling issue, but neither the \nsponsors nor I believe we should not have debate, discussion, and \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, again, because of a requirement by Members that their \namendment be voted on, apparently, the majority leader will now move \non, fill the tree, amendments will not be allowed, and we will move on \nto other legislation. This affects 500-some-thousand American \nemployees. We are talking about tens of billions of dollars. We are \ntalking about an urgent need to restructure and reform the postal \nsystem in America. So now, because of demands of Senators to have votes \non nongermane amendments, we will now move on to other legislation. I \nwonder when we will address the issue. May 15 is a very critical date \nin this whole scenario.\n  I would like to talk a bit about my proposal, and that basically is \nmodeled after the bill that is pending in the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Yesterday the Washington Post editorial said, ``The time for real \npostal reform is now.'' It begins:\n\n       For anyone who still does not quite grasp the \n     technologically obsolescent U.S. Postal Service's calamitous \n     financial situation, here are a few facts from Thursday's \n     Government Accountability Office report.\n\n  Before I go through that, I will quote from a Washington Post article \nfrom November 18. It specifically refers to the pending legislation. It \nsays:\n\n       The 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2011, proposed by \n     Senators Joseph I. Lieberman and Susan Collins and passed \n     last week by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, is not a bill to save the U.S. Postal \n     Service. It is a bill to postpone saving the Postal Service.\n       The service's announcement that it lost $5.1 billion in the \n     most recent fiscal year was billed as good news, which \n     suggests how dire its situation is. The only reason the loss \n     was not greater is that Congress postponed the USPS's payment \n     of $5.5 billion to prefund retiree health benefits. According \n     to the Government Accountability Office, even $50 billion \n     would not be enough to repay all of the Postal Service's debt \n     and address current and future operating deficits that are \n     caused by its inability to cut costs quickly enough to match \n     declining mail volume and revenue.\n       The Collins-Lieberman bill, which transfers $7 billion from \n     the Federal Employee\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\n     Retirement System to the USPS--to be used for offering \n     buyouts to its workers and paying down debts--can stave off \n     collapse for a short time at best.\n\n  I point out that this is the Washington Post's view and the GAO's \nview, not necessarily that of this Senator.\n\n       Nor do the other measures in the bill offer much hope. The \n     bill extends the payment schedule for the Postal Service to \n     prefund its employee retirement benefits from 10 to 40 years. \n     Yes, the funding requirement is onerous, but if the USPS \n     cannot afford to pay for these benefits now, what makes it \n     likely they will be able to pay later when mail volumes \n     most likely will have plummeted further?\n\n  The article goes on to talk about one of the favorite tactics around \nhere--more studies.\n\n       The bill also requires two more years of studies to \n     determine whether a switch to five-day delivery would be \n     viable.\n\n  I have to repeat that for my colleagues. We need to study for 2 years \nas to whether we need to reduce mail delivery from 6 days to 5 days. \nIsn't that marvelous. Isn't that marvelous--2 years to study. What it \nis is delaying what is absolutely necessary; that is, to have 5-day-a-\nweek delivery.\n  One of my colleagues said it might keep someone from getting a \nnewspaper in the mail. We are talking about $50 billion short, and we \ncan't even reduce the number of days which has been recommended by the \nPostmaster General himself, so we are going to have 2 years to study \nwhether we should switch to 5-day-a-week and whether that would be \nviable.\n  Continuing to quote from the Washington Post article:\n\n       These studies would be performed by a regulatory body that \n     has already completed a laborious inquiry into the subject, a \n     process that required almost a year.\n\n  So it will actually take 3 years.\n\n       This seems a pointless delay, especially given that a \n     majority of Americans support the switch to five-day \n     delivery.\n       We are sympathetic to Congress's wish to avoid killing \n     jobs. And the bill does include provisions we have \n     supported--such as requiring arbitrators to take the Postal \n     Service's financial situation into account during collective \n     bargaining and demanding a plan for providing mail services \n     at retail outlets.\n       But this plan hits the snooze button on many of the postal \n     service's underlying problems. Eighty percent of the USPS's \n     budget goes towards its workforce; many of its workers are \n     protected by no-layoff clauses.\n\n  Our Postal Service has no-layoff clauses in its contracts. I wonder \nif most Americans know that.\n\n       Seven billion dollars' worth of buyouts may help to shrink \n     the workforce, but this so-called overpayment will come from \n     taxpayers' pockets, and it is a hefty price to pay for \n     further delay.\n       There is an alternative--a bill proposed by Representative \n     Darrell Issa, (Republican-California) that would create a \n     supervisory body to oversee the Postal Service's finances \n     and, if necessary, negotiate new labor contracts. The bill, \n     which just emerged from committee, is not perfect, but it \n     offers a serious solution that does not leave taxpayers on \n     the hook.\n\n  I wish to read from the April 14 Washington Post editorial, which I \nthink sums up the situation.\n\n       For better or worse, our children's children will marvel at \n     the fact that anyone ever used to send the paper thing called \n     ``a letter.'' They'll be amazed to learn that we \n     unnecessarily spent billions of dollars propping up a huge, \n     inefficient system for moving these things around. But what \n     would really astound future generations is that we borrowed \n     that money and left it to them to pay it back.\n\n  There is no better description of what this bill is all about. My \nfriends, I will be glad to go into a number of details, but it is very \nclear Congress and the Postal Service cannot make decisions, so what we \nneed is the only thing we found that worked to reduce our bases in \nAmerica, which was a BRAC. So what we need is a BRAC-like commission to \nidentify those post offices and other facilities that need to be \nclosed.\n  I wish to go back to what the article said about future generations. \nMy friends, we now communicate with these. We communicate by e-mail and \nwe communicate by tweeting and we communicate electronically in the \nways we used to do with pen and paper or a typewriter. That is a fact. \nSo we have seen a dramatic reduction in regular mail. We have seen it \ngo down in a very dramatic fashion, which will accelerate over time. \nListen, when guys my age are doing this, everybody is doing it. The \nfact is, everybody will be doing it, and they will not have to put a \n30- or 40- or 50-cent or 60-cent stamp on a letter in order to get a \nmessage to their friends, families, business associates, et cetera.\n  Instead of doing as some did when the Pony Express was replaced by \nthe railroad--trying to prop up a failing industry--let's find a \ngraceful exit and, at the same time, preserve those functions of the \nPostal Service that will be around for a long time. There are functions \nthat could stay around for a long time. But this is a dramatically \nchanged world. We now have instant communications. We have instant news \ncycles, and we have today a proliferation, thank God, of information \nand knowledge that was unknown in previous years or in history. There \nare upsides and downsides to that, but the Postal Service delivering \nletters does not play any role in the future of information being \nshared and made available to citizens all over the world.\n  First-class mail makes up more than half of postal revenues. It is \ndown by more than 25 percent since 2001. In the last 11 years, it is \ndown 25 percent, and I promise that will accelerate. It continues on a \ndownward spiral with no sign of recovery. This, combined with \nunsustainable 80-percent labor costs and labor contracts that contain \nno-layoff clauses, points to the hard reality the Postal Service is \nbroken.\n  By the way, that is also the conclusion of the Government \nAccountability Office, which just recently issued a report entitled \n``Challenges Related to Restructuring the Postal Service's Retail \nNetwork.'' Let me quote from that report.\n\n       In 2011, the American Postal Workers Union . . . and USPS \n     management negotiated a 4-year agreement that limits \n     transferring employees of an installation or craft to no more \n     than 50 miles away.\n\n  How in the world did they negotiate an agreement that they would not \ntransfer anybody farther than 50 miles away?\n\n       If USPS management cannot place employees within 50 miles, \n     the parties are to jointly determine what steps may be taken, \n     which includes putting postal employees on ``stand by'' which \n     occurs when workers are idled but paid their full salary due \n     to reassignments and reorganization efforts.\n\n  I am not making that up. If someone is a postal service worker and \nthey want to be reassigned more than 50 miles away, they cannot do it. \nAnd if they can't do it, they put employees on stand-by, and they are \nidled but paid their full salary due to reassignments and \nreorganization efforts. My friends, it helps us to understand why 80 \npercent of their costs are in personnel.\n\n  The GAO, in its report, makes an argument basically for a BRAC. They \ncall it the Commission on Postal Reorganization. Quoting the GAO once \nagain:\n\n       The proposed Commission on Postal Reorganization could \n     broaden the current focus on individual facility closures--\n     which are often contentious, time consuming and inefficient--\n     to a broader network-wide restructuring, similar to the BRAC \n     approach. In other restructuring efforts where this approach \n     has been used, expert panels have successfully informed and \n     permitted difficult restructuring decisions, helping to \n     provide consensus on intractable decisions. As previously \n     noted, the 2003 report of the President's Commission on the \n     USPS also recommended such an approach relating to the \n     consolidation and rationalization of USPS's mail processing \n     and distribution infrastructure. We also reported in 2010 \n     that Congress may want to consider this approach to assist in \n     restructuring organizations that are facing key financial \n     challenges.\n       GAO has testified that USPS cannot continue providing \n     services at current levels without dramatic changes in its \n     cost structure. Optimizing the USPS's mail processing network \n     would help USPS by bringing down costs related to excess and \n     inefficient resources.\n\n  Continuing to read from the GAO report:\n\n       Lack of flexibility to consolidate its workforce: USPS \n     stated it must be able to reduce the size of its workforce in \n     order to ensure its costs are less than revenue. Action in \n     this area is important since USPS's workforce accounts for \n     about 80 percent of its costs.\n\n  We are faced with a very difficult decision, and the amendment and \nsubstitute I have has a number of provisions. I see my friend from \nConnecticut is on the floor, and I know he wants to discuss this issue \nas well, but the fact is we are looking at a Postal Service that once \nupon a time was so important to the United States of America it was \neven mentioned in the Constitution. Since those days, and in the \nintervening years, the Postal Service performed an incredibly \noutstanding job in delivering mail and communications to our citizens \nall over America--\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\nin all settings, in all parts of our country--and they deserve great \ncredit for doing so. But now we face a technological change.\n  As I understand it, a huge portion of their mail now is made up of \nso-called junk mail, which is advertising mail. Americans in greater \nand greater numbers are making use of this new technology, as I pointed \nout, and it is time we understood that and we stopped this incredible \nhemorrhaging of money. According to the Postal Service itself, by 2020, \nthey are expecting to face up to a $238 billion shortfall. They are \nexpecting a $238 billion shortfall in just the next 8 years--$238 \nbillion. The Postal Service has reached its borrowing limit of $15 \nbillion. Even with dramatic cost savings of $12 billion and workforce \nreduction of 110,000 postal employees in the past 4 years, the Postal \nService is still losing money. In fact, the Postal Service has said it \ncould lose as much as $18 billion annually by 2015 if not given the \nnecessary flexibility it needs to cut costs and transform.\n  What does the legislation before us do? It delays by 2 years for a \nstudy--a study--to figure out whether we should go from 6 days a week \nto 5 days a week. I wonder how long it would take some smart people to \nfigure out whether we should go from a 5-day delivery versus 6 days. \nAccording to the sponsors of the bill, it takes them 2 years, after \nthey have already studied it for 1 year. Remarkable. Remarkable.\n  What we need--and this is, unfortunately, testimony to the lack of \npolitical courage of Members of Congress and members of the \nadministration--a BRAC process. We need a BRAC process, where we can \nappoint a number of men and women who are knowledgeable and who are \nwilling to make these decisions for us and then those decisions would \nbe made and it would come back for an up-or-down vote in the Congress \nof the United States.\n  I point out again, this bill before us locks in the current service \nstandards for 3 years. It will make it impossible to go forward with \nthe vast bulk of the Postal Service's planned network consolidation for \nat least 3 years. It puts in place significant new steps, including \npublic notice and comment, before a processing plant can be closed. It \ngives appeal rights to the PRC for processing plant closures and gives \nbinding authority to this PRC to keep a plant open to protect service \nstandards.\n  The bill adds a number of new regulations designed to make it more \ndifficult to close post offices. It includes a post office closure \nmoratorium until retail service standards are created. It gives the PRC \nthe ability to enforce a ``retail service standard'' which would enable \nthe PRC to not only require appealed post offices stay open but even \nrequire new post offices to be open if a complaint is lodged.\n  It continues the 2-year delay before USPS can go to 5-day delivery, \nas I mentioned, and it removes a provision in the reported text that \nrequired arbitrators to take into account pay comparability in any \ndecision. It replaces it with vague language that says ``nothing in \nthis section may be construed to limit the relevant factors that the \narbitration board may take into consideration.''\n  If that isn't vague language I don't know what is. Let me repeat it. \nThey want the board to do nothing in this section of the legislation \nthat could be construed to limit the relevant factors that the \narbitration board may take into consideration. That is pretty good \nguidance, isn't it?\n  I could go on and on, but in summary I would just go back to the \nWashington Post's final paragraph of their article and repeat--and this \nis what this is all about, my friends.\n\n       For better or worse, our children's children will marvel at \n     the fact that anyone ever used to send the paper thing called \n     ``a letter.'' They'll be amazed to learn that we \n     unnecessarily spent billions of dollars propping up a huge, \n     inefficient system for moving these things around. But what \n     would really astound future generations is that we borrowed \n     that money and left it to them to pay it back.\n\n  I thank the sponsors of this bill for the great effort they made. I \nthink we have open and honest disagreements that deserve debate and \ndiscussion and amendments. They deserve amendments and they deserve \nhonest debate. We are talking about the future of the Postal Service in \nAmerica and we are talking about literally, over time, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of taxpayers' money.\n  I hope the majority leader will reconsider and allow amendments to be \nproposed. I hope my colleagues will not insist on a vote on a \nnonrelevant amendment as a condition to moving forward with \nlegislation. That is not right either.\n  I have said time after time, because I have been around here for a \nlong time, we should have people sit down, both majority and Republican \nleaders, and say, okay, how many amendments do you want? Which \namendments do you want voted on? Give them a reasonable handful, which \nwe did not that long ago, and then you have those votes and move \nforward.\n  This is important legislation. The Senator from Connecticut will \npoint out that May 15 is a critical day. This issue cannot be strung \nout forever.\n  I hope we can sit down with the majority and Republican leader and \ncome up with some amendments that would be allowed and then move \nforward. I don't know if my amendment will be agreed to, but I think it \ndeserves a vote. I think it deserves debate and consideration.\n  Again, I thank the sponsors, three of the four of whom are on the \nfloor, for their hard work. I look forward to the opportunity to have \nhonest and open debate and discussion on this very important \nlegislation. I know they and their staffs have put in hundreds and \nhundreds of hours of work on this legislation to bring it to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I agree with the \nstatements of the Senator from Arizona about the majority leader and \nallowing us to actually work on relevant amendments that are important \nto each and every person in this Chamber, to make sure we can address \nthose very real issues, to move not only this issue forward but to try \nto attempt to rescue the Post Office.\n  I also agree with him in his commenting on some of the deals that \nwere cut by the Postmaster General in dealing with contracting. We \nactually have spoken about this many times. I asked the Postmaster \nGeneral personally what was the thought process associated with \nentering into a contract? Did you want us to be the bad guys? What was \nthe thought process there? Our hands are somewhat tied in dealing with \nsome of these legislative issues.\n  There is nobody I respect more than the Senator who just walked out \nof this Chamber but I have to respectfully disagree. During our many \nlong hours of deliberation between staff and cosponsors we wrestled \nwith many things that were brought up in his presentation. With all due \nrespect, I read many other articles that comment we are moving boldly \nto try to rescue the Post Office, taking into consideration everybody--\nnot only the union workers but obviously the Postmaster General, the \ncitizens--i.e., the users of the Postal Service, and everybody in this \nChamber.\n  The impending financial crisis at the Post Office I can tell you is \nforemost in our minds. It was the only consideration we had, was trying \nto make the Post Office viable for future generations to use. That is \nthe only consideration we had. The fact that we are here today, and I \nguess are not going to be able to move forward on this, is mind-\nboggling. But any legitimate reform of the Postal Service has to \nrecognize we need to cut costs and streamline an organization that is \ntoo big, especially in light of the future mail volumes and the \ndecreasing of future mail volumes. Our bill recognizes this, but where \nit differs from the approach of the Senator from Arizona is in our \nrecognition of the full impact that major service changes will have on \npostal customers and future revenues.\n  The Saturday delivery service of the Post Office is one of the \nstrongest benefits it has. When you are competing with the other \nentities delivering mail or delivering packages and the like, that is \nthe leg up that the Postal Service has. We want to deliver that.\n  As a matter of fact, I want to address two other things. It is not \nthe taxpayers who are paying this money. It is the ratepayers who have \nalready paid into the system and have in fact overpaid into the Postal \nService in some of their retirement issues, the retirement\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\nprogram that we have. We are merely giving them that money back to \nallow them to get their financial house in order in order to offer some \nbuyouts, to get these 100,000 people retired so we can reduce the cost \nof the Postal Service.\n  Once we make these changes, the Senator from Arizona also referenced \nthat it is going to take a 2-year study? No, it is not a 2-year study \nto see if we are going to cut down Saturday service. They want to cut \nit right off. If we do all these other changes, the consideration we \ndid in a joint and bipartisan manner was to determine whether, in fact, \nif we had done these, do we still need to cut the Saturday service? \nWhich, by the way, is the benefit the Postal Service has over everybody \nelse. Are we going to contribute to that downward spiral or are we \nactually going to work together and give them the little bit of \nflexibility, to say we have done all these changes, we don't need to \ncut Saturday delivery?\n  We still do it. We may need to streamline it. We may need to do \ncurbside instead of going to the door. We may need to do clusters, \nshift it in some rural areas. But we have cut retirees. We have cut, \nconsolidated--we have done everything. That is what the 2-year study \nis: If it doesn't work, we will do it. But to cut off your nose to \nspite your face makes no sense to me.\n  As the Postal Regulatory Commission has pointed out time and time \nagain, the assumptions on customer and revenue impact as a result of \nthese proposals have been weak at best and nonexistent at worst. We \nneed to make sure when and if we give the Postmaster General the \nability to do these certain things, he is going to do them. There are \nno two ways about it. He needs to draw a line in the sand and, more \nimportantly, get everybody in the same room. I cannot imagine that our \npostal employees, whatever union they are from, want to have the Post \nOffice go bankrupt and go out of business. I can't imagine there are \npeople listening who don't want to get their cards from their \ngrandchildren, get their checks, magazines, these things they are \naccustomed to.\n  I am listening to the Senator and I am signing letters I am going to \nbe putting in the mail. How ironic is that. I am sitting here signing \nletters and the Senator, for whom I have great respect, says we \ncommunicate by this cell phone--yes, but the personal touch and that \nfeeling of how you feel I think is best expressed right here. That is \nwhy I take the time and effort to respond, not only to my constituents, \nto my family and friends. Call me old fashioned. I think there is \nsomething worth saving here and that is what I am working on.\n\n  Let me say, by the way, about the Senator from Connecticut, what a \nlegacy he is going to leave. We just did the insider trading bill. \nWithout Senator Collins' and Senator Lieberman's help that never would \nhave come to fruition, had they not actually had the guts to move that \nforward. What a legacy to leave.\n  Then to actually have another legacy, to save the United States Post \nOffice? They may actually name it after the Senator. I will make that \neffort, the Joe Lieberman Post Office. That will be great.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In Massachusetts?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. And I will put it in Massachusetts. How \nabout that?\n  You need to have a sense of humor around here. Trust me, sometimes \nyou have to laugh at some of the things that happen here.\n  But in all seriousness, we need to take these drastic steps in order \nto provide for the economic viability of the Postal Service. In our \nbill, S. 1789, we will have a better way. The likelihood of the House \nbill passing is, I am understanding, quite remote. But there is a good \nlikelihood that we can actually get this out first if the majority \nleader lets us move forward and get it out the door and put the \npressure on the House to join with us in a bicameral way.\n  I want to say I was honored to be part of this effort to rescue the \nPost Office, as I have been honored to work on everything in our \ncommittee. We are going to miss the Senator very much. I said that \nbefore and I am not kidding. I know Senator Collins feels the same way. \nTo do these two major pieces of legislation, I am excited to see what \nelse we can do before the Senator leaves.\n  With that in mind, I will yield the floor and note I am excited to \ncontinue to work on this very important initiative. I encourage the \nmajority leader to allow us to move forward and get this done and then \nwe will move on to the Violence Against Women Act. As I said before, I \nam a cosponsor of both. As I said before, I am a cosponsor of both, so \nflip a coin--either way I win. It is ``heads'' on both sides. This is \ntime sensitive. But it is until May 15, if I am not mistaken, in order \nfor us to do it and have some control over these cuts; otherwise, you \ncould see Draconian cuts, willy-nilly, with no input from us at all and \nno protection for our constituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first I thank my friend, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, for his kind words about me. It has been a pleasure \nto work with him. He has been a great and devoted member on our \ncommittee. He introduced, along with Senator Gillibrand, the two bills \nthat became the anti-insider trading bill and worked as a ranking \nmember on the subcommittee that Senator Carper chairs that has been \nworking, focused on saving the United States Postal Service.\n  I appreciate his kind words and the stated intention, to name a post \noffice for me. I hope he names one that is not then closed shortly \nthereafter. I also thank him for doing his part personally for the Post \nOffice by continuing to write letters and sign them.\n  If we all personally--I am using e-mail as much as anyone else. I am \ngoing to wander a bit here in preparing for this my last year in the \nSenate and how you wind things down. They actually keep our e-mails on \ndisks. They can be stored in libraries, as you would normal memos. We \ndo reserve the right to edit somewhat. We are privileged in that way. \nBut so much of the communication that goes on between people on e-mail \nis effectively lost in the ether of cyberspace.\n  When you think about the richness of history, how much of history \ncomes from letters that were written or typed over time, I think--\nthough the trend here is clear, more and more will be done on the \nInternet, on e-mail--I think people are going to still want to write \nand receive letters. That is just one of the reasons why the Post \nOffice should stay what it is--not what it is now but remain a viable \ninstitution which is not only important for the slightly sentimental \nreasons I have mentioned but because millions of jobs in our society \nand our country depend on the Postal Service. Although e-mail and the \nInternet are changing the reality of communications in our world, there \nare some things, in addition to mail, that will always best be done \nthrough the services of the U.S. Postal Service and not through the \nInternet. Some of that is the catalogs and magazines we get through the \nmail, but some of it is the packages, medicine, products that people \nbuy over the Internet, that have to be delivered. Most of that is \nactually delivered, the last mile, by the United States Postal Service.\n  I thank my friend from Massachusetts for responding to Senator \nMcCain's statement. It described where we are simplistically on this. I \nknow there are some people who believe the bipartisan bill that came \nout of our committee--Senator Collins, Senator Carper, Senator Brown, \nand I--does too much. It is too tough on the Post Office. So they are \nconcerned about it.\n  Senator McCain is on the other side. He doesn't think--and I am sure \nthere are others--that we have gone far enough quickly enough. I think \nwe found the right spot. I think this is a balanced, middle-way \nproposal. But make no mistake about it, the substitute bill that has \nbeen filed is not a status quo bill. It authorizes and facilitates \nexactly the kind of significant change in the U.S. Postal Service that \nthe reality of its declining business demands we propose. So in most of \nthe cases, with the exception of the 6- to 5-day delivery, which I will \ncome back to, to change the 6- to 5-day delivery requires legislative \nauthorization. I hope somebody puts an amendment in that would \nauthorize the Post Office to go immediately from 6- to 5-day delivery \nbecause I wish to see what the sentiment is in the Senate. My guess \nis--\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\nfor the reasons that the Senator from Massachusetts stated very \neloquently--people are not ready for that precipitous change from 6 to \n5 days; that if we do some of the things Senator McCain is proposing, \nit would make such rapid and dramatic changes in the Postal Service \nthat it will have the contrary effect to what people intend and it will \ndiminish its services so rapidly that it will accelerate its downfall \nby decreasing its revenues.\n\n  This perhaps is not the right parallel, but I remember years ago when \nI was in the State Senate in Connecticut we had a real problem with the \npublicly supported bus transportation running a deficit, and one of the \ninevitable proposals was to raise the cost of the bus fare. Well, of \ncourse, one of the logical and sensible reactions to that--which \nhappened--is that fewer people rode the bus because it cost more and it \ngot into more trouble, and that is exactly the kind of downward cycle \nthat the sensible change we are facilitating in this bill will make \npossible. Post offices and mail processing facilities will be closed \nunder this bill. A lot of employees will leave the Post Office. This \nwill all be done according to standards and in a methodical way that I \nthink ultimately will not only save a lot of money for the Post \nOffice--and I expect we will have an official estimate in the next day \nor two on that savings derived from our bill from the U.S. Post \nOffice--but it will do so in a way that doesn't break people away from \nthe Postal Service and put it into a more rapid spiral downward.\n  As a matter of process, I want to say in response to my friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain--first, I want to say that I appreciate what he \nsaid about the amendment from the Senator from Kentucky, it is not \nrelevant to this bill. I am sure there will be another occasion that \nhis proposal to terminate financial assistance to Egypt will be \nrelevant and should be brought up, but it should not be brought up on \nthis bill because it is not relevant and it is exactly those kinds of \nirrelevant amendments that often get the Senate into a gridlock \nsituation which means we won't get our job done, and makes the public \neven more dissatisfied with us. So I thank Senator McCain for speaking \nto that.\n  Senator McCain has introduced an amendment, which I oppose, but it is \nrelevant and it ought to be debated. I know the majority leader is very \nopen to working out a process by which amendments from both caucuses \nwill be introduced and introduced in a timely way. There are several \ncolleagues on the Democratic side who have amendments they want to \noffer as well. So I hope Senator Collins, Senator Reid, Senator \nMcConnell, and I can work together to begin to reach a bipartisan \nagreement where we can take up amendments that are relevant--Senator \nMcCain's is one of them--and we can debate them and get something done \nhere. Too often the public is so frustrated and angry with us because \nwe leave problems unsolved because we get stuck in partisan, \nideological, or procedural gridlock. This is a real problem.\n  The Post Office lost more than $13 billion in the last 2 years. It \nwould have been $5 billion more if we had not waived a payment \nresponsibility the Post Office had to the retirees' health benefit \nplan. It cannot go on this way. And if we don't act, it is not as if \nnothing will happen; something will happen. The Post Office will \ncontinue to spiral downward and the Postmaster will inevitably have to \nimpose dramatic cuts in services and personnel. So I think it is our \nresponsibility to create a set of rules and procedures here that \nacknowledges the need for change in the Postal Service, create a \nprocess--well, actually authorizes the Post Office to do some things it \nhas not been able to do until now to raise more money--and create a \nprocess for changing the business model of the U.S. Postal Service so \nit can survive in a very different age, the age of e-mail, and also \nflourish because so many people in our country depend on it for doing \nso.\n  Madam President, 563 million pieces of mail get delivered by the U.S. \nPostal Service every day, so this is not some kind of irrelevant and \nantiquated relic somewhere. This is a beating, functioning, critically \nimportant element of our life, our commerce, and our culture, and a lot \nof people depend on it, so we have a responsibility to change it and to \nkeep it alive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, at a later time I am going to speak in \nstrong opposition to the substitute offered by the Senator from \nArizona, but I must say that he has every right to offer that \nsubstitute. We should fully debate it, and then we should vote on it. I \nam puzzled by the procedural steps that have been taken this afternoon \nto curtail the debate and amendment process on this bill without our \neven trying to get an agreement on the number of amendments, perhaps \nlimiting them to relevant amendments, which I think would have been a \nfair way to proceed. So as much as I am opposed to the substance of \nSenator McCain's substitute and believe it is ill-advised, I do believe \nwe should have a full debate on it and a vote on it. That is what we \nare here for.\n  There are many different views on how we should save the Postal \nService, but surely all of us ought to recognize that we simply cannot \nallow the Postal Service to fail. It is the linchpin of a trillion \ndollar mailing industry that employs 8.7 million Americans. It is \nabsolutely vital. It also is an American institution with roots going \nto our Constitution, and we worked very hard in a bipartisan way on our \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to come up with a \nvery good bill that would put the Postal Service back on the right \ntrack.\n  It would allow it to compassionately downsize its workforce, which it \nneeds to do. As painful as that is, we would do it in a compassionate \nway by giving authority for buyouts and retirement incentives similar \nto those used by the private sector. The Postmaster General has said \nhe believes he could reduce the number of employees by 100,000 without \nlayoffs but by giving these incentives, particularly since more than 33 \npercent of the Postal Service employees are already eligible for \nretirement.\n\n  Senator McCain has a different view on how we should go about that. \nHe has a different view on Saturday delivery, on rural post offices, on \novernight delivery of mail, all of which I think are important. Our \nbill does not prevent the closure of every single post office, nor does \nit dictate that a certain number remain open or closed, for that \nmatter. What we did is we set standards. That is the way it should be. \nWe have the Postal Regulatory Commission set standards for access to \npostal services, and those standards are supposed to include \nconsideration of such factors as distance to the next post office, \ngeography, public transportation, and weather factors. That is far \nbetter than a one-size-fits-all approach that the Senator from Arizona \nwould have or the approach used by the Postmaster General to target \n3,200 post offices without even looking at whether there are \nalternative and far less expensive ways to deliver the services. And \nthere are.\n  For example, a rural post office could be colocated in a pharmacy or \na grocery store. It could still exist but run different hours, perhaps \nbe opened from 7 to 9 in the morning and 5 to 7 at night. I wager that \na lot of my constituents would appreciate that. That would be on their \nway to work in the morning and on their way home at night. It could \ncolocate with a State office or local office, move into a townhall, or \nhave a Federal agency move in with the post office. It could offer \nservices that are available generally at State and local offices. There \nare so many creative ways we can preserve postal services in rural \nareas and yet reduce costs, and I believe the Postal Service needs to \nbe far more creative in its approach.\n  But I do not support the approach Senator McCain has laid out. One of \nhis proposals would create a new bureaucracy--I thought we were against \ncreating new bureaucracies around here--such as a new control board \nthat would be over the board of governors and would have these \ndictatorial powers over the Postal Service. That is a proposal that I \ndon't think makes sense.\n  Our approach is to have a commission that would examine the \ngovernance of the Postal Service, but perhaps what we should do, if \nthere is something wrong with the structure of the board of governors--\nit was substantially revised in 2006--is then we should\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nrevamp the board of governors, not create this new superbureaucracy on \ntop of it.\n  I agree with the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts on \nSaturday delivery. The provision that Senator McCain has to move \ndirectly to 5-day delivery and his negative comments on the fact that \nwe would prohibit that from happening for 2 years misunderstands the \nintent of our bill. It is not to say that might never happen; it is to \nsay that reducing service should be the last resort, not the first \noption. The Postal Service has an advantage that it delivers 6 days a \nweek.\n  Now if, in fact, after all the costs and waste and excess have been \nwrung out of the system and the Postal Service is still not solvent \nafter 2 years, then we may have to move to 5-day delivery. But to give \nup that advantage immediately, I can tell you what is going to happen: \nThe volume of mail will decline further. And if the volume of mail \ndeclines further after having a 26-percent decline over the past 5 \nyears, what is going to happen? Revenues will plummet once again. So we \nneed to be very careful about cutting service because it leads to \nmailers leaving the system. And once the big mailers, in particular, \nleave the Postal Service, they are not coming back, and the Postal \nService will sink further and further into a death spiral.\n  My approach is to try to keep and grow the customers for the Postal \nService. I think moving to Saturday delivery would drive more mail away \nand would hurt service and thus decrease the volume. So I do not think \nthat is a good approach. But the reason for our 2-year delay is not an \nendless study, as has been described by the Senator from Arizona. It is \nto allow time for the retirement incentives to go into effect, the \ndownsizing of the workforce to go into effect, the workers comp reforms \nto go into effect, the new arbitration provisions to go into effect, \nthe administrative efficiencies that we mandate to go into effect-- \ncountless provisions of the bill to go into effect. I believe if they \nare aggressively and well implemented by the Postal Service leaders--if \nthey are--there will be no need to eliminate Saturday delivery. That is \nthe reason for the provision in our bill. But we recognize that maybe \nthat will not happen. Maybe the provisions will not be aggressively and \nwell implemented, and the Postal Service will find that it needs to \ntake that extra step. But, surely, our first approach ought to be to \nimplement cuts without hurting service.\n\n  Let me give an example of that from my own State. In Hampden, ME, it \nis one of the two postal processing centers for the entire State of \nMaine. The other one is in Scarborough, ME, in southern Maine. The \nHampden facility is absolutely essential for processing mail from the \nbroad reaches of northern Maine, eastern Maine, and parts of western \nMaine.\n  Under the Postal Service's proposal, the Hampden facility would be \nclosed. That virtually eliminates the possibility of overnight delivery \nfor roughly two-thirds of the State of Maine by geography. It means a \nletter mailed from my hometown of Caribou, in northern Maine, to \nPresque Isle, just 10 or 11 miles away, would have to make a 600-mile \nroundtrip to Scarborough, ME, in order to be processed and delivered. I \ncan't imagine how many days that is going to take, particularly in the \nwinter, and this is all ground transportation.\n  So that is the kind of ill-conceived decision our bill is intended to \nprevent because it is the kind of decision that is going to cause \npostal customers to take their business elsewhere. In proof of that, I \nreceived an e-mail from a small business owner in Bangor, ME, which is \nthe town right next to Hampden, who told me he had already received a \nnotice from his payroll company saying if the Hampden facility closes, \nthen they recommend that he move to electronic payroll or they will \nhand deliver the checks from their payroll. So that, again, is lost \nbusiness for the Postal Service.\n  Could things be done at the Hampden facility to save money? \nAbsolutely. If the facility's size is too big compared to the volume of \nmail it is now processing, reduce the footprint. Rent out part of the \nfacility. A major mailer would love to be right in the same building as \nthe postal processing center. It could easily be reconfigured to \naccomplish that. So the Postal Service can do a lot to reduce its costs \nwithout doing away with overnight delivery, with Saturday delivery, and \nwith the treatment of first-class mail in the way that we have been \naccustomed.\n  Coming from New Hampshire, I know the Presiding Officer has a special \nappreciation for this: The steps that will be taken if we do not act \nwill leave rural America behind. Not every part of my State has access \nto broadband. We talk all the time about how people can go on the \nInternet. Well, they can't in parts of my State. We are making progress \nin that area, but there are many rural areas in Maine that do not have \naccess to broadband. So they do not have alternatives.\n  Weekly and daily newspapers would be at a terrible disadvantage if \novernight delivery is no longer available for two-thirds of the State \nof Maine. Think about that. Think what it means for bill paying for \nthose small businesses sending out bills to their customers.\n  Think about what it means to elderly individuals who are receiving \nprescription drugs through the mail--very common in my State, which is \none of the States with the oldest population in the Nation. A lot of \nour elderly in Maine are, particularly in the winter months, \nessentially homebound and they rely on getting those pharmaceuticals \nthrough the mail. So if we do away with Saturday delivery, close the \nprocessing plants, no more overnight delivery, Monday holidays as \nwell--I have talked to the Postmaster General, and he has conceded to \nme that even a first-class package or letter mailed on a Thursday would \nnot arrive until a Tuesday. That is a long time when a person is \nwaiting for vital medication.\n  So our approach, our fundamental premise, is to recognize that the \nPostal Service must become leaner, more streamlined, more efficient. It \nmust downsize to respond to declining volume, but it must be smart in \nhow it does so. It must do so in a way that does not alienate more of \nits customers because if it loses more of its customers, volume will \ndecline and revenues will decline. It is that simple, and that is why \nthis bill has been so carefully crafted.\n  This is not the bill I alone would have proposed, and I think that is \ntrue of all four of the sponsors of this bill. But we did what we are \nsupposed to do in the Senate. We worked together. We had countless \nmeetings, at times--I think the Senator from Connecticut will agree--\nendless meetings, to hammer out these provisions, to strike \ncompromises.\n  We consulted widely with our colleagues--with GAO, with the Postal \nService, with large mailers and small mailers, with the greeting card \nindustry, with the newspaper industry, with magazine publishers, with \nanyone who had a stake--with the postal unions--and we got their \nsuggestions and we crafted the bill to the best of our ability. We \nworked hard on it. I think it is a good bill.\n  I am very disappointed and indeed puzzled why we can't now proceed \nwith debate on amendments on this bill and why we have a cloture motion \non this bill already filed. That makes no sense to me. We are acting in \ngood faith. We are open for business right now. We could be taking up \namendments right now. I hope the leader will reconsider and allow us to \ndo this bill in the usual way. I would pledge to him--and he knows I am \nsincere in this--to work with him to try to come up with amendments and \nsee if we can go back and forth, side to side, and start working \nthrough them. We are here. We are open for business. We are ready to \ngo.\n  This bill matters. Our economy is still very fragile. If the Postal \nService stops delivering mail this fall, it will be a crushing blow to \nthis economy. If it stops delivering mail in certain areas or the mail \nis very slow, it will also hurt this economy.\n  We cannot leave rural America behind. The mandate of the Postal \nService is universal service. That means whether a person lives in the \nfar reaches of Alaska or at the bottom of the Grand Canyon in Arizona \nor on an island off the coast of Maine; all are supposed to be able to \nhave access to the Postal Service. It is one of the things that unites \nus as a country.\n  So I urge my colleagues to come together in good faith and work \nthrough\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nwhat I believe is a very important bill with a vital mission; that is, \nto save the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish to thank my dear friend and \ncolleague from Maine, not my ranking member but really sort of cochair \npartner of our committee, for her excellent statement. I share her \nfrustration about the procedural moment we are at in the Senate. I hope \nand I believe this is temporary. I believe Senator Reid's intention is \nto do exactly what Senator Collins has said she would like to see \nhappen, which is that we negotiate an agreement, hopefully--it would \nhave to be adopted by consent, but it would have to be amendment by \namendment, where we would go back and forth and consider amendments \nfrom each side of the aisle.\n  I know Senator Reid has filled the tree. It is not as if there are \nnot amendments that the Senate Democratic caucus wants to offer to the \nbill. There are. There are several of them. I know there are several on \nthe Republican side. We worked very hard on this bill, as Senator \nCollins has said. The meetings did seem endless. I would say sometimes \nthey seemed excessively endless. But, nonetheless, we reached across \nthe aisle and compromised.\n  This is not a perfect piece of work. It is an important subject, so \nit deserves to be considered, debated, and amendments need to be \noffered. I am confident in saying that is exactly the direction in \nwhich the majority leader wants to go, and the sooner the better.\n  Having said that, and seeing no one else on the Senate floor, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, we are debating this bill today because \nthe Postal Service is facing, as many of us know, a dire financial \ncrisis that literally threatens its very survival. This is a crisis \nthat has been building for some time. It is one that only Congress can \nfix at this point, and one that we absolutely must fix now, literally \nin a matter of weeks.\n  Since the Postal Service was first established in 1971 in its current \nform, we have taken it for granted that our mail would arrive and that \nimportant business and personal correspondence would reach its \ndestination. In addition, businesses, large and small, have come to \nrely on the mail to reach new customers and to communicate effectively \nwith existing customers.\n  The Postal Service has a presence in virtually every community of any \nsize in our country, large and small. It supports a trillion-dollar \nmailing industry that creates and sustains millions of private sector \njobs--I am told as many as 8 million private sector jobs today. \nUnfortunately, a number of those jobs are at great risk today. They are \nat risk because those of us in Congress have, to date, proven unwilling \nor unable to come to consensus around a package of reforms that can \nupdate the Postal Service's network and business model to reflect the \nreality it faces today--if you will, to right-size the enterprise, much \nas the auto industry has right-sized its enterprise in the last 3 or 4 \nyears. That lack of action on our part comes despite ample warnings \nabout the severity of the problem and about the consequences of not \nappropriately and effectively solving that problem.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, former Postmaster General Potter announced--I \nthink with the help of three major consulting companies--that the \nPostal Service would run up cumulative losses of more than 230 billion \nextra dollars by 2020 if we did nothing.\n  There are several reasons for these losses, including the diversion \nof first class mail to electronic forms of communication and \nlegislative hurdles Congress has imposed on reform efforts.\n  Mr. Potter and his successor Pat Donahoe have done a tremendous job, \nI believe, in trying to chip away at these losses, with the help of \ntheir employees, with the help of several of their unions, with the \nhelp of a number of their customers, and I think from time to time with \nhelp from those of us who serve in the Congress and in the last \nadministration and the current administration.\n  Over the past decade, the Postal Service has reduced the size of its \npostal workforce by roughly a third--not by firing people, not by \nlaying people off, but through attrition. They have closed scores of \nmail processing facilities across America with no noticeable impact on \nservice. People still drop letters and packages in the mail, and they \nmight be delivered the next day or the next day or within at least 3 \ndays--pretty amazing when you think about it. The approval rating for \nCongress is not very high, but the customer satisfaction of the \nAmerican people with respect to the Postal Service is still at about 85 \npercent--pretty good compared to how we are doing here in our Nation's \nCapital.\n  The Postal Service has introduced some new products such as the flat \nrate boxes: If it fits, it ships. They have formed productive \npartnerships with companies such as UPS and FedEx. UPS and FedEx do not \nwant to deliver every package, every parcel to every mailbox or address \nacross America. The Postal Service does that 6 days a week. The Postal \nService has a nice partnership with FedEx and UPS in order to make \nmoney for the Postal Service and to provide good customer service in \nthat partnership. But despite that, losses at the Postal Service \ncontinue to mount.\n  Last year, the Postal Service suffered an operating loss of more than \n$5 billion. It will see a similar loss this year, even if it finds some \nway to avoid making the retiree health prefunding payments due in the \ncoming months. Then the losses accelerate to $6.5 billion in 2013; to \n$10 billion in 2014; to more than $12 billion in 2015; and to more than \n$15 billion alone in 2016.\n  But these losses are only theoretical. I say that because the Postal \nService is close to exhausting its $15 billion line of credit with the \nTreasury and by this time next year will be well on its way to running \ncompletely out of cash. If that were to occur, the Postal Service's \nability to continue operating will be in jeopardy.\n  Postmaster General Donahoe has said repeatedly that he and his team \nwill do everything they can do to keep the mail moving even as the \nPostal Service's finances deteriorate. I believe him. But make no \nmistake: If the Postal Service is not permitted in the very near future \nto begin making the adjustments needed in response to the likely \npermanent declines in mail volume--especially first class mail--we have \nwitnessed in recent years, the Postal Service will drown in red ink. \nThe ripple effect of losing the Postal Service and the still very \nvaluable services it provides would deliver a body blow to our economy \nat the very time our economy is recovering.\n  We are on the brink of this impending disaster in part because we are \nexpecting the Postal Service of 2012 to try and be successful with a \nbusiness model created in the 1970s. Let's remember, in 1970, when I \nwas a naval flight officer on my first tour in Southeast Asia, there \nwas no e-mail. There was the mail. The happiest day of the week was \nwhen the mail came--letters, cards, packages, magazines, newspapers, \nyou name it. That was the day of the week to live for. The last time I \nwas over in Afghanistan--and Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins have \nbeen there any number of times--the last time I was there, they still \nget mail, our guys and gals still get mail, but do you know what they \nhave? They have Skype, they have telephones, they have these little \nphones like we carry around. They have the Internet; they have \nFacebook; they have Twitter. They have all that stuff. As a result, \nthey do not use the mail as we did in our generation.\n  Today, Americans live and work online. We shop and transact more and \nmore business online. These trends are likely to accelerate. If any of \nour colleagues doubt that, then they should ask our pages--these pages \nwho are sitting right down here--how often they sit down and write a \nletter or send a greeting card. Our colleagues should ask members of \ntheir own staff how often they pay their bills through the mail. We \nshould look at our own mail. In fact, when I asked my staff to do\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nthis, I said: Go back and look at 2001--my first year as a Senator--go \nback and see, if you look at the number of e-mails we got then and the \nnumber of letters we got then, what was the ratio? For roughly every 15 \nletters we got in 2001, we got 1 e-mail. I said: Go back and look at \n2011. They did. As it turned out, for every 1 letter we received last \nyear, we received about a dozen e-mails. Think of that.\n\n  The Federal Government itself is even contributing to this trend, and \nI think in a pretty big way. It was announced within the last week or \nso that the Social Security Administration, starting next year, will \nsend virtually all of its 73 million payments--I think that is each \nmonth--to Social Security recipients processed online through direct \ndeposit, not mailed out. That is us.\n  So even as the American people adjust to new communications \ntechnologies, many of us here in Congress expect the Postal Service to \ncontinue as if nothing has changed. But in these changing times, these \nchallenging times, we need to recognize that difficult choices need to \nbe made. It is not efficient or affordable to maintain a mail \nprocessing and delivery network built for the peak mail volumes of \nyears ago.\n  That said, many of my colleagues have legitimate concerns about the \nseverity and speed of the Postal Service's streamlining efforts. To \naddress those concerns, the managers' amendment that Senators \nLieberman, Collins, Brown, and I have put forward includes a number of \nsafeguards crafted to ensure that the changes that will occur in the \ncoming months and years are implemented in responsible ways--ways that \nare consistent with what I can describe as the Golden Rule: that we \nwould treat others the way we would want to be treated. That includes \ncustomers of the Postal Service, employees of the Postal Service, and \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  We also seek to provide assurances in our managers' amendment that \nthose who still rely largely on the Postal Service, including rural \ncustomers without access to broadband, will continue to have access to \nthe services they know and need in the years to come.\n  We also take steps in this bill with this managers' amendment to \nensure that this effort to save the Postal Service is not all about \nclosing facilities and cutting services. Recognizing that questionable \npolicy decisions made over the years regarding the Postal Service's \npension and health care obligations are part of the Postal Service's \nfinancial problems, we call for, in this managers' amendment, refunding \nthe more than $10 billion the Postal Service has overpaid into the \nFederal Employees Retirement System. A portion of that refund--that $10 \nbillion to $12 billion, whatever it turns out to be--would be used to \nencourage at least some of the 125,000 postal employees at or near \nretirement age today to retire now or within the next year or 2, saving \nthe Postal Service billions of dollars annually.\n  Let me back up for a moment. If you go back a decade or so ago, there \nwere roughly 900,000 men and women who worked for the Postal Service, \nfor us in the Postal Service. Today, there are 550,000 people who are \nemployees of the Postal Service. Out of that roughly 550,000 people, \n125,000 are eligible to retire. They are eligible to retire, and they \nhave not chosen to do so, despite the fact they are eligible.\n  One of the things the Postmaster General wants to do--and I believe \nour managers, those of us who are cosponsors, coauthors of this bill \nand the managers' amendment, want to do--is to encourage those folks to \nretire. Eighty percent of the Postal Service's costs are personnel \ncosts. To the extent we can continue to right-size this enterprise, \nenable it to right-size itself, given the market share from 550,000, \n500,000 down to maybe 450,000 in the next year or two--an enterprise \nwhere 80 percent of the cost is personnel--that helps get this \nenterprise back to a place where it is not bleeding money every day of \nevery week of every month of this year.\n  Today the Postal Service will lose--get this--$23 million. Today. And \ntoday, if you look at the amount of money the Postal Service owes to \nthe Treasury on its line of credit, it is roughly $13 billion--maybe \nmore than that for the line of credit that only goes up to $15 billion.\n  There is some controversy that flowed out of the 2006 legislation \nsigned by former President Bush. He insisted at the time that in order \nto sign that legislation, we in the Congress would have to agree to I \nthink maybe the most conservative approach to prefunding retiree health \nbenefits of any government agency or any business with which I have \never been associated. I used to be treasurer of my State government, \nand we began prefunding health benefits for retirees several years \nago--actually, right at the end of my second term as Governor--but \nnothing like this. We instituted that requirement in order to get \nPresident Bush to sign on to the bill at a time when the Postal Service \nwas in good shape. That was a very popular year, if you will, for the \nPostal Service, before the roof fell in and the economy went to heck in \na hand basket. But the Postal Service was in pretty good shape, very \ngood shape, so the taxpayers would not be saddled with those \nobligations in the event the Postal Service could not meet them in the \nyears to come.\n  President Bush's people said: Look, we will sign this bill. The \nPostal Service will not always be making money--as they were in 2006--\nand 10 or 15 years down the line when they are not doing so well, we \nwant to make sure that a large part of the health care benefits for \nretirees have been satisfied or paid for.\n  That is not an entirely bad idea. We did not know that we were going \nto enter the worst recession since the Great Depression in 2008. We did \nnot know we were going to lose 2.5 million jobs in the second half of \n2008 and we did not know were going to lose 2.5 million jobs in the \nfirst half of 2009, but we did. It put us in the tank and it put the \nPostal Service in the tank far quicker than anybody had a reasonable \nright to imagine.\n  But, in retrospect, the payment schedule put into place back then \nproved to be too aggressive once the bottom fell out of our economy in \n2008. Our managers' amendment scraps the schedule adopted in 2006 and \nreplaces it with a more realistic one that is based on what the Postal \nService actually owes. And that change, coupled with some others, \nincluding one that would better coordinate postal retirees' Medicare \nand Federal employee health benefits, would cut the Postal Service \nretiree health costs by more than half--not ignore them but cut them in \nhalf and put them on a more realistic time schedule.\n  Finally, our managers' amendment pushes the Postal Service to \nredouble its efforts to innovate, to redouble its efforts to develop \nnew products that can grow revenue going forward. There are some who \nwould argue that--let me dwell on that for just a moment. Frankly, \nsomewhere down the line--I don't if it will be a year from now or 5 \nyears from now or 10 years from now--a light will go on in somebody's \nhead, and they will say: You know, the Postal Service goes to every \ndoor in America five or six times a week. They are in every community \nin America. Why did we not think of a particular idea to enable them to \ncreate a new source of revenue or new sources of revenue?\n  I would like to mention some that are actually working. Flat rate \nboxes--if it fits, it ships. That is a great product. There is the \npartnership the Postal Service has with FedEx and UPS, delivered by the \nPostal Service the last mile or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 miles where Fed-Ex or \nUPS does not want go in many cases. That is a good way to make money, \nespecially if more people buy things, order things for themselves, for \ntheir families, for their loved ones over the Internet and have them \nshipped. The Postal Service can have a big piece of that business.\n  There are other ideas as well. Fed-Ex and UPS get to deliver wine and \nbeer. The Postal Service does not. We changed that in this legislation. \nThere are ideas dealing with electronic mail boxes. We will hear more \nabout those in the days to come. Other countries with postal services \nactually have used that as a way to provide a good service for their \npeople and for their businesses, and I think there is maybe an argument \nthat we should allow the Postal Service here to do that too.\n  Even further down the road and kind of out there in ideas, as the \nPresiding Officer knows in neighboring Pennsylvania--they do not have a \ncoastline,\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\nbut they are close to ours and to New Jersey--5, 6 years from now, we \nare going to have windmill farms off the coast of the United States, \nthe east coast from North Carolina, Virginia, all the way up to Maine. \nThey are going to be harvesting the wind, turning that wind into \nelectricity. Do you know what. The wind does not always blow, but there \nare times that it blows a lot more, and we are going to generate more \nelectricity than we can actually use on a particular day at a \nparticular hour. What are we going do with that electricity? Well, we \nare going to store it. And where are we going to store it? One of the \nplaces to store it is in the batteries of fleets of vehicles. Who has \none of the biggest fleets in America? The Postal Service. A lot of the \nvehicles in their fleet are like 25, even 30 years old. We have all of \nthese new vehicles coming to the market that are far more energy \nefficient to replace those old and in some cases dilapidated fleet \nvehicles in the Postal Service. The new vehicles, with their batteries, \ncan literally be a place to receive the electricity generated on a \nwindy day in the Atlantic, out in the Outer Continental Shelf, to store \nthat electricity and, when needed, put it back out on the grid, the \nelectric grid, to provide energy as needed across the Northeast and \nmid-Atlantic part of our Nation. That is an idea that is sort of out \nthere, but we need to be thinking boldly, and the Postal Service needs \nto be doing that.\n  I think one of the better pieces of our amendment--and this came from \nsome of the more progressive members of the Democratic Party here in \nthe Senate and kind of joined up with some of the more conservative \nfolks on the Republican side--but the idea is that the Postal Service \nneeds to be more entrepreneurial. They need to be more innovative.\n  When they come up with good ideas for making money, including the \nidea we talked about at lunch in the caucus we had today--how about \nvote by mail? In two States today--Oregon and Washington--they vote by \nmail. And what does that do to voter turnout? I think we were told by \nSenator Cantwell that in her State last year--2 years ago in the \nelection, they had 72-percent voter turnout. This year they are \nexpecting 84 percent voter turnout. I mean, this is a country in which \nwe are lucky to have 50 percent of the people who are eligible actually \nturn out to vote. And we can see what vote by mail can do in those two \nStates. They could be laboratories of democracy for our Nation, \nencourage voter turnout, maybe do it in a more cost-effective way and--\nget this--provide new sources of revenue, a great source of revenue for \nthe Postal Service. That is the sort of thing we need to kind in mind.\n\n  I don't think there is any one silver bullet, but I like to say there \nare a lot of silver BBs, and some of them are pretty big, and those \nmight be among them. There are ideas we have not even thought of yet \nthat we ought to do.\n  Let me just say--and I am getting fairly close to the end--that I \ndon't mean to suggest that what the managers' amendment--the underlying \nbill was reported out of committee by about a 9-to-1 vote. The \nmanagers' amendment, crafted by Senators Lieberman, Collins, Brown, and \nmyself, is not perfect. Very few things associated with my name have \never been perfect. But I will say this. One of my core values--some of \nyou have heard me say this maybe too many times--if it is not perfect, \nmake it better. If it is not perfect, make it better. And we have the \nopportunity to take what we believe is a managers' amendment which is \nan improvement over the original bill--we have the opportunity to make \nit better. I do not think in this case, they are not just Republican \nideas, they are not just Democratic ideas, they are not liberal ideas, \nthey are not conservative ideas, they are just better ideas. And my \nhope is that Members will have the opportunity in the days this week, \nin the days to come, to come to this floor and to offer their better \nideas.\n  I would plead with our colleagues, don't just come to the floor and \noffer amendments that have absolutely nothing to do with the Postal \nService. Please come to the floor to offer amendments that can help \nmake this bill better with respect to ensuring that we have a Postal \nService that is viable and solvent in the 21st century, that can meet \nour communications needs for individuals, for families, and for \nbusinesses.\n  We are not going through a fire drill here; this is an emergency. \nThis is an emergency. It is a huge challenge, but it is also an \nopportunity to get it right this time and hopefully, with a growing \neconomy, to maybe have a little bit of the wind to our backs.\n  We have to pass a bill. My hope is we can pass a bill with bipartisan \nsupport that is good underlying public policy so that when we end up in \n2016, the Postal Service won't be running daily losses of $22 million a \nday as they are today, that the Postal Service will have had an \nopportunity to use this refund they are owed by the Federal Employees \nRetirement System--$12 billion--to pay down much of their debt, maybe \nuse a little bit of that money to help incentivize some of the 125,000 \nPostal Service employees who are eligible to retire to go ahead and \nretire.\n  We can do this in a way--I know a bunch of our colleagues are \nconcerned. We hear it--Senator Lieberman and I, Senators Collins and \nBrown--from our colleagues already. They are concerned about rural post \noffices. Believe it or not, we have some of those in Delaware. We have \nsome of those in Connecticut and certainly in Maine, even some in \nMassachusetts. I think we have actually come up with a pretty good \napproach. And we appreciate very much the input of people such as Jon \nTester from Montana and Jerry Moran from Kansas, those Senators--one a \nDemocrat, one a Republican--to try to give us a better idea on how to \nmove forward on the post offices.\n  Let me just close with this. There are 33,000 post offices in \nAmerica, in communities across the country. A year or so ago, the \nPostal Service--the Postmaster General met with us and our committee, \nand he said: We have 3,700 of those post offices under review that we \nthink maybe should be closed--3,700.\n  There were at the time about 500 mail-processing centers across the \ncountry that the post office had for processing mail, and he said: We \nwould like to close about 300 of them. We would like to change the \nstandards for delivery for mail from 1 to 3 days to maybe 2 to 3 days.\n  Some were afraid it was going to slip from 2 to 3, to 2 to 4, even \nworse.\n  Where we have ended in this managers' amendment--I would say to \nfolks, my colleagues who are concerned about the impact that will have \non their rural post offices or their mail-processing centers, here is \nwhere we have ended. The Postal Service has pretty much backed off and \nsaid: We are not that much interested in closing 3,700 post offices or \n2,700 or 1,700 post offices.\n  What they really would like to do is this, and I think it is a \nsmarter, actually more cost-effective approach, more humane approach, \nand that is to say to communities across America: We have a post \noffice--or maybe the postmaster is making $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a \nyear and the post office is selling like $15,000 or $20,000 worth of \nstamps. Rather than close that post office, provide that community with \na menu of options. The menu of options would be to maybe keep the post \noffice open; say to the postmaster there who is eligible to retire: We \nwould like to incentivize you to retire. Here is a $25,000 bonus if you \nwill go ahead and retire. You can retire, receive your pension, be \neligible for benefits as a postal retiree, and come back and work on a \npart-time basis and run that post office for 2 hours a day, 4 hours a \nday, 6 hours a day, whatever the community feels meets their needs, \nmorning or afternoon, midafternoon, evening. And that retired \npostmaster can--that money they collect, they keep. They do not have to \nreduce their pension. That is just extra money they can make for \ncontinuing to provide the service. We still have the post office there. \nThe flag still flies in front of it. That is one option.\n  Another option might be, if the folks in the community want it, to \nput that post office in a supermarket. One of the supermarkets that are \nclose to my house in Delaware--they have a supermarket, they have a \npharmacy, and they have a bank. It turns out that one of our major \nnational chains of pharmacies, Walgreens--I was up visiting their \nheadquarters, their offices up in Chicago--I do not know if Chairman \nLieberman has been there, but the pharmacy of the future--they took me\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nto a couple of them--has a beautiful pharmacy. Part of it is a post \noffice. So you can see in places across the country whether it might \nmake sense to consolidate the post office in like a Walgreens or some \nother kind of pharmacy or convenience store. It might make sense to--\nsay you have a small town and they have like a townhall, that kind of \nthing. How about consolidating those buildings together with the post \noffice?\n  We have even heard of an idea like creating kind of an Internet cafe \nin places where they do not have broadband and see if we can't have in \nrural post offices--where folks who live in that community, in that \narea, do not have broadband access, maybe have it at the post office. \nThere are all kinds of ideas out there.\n  You know, on the mail-processing side, instead of closing 500 mail-\nprocessing centers across the country, the Postmaster General has come \nto us. We worked to maintain--not to go from 1- to 3-day service--from \nthat to a 2- to 3-day service or 2- to 4-day service, but to maintain \nkind of like a 1- to 3-day service--1 with an asterisk: The 1-day \nservice would be overnight service, next-day service in communities \nlike if they are in the same metropolitan area.\n  They were still getting next-day service. Outside of that \nmetropolitan area, they might. But in most cases it would be 2-day \nservice, and in no case would it be worse than 3-day service. By going \nto the modified service standard delivery, the Postal Service would \nhave to close 500 mail processing centers. It probably would be able to \nclose 150 and be able to offer incentives to employees to retire and \nthey could migrate to other jobs within the Postal Service. But I think \nit maybe would be a smarter way to move this large, old, but still \ngermane, relevant Postal Service into the 21st century.\n  I will close with this: This is not the time to kick the can down the \nroad. I have no interest in doing that. I know Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Brown and Senator Collins have no interest in doing that. This \nis the time to fix the problem. I would like to think we are smart \nenough in the Senate to fix this; that we are smart enough to work with \nthe House, with our staffs, a lot of good people--the folks at the \nPostal Service who work there, the unions, the customers, and a lot of \npeople in businesses all over the country together working on this. I \nthink we are smart enough to figure out how to solve this. We need to \ndo that.\n  Last thought: During the recess I mentioned to my colleagues and the \nPresiding Officer and Senator Lieberman during our caucus lunch, I \nsaid: I don't know what you guys did over the Easter recess, but I \ncovered Delaware. I love to do it. I go back there every night, but it \nis a great joy to reconnect with everybody. I also spent some time on \nthe phone and meeting with folks in businesses in Delaware and outside \nof Delaware who usually rely on the Postal Service.\n  Nationwide there are 7 million to 8 million people whose jobs are \nintegrated or part of or facilitated by our Postal Service--7 to 8 \nmillion jobs. We are coming out of the worst recession since before I \nwas born--before we were born. We need to get out of it. One of the \nbest ways to do that is to provide certainty and predictability for a \nlot of businesses. One way to do that is to pass postal reform \nlegislation that finishes the job we started 5, 6 years ago. We can do \nthat. We need to do that. I am encouraged that we will do that.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, whom I love working with--I \nthink we all do--for giving me a chance to work with him on this issue \nand for providing the great leadership he always does. Also, I say to \nSusan Collins who has just left the floor, it is a real privilege to \nwork with her.\n  Finally, we are blessed with wonderful staffs, wonderful people, as \nSenator Lieberman knows, John Kilvington and others who are part of my \nstaff, and Michael and the team who are part of Senator Lieberman's \nstaff, and Kate who works with Senator Collins. They have done great, \nhard work. We are privileged to be able to work with them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nDelaware, for his excellent statement on the bill and where we are in \nregard to the U.S. Postal Service. I thank him for what he has done \nover the last several years to try to save the U.S. Postal Service in a \nchanging environment and to lead the change.\n  No one in the Senate--I believe no one in the Congress--has worked \nharder over the last decade to reform the U.S. Postal Service than \nSenator Tom Carper. There is a way in which he has engaged in the kinds \nof problems that others try to get far away from. He sees an \ninstitution like the U.S. Postal Service and how important it is, he is \nchallenged by it, and he goes at it with all of his considerable \ncapabilities and persistence until he gets it right. I cannot thank him \nenough for doing that.\n  This is not the kind of issue on which one gains a lot of political \nadvantage. Again, it is a test of our government, a test of our \ncapacity to maintain public services that people depend upon in a \nchanging world. We all know--and he has been a leader--that e-mail is \naffecting the volume of mail. The post office has to change to stay not \nonly viable but strong. I think we are going to do it in this Congress, \nand nobody will deserve more credit for that than Senator Tom Carper. I \nam glad I had the chance to spontaneously offer that much deserved \ngratitude and praise to Senator Carper.\n  I say to my colleagues and staff who may be watching or listening--to \npick up a theme of Senator Carper and try to bring it home--there are \nsome amendments on both sides that ought to be aired out. I believe \nSenator Reid wants to do that and wants to create a process where \nrelevant amendments from both sides--not without limit but a good \nnumber of them--get to be debated on the Senate floor.\n  It is my understanding that both caucuses now are hotlining a request \nto Senate offices that if Senators have an amendment they want to \nintroduce on this postal reform bill, to let their respective \ncloakrooms know so that we can see what the universe is and then we can \nsee if we can work on an agreement where we alternate submitting \namendments and begin to get into the substance of the bill and move it \nto a point where we can actually adopt something.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Welcoming John Crown\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor today for \nhis first time on the Senate floor with John Crown, who works on our \nveterans affairs issues. He came from the Veterans Committee and joined \nour staff in the last couple of weeks. John Crown is a marine, did two \ntours of duty in Iraq, and we honor him for his service. He, it seems, \nwants to dedicate his life to serving people who also served their \ncountry, people of all ages and both genders and all ideologies and who \nserved their country anytime in the last several decades. I wanted to \nannounce his first visit to the Senate floor today.\n\n\n                        Doolittle Tokyo Raiders\n\n  Mr. President, 70 years ago this week, on April 18, 1942, 80 brave \nAmerican airmen volunteered for an extremely hazardous mission. The \nPresiding Officer, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, knows I like \nto come to the Senate floor and talk about history and honor people who \nhave played such an important role in our history. I want to talk about \nthese men. They were known as the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. They \naccepted their mission without knowing what it entailed. Their mission \nfollowed the attack on Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor happened, obviously, \nthe December before. It was our Nation's first offensive against \nJapanese soil in the Second World War, planned and led by Lt. Col. \nJimmy Doolittle.\n  The mission was risky from the outset. It was the first time the Army \nAir\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nCorps and Navy collaborated on a tactical mission, flying 16 B 25 \nMitchell bombers from the deck of the USS Hornet, a feat never \nattempted before. The morning of the raid, the USS Hornet encountered \nJapanese ships 170 miles from the prearranged launch point. Fearing \nthat the mission might be compromised, the Raiders proceeded to launch \n170 miles earlier than anticipated. By departing 650 miles from their \nintended target, these men accepted the risk they might not have enough \nfuel to make it beyond the Japanese lines to occupied China. Accepting \nthis choice meant the raiders would almost certainly have to crash land \nor bail out, either above Japanese-occupied China or even over the home \nislands in Japan. Any survivors, they knew, would certainly be \nsubjected to imprisonment or torture or death.\n  After reaching their targets, 15 of the bombers continued to China \nwhile the 16th, dangerously low on fuel, headed to Russia. The total \ndistance traveled by the Raiders averaged 2,250 nautical miles over 13 \nhours, making it the longest combat mission ever flown in a B 25 bomber \nduring the war.\n  Of the 80 Raiders who were launched that day, 8 were captured. Of \nthese eight prisoners, three were executed, one died of disease, and \nfour of these prisoners returned home after the end of the war. Of the \noriginal 80 Raiders, 5 are still with us today and they are celebrating \nthis week the 70th anniversary in Dayton, OH, honoring their fellow \nRaiders who are no longer with them. As they gather this week, I am \nproud to submit this resolution with my colleagues from both parties \nand from each State where these men reside. It is my pleasure to have \nSenator Hutchison from Texas, Senator Murray from Washington State, \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee, Senator Tester from Montana, and \nSenator Baucus, also from Montana, and Senator Nelson as my cosponsors. \nIt is my sincere privilege especially to have Senators Inouye and \nLautenberg, both veterans of the war, as cosponsors, too.\n  As the Raiders gather this week, these five men will also honor other \nheroes--this is what is perhaps even as interesting as the first part--\nthe Chinese citizens who cared for, protected, and enabled them to \nsurvive in a foreign land, a very foreign land to these American men. A \nChinese delegation is coming to Dayton for the reunion. Among the \ndelegation is a man whose father helped carry injured Raiders to safety \nand even nursed one Raider to health. I would be certain they could not \ntalk to each other in a common language. They had never seen anybody \nlike the other one. Yet one, a Chinese, helped this American airman.\n  It is only fitting we recognize this week's anniversary and commend \nthe 5 living members and the 75 deceased members of the Doolittle Tokyo \nRaiders for their heroism on that day. It is fitting to remember the \ncompassion shown to the Raiders by the Chinese villagers they \nencountered.\n  The Senate resolution is our humble attempt to show our gratitude. \nThe valor, skill, and courage shown by the Raiders proved invaluable to \nthe eventual defeat of Japan during the Second World War. Today, these \nmen, with their Chinese friends, remind us that quiet decency and \nuncommon valor in the face of sure danger, however rare, are traits \nthat know no limit.\n\n\n                           The Auto Industry\n\n  Mr. President, the last 2 weeks most Members of the Senate were back \nin their States talking--I hope listening more than talking and \nlearning more than perhaps talking--and learning about issues and \nproblems they were seeing and hearing in their State. I was in Ohio, \nfrom Ashtabula to Parma to Zanesville, to meet with Ohioans to discuss \nways to get our economy back on track.\n  Too many Ohioans are struggling as too many people in Pennsylvania \nare struggling. Many are still looking for work. Others have seen their \nwages cut or their hours reduced, but from Chillicothe to Toledo, from \nPortsmouth to Mansfield, there are signs of recovery as our \nmanufacturers, especially auto suppliers, but much more than that, and \nsome of the small businesses supplying these companies, are beginning \nto show real signs of growth.\n  Few places are more symbolic of this than a company called American \nManufacturing, located in Toledo. Three years ago the auto industry, as \nwe know, was on the verge of collapse, threatening to take down with it \nthousands of auto parts suppliers. American Manufacturing got down to \nfour employees. They had had 125. They supplied container crates, metal \ncontainer crates, for the auto industry. It had once been 125, down to \n4 employees.\n  President Bush tried but was blocked, mostly by Republicans in the \nSenate, his own party members, to do a bridge loan and assistance for \nthe auto industry. President Obama, with a strong Democratic majority, \nover the opposition of many Republicans--although some Republicans in \nmy part of the country, the industrial areas around Ohio, including \nOhio, were supportive--was able to rescue this industry. We knew that \nrescuing the auto industry was way more than about helping Chrysler and \nGeneral Motors. We knew it mattered, not just for those large companies \nand their workers, it mattered for Johnson Controls, it mattered for \nMagnam, it mattered for small companies such as American Manufacturing \nin Toledo, companies that depended on the auto industry.\n  In fact, estimates are that 800,000 people in Ohio are in the auto \nindustry one way or the other; directly or indirectly they work for \nauto companies. Forty-eight of these 800,000-plus jobs were depending \non Congress moving forward in early 2009, doing the right thing. The \ndecision was not popular. There were all kinds of naysayers. There is \nno question now that it was a success. A number of people--from \nGovernor Romney to lots of people around the country and lots of \nconservative politicians in Washington--said we can structure it. But \nlet the companies go into bankruptcy and then let them put the \nfinancing together to come out of bankruptcy. The only problem was that \nnobody--from Bain Capital to First National Bank--was willing to loan \nmoney to these two behemoths, Chrysler and GM, because they were in \nsuch a terrible situation and had such terrible problems.\n\n  So what happened? The government loaned the money. Much of that money \nis paid back and things are better. But let's not forget that in \nJanuary of 2009, when President Obama took office, we were losing \n800,000 jobs a month. Our economy was in freefall, and this was the \ntime the auto industry was going down. To stop the bleeding, one of the \nthings we did was unlock the frozen credit market for small businesses \nand manufacturers through the Small Business Administration. Through \nthese SBA loans, we saw a new local bank that had only been around for \na handful of years in Toledo, OH, step up, invest capital in American \nManufacturing, which is in Toledo, and this company is now about to \nhire its 100th person. This company is successful now because of the \nauto rescue, and it is successful because of the Small Business \nAdministration coming out of the Recovery Act and having enough money \nto guarantee loans not with a Wall Street bank but a local community \nbank to get this company on its feet.\n  Even with all of this we are seeing that the auto rescue is working, \nand we know two terrific examples of how it is working in my State. The \nChevy Cruze is assembled in Youngstown, OH. My 28-year-old daughter \ndrives a Chevy Cruze. The Chevy Cruze probably would not exist today if \nit were not for the auto rescue, and here is what it means to Ohio: The \nengine is made in Defiance, OH; the bumper is made in Northwood, OH; \nthe transmission is made in Toledo, OH; the sound system is made in \nSpringboro, OH; the steel comes out of Middletown, which is in Butler \nCounty, OH; the aluminum comes out of Cleveland, OH; the stamping is \ndone in Parma, OH; and the assembly is done in Lordstown, OH.\n  Look at the Jeep Wrangler. The Jeep Wrangler was assembled in Toledo \nprior to the auto rescue, but only 50 percent of the parts for the Jeep \nWrangler were made in the United States. Today there are more people \nworking at Wrangler, producing more cars--still assembled in Ohio--yet \ninstead of 50 percent, 75 percent of the parts now come from companies \nin the United States made by workers in the United States.\n  What we are now seeing as the auto industry begins to grow and the \nauto rescue was so clearly the right thing to do--thank God the Senate \nand the House didn't listen to the naysayers. In spite of that, we are \nstill seeing huge trade deficits with China in auto parts.\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\n  Ten years ago our trade deficit with China and auto parts was a $1 \nbillion. That meant we bought about $1 billion in car parts from China \nmore than we sold to China. That was 10 years ago. Today that number \nhas grown to almost $10 billion.\n  The first President George Bush said a $1 billion trade deficit, \nmeaning we bought $1 billion more than we sold to another country, \ntranslated to about 13,000 jobs. Do the math. Today the bilateral trade \ndeficit between the United States and China on auto parts alone is $10 \nbillion.\n  We are seeing it in other things. We see it in auto, we see it in \nsolar, and we see that China uses unfair subsidies. They subsidize \nwater, they subsidize energy, they subsidize land, they subsidize \ncredit, and on top of that they have a currency advantage because they \nmanipulate the currency.\n  Sitting idly by is not an option. My colleagues on both sides of the \naisle understand that. That is why my China currency manipulation \nbill--the biggest bipartisan bill to pass the Senate in 2011 by more \nthan 70 votes--costs the taxpayers nothing, but it levels the playing \nfield so China cannot manipulate its currency and cheat in \ninternational trade. As I said, that legislation passed with 70 votes.\n  A recently released report shows that if this Congress--meaning the \nHouse of Representatives down the hall--would pass this and send it to \nthe President's desk, and if the President signs it, that by addressing \nthe China currency manipulation it could support the creation of 2.2 \nmillion American jobs without adding a dime to the deficit. In fact, it \nwould be the opposite.\n  If we take 2 million people who are now unemployed and put them in \nmanufacturing jobs making $15, $20, $25 an hour, we would clearly see \nthe deficit shrink. More people would be back on the payroll paying \ntaxes and contributing to their communities.\n  It is time to take bold action. It is time to stand up on China \ncurrency. I appreciate the support of my colleagues in the Senate on \nthe China currency bill. Time is running out in the House. I am hopeful \nthe House of Representatives passes this bill too. It is time we put \nAmerican workers and American manufacturing companies first.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Kenneth Hall\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to mark and \ncelebrate the career of a Louisiana native who is a very dear friend of \nmine and someone who is admired by literally thousands if not millions \nof people in Texas and around the world. That gentleman is Dr. Kenneth \nHall.\n  Next week Dr. Hall will retire after almost two decades of leadership \nat Buckner International, which is one of the world's outstanding \nnonprofit organizations formed many years ago in Texas. Dr. Hall served \nas only the fifth president in over 120 years. After his retirement as \npresident in 2010, he has continued to serve as CEO of this fine \norganization.\n  Buckner, as it is known, is a global Christian ministry that does \nextraordinary work with vulnerable children and families throughout \nTexas and other places in the United States and recently expanded \ninternationally. They helped run self-sufficiency programs, community \ntransformation programs, education, job readiness training, and \nafterschool programs for vulnerable children. Remarkably, I have seen \ntheir work both in downtown Dallas, TX, as well as out in remote \nvillages in Ethiopia, and the quality and expertise is identical and it \nis heartwarming.\n  The causes of vulnerable children both here and overseas is \nsomething, of course, that is extremely close to my heart. I spent a \ngood bit of time in the Senate working with my colleagues on issues \nthat advance their welfare, and it has been my privilege and honor to \nknow Dr. Hall over the past several years.\n\n  He was born in Louisiana, earned his BA from the University of Texas \nat Tyler. He earned a master of divinity and doctor of ministry degrees \nfrom Southwest Baptist Theological Cemetery in Fort Worth.\n  Before his career started at Buckner, he served as pastor of four \nchurches in Texas. He has been married for many years and has a \nbeautiful family--his wife Linda and their two married children and \ntheir grandchildren.\n  I want to say a brief word about Buckner itself. It was founded over \n135 years ago when a Baptist minister, R.C. Buckner, started an \norphanage with an initial donation of $27. As the story goes, he \nliterally took off his hat, put a dollar in it, and passed it around to \nthe ministers present, and with $27 started the first orphanage west of \nthe Mississippi to help the children who were coming on those orphan \ntrains across our Nation. They took them off of those trains and gave \nthem homes and families.\n  The organization has grown since then, but under Dr. Hall's \nleadership Buckner expanded to include more than $200 million in \ncapital improvements and an endowment of more than $200 million. As I \nsaid, he worked to expand Buckner's reach overseas.\n  I had the pleasure of traveling with him to Ethiopia recently, and I \nwitnessed firsthand the incredible work and his personal passion for \nhelping families become more self-sufficient, maintaining children in \ntheir birth family groups, and helping to literally transform \ncommunities with this special Buckner touch.\n  So it has been said before: To be who you are and become what you are \ncapable of is the only goal worth living. It is my hope that Dr. Hall \nwill continue to achieve his goal in this life. We will miss him, his \nselfless service, and his dedication. We honor him today in the Senate \nfor over two decades of service to one of the Nation's best nonprofit \nfaith-based organizations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow my colleague \nfrom Louisiana because I am rising this evening to talk about a bill \nshe has put an enormous amount of effort into, and she has had a very \nsignificant role in the success of the bill that I am going to talk \nabout. We have a bill in Congress that is perhaps the most significant \njobs bill that will be able to pass in this session. It is described as \nproducing 2.9 million jobs--nearly 3 million jobs.\n  Rhode Island is a relatively small State, but it means 9,000 jobs in \nthe State of Rhode Island. We have about 60,000 people out of work \nright now in Rhode Island; 9,000 would take a significant number of \nthose folks and enable them to get to work.\n  It is a serious jobs bill. It also went through a completely \nimpeccable process in the Senate. It passed out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee with the strong support of our chairman, Barbara \nBoxer, and the equally strong support of her ranking member, Senator \nInhofe of Oklahoma. They come from quite different political \npersuasions, but they were together on this bill and it passed \nunanimously out of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\n  It came to the floor. We had a completely open process on the floor. \nIt spent 5 weeks on this floor being discussed, debated, and amended. \nIt was quite thoroughly amended. There were more than 40 amendments \nthat were either voted on or accepted while it was on the floor. So \nfrom a process point of view, it was exactly what everybody hopes for \nin a piece of legislation. It passed out of the Senate with 74 Senators \nvoting for it; a 75th who would have voted for it but had to be away in \nhis home State. So the final tally, in effect, would be 75 to 22--a \nlandslide, bipartisan vote; a jobs bill that passed with an impeccable \nlegislative process and produced a landslide bipartisan bill.\n  What is that bill? It is the highway bill. It is a bill we have been \nworking on now in Congress since the days of the Federal highway system \nunder President Eisenhower. It is not complicated, everybody \nunderstands it, and 3 million jobs depend on its passage.\n  Unfortunately, it is snarled up, for reasons that are hard to \nexplain, over\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nin the House of Representatives. The Speaker has not called up this \nbipartisan, very well regarded Senate bill. It has support outside this \ninstitution from everybody from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the \nLaborers' International Union. It has environmental support. This is a \nbill that is not being held up in the House because there is an \nimportant interest that was overlooked or that is an adversary to it. \nIt is being held up for, I don't know, I would say Washington insider \nreasons having to do with the politics of the House of Representatives. \nSo when there are 3 million jobs at stake, that is a real shame.\n  It started to be noticed by, for instance, the ratings agencies. \nStandard & Poor's just published on April 2 a report entitled \n``Increasingly Unpredictable Federal Funding Could Stall U.S. \nTransportation Infrastructure Projects.'' When we stall U.S. \ntransportation infrastructure projects, we kill jobs. That is what is \nhappening.\n  Here is how they describe it: Currently, the surface transportation \nbill remains mired in uncertainty. Holdups in funding reauthorizations \nand/or significant cuts in infrastructure programs are delaying some \nprojects and forcing others to be scaled back.\n  Delaying some projects means taking away jobs. Forcing others to be \nscaled back means taking away jobs.\n  Here is what happened, as they describe it: With the March 31 \nexpiration of the highway trust fund looming, Congress passed on March \n29--last minute--yet another extension to fund U.S. highway programs. \nThis latest continuing resolution--the ninth--provides funding through \nJune 30, 2012. As construction season begins in the northern half of \nthe country, this continuing uncertainty in funding could force States \nto delay projects rather than risk funding changes or political \ngridlock come July.\n  That is exactly what is happening in Rhode Island and in many other \nStates. I was home over our recess and met with our very capable \ndirector of transportation Michael Lewis, who has served under \nRepublican and Independent administrations. He said: Sheldon, I have a \nlist of all the projects we want to get done this summer, in the summer \nhighway construction season. We can't build highways in the winter in \nRhode Island and in much of the country so the work has to be done in \nthe summer construction season. He said: Here is my list if we have to \nlive with this extension. If we don't find out until maybe July 4 what \nkind of money we actually have to build these projects, he said, I \ncan't take chances. I have to start dropping projects off my list. \nEvery one of the projects that falls off his list represents jobs. \nEvery project that falls off his list is an unemployed Rhode Islander. \nHe estimated there would be 1,000 unemployed Rhode Islanders because of \nthis extension to June 30. So when people say: Oh, we have extended the \nhighway program until June 30, don't buy it. That is not a neutral act. \nThat is a harmful act. That costs 100,000 jobs just in Rhode Island. So \nif it is extended further, the problem gets even worse. We cannot \ntolerate these continued extensions. We have to get action on a long-\nterm authorization.\n  To go back to the Standard & Poor's report, here is what they said: \nOnce a long-term reauthorization is approved, we believe it will \nprovide an impetus for transportation agencies to reconsider high-\npriority projects that had been shelved because of lack of funding.\n  Those high-priority projects that had been shelved because of lack of \nfunding, when they get taken off the shelf and put into the street, \nthat is jobs. That is why this is a 3-million jobs bill, nearly. But \nthey say, if the authorization is extended by even more continuing \nresolutions, such high-priority projects will remain in limbo.\n  I intend to come to the floor as often as I can. I know there are \nother colleagues who want to come to the floor. We want to come every \nday. We want to set up a daily drumbeat of attention to the fact that a \n3-million jobs bill is being held hostage in the House of \nRepresentatives by the Republican Speaker for political Washington \ninsider reasons that have nothing to do with the merits. This is a bill \nthat everybody is for. We will continue to urge the Speaker to take up \nthe bipartisan, fully paid for, widely supported, very well legislated \nSenate MAP 21 highway bill. Three million jobs depend on it. I am here \nto urge the Speaker to please do his job.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Gladly.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Did the Senator have an opportunity today--because I \nhad a group from Louisiana in my office on the same subject, and I \nappreciate the Senator's leadership. The group was the American \nEngineering Society that was in Washington today. I don't know if the \nSenator had an opportunity to meet with such a group, but have other \ngroups come by the Senator's office to express, as this group did, \ntheir utter frustration with Congress's inability to get such a basic \npiece of legislation through? Did they tell the Senator the same thing \nthey told me, which is: Senator, when engineers are not working in \nAmerica, no one is working. We are the ones who are designing the \nprojects to be built. If we are not designing them, they are not going \nto be built. If we don't get this Transportation bill passed for a \nlonger period of time, we will not be going back to work.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding when he meets with groups in his \noffice?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, exactly. I have met with the Rhode Island road \nbuilders who are concerned about where the work is going to be and how \nmuch of it is going to get done. As I said in my earlier remarks, I met \nwith the State director of transportation. I have met with the mayor of \nour capital city, which has a very significant highway construction \nproject that needs to get done in that city that would provide an \nenormous number of jobs in that city at a time when Rhode Island still \nhas over 10 percent unemployment. So we need these jobs.\n  That project needs to be done. That infrastructure is crumbling. It \nis a land bridge that goes through the city above other roads. It is I \n95. It is our main artery for the entire Northeast, and it is in such \npoor shape that they have had to put planks across, between the I-beams \nthat hold up the roadway and the planks are there so that the pieces of \nroadway that are falling in don't land on the cars driving by on the \nroads underneath. Amtrak, the main rail artery for the Northeast, goes \nright under the same highway, the same deal. They have the planks up \noverhead to keep the roadway from falling on the trains below.\n  So this is an urgent matter. It certainly involves the road \nconstruction industry, but it is everybody who wants jobs and economic \ndevelopment that is around this infrastructure. It is the mayors who \nare concerned about it and, frankly, it is the people who drive over \nthese highways and want to know--these roads are 50 years old. It is \ntime to rebuild. Let's get on with it. This shouldn't be complicated.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. As the Senator from Rhode Island said, he had 9,000 \njobs at risk in Rhode Island. We have 26,700 jobs at risk in Louisiana. \nThis is a very significant deal and challenge for all our States.\n  We don't have the trouble of the winter and the summer but, \nunfortunately, Louisiana does have one of the largest percentages of \nbridges that are deficient in the Nation. We also, because we have to \nbuild on such soft and unsettling lands, need to have repair money \nreadily available so people can evacuate in times of hurricanes and \nnatural disasters. We have been working--and the Senator may be \nfamiliar with the area because he has friends and relatives in our \nState--on the I 49 south and I 49 north but particularly I 49 south \nthat connects New Orleans to Lafayette in a loop around south \nLouisiana, which is America's energy coast that is so important for not \nonly saving those wetlands and that great industry of fisheries but \nalso supporting oil and gas production. That highway is yet to be built \nin a nation that depends on the resources we send to the Senator's \nState and to other parts of the Nation.\n  So I feel the same as the Senator from Rhode Island. I can't, for the \nlife of me, figure out why the House will not move with more quick \naction to pass a longer term bill. Maybe if they can get just anything \nout of the House, we could get to conference and start negotiating some \nthings that might be better than a 3-month short-term authorization \nwhich I hear nothing but\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\ncomplaints about from everyone. I hear complaints from the left, the \nenvironmental movement, to the right, the business community. They say: \nSenator, we can't live with these short-term authorizations. We need 2 \nyears. We need 3 years. We need 5 years. We need something we can build \non, count on, budget for, and depend on; otherwise, it is too \nexpensive. It starts and stops projects. We have to lay off a crew and \nhire them the next day or we can't place our orders in an efficient \nfashion. The Senator from Rhode Island knows we just raise the cost of \nall the projects. So why would the House claim to want to be so \nfiscally conservative but act in such a way that is the opposite, that \nis making all these projects more expensive?\n  I think the Senator from Rhode Island is absolutely correct. I will \njoin him on the floor, and I hope our colleagues will come to this \nfloor every night and say it is time to pass this Transportation bill. \nIt is time to help Colorado, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Rhode Island to \nget people back to work and to fix this crumbling infrastructure.\n  Nine is enough. The cat has nine lives. This cat has run out of \nopportunities. This is the ninth short-term authorization. We have to \nmove to a more long-term, sustainable infrastructure plan for America. \nThis is truly an embarrassment, I have to say to my friend.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership, and \nI will join him in subsequent evenings on the floor to raise this issue \nand explain to the American public not the inside baseball or the \ninside politics but to explain what is the most important thing about \nthis, which is we need the jobs and we need them now.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the tenacity of \nthe Senator from Louisiana on this subject. It is a characteristic of \nhers, but it is always a good thing to be her teammate and have that \ntenacity deployed on this side. I am delighted she is here. As Senator \nLandrieu said, she has bridges that are deficient. One in five Rhode \nIsland bridges is deemed to be structurally deficient. One in five \nhighways is in mediocre condition. This is work that needs to be done. \nThe American Society of Engineers gives our infrastructure on average a \nD rating. That is the trouble we are in, and we can't sort this out.\n  I intend to urge as many of my colleagues as I can to come to the \nfloor, and I hope we get the floor covered by some of our colleagues on \na literally daily basis until we get this resolved. We need to point \nout the places where jobs are falling off around the country because \nthis wasn't done, where people are getting laid off around the country \nbecause this isn't getting done. There is a direct link between \nconstruction jobs not getting put on the list, funds not getting put \nout for those jobs and folks not getting employed. In this economy, we \ncan't afford that, and we certainly can't afford it for internal \ninsider Washington, DC, reasons.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2386-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Temple Sinai in Reno, NV, \nwhich has stood for 50 years as a place of worship for the Jewish \npeople of northern Nevada. It is comprised of approximately 120 \nhouseholds who come together to form a strong community where the \nJewish faith is celebrated. Temple Sinai has been a consistent presence \nfor Reform Judaism in northern Nevada, a place where Jewish teaching, \ntradition, and spiritual inquiry is nurtured.\n  The important 50th anniversary, ``Shanah Shel Zahav'' in Hebrew, or \nGolden Year, is testament to the resiliency of the Temple Sinai \ncongregation. It traces its humble beginnings to a small group of \nReform Jewish residents in Reno offering High Holy Day services, soon \nexpanding to Sabbath Services and Bar/Bat Mitzvah training. Many of \nthese sacred rituals were performed in the private homes of \ncongregation members who realized the importance of building a \nsanctuary. It is through their sacrifice and determination that this \nholy place of worship was built.\n  Temple Sinai has had many homes since its founding 50 years ago. \nInitially located in the Virginia City Room of the Masonic Temple in \ndowntown Reno, the Temple was forced to find a new location after a \ndevastating fire. Temple Sinai congregants then came together to offer \nthe skills and capital necessary to construct a permanent location. \nGround broke in February 1970, and the Temple has continued to grow \nsince then, adding classrooms, a social hall, and a library. As \nrecently as 2008, Temple Sinai expanded the available space and updated \nthe Temple for the 21st century.\n  I have personally experienced the welcoming warm hospitality of \nTemple Sinai. I was honored to share in a Shabbat dinner with members \nof the Temple, as well as attend Evolution Weekend. In visiting the \ncongregation over the years, I have always been impressed by the rich \nspiritual life and intellectual openness exhibited there.\n  I would like to congratulate Temple Sinai for its important role in \nbringing Reform Judaism to northern Nevada and on its important 50th \nanniversary. While I cannot be in Reno to share in their celebration, I \nwould be remiss if I did not offer my words of support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2386-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2386-S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAN GILBERT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to honor Ms. Jan Gilbert, who has \nspent more than 30 years dedicated to the advocacy of income equality, \nhuman rights, and women's health. Ms. Gilbert will be retiring from her \ncurrent position at the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, \nPLAN, in May and has been named by the White House as a Champion of \nChange. Today, I am proud to honor her service and leadership as an \nadvocate for a just and fair Nevada.\n  Jan Gilbert's work in Nevada began in 1982, serving Nevada's \ncommunities through the League of Women Voters of Nevada as president \nof the Carson City chapter, empowering citizens to become active \nparticipants in their government. Jan's commitment to lifting \ncommunities prompted her to cofound PLAN, an important organization \nthat offers a cohesive force for social, environmental, and economic \njustice in Nevada. Jan spearheaded critical reports on civil rights, \nboth in 2009 and 2011; she authored the Legislative Report Card on \nRacial Equity: Facing Race; and coauthored the 2002 Wider Opportunities \nfor Women's Self Sufficiency Standard for Nevada. She also served as \nthe cofounder of Nevada's Empowered Women's Project, representing low-\nincome women.\n  Ms. Gilbert has been instrumental in promoting social justice among \nNevadans as the chair of the Child Abuse Prevention, Respite and Family \nSupport Subcommittee of the Nevada Department of Health and Human \nServices. Everyone who works with Jan is touched by her contagious \nspirit and smile. Throughout the years, her noble efforts have been \nrecognized by a number of distinguished awards, including the Mike \nO'Callaghan Humanitarian of the Year Award, the Hannah Humanitarian \nAward, the Public Citizen of the Year Award, and the Women's Role Model \nAward.\n  I am pleased to stand today to recognize the indelible mark she has \nleft on Nevada in making it a more just place for all. I congratulate \nJan and her family on a well-earned retirement. PLAN is losing a giant, \nbut I am sure her love for service and helping those in need will \ncontinue to benefit the Silver State in new ways.\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2387-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PIERRON TACKES\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, today I wish to \ncelebrate and honor the service of Dr. Susan Randall upon her \nretirement as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Children.\n  Dr. Randall's career began in education. She spent 2 years in \nCenterville, SD, as a high school English and speech teacher. Susan \ncontinued her commitment to young people by going on to work in higher \neducation, teaching sociology. She entered the political realm after a \nsuccessful bid for Sioux Falls city commissioner, a position she held \nfrom 1986 to 1988. After her time at city hall, Dr. Randall worked for \nTurnabout, a community organization serving South Dakota's \nunderprivileged children and families. She furthered her dedication to \nthe youth of South Dakota by volunteering with South Dakota Voices for \nChildren, using her expertise to help them to secure grants. In 1999, \nDr. Randall became the executive director of the organization.\n  Dr. Randall's 13-year tenure as executive director of South Dakota \nVoices for Children has been marked by many victories. She fought \ntenaciously to reduce teen smoking, with great success; initiated a \ncampaign in support of Starting Strong, a prekindergarten pilot program \nfor low-income children; and spearheaded an effort to improve \nconditions for juvenile offenders. Dr. Randall was recognized as a \nchampion for South Dakota youth by the Associated School Boards of \nSouth Dakota with their Bell Award, the highest honor that can be \nconferred on a non-school board member. Throughout her career Dr. \nRandall has been a tireless advocate for South Dakota's youth. I \ngreatly value her advocacy and expertise and she has frequently met \nwith me and my staff over the years, keeping me apprised of the most \npressing issues facing South Dakota's children.\n  Dr. Randall and her husband Mark Sanderson plan to start a business \ngrowing herbs and flowers on their 80-acre property in Brookings County \nunder the name Deer Creek Farms. I am pleased to hear that in \nretirement Susan will fulfill this long-held dream.\n  Dr. Randall has been a determined fighter for the health and well-\nbeing of South Dakota's children. I wish Dr. Randall all the best in \nretirement and the new business venture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2387-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING THE FERRIS STATE BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we in Michigan love hockey, at all \nlevels, from the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL to early mornings spent \nat local rinks watching our kids in youth league games. But even in \nMichigan, at the start of the men's college hockey season last winter, \nfew eyes were on Big Rapids, MI, where Coach Bob Daniels was preparing \nfor his 20th season leading the Ferris State Bulldogs.\n  In a preseason poll, the Bulldogs were ranked ninth in the 11-team \nCentral Collegiate Hockey Association. Ferris State had made it to the \nNCAA tournament only once in its history. And even in our home State, \nhockey teams from the larger schools tend to get more attention than \nthe team in Big Rapids. But the players at Ferris, a campus of fewer \nthan 15,000 students in a town of just over 10,000 residents, were \ndetermined to let neither history nor expectations get in their way. \nThey just started winning--eight games in a row to start the season, in \nfact, on the way to the CCHA regular season championship, two weeks as \nthe No. 1-ranked team in the nation, 23 victories and a berth in the \nNCAA tournament.\n  Despite a phenomenal regular season, few picked the Bulldogs to go \nfar in the NCAA tournament. Experts pointed to the fact that the team \nhad no players who had been drafted by the professional teams in the \nNational Hockey League, one of only three teams in the 16-school field \nwithout an NHL draftee. Top-rated Boston College, for example, had \nnine. But by now, exceeding expectation was nothing new. The Bulldogs \ndefeated the University of Denver, and then Cornell, each by a single \ngoal, to reach the Frozen Four in Tampa.\n  In the national semifinals, Ferris State was locked in a tight match \nwith Union College. The Bulldogs were behind 1 0 late in the second \nperiod when senior Aaron Schmitt scored to tie the game, and it \nremained tied until just under five minutes remained in the third and \nfinal period, when junior Kyle Bonis scored the go-ahead goal.\n  That victory set up a championship match with Boston College, the \nodds-on favorite for the championship. The Eagles had outscored their \nopponents in three previous tournament games by a combined 12 goals to \n1. Again, few gave Ferris a chance.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mary Mack, a \nveteran of World War II.\n  Mary was born in Butte, MT and graduated from Girls Central High \nSchool before attending Sacred Heart School of Nursing in Spokane, WA.\n  Sixty-eight years ago, Mary enlisted in the Army as a registered \nnurse. She was assigned to the 203rd General Field Hospital. Her \nmission was to provide medical support for troops staged in England as \nthey prepared for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe in Operation \nOverlord on June 6, 1944. One month after the invasion, Mary, along \nwith the 203rd Field Hospital, crossed the English Channel and arrived \nat Utah Beach in Normandy, France. From there they traveled on foot \npast scenes of war and destruction to set up a hospital for troops as \nthey continued on into Europe. After the liberation of Paris in late \nAugust 1944, the 203rd established the largest general hospital in the \nEuropean Theater of Operations in the French capital. There they \ntreated over 65,000 patients.\n  While stationed in Paris, Mary achieved the rank of First Lieutenant. \nShe later served in Africa and the Middle East.\n  Mary was honorably discharged from the Army on January 7, 1946. \nBecause honors were made known toward the end of the war, many members \nof the 203rd may not have been aware of their eligibility or received \ntheir awards.\n  After the war, she returned to Montana where she committed herself to \nraising a family and serving her community.\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\n  Mary passed away last month on March 15. I had the honor of \npresenting Mary's family with a European-African-Middle Eastern \nCampaign Medal with 3 Bronze Service Stars. This decoration represents \nthe gratitude of the Nation she served and the wish that her family \ncontinues to share the memories of this courageous woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2388-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DALE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I would like to honor \nthe life of an extraordinary Coloradan, Dale L. Johnson, who passed \naway at his Boulder home on February 23, 2012. Known as a legendary \nmountaineer, businessman, writer, environmentalist, and a dear friend \nof mine, Dale taught us all to appreciate life, and to take advantage \nof life's opportunities and challenges especially those on the \nmountain.\n  Infamously, one of Dale's early mountain escapades occurred while he \nwas a freshman at the University of Colorado. Unsatisfied that the \nColorado School of Mines had an ``M'' painted into a neighboring \nmountain and that the University of Colorado had no such ``C'' painted \ninto the neighboring Flatirons, Dale and his roommates sought to change \nthat.\n  Under the glow of a full Moon on a mild December night, Dale and his \nfriends, equipped with a 4-inch paint brush and 3 gallons of white \npaint, ventured up the Third Flatiron and infamously painted a giant \nwhite ``C'' into the ridge. While classmates celebrated the prank, the \nlocal authorities did not find the act amusing. Ultimately, the matter \nwas resolved, but the story has never grown old.\n  For those of us fortunate enough to have known Dale, we know how \npassionate he was about climbing. In fact, passionate would be an \nunderstatement. Dale pioneered seven first ascents, including the \nRedgarden Wall in Eldorado Canyon, the Second Buttress of the North \nFace of Hallett's Peak, and the South Face of the Matron.\n  While these achievements would suffice for your typical climber, Dale \nwasn't satisfied. Through his life, Dale climbed peaks in New Zealand, \nPeru, Nepal, East Africa, Japan, Italy, and Switzerland. As if his \nworldly travel and climbing achievements were not enough, Dale famously \nclimbed the Third Flatiron in Boulder, CO in roller skates.\n  After summiting peaks throughout Colorado and the world, Dale honed \nin on his inner businessman, inventing Frostline Kits for climbers. \nWith firsthand knowledge of the gear and clothing needs of climbers, \nDale developed innovative equipment that was durable, lightweight, and \ndependable. The kits were an instant success and delivered a product \nthat was previously unavailable to climbers in retail stores.\n  Throughout his life, Dale also developed an appreciation for flying. \nHe coupled his interest in flight with his love for the environment by \nflying over southern Utah's canyons, mesas, ridges, and buttes during \nthe citizens wilderness inventory in the late 1980s to help document \nUtah's wild lands.\n  Life is full of challenges and opportunities. Dale taught us all to \nappreciate each and every day and to always strive for something \nhigher. He impacted the lives of so many, and I feel lucky to have \nknown him and to have called him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2388-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MRS. GERTRUDE LORIO BEAUFORD\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mrs. Gertrude \nLorio Beauford on the occasion of her 100th birthday.\n  Born to Wilfrid A. Lorio and Eulalie L. Fischer on May 28, 1912, at \nIngleside Plantation in Lakeland, LA, Mrs. Beauford is the third oldest \nof five siblings, two brothers and three sisters. She received her \neducation from St. Joseph's Academy in New Roads and was classmates \nwith former United States Congresswoman Lindy Boggs. Mrs. Beauford then \nwent on to St. Mary's Dominican College and married childhood friend \nLeonard M. Beauford in 1935. Mr. Beauford worked for the United States \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and their family moved to 18 cities in 9 years \nbefore finally settling in New Orleans in 1945.\n  They were married for 48 years, and their family includes 3 children, \nGertrude, Wilfrid, and Kathleen, and 1 grandchild, Judith. Sharing a \nfondness for traveling, Mr. and Mrs. Beauford visited countries across \nthe world including Japan, Canada, and many more across Europe. In \nfact, they even traveled south to Antarctica and also went north and \ncrossed the Arctic Circle.\n  Mrs. Beauford has been an active member of the Louisiana Lions Club, \nthe Jefferson Lions Club, Children's Hospital, the League of Women \nVoters, the Parent-Teacher Association, and the American Association of \nUniversity Women. She is also an active member of St. Agnes Catholic \nChurch and committed 18 years of her life to educating young people at \nMcDonough #7 where she taught 5th grade.\n  Five generations later, Ingleside Plantation is still owned and \noperated by the Lorio family where sugarcane, soybeans, and wheat \ncontinue to be grown. Those closest to her know Mrs. Beauford simply as \n``Gertie,'' and she's attributed her long life to keeping busy.\n  I am proud to honor such an extraordinary member of our community on \nher 100th birthday and wish Mrs. Beauford many more joyous days, \nmonths, and years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2388-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3001.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \ncertain segments of the Farmington River and Salmon Brook in the State \nof Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lower \nFarmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Act. I first \nwould like to thank my colleague, Senator Blumenthal, for joining me as \na cosponsor of this legislation, and also wish to thank Congressman \nChris Murphy, who recently introduced an identical bill in the House.\n  My work to preserve and protect the Farmington River dates back many \nyears, and holds a special place in my heart. In 1993 and 1994, in my \nfirst term in office, I worked with Congresswoman Nancy Johnson to \nintroduce and pass legislation that added 14 miles of the Upper \nFarmington River, or the west branch of the river, to the National Wild \nand Scenic River System, becoming Connecticut's first addition to the \nsystem. In 2006, I again had the privilege of working with Rep. Johnson \nand Sen. Chris Dodd to introduce and pass the Lower Farmington River \nand Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Study Act, which authorized a \nstudy of the Lower Farmington, or the east branch of the river. Now \ncomplete, the study found that the Lower Farmington River and Salmon \nBrook possess outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational values. I \nam honored to return to the Senate floor today to introduce this \nlegislation, which would add the Lower Farmington River and Salmon \nBrook to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System in order to preserve the \nextraordinary ecological and recreational values it brings to our \nstate.\n  Passing through ten towns in northwestern Connecticut, the Lower \nFarmington River and Salmon Brook is home to extensive wetlands, unique \ngeology, and stunning vistas. The pristine and unique qualities of this \nriver system and the surrounding landscape provide visitors and \nresidents alike, a special location for hiking, paddling, and fishing. \nThis unspoiled natural retreat has a rich history that is only rivaled \nby its vibrant biodiversity. Archeologists have revealed that sites \nsurrounding the river date back over 11,000 years. The timeline that \nhas been discovered chronicles important Native American development as \nwell as the birth and growth of our nation. From\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nthe prehistoric campsites, to the Underground Railroad network, and \nburgeoning manufacturing that sent goods to markets across the world, \nthe river and its banks are an essential component of our nation's \nhistory.\n  But the importance of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook \ngoes beyond its contribution to our nation's history. Among the \ncountry's most biologically diverse ecosystem, the river is home to 30 \nspecies of finfish, 105 bird species, and the only river in New England \nthat is home to all 12 of the freshwater mussel species native to the \nregion, one of which is a federally listed endangered species. Since \nprehistory the rich biodiversity has also benefited agriculture along \nthe banks of this river system. Driven by the unique qualities of the \nsoil, Native Americans, colonists and Connecticut residents have \nharvested tobacco that is known the world over.\n  Today, outdoor recreationists visit the Lower Farmington River and \nSalmon Brook in increasing numbers. As Americans return to nature, it \nis essential that policies are in place which enhances stewardship and \nconservation in Connecticut and across the nation. Unchecked \ndevelopment threatens to erode biodiversity, destroy unprotected \nhistoric sites, and consume priceless natural resources. In order to \ncombat such destruction we must have the foresight to ensure that \ntreasures such as the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook remain \nunspoiled for today's recreational users as well as tomorrow's.\n  I thank Congressman Murphy, all the members of the Study Committee, \nand especially the Farmington River Watershed Association and its \nExecutive Director, Eileen Fielding, for working with me to advance the \nLower Farmington River and Salmon Brook's status within the National \nWild & Scenic Rivers System. I reaffirm my strong support today for the \nriver's protection, and I look forward to working cooperatively with my \ncolleagues in making it happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Roberts):\n  S. 2289. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to pediatric provisions; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Alexander, \nMurray, and Roberts in introducing the Better Pharmaceuticals and \nDevices for Children Act, BPDCA. This legislation will ensure that \nchildren are prioritized in the drug development process, as well as \ncontinue the increase in the number and quality of medical devices \ndeveloped for use in children. I am particularly pleased that this bill \nhas the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n  Indeed, drugs and devices work differently in children than in \nadults, and consequently, must be studied specifically for use in \nchildren. However, due to the fact that pediatric trials can be costly, \ntake several years, and offer less of a return on investment, drug \ncompanies weren't initiating these trials. As a result, nearly 80 \npercent of drugs were used off-label in children.\n  This alarming statistic garnered the attention of pediatricians, \nmedical experts, families, and ultimately, Congress. In 1997, Congress \nprovided pharmaceutical companies with an incentive to invest in \npediatric research through the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, \nBPCA. In 2003, Congress passed the Pediatric Research Equity Act to \nbegin requiring pharmaceutical companies to engage in these studies. \nSince the enactment of these laws, 426 drug labels have been revised \nwith important pediatric information and there has been a decline in \nthe number of drugs used off-label in children from 80 to 50 percent.\n  However, these laws will expire on October 1 unless Congress passes \nlegislation to renew them. The Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for \nChildren Act would ensure that these laws are never at risk of expiring \nagain. Laws that examine the safety and effectiveness of drugs and \ndevices in adults are permanent. Children should have the same \nassurances. By making these laws permanent, pharmaceutical companies \nwill also gain the certainty they need to continue wisely investing in \nthese studies.\n  In making these laws permanent, we must not miss an opportunity to \nimprove their benefits for children to ensure that more robust and \ntimely information about the use of drugs and devices can guide \nclinical care. This legislation does just that.\n  First, it would ensure pediatric studies are planned earlier in the \ndrug development process. Currently, pediatric study plans can be \nsubmitted to the FDA when a company submits its new drug application. \nThis can be a very stressful time for a company and, as such, pediatric \nstudy plans are often left to the last minute. This has traditionally \nresulted in insufficient and inappropriate study plans, as well as \ndelays of important pediatric data. Our legislation would require \ncompanies to submit a more robust pediatric study plan at the end of \nphase two in the drug development process. By this time in the process, \na company already has performed the requisite clinical trial or trials \nin adults and has a better understanding of a drug's safety and \nefficacy, as well as dosing requirements. Moreover, experts at the FDA \ninitially tried to require companies to submit a pediatric study plan \nat this time in the drug development process in a regulation that was \nstruck down by the courts. However, the rationale and justification \nbehind the regulation helped inform the drafting of this legislation \nand led us to believe that companies should submit their initial \npediatric study plan to the FDA at the end of phase two.\n  The legislation would also ensure that pediatric studies are actually \ncompleted. An alarming 78 percent of pediatric studies that were \nscheduled to be completed by September 2007 are currently late or were \nsubmitted late. While it is appropriate for some studies to take longer \nthan expected and we wouldn't want a pediatric study to hold up the \napproval of a drug for use in adults it is unacceptable for companies \nto fail to complete pediatric studies altogether. Our bill would give \nthe FDA the authority to distinguish between reasonable and \nunreasonable delays in pediatric studies and provide the agency with \ncritical enforcement tools to ensure required pediatric studies are \ncompleted. This legislation would also provide the FDA with the ability \nto better track the progress of studies and assist with any \ncomplications.\n  The Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act also responds \nto the need for the development of pediatric medical devices in \nchildren, which can lag five to ten years behind those manufactured for \nadults. The pediatric profit allowance for Humanitarian Use Devices has \nproven to be an effective incentive for the development of new medical \ndevices that are designed specifically for the needs of children. Our \nbill would continue this important policy. It would also reauthorize \nthe Pediatric Device Consortia, which in just two and a half years, has \nassisted in advancing the development of 135 proposed pediatric medical \ndevices and helped get life-saving and life-improving pediatric devices \nto the patients that need them.\n  This legislation is critical for children's health. It will help give \nparents peace of mind that when their doctor prescribes a medication or \nrecommends a medical device for their kids, it is proven safe and \neffective for specific use in children.\n  It is my understanding that Chairman Harkin will be including this \nlegislation as part of a broader initiative that the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee will soon be considering focused on \nimproving drugs and devices. I look forward to working with Senators \nAlexander, Murray, and Roberts, as well as the Chairman and others on \nmoving this bill forward before the October deadline.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Heller):\n  S. 2291. A bill to provide a taxpayer bill of rights for small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Business \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2012, SBTBOR. I am very pleased that \nSenators Snowe, Hutchison, and Heller are cosponsors of this taxpayer-\nfriendly legislation.\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\n  As Americans across the country race to meet today's deadline to \ncomplete their federal tax return, it is important to note that their \ntax burden is more than just the amount of tax paid to the federal \ngovernment. Taxpayers also bear the burden of the cost of complying \nwith the tax code. Analysts predict that taxpayers will spend over $350 \nbillion this year alone to comply with the tax code. In addition, \naccording to a survey by the National Small Business Association, over \nhalf of the respondents reported that they spend more than 40 hours a \nyear dealing with federal taxes and spend more than $5,000 each year \njust on the administration of federal taxes. In addition, a dispute \nover a complex tax code with the IRS can become an expensive endeavor \nfor small businesses, who have limited resources to fight off frivolous \nIRS claims. With the passage of the 2010 health care act, this burden \nis expected to increase in the future. At a time when job creation \nremains weak, small businesses should be spending their time and \nresources creating jobs, not cutting through miles of burdensome IRS \nred tape. The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights seeks to mitigate \nthis problem. It would ensure that small businesses spend less time \ndealing with the IRS and more time creating jobs.\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights, among other things, \nprovides more protections and safeguards for small businesses during \nadministrative procedures with the IRS. It would: lower the compliance \nburden on small business taxpayers; strengthen safeguards against IRS \noverreach; increase taxpayer compensation for IRS abuses and; improve \ntaxpayer access to the court system. Amid the weakest economic recovery \nsince World War II, American job creators urgently need such relief.\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act will reduce the \ncompliance and administrative burdens faced by small business taxpayers \nwhen it comes to dealing with the IRS. The bill provides an alternative \ndispute resolution procedure through which a small business taxpayer \nmay be able to request arbitration with an independent, neutral third \nparty not employed by the IRS. In addition, the bill will make more \nsmall businesses eligible to recoup attorney's fees when a court finds \nthat the IRS's action taken against a taxpayer is not substantially \njustified.\n  The legislation also reinforces the independent nature of the IRS \nAppeals Office by prohibiting it from discussing the merits of a \ntaxpayer's case with any other department at the IRS, unless the \ntaxpayer is afforded an opportunity to participate. Second, the bill \nwill prevent an Appeals Officer from raising a new issue that was not \ninitially raised by the IRS in the examination process. The SBTBOR \nwould help to ensure the Appeals Office remains a neutral entity that \neffectively facilitates the taxpayer's appeals process.\n  The Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act will make the IRS more \naccountable to taxpayers by increasing the amount of damages taxpayers \nmay receive for any collection action the IRS takes against them that \nis reckless, or by reason of negligence disregards the law or its \nregulations. Second, it increases the amount of damages taxpayers may \nbe awarded when the IRS improperly discloses their tax returns and tax \ninformation. Third, the bill raises the monetary penalty on IRS \nemployees who commit certain unlawful acts or disclose taxpayer \ninformation.\n  Finally, the legislation will improve taxpayer access to the Tax \nCourt by expanding the role of the current ``small tax case'' \nprocedure--an informal and efficient method for resolving disputes \nbefore the Tax Court--to include a wider variety of cases. The bill \nwill permit taxpayers to obtain judicial review from the Tax Court when \nthe IRS fails to act on their claim for interest abatement due to an \nerror or delay by the IRS. Taxpayers whose property has been wrongly \nseized to satisfy a tax debt will have more time to claim relief and \nbring a civil suit against the IRS. It also makes procedural \nimprovements for taxpayers who request innocent spouse relief. By \nrequesting innocent spouse relief, taxpayers can be relieved of the \nresponsibility for paying tax, interest, and penalties if their spouse \nimproperly reported items or omitted items on their tax return.\n  Last week, I held an event in Houston, Texas, where I announced my \nintention to introduce the Small Business Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act. \nThe event was held at the headquarters of Forge USA, which is a family-\nowned, medium-sized open-die forging business. Forging is a process \ninvolving the shaping of heated metal parts in which the metal is never \ncompletely confined or restrained in the dies. Forge USA has 215 \nemployees and provides high-quality custom forged products for a \nvariety of industries, with about 70 percent of its product going to \nthe oil and gas industry. This is what the owners of Forge USA said \nabout the legislation: ``Senator Cornyn's efforts to improve the rights \nof small businesses will mean that business owners will be able to \nspend more time growing their businesses and hiring more workers and \nhopefully less time talking to the tax man.'' I am grateful for the \nsupport of a small business like Forge USA. This legislation is also \nsupported by the Texas Association of Business, U.S. Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce, and the National Taxpayers Union, among others.\n  Small business owners face an especially crushing burden of \npaperwork, but they lack the key financial and legal resources that \nmultinational corporations do when dealing with the tax code and the \nIRS. This legislation will provide relief for small businesses and will \nallow small businesses to spend more time expanding their business and \ncreating jobs and less time dealing with the IRS.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn, The United States Hispanic Chamber of \n     Commerce (USHCC) would like to express its support and thank \n     you for introducing the Small Business Taxpayer Bill of \n     Rights Act of 2012 (SBTBOR). As our organization advocates \n     for legislation that helps to build Hispanic owned businesses \n     and enhance America's economy, it is encouraging to see the \n     SBTBOR introduced on the Senate floor.\n       As you are aware, Hispanic-owned firms are the fastest \n     growing segment of business across the country. We applaud \n     you for recognizing this fact and, as a result, taking the \n     initiative to provide sensible solutions for the USHCC \n     constituency of Hispanic enterprises. The four pillars of the \n     SBTBOR--lowering compliance burden for taxpayers, \n     strengthening taxpayer protections, compensating taxpayers \n     for IRS abuses, and improving taxpayer access to the judicial \n     system--are crucial to the efficiency of small business, and \n     we hope that your Senate colleagues join in your efforts to \n     pass sensible, pro-growth legislation.\n       In the USHCC's recently released 2012 2014 Legislative \n     Agenda, regulatory reform is noted as a critical part of the \n     Hispanic small business community's potential for job \n     creation and economic development. The SBTBOR, by addressing \n     problematic regulation and interaction with the IRS, is \n     parallel to the USHCC mission. In order for the Hispanic \n     community to continue leveraging its entrepreneurial spirit, \n     we cannot allow for entrepreneurs to be subject to slow and \n     costly resolution of audits, low civil damages when the IRS \n     disregards the law, fees on installment agreements for low-\n     income taxpayers, and many other harsh burdens that exist for \n     small businesses.\n       The SBTBOR is clearly something that will positively affect \n     the Hispanic business community and American economy as a \n     whole. Please let us know how we may assist in your effort to \n     promote an environment where entrepreneurs focus more on \n     growing their businesses rather than dealing with \n     unreasonable regulations.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor our Nation's public \nservants and once again submit a resolution recognizing our public \nservants during Public Service Recognition Week.\n  This is the 28th year we will honor our public servants with Public \nService Recognition Week during the first full week of May, this year \nfrom May 6 12. I am proud to once again take a moment to highlight the \nimportance of the work of our public servants and to thank them for all \nthat they do for this country.\n  As a life-long public servant, I have worked with so many talented, \nhard-working people who have dedicated their lives to helping others. I \nhave been inspired by meeting countless men and women who come to work \nevery day to serve the communities and their country. Our way of life \nwould not exist without the work of these admirable men and women who \nprovide so many vital services to the American people, including caring \nfor our wounded warriors, teaching our children, protecting our \ncommunities, and keeping our nation safe.\n  Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity not only to \nhonor those who serve, but also to hear about the wide variety of \ncareers in public service. Public employees use the week to educate \ntheir fellow Americans about how government serves them, and how \ngovernment services make life better for us all. It is always my hope \nthat people will hear about these great opportunities to give back to \ntheir communities and be encouraged to consider a career in public \nservice.\n  While we have designated a week to pay tribute to government \nemployees, it is so important that we continue to honor the work of our \npublic servants throughout the year. We face many challenges both here \nat home and abroad, and our public servants play an integral role in \nmoving our country forward. It is important that we do not lose sight \nof all they do to keep our country strong.\n  To all the dedicated men and women currently serving our Nation, \nmahalo nui loa, thank you very much, for all that you do. I encourage \nmy colleagues to join me in recognizing the public servants in their \nstates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/17/senate-section/article/S2399-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 420--DESIGNATING APRIL 5, 2012, AS ``GOLD STAR WIVES \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to S. Res. 421.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 421) designating April 20 through 22, \n     2012, as ``Global Youth Service Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a resolution I \nhave submitted designating April 20 through 22, 2012, as Global Youth \nService Day.'' My resolution recognizes and commends the significant \ncommunity service efforts that youth are making in communities across \nthe country and around the world on this weekend in April and every \nday. This resolution also encourages the citizens of the United States \nto acknowledge and support these volunteer efforts. Passage of this \nresolution sends a very strong message of support to the thousands of \nyouth across our great Nation who are contributing positively to their \ncommunities--your efforts are recognized and appreciated.\n  Beginning Friday, April 20, youth from across the United States and \naround the world will carry out community service projects in areas \nranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. Through this \nservice, many will embark on a lifelong path of service and civic \nengagement in more than 100 countries around the world.\n  Mr. President, the participation of youth in service to their \ncommunities is more than just a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. All \nyear long, young people across America, indeed--across the globe--\nidentify and address the needs of their communities, make positive \ndifferences in the world around them, learn leadership and \norganizational skills, and gain insights into the problems of their \nfellow citizens.\n  The positive effects of this service are not limited to the projects \nour young people complete. Youth who are engaged in volunteer service \nand service-learning activities do better in school than their \nclassmates who do not volunteer because they see a direct connection to \nwhat they are learning and the real world in which they live. Youth who \nengage in volunteering and other positive activities are also more \nlikely to avoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, \nand promiscuity. Service within the community also contributes \npositively to young people's character development, civic \nparticipation, and philanthropic activity as adults.\n  Youth service also plays a role in encouraging our young people to \nstay in school. A survey by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent of \nhigh school dropouts reported that boredom in school was a primary \nreason why they dropped out. High quality service-learning activities \ncan, however, help young people see that school matters to them \npersonally.\n  It is important, therefore, that the Senate encourage youth to engage \nin community service and to congratulate them for the service they \nprovide.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nam proud to acknowledge some of the young people who have participated \nin community service activities over the past year. Last year, the \nmembers of the Youth Advisory Board for Anchorage's Promise partnered \nwith various community and faith-based organizations in Anchorage and \nheld a ``Solidarity Sleep Out'' event that taught both middle school \nand high school students what it means to be homeless and what can be \ndone to help. I am told that the impact of this event was huge and \nlong-lasting. This year, these young leaders have decided to focus on \nthe problems of suicide and bullying--two major issues facing Anchorage \nand our entire State. Their goal is to find ways to bring more \nawareness, resources, and funding to these two issues.\n  In addition to these efforts, young people from across my home State \nand this country have and will continue to engage in projects such as \nhelping the homeless, the hungry, and the elderly. In fact, young \npeople from across Alaska turn their energy and initiative to projects \nsuch as restoring salmon streams, combating domestic violence, raising \nmoney for community needs, and providing other significant acts of \nservice for their peers and for adults.\n  I am so proud of all of these young Alaskans. I value their idealism, \nenergy, creativity, and unique perspectives as they volunteer to make \ntheir communities better and assist those in need.\n  Many similarly wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe Nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to learn about and applaud \nthe selfless and creative youth who are contributing in their own \nStates this year.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
