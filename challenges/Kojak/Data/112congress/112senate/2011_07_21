Mr. President, the Senate will begin debate today on \ncut, cap, and balance, the plan approved earlier this week in the \nHouse. This means Senators will now have the opportunity to go on \nrecord either in support of balancing our books or against it.\n  This is an opportunity for everyone to take a stand. It is an \nopportunity to say that a government which borrows more than 40 cents \nof every $1 it spends is not sustainable and very much needs to change \nits ways. It is an opportunity to stand with those who believe \nWashington needs to heal its addiction to spending now, not make more \nfalse promises of spending restraint sometime later.\n  The President's veto threat of this legislation is telling. Many of \nus learned a long time ago to pay more attention to what this President \ndoes than what he says. Anyone who has witnessed his reckless spending \nhabits over the past 2\\1/2\\ years or sat across the negotiating table \nwith him over the past few weeks could be forgiven for being skeptical \nof his recent attempts to come across as a fiscal moderate.\n  I will just say this: There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that \nthis President is as deeply committed to a government we cannot afford \nas he was on Inauguration Day.\n  That is why we have decided to bring our case directly to the \nAmerican people with the cut, cap, and balance plan, which forces \nWashington to get its fiscal house in order with a constitutional \namendment.\n  It is nice that some people are hoping the President has had a change \nof heart, but no one should be planning on it. Cut, cap, and balance \ncuts spending now, caps it in the future, and only raises the debt \nceiling if it is accompanied by a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  That is what America wants, and it is what Washington needs. All we \nneed is 20 Democrats to join us. At least 23 of them have led their \nconstituents to believe they would fight for a balanced\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nbudget amendment. The White House has called for a balanced approach in \nthis debate. This bill does not just suggest balance, it actually \nmandates it. So I strongly urge my Democratic friends to join us in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Let me note in closing another virtue of the cut, cap, and balance \nplan. It does not raise taxes. Why is this a good thing? There are many \nreasons Americans do not like tax hikes. First, they know government is \nbound to waste the money. Americans have seen what government does with \nnew tax revenue: It wastes it on things such as turtle tunnels. Second, \nit never uses it to pay down deficits and debt. So if you are concerned \nabout the size of our debt, then raising taxes is a sure way to ensure \nthat nothing gets done about it--absolutely nothing.\n  The reason we have a debt crisis is government spends every cent it \ngets--and then some. Sending Washington more money will not solve the \nproblem, it will enable it.\n  Our tax system certainly is not perfect. But until Washington can \nprove it is responsible with our tax dollars, we should not be sending \nit more of those tax dollars. That is why Republicans have focused on \ncuts in this debate, and that is why every one of us--Democrat and \nRepublican--should support cut, cap, and balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4742-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, let me get this off my chest. Coming \nin today, I just heard the announcement that the House of \nRepresentatives is taking the weekend off. I have reached out to the \nSpeaker. I have not had an opportunity to speak to him. But I want \neveryone who can hear my voice to understand that time is of the \nessence. We are running out of time.\n  Procedurally, things cannot move very quickly through the Senate \nunder the best of circumstances, and when there are people who want to \ncause problems, it takes a long time to get things done. There are \npeople who serve in the Senate who say they do not believe--and they \nwill fight to make sure we do not--we should raise the debt ceiling. In \nfact, they are saying: Let's default on our debt.\n  I think this is a very bad picture for our country, to have the House \nof Representatives out this weekend when we have to likely wait for \nthem to send us something because I understand that the negotiations \ntaking place deal with revenues, which constitutionally have to start \nin the House of Representatives. So I think it is just untoward--that \nis the kindest word I can say--to have the House of Representatives out \nthis weekend. What a bad picture that shows the country. We have 12 \ndays before our Nation does the unthinkable, forever undermining the \nfull faith and credit of our great country.\n  Members of Congress come from 50 different States, but we all serve \none Nation. The American people deserve better than leaders who each \nstake out their own positions--sometimes radical positions--forsaking \nthe good of the Nation. The American people expect us to find common \nground no matter how difficult it may seem.\n  Every reasonable voice in America has warned us that a default on \nthis Nation's financial obligations would not only be a blight on our \nreputation but would precipitate a global economic crisis that we have \nnever, ever seen. These warnings have come from the banking industry \nand the business community; they have come from our finest economists \nand shrewdest investors; they have come from former legislators, past \npolicymakers, both Democrats and Republicans; and they have come from \nreasonable people here in our Congress.\n  It is clear to me that we have to increase the debt ceiling. That is \nwhat John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, said this \nspring. But it is now summer. He also said this: Not raising the debt \nlimit would have a serious implication for the worldwide economy and \njobs here in America.\n  That is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. His deputy, Eric \nCantor, agrees. Last week, Cantor said:\n\n       We want to make sure that we avoid default. We want to make \n     sure that we avoid going past August 2nd without raising the \n     debt ceiling.\n\n  And my Republican counterpart here in the Senate, the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, said he would support the debt limit as long as Congress \nused the opportunity to do ``something really important'' about the \nnational debt.\n  Democrats are willing to join with our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to do, as my Republican counterpart said, ``something \nreally important.'' We have already shown our willingness to make tough \ndecisions for the sake of finding common ground even if it means \ndrawing the ire of our own political party. Unfortunately, the loudest, \nshrillest voices from the Republican Party are not reasonable leaders \nbut tea party extremists.\n  Congress has days, not weeks, to reassure the markets that when this \ngreat Nation issues an IOU, we stand by it, we do not turn into \ndeadbeats when the bills come due. If you want to know how important \nthis issue is, ask Ronald Reagan. Here is what he said about the \nimportance of averting this kind of default:\n\n       The United States has a special responsibility to itself \n     and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a \n     well-earned reputation for reliability and credibility, two \n     things that set us apart from much of the world.\n\n  President Reagan took the threat of default seriously. I will repeat \nwhat he said:\n\n       The United States has a special responsibility to itself \n     and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a \n     well-earned reputation of reliability and credibility, two \n     things that set us apart from much of the world.\n\n  President Reagan took the threat of default seriously. So do \nreasonable Members of Congress today. And this is reasonable Republican \nMembers of Congress. Yet I fear the closer we get to disaster, the \nfurther we get from making the arrangement needed to raise the debt and \nstop a default.\n  Democrats have shown they are willing to work with Republicans on any \nserious, reasonable plan that averts default and cuts the deficit in a \nbalanced way. Now it is time for House Republicans to show they are \nalso willing to get serious. A plan to decimate Social Security, \nMedicare, and every other Federal benefit plan, while protecting \nhundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks, is not \na serious plan. The Republicans so-called cut, cap, and balance plan \ndoes not have one chance in a million of passing the Senate.\n  The moment for partisan games has long since passed. It is time for \npatriots on both sides of the aisle to join\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nhands and actually govern. So I ask, Will reasonable Republicans join \nus in forging a compromise for the good of our country?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4743-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4743-S4751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE ACT OF 2011--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 106, \nH.R. 2560.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. \n     106, H.R. 2560, an act to cut, cap, and balance the Federal \n     budget.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 2 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled by the two leaders \nor their designees, with Senators permitted to speak therein for a \nperiod of up to 10 minutes each, with the Republicans controlling the \nfirst 30 minutes and the majority controlling the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the issue the \nSenate is going to be considering for the next couple of days and \nultimately voting on, it sounds like, possibly sometime on Saturday; \nthat is, the cut, cap, and balance proposal that has been put forward \nby the House of Representatives.\n  The House passed this particular proposal the night before last. It \nis now pending under consideration in the Senate. What I would suggest \nto my colleagues in the Senate is this: It is the only proposal out \nthere. It is the only plan we have to vote on.\n  It has now been about 813 days--I think is the correct number of \ndays--since a budget was passed in the Senate. The Democratic majority \nhas not submitted one for consideration here. We have not had votes on \na budget. We have been operating without a budget. There is no plan.\n  The House of Representatives passed a budget earlier this year. It \nwas criticized by many people here--Democrats--as being something they \ndidn't want to support. There wasn't an alternative put forward by the \nSenate Democrats or by the President. The President did put a budget \nforward in his annual budget release earlier this year, but the Senate \nvoted it down 97 to 0. There wasn't a single Member, Republican or \nDemocrat, who voted in favor of the President's budget proposal. Why? \nBecause it would have raised spending, raised the debt--almost doubled \nthe debt over the next 10 years, and it would have increased taxes by \nover $1 trillion.\n  Overall, I don't think those are the elements you want to be in a \nbudget. You want to reduce spending and put a plan into place that \nstarts getting a trajectory in place that starts reducing the amount of \ndebt we have. You certainly don't want to raise taxes in an economic \ndownturn, when you are dealing with 9.2 percent unemployment. That is \nthe only budget submission we have seen from the President.\n  As I said, there has not been anything in the context of the debt \nlimit debate put forward by the Democrats in the Senate or by the \nPresident. The only proposal we have in front of us is the Cut, Cap, \nand Balance proposal passed by the House of Representatives. You can \nsay the House arguably has done its work. They have put forward a plan \nthat we need to act on.\n  To suggest for a minute that there isn't an alternative, that the \nRepublicans are being unreasonable in all this, I think completely \nmisses the point, because that is the only plan out there. If you don't \nlike that one, where is your budget? We have had 813 days without a \nbudget. We don't have a plan to deal with the debt limit. What we have \nto vote on and consider and debate today is the Cut, Cap, and Balance \nproposal.\n  That is significant for a number of reasons. One, I believe the way \nto deal with the crisis we have in this country today--a debt crisis \nthat gets worse by the day--is to get spending under control. I believe \nfundamentally that the problem we have in this country is not a \nquestion of not enough revenue, it is a question of too much spending. \nThe government has gotten too big, has grown too fast. It is spinning \nout of control, in the minds of most Americans. They want to see us \nrein it in and get government spending and debt under control.\n  Yesterday, I read this on the floor, but I want to read it again. \nIronically, it is a letter I got from a Boy Scout in South Dakota who \nis earning his merit badge. He wrote me a letter and said this:\n\n       I feel that the Federal Government needs a balanced budget. \n     If we don't, the debt gets larger each year. I feel that \n     there are two solutions for this. In our house, we are \n     careful to only spend what my mom and dad earn. That needs \n     come first and what is left is for wants. Many times we were \n     told no when we ask for something. With my allowance and lawn \n     mowing money, I divide it between donations, saving, and \n     spending. I can't spend more than I make.\n\n  I think there are a couple of very powerful observations in this \nstatement. The first is, obviously, it is not lost even on this young \nAmerican how important it is to live within your means, and that you \ncannot spend money you don't have. That is clearly a lesson he has \nalready learned. We need to learn that in Washington, DC.\n  Second is how profoundly this issue impacts the next generation. If, \nin fact, we fail to act to get spending and debt under control and to \nput us on a sustainable fiscal course, the next generation is going to \npay a powerful price for our irresponsibility.\n  I submit again to my colleagues this is fundamentally a spending \nissue. A lot of folks talk about the need for more revenue. The \nPresident talks about wanting more revenue. The majority leader just \nsaid the House is out of town and how that is terrible because revenue \nmeasures have to originate in the House. Many of us believe this can be \nsolved without more revenue, that we don't have to raise taxes on the \nAmerican people or American small businesses to solve what is \ninherently and fundamentally a spending problem.\n  If we want to balance the budget, we have to get spending under \ncontrol. Five times since 1969 the budget was balanced in this country. \nIn each case, the average amount we spent was just under 18.7 percent \nof our GDP, so that is kind of the benchmark for the five times in our \nhistory since 1969 when the budget has been balanced. The 40-year \naverage of spending to GDP in this country is 20.6 percent. That is the \n40-year average. The five times we balanced the budget, it was 18.7 \npercent of GDP. This year, we are spending 24.3 percent of GDP. If you \nlook at the President's budget--and even what are, in my view, \noptimistic assumptions about economic growth--you are still looking at \nthat sort of a course for the foreseeable future. With what I think are \ngoing to be the exploding costs of the health care bill that was passed \nlast year, it could be much higher than that.\n  My point is this: If you can balance your budget at 18.7 percent \nFederal spending as a percentage of GDP, and we are spending at 24.3 \npercent this year, we are 30 percent higher in terms of what we spend \nthan those times in which we were able to balance the budget. If you \nare talking about balancing the budget, it means getting spending under \ncontrol, reining in out-of-control Washington spending.\n  For a long time, I have believed that we need not only what is \nproposed in the Cut, Cap, and Balance bill, in terms of an immediate \nreduction in spending, caps on spending in the future years, but also a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is something I have \ncampaigned on my entire political career. I believe it is necessary.\n  Washington has not demonstrated in the past the political courage \nthat is necessary to get spending under control. The consequence of \nthat is we now have a Federal debt that is over $14 trillion, and we \nare actually talking about raising the borrowing authority of this \ncountry simply because we get further and further into debt every year. \nWe are running $1 trillion deficits, and at that rate you are obviously \ngoing to continue to accumulate enormous amounts of debt. It means \ngetting your budget balanced. We don't do that around here. Most \nStates--49 of them--have some form of a balanced budget amendment that \nrequires them to make sure their spending doesn't exceed the amount of \nrevenue they have coming in. I think that is needed.\n  When I first got to the Congress as a freshman Congressman in 1997, \nthere was a vote in the Senate on a balanced budget amendment. It \nfailed by one\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nvote. It needs two-thirds votes in the House and Senate, and then has \nto be sent to the States for ratification. If 38 States ratify, it \nwould be added to the Constitution. We would have a requirement that \nthe Federal Government balance its budget as so many States have to do \nevery single year. Well, that vote in the Senate in 1997 failed by 1 \nvote. It got 66 votes in the Senate, which is 1 short of the 67 \nnecessary to send it on to the House. At that time, I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, and had the Senate passed it and sent it \nto the House, I believe we would have gotten a two-thirds majority in \nthe House and been able to send it to the States.\n  What has happened in the last 15 years? At that time, the accumulated \ndebt was $5 trillion. Today, it is $14 trillion. We have seen a $9 \ntrillion increase in the amount of debt. I can't help but think that \nhad we had a balanced budget amendment in place, we would be much \nbetter off today.\n  The cut, cap, and balance approach strikes at the very heart of the \nissue, which is that this is fundamentally a spending issue that needs \nto be addressed in the near term by cutting spending, capping spending \nin future years, and putting in place the mechanism that requires \nCongress to have the discipline to balance the budget for future \ngenerations. I hope we will get an affirmative vote when the time \ncomes, and that my colleagues will support the measure I think will get \nthis country back on a sustainable fiscal track and create prosperity \nfor this generation and future generations, as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the legislation \nthat has come over from the House of Representatives which, I must say, \nI consider to be some of the most ill-considered legislation I have \never seen come over from the other body. This legislation has been \nhastily thrown together, has never had a hearing, and yet proposes to \namend the Constitution of the United States in dramatic and draconian \nways. This is truly dangerous business.\n  I have been a part of the fiscal commission, and I was part of the \nmajority that supported its conclusions to reduce our debt from what it \nwould otherwise be by $4 trillion. Eleven of us supported that plan--\nfive Democrats, five Republicans, and one Independent. I have been a \npart of the Group of 6--three Democrats and three Republicans--and we \nhave released our plan to reduce the debt from what it would otherwise \nbe by $3.7 trillion. I have been part of putting out the Democratic \nSenate Budget Committee plan, and I am proud to say it would reduce the \ndebt from what it would otherwise be by $4 trillion.\n  In my entire career, 25 years in the Senate, I have consistently \nspoken of the dangers of deficits and debt and the risk of the debt \nthreat to our country. I believe passionately that we have to find a \nway to come together to reduce the danger of these runaway debts. But \nthis legislation that has come over from the House cannot be the \nanswer. It is not bipartisan. In fact, it is superpartisan. It is \ntotally done on one side of the ledger. It will not pass, it will not \nbecome law, and it should not.\n  Now, let's understand the context within which we are operating. \nFirst of all, as a country, we are borrowing 41 cents of every dollar \nwe spend. Our gross debt is now 100 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. The best economists in the country have warned us that once we \nget to a debt that is more than 90 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, our future economic prospects are in danger. Future economic \ngrowth is reduced. That is why I have been deeply involved in every \nserious bipartisan attempt to reduce deficits and debt.\n  This proposal that has come over from the House--not having had a \nsingle hearing in this body, not one--is truly radical. Again, I say to \nmy colleagues, we have an urgent need to act, but we shouldn't panic. \nUnfortunately, I think that is what the House did when they sent us \nthis half-baked concoction of ideas that don't hold together, that \ndon't add up, and that would actually further threaten the economic \nrecovery.\n  There is no denying we face a debt threat. This is what the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in June of last year:\n\n       Our national debt is our biggest national security threat.\n\n  Now we have had the rating agencies warn us that if we don't act, if \nwe don't get our debt and deficits under control, they are going to \ndowngrade the rating of U.S. debt--the rating of how the markets \nrespond to our debt offerings. That would have a very serious impact on \nwhat we pay to borrow money. Remember, for every 1 percent increase in \nthe interest rates we pay, it adds $1.3 trillion to the debt.\n  Here is what one rating agency has said:\n\n       We may lower the long-term rating on the U.S. by one or \n     more notches into the AA category in the next 3 months, if we \n     conclude that Congress and the administration have not \n     achieved a credible solution to the rising U.S. Government \n     debt burden and are not likely to achieve one in the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  That is why I joined the Gang of 6 some 6 months ago, to produce a \nbipartisan plan to deal with the debt threat. And we have released that \nplan now--three Democrats, three Republicans. Many more of our \ncolleagues on both sides have joined and said they are with us. So we \nhave a way forward, but it is certainly not the legislation that has \ncome over from the House of Representatives that we are considering \ntoday.\n  The House legislation would restrict the ability to respond to \neconomic downturns and actually compound declines. It uses Social \nSecurity funds to calculate balance and subjects that program to the \nsame cuts as other Federal spending, even though we all understand that \nis totally separate from the rest of the budget. It shifts ultimate \ndecisions on budgeting to unelected and unaccountable judges. What a \nmistake that would be. It requires a State ratification process that \ncould take years to complete.\n  We don't have years to deal with this problem. I am afraid the House \nlegislation is mostly political theater that has been sent to us rather \nthan a serious response to the problem. But perhaps most alarming, the \nproposal before us could turn a recession into a depression. We need to \nthink very carefully how we respond to this debt threat, and then we \nneed to react in a serious and credible way, and we have to stand \ntogether with our colleagues.\n  That is why I was proud to be a part of the fiscal commission, \nbecause we produced a plan that would get our debt under control and \nstart reducing it. There were 11 of us--five Democrats, five \nRepublicans, and one Independent--and a majority of that commission \nagreed to that plan. It is why I have been proud to be part of the Gang \nof 6 in the Senate--three Democrats, three Republicans. We have \nproduced a plan to control our debt and to begin to work it down. None \nof those plans, and none of the other bipartisan plans, would risk \nturning a recession into a depression. But that is exactly what the \nlegislation from the House would do.\n  Now, why do I say that? Well, here is one of the most respected \nscholars in this town. He is from the American Enterprise Institute. He \ncalled the balanced budget amendment that has come from the House a \nreally dumb idea. This is what he said:\n\n       Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and more \n     destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment. Here \n     is why: Nearly all our states have balanced budget \n     requirements. That means when the economy slows, states are \n     forced to raise taxes or slash spending at just the wrong \n     time, providing a fiscal drag when what is needed is \n     countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In fact, the \n     fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010 was barely countered \n     by the Federal stimulus plan. That meant the Federal stimulus \n     provided was nowhere near what was needed but far better than \n     doing nothing.\n\n  Now imagine that scenario with a Federal drag instead. Mr. Ornstein \ndoesn't just imagine that, the Washington Post, in an editorial from \nlast Friday, said:\n\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n\n       Rewriting the Constitution is the wrong way to deal with \n     the debt.\n\n  Let me just reference, from their second column, these words:\n\n       Worse yet, the latest version would impose an absolute cap \n     on spending as a share of the economy. It would prevent \n     Federal expenditures from exceeding 18 percent of the gross \n     domestic product in any year. Most unfortunately, the \n     amendment lacks a clause letting the government exceed that \n     limit to strengthen a struggling economy. No matter how shaky \n     the state of the union, policymakers would be prevented from \n     adopting emergency spending, such as the extension of \n     unemployment insurance and other countercyclical expenses \n     that have helped cushion the blow of the current economic \n     downturn.\n\n  Two of the most distinguished economists in our country, Alan \nBlinder, the former Deputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark \nZandi, who was an adviser to John McCain's Presidential campaign, \nstudied the government response to the latest financial crisis. Here is \nwhat they concluded:\n\n       We find that its effects on real GDP, jobs, and inflation \n     are huge, and probably averted what could have been called \n     Great Depression 2.0.\n\n  This amendment before us would have stopped the governmental \nresponse, which two of the Nation's most distinguished economists tell \nus averted Great Depression 2.0. Quoting further from the article:\n\n       When all is said and done, the financial and fiscal \n     policies will have cost taxpayers a substantial sum, but not \n     nearly as much as most had feared and not nearly as much as \n     if policymakers had not acted at all. If the comprehensive \n     policy responses saved the economy from another depression, \n     as we estimate, they were well worth their cost.\n\n  This amendment that is before us now would have prevented this \nresponse and would have prevented averting a Great Depression.\n  Here is the work of Zandi and Blinder with respect to what would have \nhappened to jobs absent the Federal response. Jobs with the Federal \nresponse, the green line; jobs without the Federal response, the red \nline: 8 million fewer jobs without the Federal response to prevent a \ndepression. Unemployment, what would have happened without the Federal \nresponse, according to this detailed study by Zandi and Blinder: \nWithout the Federal response, unemployment today would be about 16 \npercent instead of the 9 percent we are experiencing. We would be in a \ndepression. That is the hard reality. The amendment before us would \nhave prevented that kind of governmental response.\n  They call this plan cut, cap, and balance. They should have called it \ncut, cap, and kill Medicare, because that is what this plan would do; \nit would cut, cap, and kill Medicare.\n  Why do I say that? Well, if we look at the House budget proposal that \nunderlies this plan, we see what happens under traditional Medicare. \nUnder traditional Medicare, the beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of \ntheir expenses. Under the Republican budget plan that underlies the \namendment that has come before us, Medicare beneficiaries would pay 68 \npercent of the expenses of their health care. In other words, somebody \nwho is Medicare eligible, qualifies for the program, pays their \nrequired costs, pays their required copays, pays their required \npremiums, pays 25 percent of the cost under the plan. With the \nRepublican plan from the House, that would increase to 68 percent. That \nstands Medicare on its head. Instead of Medicare, as normal insurance \ndoes, paying the lion's share, individuals would pay the lion's share \nof their health care expenses.\n  The underlying House Republican plan that underlies this amendment \nwould increase the out-of-pocket costs to a Medicare beneficiary from \n$6,000 to $12,500. That would be health spending for a typical 65-year-\nold Medicare beneficiary in 2022. Instead of paying $6,000 under \ncurrent law, they would pay $12,500.\n  Somebody who has been following the details will look at these \nnumbers and say, Well, Senator Conrad, what you have outlined there is \nthe House Republican plan. And what has been sent you in an amendment \nactually is even more draconian than the House Republican plan. It goes \neven further. It cuts Medicare even more. And, yes, that is true. I \nhave understated very substantially the devastation that would be done \nto Medicare under the amendments before us. But how can that be? Well, \nhere is how it can be.\n  The red line shows the spending under the House GOP budget. But in \nthis amendment, in this legislation that has come to us, not only did \nthey adopt the House Republican budget, they then trump it. They then \noverride it with a constitutional amendment that goes even further.\n  Here is the spending under the House Republican plan. It goes from 24 \npercent of GDP down to 19.9. Then it is leapfrogged by the provisions \nof the constitutional amendment that would take spending down to 18 \npercent of GDP. From 24.1 to 18, that is a 25-percent cut if you took \nthe cut across the board.\n  But their plan doesn't take the cut across the board. It shields \ncertain things. So the cuts to those things that aren't shielded have \nto be more draconian and even deeper.\n  Visually I thought I should produce a chart that shows what would \nhappen if you had to reach the limit that is in the constitutional \namendment that is before this body today.\n  With an 18-percent cap on all gross domestic product spending, here \nis Social Security. That is 5 percent of gross domestic product. \nDefense and other nonhealth spending, as you can see, takes you well \nover 15 percent. Then you have interest, and you are at their cap. \nThere is no money for Medicare. There is no money for Medicaid. There \nis no money for any of the other health care accounts. If they hold \nharmless Social Security, defense and other nonhealth spending, and of \ncourse we have got to pay interest on the debt, there is nothing left \nover. That is why I call this cut, cap, and kill Medicare. I should \nhave added cut, cap, and kill Medicaid. Cut, cap, and kill every other \nhealth care account.\n  This plan caps spending going forward at draconian and unrealistic \nlevels. It fails to account for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration and rising health care costs. Perhaps more remarkable, it \nprovides no war funding for 2013 to 2021. Nothing.\n  Let me repeat that. This plan that has come over from the House is so \nill-considered, so hastily thrown together, so lacking in credibility \nthat they provide for no war funding after 2013. Does that mean they \nare advocating bringing all the troops home from every location \neverywhere around the world? Well, I am certain not, because that is \nnot the position they have taken. But they don't provide any money for \nit.\n  I don't know who slapped this thing together, but they weren't very \ncareful in what they did. None of it adds up. It is totally make-\nbelieve.\n  This is not make-believe. This is what is going to happen to the \nnumber of people who are eligible for Medicare and Social Security \nrunning up to 2050: The number of people eligible is almost going to \ndouble. That is a demographic tidal wave that is a reality. It is not a \nprojection. These people have been born. They are alive today. They are \ngoing to retire. They are going to be eligible. This amendment before \nus makes no provision for them.\n  So what is going to happen? They are going to shred Medicare, they \nare going to shred Medicaid, and they are going to put at risk Social \nSecurity. That is as clear as it can be.\n  Here is the reality we confront today as a nation. Spending as a \nshare of GDP is the highest it has been in 60 years, but revenue as a \nshare of GDP is the lowest it has been in 60 years. Both of these are \nfacts, both of these are true. Our friends on the other side are saying \nyou cannot touch the revenue side of the equation, even if it is \nclosing tax havens, going after abusive tax shelters, going after tax \nscams that proliferate the Tax Code today. They say, Oh, no, you can't \ntouch that; you can't make any changes on the revenue side of the \nequation, even though the revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years \nas a share of our national income. They say it would take a two-thirds \nvote, and they would put it in the Constitution of the United States \nthat they would require a two-thirds vote to close any tax haven, any \ntax shelter, any abusive tax scam would take a two-thirds vote.\n  That is not what I learned when I was growing up about the \nConstitution of the United States. It didn't say anything about \nprotecting those who engage in tax scams and tax havens and abusive tax \nshelters. But that is what this plan would do.\n  The Washington Post back in May did an analysis: How did we get into\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nthis ditch we are in of runaway debt and runaway deficits? How did we \nget into this position? Their conclusion after this study was that:\n\n       The biggest culprit by far has been an erosion of tax \n     revenue triggered largely by two recessions and multiple \n     rounds of tax cuts. Together, the economy and tax bills \n     enacted under former President George W. Bush, and to a \n     lesser extent by President Obama, wiped out $6.3 trillion in \n     anticipated revenue. That is nearly half of the $12.7 \n     trillion swing from projected surpluses to real debt. Federal \n     tax collections now stand at their lowest level as a \n     percentage of the economy in 60 years.\n\n  This amendment before us would require a two-thirds vote to do \nanything about it? Let's get serious.\n  As I say, I have been part of every serious bipartisan effort here \nover the last 2 years to come up with a plan, to get our debt under \ncontrol. So, yes, cut spending; yes, reform entitlements; yes, get the \nrevenue base recovered so we can reduce our debt. But this plan before \nus is a disaster.\n  Let's look at reality. The last five times the budget has been in \nsurplus in the last 40 years, revenue has been close to 20 percent of \nGDP. This plan would require a two-thirds vote to increase any revenue. \nRevenue is at 14.8 percent of GDP. Wow. You talk about consigning this \ncountry to an endless round of economic uncertainty and an undermining \nof the economic position of the United States, vote for this thing.\n  Martin Feldstein, who is one of the most conservative economists in \nthe country, has said we have got to take on these tax expenditures. \nTax expenditures now amount to $1.1 trillion a year. We are spending \nmore through the Tax Code than we are in all appropriated spending \nevery year, and yet this amendment would require a two-thirds vote to \nchange any of those tax expenditures, to close any of the tax \nloopholes, to go after any of the tax havens and abusive tax shelters.\n  Here is Martin Feldstein, Professor of Economics at Harvard, Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. Eliminating tax expenditures does not \n     increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for saving, \n     investment or risk-taking. It would also increase overall \n     economic efficiency by removing incentives that distort \n     private spending decisions. And eliminating or consolidating \n     the large number of overlapping tax-based subsidies would \n     also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, cutting tax \n     expenditures is not at all like other ways of raising \n     revenue.\n\n  Interestingly enough, every bipartisan commission has come back and \nsaid, as one part of dealing with our deficits and debt, we ought to \nreduce tax expenditures. It is spending by another name. But do you \nknow what. The legislation before us would require a two-thirds vote to \nchange any of these tax expenditures because it raises revenue. It \nraises revenue, so they are against that.\n  Here is where the tax expenditures go. The top 1 percent get 26 \npercent of the value of tax expenditures. These loopholes that have \nproliferated have gone to the very top. We are going to have to reform \nthis Tax Code, take out the junk, and at the same time we are going to \nhave to go after these offshore tax havens and tax shelters that some \nof the very best off among us, the most fortunate, are using to dodge \nwhat they legitimately owe in this country.\n  They call this legislation cut, cap, and balance. They should have \ncalled it preserve, protect, and defend tax havens and tax shelters \nbecause that is, in effect, what it would do. They say if we go after \nthese tax havens and these tax shelters that is a tax increase. That \nincreases revenue; therefore, it should take a two-thirds vote to do \nanything about it.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, this is a little five-story building \ndown in the Cayman Islands. It claims to be home to 18,857 companies. \nThey all say they are doing business out of this little building. This \nis the most efficient building in the world. It is unbelievable: 18,857 \ncompanies say they are doing business out of this little building. That \nis a remarkable accomplishment, to be running 18,000 businesses out of \nthis little building. How can that possibly be?\n  Of course it is not. The only thing they are running down there is a \ngiant tax scam on all the rest of us who pay what we owe. By the way, \nit has no taxes that apply to these businesses. We are not down in the \nCayman Islands. We are right here. We are filing our taxes, and we are \npaying them. These companies are dodging theirs. If anybody doubts that \nthis has become a huge hemorrhage for the U.S. Treasury, here is what \nour own Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has found:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 billion to $70 billion from individuals \n     and another $30 billion from corporations engaging in \n     offshore tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of \n     billions of dollars more.\n\n  Before we raise taxes one thin dime on any of the rest of us who are \npaying our taxes, let's go after these folks who are dodging their \nresponsibilities and their obligations. This amendment before us would \nrequire a two-thirds vote to do it.\n  That is not the end of it. Here is what happened to the tax rates of \nthe most wealthy 400 families in the United States, their effective tax \nrates since 1995. In 1995 their effective tax rate was 29.9 percent. By \n2007 it was down to 16.6 percent. The wealthiest among us have had \ntheir tax rates about cut in half. I don't know about you, but I didn't \nhave my taxes cut in half. The vast majority of Americans did not have \ntheir taxes cut in half. But with the help of well-placed lobbyists \nhere, those who are the most fortunate have had their effective tax \nrates cut in half.\n  This amendment before us would say it would take a two-thirds vote to \nchange that. That is why I say this amendment should be called \npreserve, protect, and defend tax havens and abusive tax shelters.\n  The last time the top rate was 39.6 percent we experienced the \nlongest period of uninterrupted economic growth in U.S. history. Those \nwho say if we raise any revenue we kill jobs--really? That is not what \nhistory shows. The last time we had a comprehensive plan to cut \nspending and raise revenue to reduce the debt--during the Clinton \nadministration--we kicked off the longest period of uninterrupted \neconomic growth in U.S. history: 39 straight quarters of economic \ngrowth, 32 of those quarters during the Clinton administration, and 24 \nmillion jobs were created.\n  Dealing with the deficit and the debt in a balanced and comprehensive \nway does not kill jobs. It creates the climate for the creation of jobs \nbecause it improves the competitive position of the United States.\n  I have been part of three plans to reduce this debt from what it \nwould otherwise be by $4 trillion. The fiscal commission plan--I \nserved, 11 of us, 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans and 1 Independent endorsed \nthat outcome. I was part of the Group of 6, 3 Democrats and 3 \nRepublicans.\n  We produced a plan to reduce the deficit and debt from what it would \notherwise be by $3.7 trillion. I was part of the Democrats on the \nSenate Budget Committee that unveiled a plan to reduce deficits and \ndebt from what they otherwise would be by $4 trillion. So I have been \nhappy to be part of bipartisan efforts, efforts just on our side of the \naisle, and interestingly enough every single commission has come up \nwith a package of about $4 trillion in deficit savings.\n  I think the Group of 6 did yeoman's work, bringing the deficit down \nfrom 9.3 percent of GDP, down to 1.9. Yes, we have revenue; yes, we \nhave spending cuts; yes, we reform entitlement programs--because all of \nthat is necessary. This legislation before us says: Whoa, wait a \nminute. We don't want to do it all. We want to focus on just part of \nit. This problem is too big to try to solve it with just part of the \nFederal fiscal picture. It is going to take all parts to solve this \nproblem.\n  The Group of 6, I am proud to say, came up with a plan that \nstabilizes this debt and begins to bring it down, avoiding this \nskyrocketing debt we are otherwise going to experience. This \nlegislation before us would stop it in its tracks. I think that would \nbe a profound mistake.\n  I hope my colleagues reject this ill-considered plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the plan \nthat\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nis before us, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. I also think there are \nsome very important achievements in the Group of 6 proposal. It is a \nproposal. It is not legislative language. It has many things in it that \nare very good. It has tax cuts, it has entitlement reform, it has \nspending cuts. It is a complicated outline and one that needs to be \nfleshed out to know exactly what is in it, and it has some areas with \nwhich I disagree. I certainly want to assure that we keep the 15-\npercent capital gains and dividends rate. But we also have another \nproposal that I think has great merit.\n  I think the bill that has come over from the House, the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act, puts even more together on the issues that we are all \ntrying to address. What we need are spending cuts that are real, not \nproposed down the road or promised. That is what the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act will do.\n  We all know we have a $14.3 trillion debt ceiling that is getting \nready to be hit sometime in the month of August. What we need to do--in \nthis Senate, in the Congress, and, certainly, hopefully, the \nPresident--is give confidence to the markets. That means we do two \nthings: We raise the debt ceiling. We don't default or even scare \npeople that we are going to default, with reforms that will assure that \nwe will not ever have to do it again. That is what we must do to send a \nmessage to the markets that we are going to get our fiscal house in \norder, and we are going to assure that our debts are paid, that the \npeople who work on Federal contracts and our military and Social \nSecurity recipients will get their paychecks. We have to assure the \nmarket. To raise the debt ceiling we have to show we are going to cut \nback on spending. That is the key.\n  We have to tackle the core problem. We have to stop spending too \nmuch, borrowing too much, and taxing too much. We do not have a taxing \nproblem in this country, we have a spending problem. We are not being \ntaxed too little, we are spending too much.\n  With $2.2 trillion in tax revenue collected, the Federal Government \nhas the ability to live within its means. We must prioritize and we \nmust make sure we get a private sector economy that will hire people.\n  I can tell you, small businesses are not hiring because they are \nterrified of the health care bill that was passed last year. They are \nterrified of the costs involved. Second, they are looking at people in \nWashington talking about more taxes, and they are saying: I am freezing \nright now. I am not going to take a chance that I am going to hire a \nnew employee who is going to cost more than the productivity we can add \nto our business and keep going.\n  The cut, cap, and balance bill would make significant spending cuts \nnow. It also requires the passage of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. It takes a two-thirds vote of both Houses to do that, but \nwe need to do it. We need to put the Federal Government on the same \nkind of fiscal constraint that almost every State in our Nation has; \nthat is, a constitutional requirement that we have a balanced budget, \nthat we do not borrow for operational expenses.\n  We can borrow for long-term projects, bonds--absolutely. But we are \nnot going to borrow for our immediate needs. That is what kills the \ngovernments that overspend, of which the U.S. Federal Government is \none. We need to have the balanced budget amendment that is in this bill \npassed, knowing that it is not going to be an immediate fix because the \nStates would have to ratify it.\n  More than half the States will have to ratify a constitutional \namendment. In that constitutional amendment we have an 18 percent of \ngross domestic product cap on Federal spending because that will put \nour fiscal house in order. We know that is long term. Certainly, we \nwant to get started on that long-term constitutional amendment fix \nbecause once we do it and once the States ratify it--and I believe they \nwill--then we will have the ability to assure future generations that \nwe will never be in the fix we are in now.\n  Today the Federal Government is spending 24 percent of GDP. The 40-\nyear average is 20.6 percent. We have about a 3-percent increase in the \nFederal spending level that is juxtaposed against a gross domestic \nproduct. If we put a spending cap of 18 percent in a constitutional \namendment, we will have time to start drawing that down so it will not \nbe an immediate hit. In fact, the bill that is before us has a gradual \ndecrease in the caps on spending. We have the constitutional amendment \npart, that is the balance part.\n  We also have a cap in the bill that is before us. It is not an \nimmediate cut, 18 percent, but it does ratchet down: 21.7 percent in \nthe year 2013, 20.8 percent in 2014, and so forth until we get to 2021 \nwhich would have a 19.9-percent spending cap as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product. It is a gradual cut between 2013 and 2021, in the cap \non Federal spending. I think that is a responsible approach, and that \nis why I am fully supporting this bill. That is the cap part. We have \nthe cut part that is real cuts. We have the cap part that puts the lid \non spending going forward, and then we have the balanced budget part, \nwhich goes to the States and goes through our constitutional process to \nput us in the same situation most States are in; that is, with \nconstitutional provisions that they have balanced budgets.\n\n  One of the most valuable economic lessons we have in this country--\nbecause we have learned from history--is we cannot spend our way out of \ndebt. That is the worst remedy. If you are a family in debt, you do not \nkeep spending and you do not put a freeze on spending either, which is \nwhat was suggested in President Obama's budget. He said: We will just \nfreeze at 2011 levels. But 2011 levels are inflated. Because of the \nhuge stimulus bill that was passed we have an inflated level and we say \nlet's freeze there. No; we need to freeze at a lower level. We need to \nstart ratcheting down the spending in this country in order to assure \nthat we start going toward a balanced budget. The Cut, Cap, and Balance \nAct is a reasonable way to cut spending now so we will not have that \ndebt ceiling lifted again because we will bring down the deficit and \nnot hit that debt limit again. So we bring down the deficits with \nimmediate spending cuts, then we go forward with a cap that starts at \n21.7 percent in 2013. Knowing we are at 24 percent now, we have to have \nthose immediate cuts to start getting down to the reasonable level.\n  There is one more thing we need to do that is not in this bill but is \nsomething that if we are going to have the long-term debt reduction, we \nhave to look at the entitlements and expenditures because our \ndiscretionary expenditures are roughly 30 percent of the total \nexpenditures of our country. So we know we are out of kilter right now \nin Social Security because the actuarial tables have not been kept up-\nto-date. When Social Security was passed, the average man lived to be \nabout 60 years old. Today, the average man lives to be about 77. We are \ngoing up--and thank goodness--with the life expectancy and quality-of-\nlife. So if we are going to get our fiscal house in order, we do need \nto address that. We need to have a very gradual increase in the \nretirement age.\n  I have proposed a Social Security reform bill that does adjust the \nCOLA, and it also has a gradual increase in the age of retirement. It \nstops at 69. The other thing the Gang of 6, or the Group of 6, did that \nI thought was very positive is, it put everything that depends on a \ncost-of-living adjustment in the Federal budget on a different \ncalculation that is determined by economists to be a more realistic \nspending gauge, and it is the CPI, the Consumer Price Index. The CPI is \nadjusted in the Group of 6 proposal that will bring down the costs and \nwill be a more realistic COLA, cost-of-living adjustment. So it is very \nimportant we look at that as one of the good parts of the Gang of 6, or \nGroup of 6, proposal because it puts it more in line with reality, and \nit also will save money on the other end on the long-term strategy that \nwe must have to adjust our fiscal requirements to meet the needs and \nthe revenues that are coming in. The tax cuts that are also in the \nGroup of 6 proposal will help spur the economy, and along with the \nspending cuts, will bring our debt interest requirements down. The \ncost-of-living adjustments are very minor but will have an impact over \nthe long term. These are some of the good things that are out there.\n  Let me say in conclusion, we have had several of our leaders make \nproposals. We had Senator Reid and Senator McConnell put out a \nproposal. Of course, there were critics on all sides of\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\nthat proposal. Then we had the Group of 6 that came out with a proposal \nand there were people who criticized that immediately. I think we need \nto take the nuggets of these proposals--which there are some very good \nparts of the Reid-McConnell bill and there are some very good parts of \nthe Group of 6 proposal--and let's not criticize people for putting \nforth ideas because that is how we start coming to a conclusion about \nwhat is the best proposal. To criticize the people who have come \nforward with very bold plans is a huge mistake, and I think it is \nunfair to those who have put something out to say: Oh, that is a \nterrible plan and we would never vote for it. Are you kidding? I mean, \nwe need to come together with all the plans.\n  I am supporting this one, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, which I \nthink came mostly from the House and some of our Senators. It is very \nsolid. I certainly think Senator Reid and Senator McConnell didn't want \nus to come to August 1 and have no endgame. So they were preparing \nsomething that has some merit. They have a 302(a) allocation in theirs \nthat is basically a cap on spending. We need to have that, and that \npart of their proposal is very sound. Then the Group of 6 has tax cuts \nas well as spending cuts and some adjustments in the mandatory spending \nside, the entitlements. We have to have those ideas all on the table.\n  Instead of being negative about everything, let's take some of the \ngood parts we like and see if we can come to a consensus on those. That \nis what we have to do if we are going to have an end result that will \nassure our obligations are paid sometime in August when the true debt \nceiling is hit. I think it is later in August. That is what is in \nconflict right now. I think it is later in August, and if we are going \nto meet those requirements that we have as elected Members of Congress, \nwe are going to have to find some way to get there with the reforms \nthat are necessary to give confidence to not only the people who hold \nour debt but to the markets that would assure that our economy is not \ngoing to collapse under the heavy burden of this debt. The reforms are \na necessary element to lift the debt ceiling or we will not be sending \nthe right message to our debtors nor to the people who might start \nhiring and getting this 9.2 percent unemployment down.\n  I hope we can have a very strong, positive vote on the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act. We need to address these issues. Let's put it all together \nand let's start talking about what we have to do when that debt ceiling \nis reached, and this is a good start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas \nfor her remarks, for her leadership, for her willingness to be involved \nin and support a variety of ways for us to meet the two goals we have \nbefore us, one of which is to make a significant step to reduce our \nFederal debt, to stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have; \nsecond, to do so in a way that honors the financial obligations of the \nUnited States of America, the most creditworthy country in the world.\n  The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, which has passed the House and has 37 \ncosponsors in the Senate--I am proud to be one of them--I think is a \nsuperior piece of legislation. I hope when we vote on it, it gets a \nmajority of votes in the Senate and becomes law. Before I speak about \nthe Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, I would like to speak for a moment about \nthose two goals that are before us as we consider our debt, consider \nour financial obligations, and consider all of them up against what is \nsaid to be a point on August 2 where the debt ceiling needs to be \nincreased.\n  As I think about those two goals, reducing our debt, honoring our \nobligations, I think about a friend of mine in Tennessee who pays his \nbills out of a cigar box. This is how it works: A bill comes in to my \nfriend and he puts the bill in a cigar box. Then another bill comes in \nand he puts that bill in a cigar box. Then the next week maybe some \nmoney will come in. So my friend will reach down to his cigar box and \nhe will pull a bill out and he will pay that bill. Then, when a little \nmore money comes in the next week, he will reach down and pull out \nanother bill and pay that bill. My friend pays his bills out of a cigar \nbox. Now what happens to my friend if he wants to go down to the local \nbank and says: I would like to borrow some money in order to pay all \nthe bills I have in my cigar box.\n  I think what the banker is going to say is: I am sorry, my friend, \nbut we are reluctant to loan money to you or, if we do, we are going to \ncharge you more for it because we don't know whom you are going to pay. \nYou might reach into your cigar box and pay the whiskey store instead \nof the bank. You might pay the grocery store instead of the principal \non your loan. You might pay the service station before you pay us. So \nbecause you selectively pay your bills out of your cigar box, you are \nnot a good risk. We are going to charge you more to borrow money or we \nare not going to loan you money at all. That is the risk we take if we \nplay around with this idea of the United States of America--the most \ncreditworthy country in the world--selectively paying its bills, going \nfrom being the most creditworthy country to being a country that pays \nits bills out of a cigar box.\n  There are three obvious reasons why we should not do that. Reason No. \n1 is, it is going to cost us more. Today, the United States of America \ncan borrow money for 10 years at about 3 percent. We are so \ncreditworthy--people trust us so much to pay our obligations--that they \nwill give us money for a short period of time at no interest. It is a \ntremendous advantage to us. The United States has the most risk-free \ncredit in the world, and I might add the most risk-free credit in an \nincreasingly turbulent world.\n  What if we decided after August 2, when we are told sometime in that \nmonth we will begin to not have enough money to pay all our bills, what \nif we decided not to raise our debt ceiling and that we would pay our \nbills out of a cigar box? We might say: OK. We don't have enough money, \nso we will pay China before we pay grandma her Social Security. Oh, \nbetter not do that. In fact, I saw a fellow in Portland, TN, on Monday \nand he said: What is this about my Social Security not being paid? I \nsaid: I think it will be paid. It might be two or three days, but the \ntelephone calls would come in and Congress will fix it and it will get \npaid. He said: It better not be 5 minutes.\n  So we might want to pay all of our Social Security benefits, but the \nPresident might say or the Secretary of Treasury might say: Well, we \nwill pay grandma her Social Security, but we won't pay the wife of the \nsoldier at Fort Campbell who is in Afghanistan on his third tour. That \nis not such a good idea. So maybe we won't pay the veteran's benefit. \nWe will pay the wife. That doesn't sound so good, either.\n\n  What about those 12 million, 15 million students who are headed off \nto college in the next few weeks with a student grant or a student loan \nfrom the government? Should we pay just those going to public colleges \nand let the private colleges take care of their own--just the for-\nprofits, not the nonprofits?\n  We see what could happen if we have a country that--especially a \ncountry such as the United States--instead of paying all of its \nobligations on time, whether it is to China or Japan or to grandma or \nto the veteran, begins to selectively pay those bills when we have the \nmoney. I think I know what would happen. Instead of being able to \nborrow money for 10 years at 3 percent, we might have to pay a little \nmore for it. Let's say it just went from 3 percent to 4 percent. What \nwould that mean to us? It would mean, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the taxpayers would have to pay $1.3 trillion more in \ninterest over 10 years. So if it goes up 2 percentage points to 5 \npercent, it is twice that. That is what happens when we pay our bills \nout of the cigar box.\n  It is not just the taxpayers. My son said to me the other day: Dad, \nmy mortgage loan resets in October. If you all don't work this out, it \nmeans my interest rate might go up.\n  Let's say he has a $100,000 house loan, and it goes up 1 percent. \nThat gets to be some money for him. So if it is a credit card loan, if \nit is a home loan--whatever loan it is, it would begin to go up. Paying \nour bills out of a cigar box would raise our costs.\n  There is a second obvious reason not to do this. In 2008, we were \nsmacked in\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nthe face with a world economic crisis. We didn't expect it. Most of us \ndidn't cause it, but we had to deal with it. Here in the Congress, we \nhad to do some very unpopular things: We had to bail out banks, even \nsome industries. The American people hated that, even though most of \nthe money has been paid back. We don't know what we averted--probably a \nmuch worse problem--but we are still suffering from what happened in \n2008. But we didn't do that deliberately.\n  In this case, if we were to deliberately go from being the most \ncreditworthy country in the world to a country that paid its bills out \nof a cigar box, we would be deliberately injecting uncertainty into a \nturbulent world.\n  Look at Europe, with the eurozone trembling over the debt in Portugal \nand the debt in Greece, with sovereign nations perhaps having to bail \nout European banks.\n  Look at Japan, the third largest economy, in a 10-year recession, \nwith a third of its powerplants closed after the tsunami, sweating \nthrough the summer, with an inability to sell their goods.\n  Look at China. China is a big success story, but it may be growing \ntoo fast. Its inflation is up, and it has a lot of unreported debt at \nthe provincial level.\n  Look at our markets. We make trades in milliseconds, and twice in the \nlast year we had sudden drops in the market which we couldn't explain \nfor months. Do we really want to inject this level of uncertainty into \nthe turbulence we have today and into the financial markets when we \nknow we could avoid it? I think not.\n  Then there is a third reason, and this is a purely partisan reason. \nMaybe it is not even appropriate to talk about it on the Senate floor, \nbut let's talk about it for a moment anyway.\n  The President has done a pretty good job of blaming his predecessors \nfor problems, but lately people have said: Mr. President, we don't \nblame you for the problems you inherited, but we do hold you \nresponsible for the decisions you have made to make it worse. You have \nmade it worse with the health care mandates and higher individual \nhealth care policies. You have made it worse with the financial \nregulations bill. You have made it worse by not sending over the trade \nbills. You have made it worse with the high cost of energy. You have \nmade it worse with your National Labor Relations Board appointments and \nundermining right-to-work laws. You have made it worse by doubling and \ntripling the debt.\n  People are listening to that. They agree with that. But what would \nhappen if the Republican Party or the Democratic Party or any group of \npeople have the primary responsibility for turning this country from a \ncountry that is the most creditworthy country in the world into one \nthat pays its bills out of a cigar box? The President will say--instead \nof us saying, Mr. President, you made it worse, he will say, you made \nit worse.\n  There is every reason in the world to regard the debt ceiling \ndecision we have to make as an opportunity to take a significant step \nto reduce the debt. We can do that while still honoring our financial \nobligations, and we should. And today we are talking about one of those \nways to do it.\n  Republicans have offered--with Democratic cosponsorship in a number \nof cases--at least five major ideas for taking a significant step \ntoward stopping Washington from spending money it doesn't have. There \nare five ways to do that:\n  There has been the Corker proposal, which is bipartisan and over 10 \nyears would bring our spending, which is the real problem, from its \npresent level--about 25 percent of our total output in the country--to \nabout 20 percent, which is the historical level.\n  There is the balanced budget amendment, which is the most obvious \nsolution for a nation that is spending more than it takes in. Families \ndo it, States do it--balance their budgets, live within their means--\nand the Federal Government can do it. Over time, we can get back to the \npoint where we were not many years ago, where we spend about the same \namount of money we take in. As Governor, I know that for 8 years we did \nthat. As a result, we have almost no debt in the State of Tennessee, \nand as a result of that, we can use our gas tax money, for example, to \npay for roads instead of interest on the debt.\n  Then there is a third idea that has bipartisan support; that is, the \nGang of 6, which came out this week. The President said it was a gang \nof seven. He thought I was in it. I would have to say with respect, Mr. \nPresident, I am a law-abiding citizen. I am not a member of any gangs. \nBut I support what they do because I think it is a serious, bipartisan \neffort to help stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have.\n  Then there is another proposal which has bipartisan support that \nRepublicans as well as Democrats have initiated. Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia has taken the lead on it. It is the 2-year budget proposal \nwhich would allow us time every other year to focus our efforts on \neliminating rules and eliminating regulations instead of adding so \nmany.\n  So there are four ideas we have suggested--in some cases with \nbipartisan support--where we can take a significant step to reduce our \ndebt while still honoring our financial obligations.\n  Today, we are talking especially about cut, cap, and balance. The \nlegislation that passed the House of Representatives with 234 votes \nthis week has come to the Senate floor. We are going to be voting on it \nin the next day or two. It has 37 cosponsors, and I am one of them. I \nespecially commend Senator Lee for his work on putting this bill \ntogether and doing it in a way that would attract the largest amount of \nsupport.\n  This is a very reasonable proposal. The cut part is to say that for \nthe first year, we would spend a little less than we did last year. \nNow, that is a reasonable proposal. The State of Tennessee, where I was \nonce Governor--the current Governor is presiding over a State that is \nspending $1\\1/2\\ billion less than it spent last year. Now, they don't \nlike to do that. There are some unfortunate consequences from it. But \nthey still balanced their budget, they are still getting along, and \nthey are hoping for the day when the economy recovers and they will \nhave more revenues coming in without raising taxes.\n  So step one is to cut what we are spending today in next year's \nbudget. Then we cap, according to the economic output of the country \nover the next 10 years, the amount we spend over those 10 years. Then \nthe third step is to balance the budget--the most obvious solution of \nall--over time, to say we are not going to spend more money than we \nhave coming in. This is our proposal to begin to control spending in a \ngovernment that borrows 40 cents out of every dollar it spends, a \ngovernment the economists tell us is costing our Nation 1 million jobs \nbecause of the high level of debt. This is an urgent problem. It \nurgently needs a solution.\n  In conclusion, almost all of us here in the Senate are good at making \nspeeches. That is one way we get here. But we have not become as good \nat the rest of our job, which is to get a result. The American people \nexpect us to do that. They have to do that in their everyday lives. So \nthey respect our principles, they respect our speeches, but they know \nour principles sometimes conflict, and in the end, we have to have a \nresult. We have to have a result here. We have to find a way, first, to \nsignificantly reduce the debt and, second, to do it in a way that \nhonors the financial obligations of the United States.\n  I have suggested five ways we can do that, including cut, cap, and \nbalance. In order to do that, it means each of us is probably going to \nhave to accept as a part of the solution an idea that is not our first \nchoice. But why should we be exempt from that requirement? That is what \nwe have to do in a marriage. That is what we have to do in a family. \nThat is what we have to do in a business. That is what we had to do in \ncreating the Constitution years ago. This Senate wouldn't exist if it \nweren't because of a grand compromise. Otherwise, how could we justify \ntwo Senators from Wyoming and the same number of Senators from \nCalifornia, which is so much larger?\n  To get a result, after we make our speeches, we need to be willing to \naccept some ideas that are not our first choice. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of several different kinds of ideas--cut, cap, and balance, \nthe Corker proposal, the Gang of 6 proposal. That is why I support the \nIsakson-Shaheen effort on the 2-year budget. That is the kind of \nattitude we need in the next couple of weeks.\n  Cut, cap, and balance is a good way to meet our two urgent goals: \ntake a\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nsignificant step to reduce our debt and do it in a way that honors our \nfinancial obligations.\n  We are perfectly capable as a country of fiscally disciplining \nourselves. We are capable of reducing our debt and of stopping spending \nmoney we don't have and, at the same time, avoiding turning the most \ncreditworthy Nation in the world into a country that pays its bills out \nof a cigar box.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we spend the day debating the \nRepublican plan to cut, cap, and kill Medicare, a plan that is dead on \narrival in the Senate, it has become obvious what the true question of \nthe day is. That question is, Will we as a nation allow ourselves to be \ndriven into default and financial calamity by a small group of extreme \nrightwing ideologues in the House GOP?\n  It has become increasingly clear that this group of ideologues has \ngrabbed the reins and is refusing to let go, no matter who tries to pry \ntheir fingers off. It is clear that this uncompromising group of narrow \nideological Congressmen is the one thing standing in the way of raising \nthe debt ceiling so our Nation does not default. It is the group that \nalone wants to drive the car off the cliff. We are now 11 days from \ndefaulting on our debt, and for the last few months this small group, \nfar outside the mainstream, has contributed nothing to efforts to reach \na compromise.\n  The House GOP has rejected every form of compromise, from the \nSimpson-Bowles plan, to the President's $4 trillion grand bargain, to \nthe McConnell fallback plan, to, as of yesterday, the Gang of 6 \nframework. Instead, they have offered dangerous schemes such as the \ncut, cap, and kill Medicare plan that passed the House yesterday. Their \n``plan'' would wreak havoc on our country's seniors and the middle \nclass. It is not a serious proposal, it will never pass this body, and \nit is a waste of time.\n  While reasonable people are trying to come to a compromise, the House \nGOP is becoming increasingly isolated. Yesterday, for example, my \ncolleague John McCain warned the House GOP that Americans do not want \nthe government to shut down and urged them to learn the lessons of \n1995. Then, close to a third of Senate Republicans signed on to a plan \nthat would combine major spending cuts with new revenues--a balanced \napproach the House GOP has sworn off. And every day more voters are \nabandoning them. As the L.A. Times reported this morning:\n\n       Republican resistance to compromise has turned a \n     significant bloc of voters against them . . . frustrated \n     members of their own leadership as well as establishment GOP \n     figures.\n\n  So the House GOP is being criticized from every corner.\n  Then today we have what must be the most significant departure to \ndate from the House GOP's fantasy-land. In a major development, antitax \ncrusader Grover Norquist told the Washington Post that letting the Bush \ntax cuts lapse would not constitute a tax hike. This is a development \nthe significance of which should not be underestimated. It is a \nrecognition from Norquist that the House Republicans are increasingly \nisolated and have painted themselves into a corner. Norquist is trying \nto signal to the House GOP that their no-compromise position is \nuntenable, deteriorating, and bad for their party and the country. The \nHouse GOP is on an iceberg that is melting into the ocean, and even \nGrover Norquist is offering them a lifeboat. The question is, for their \nown good and for the country's good, will they take it? I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to accept this lifeline. It is time to leave \ndefault-denier island and come back to reality.\n  The House Republican extremists--those who are way over to the far \nright--painted themselves into a corner, even to the right of Grover \nNorquist. Grover Norquist, the hall monitor when it comes to enforcing \nthe Republican Party's antitax pledge, has given House Republicans a \nhall pass. They should use it. This is a coded message from one of the \ntruest believers in the Republican Party that it is time for \nconservatives to step back from the brink.\n  Norquist has given us a potential path forward. If we decouple the \nBush tax cuts now by only extending them for the middle class and not \nfor millionaires and billionaires, we could have the foundation of a \ndeal that includes revenues but does not violate the Norquist antitax \npledge.\n  This decoupling strategy is what the President and Speaker Boehner \nwere entertaining earlier in the context of a grand bargain, but Leader \nCantor and other rightwing hardliners forced the Speaker to walk away \nbecause they feared violating the antitax pledge. But now a deal on \ndecoupling seems to have Norquist's permission, if not his blessing. We \nshould revisit it.\n  It is time to recognize that the quickest, most effective and \neconomically sound way to reduce our deficit and debt is a balanced \napproach that both cuts spending and raises revenues--a plan that \nmirrors every other successful deficit reduction deal in our Nation's \nhistory, a plan along the lines of the ones negotiated by Presidents \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton.\n  I hope my colleagues in the House GOP see the danger of the path they \nare going down and change course before they take the entire country \ndown with them.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask permission to ask my friend a question \nthrough the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, that the Senator served many years \nin the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Eight years.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator understands the difference between the \nprocedures in the House and in the Senate, does he not?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do, some.\n  Mr. REID. And in the Senator's years serving in the House of \nRepresentatives, he has seen how quickly things can move over there; is \nthat right?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is absolutely right.\n  Mr. REID. And coming to the Senate, the Senator has seen how slowly \nthings have to move here in the Senate; is that right?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Indeed. I have learned that hard lesson.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend through the Chair that I see what is \ndeveloping now as very, very bad for our country. It is hard to \ncomprehend--I ask my friend this question--it is hard to comprehend how \nthe House of Representatives, at the height of this fiscal crisis we \nhave, has decided to take the weekend off. Is the Senator aware they \nhave decided to take the weekend off?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have read that. Yes, I have.\n  Mr. REID. And it appears to me one reason to do this is to do \nindirectly what they cannot do directly; that is, we have--and I read \nthem here this morning--statements from my friend the Speaker, John \nBoehner, saying we cannot default on our debt; from the whip over \nthere, Eric Cantor--or majority leader, whatever he is, second in \ncommand--saying we cannot default on our debt. I am saying to my friend \nfrom New York that it appears to me they are going to do indirectly \nwhat they cannot do directly by not sending us whatever they decide to \ndo in time to get it done.\n  I think the country is staring in the face a default on our debt \nbecause of the House of Representatives being out this weekend. Would \nmy friend comment on that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. I think the leader has an excellent point. To not \nbe here this weekend when the Nation stares at the first default in our \n200-some-odd year history is amazing to me, that they would be gone. \nAnd when you think about it, either they do not care about defaulting \non the debt--and we know Speaker Boehner does care about that default. \nI think he is aware of what terrible problems it would create for this \ncountry for decades to\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\ncome. So the answer must be what the leader is saying; that is, they \nhope to jam us at the last minute with something and say: Take it or \nleave it, which is playing with fire.\n  I can assure my colleagues in the House that is not how we are going \nto play ball here. There has to be a fair compromise, not something \nthey come up with at the last minute and sort of toss it over here. \nThat could create default, and if they do it, it would be on their \nshoulders.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend through the Chair that they may send us \nsomething well-intentioned, but I am not sure they understand the rules \nof the Senate. There are a number of people who are Republicans over \nhere who have stated publicly that they think the debt should be \ndefaulted upon. As my friend knows, most everything we do here is by \nunanimous consent and, if not by unanimous consent, by the rules of the \nSenate, which are very strict and very difficult sometimes to \ncomprehend, but they are there.\n\n  So I am afraid that what is happening with the House leadership is \nthey think they can send something over here and, as the majority \nleader, I can figure out a way to get it done. I cannot get it done if \nwe have to follow the rules, which we have to follow, and I cannot get \nconsent, and I cannot get consent on most anything I do around here. So \nI would like my friend to comment on that.\n  I appreciate my friend saying that Speaker Boehner is a good person. \nI agree with that. But I am not too sure that this is not an easy way \nout for everybody over there, that they could say: Well, we did what we \nwanted to do. I am sorry the Senate could not do it, so I guess our \ndebt is defaulted upon, and we will close down all of the functions of \nthis government and wait for a better day.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, again, in answering the leader, first, the rules \nof the Senate would allow any single Senator--and we have a whole \nhandful--to delay things day after day after day after day. Second, \nthere are things out of any Senator's control. For instance, any \nproposal on an issue such as this would have to be scored by the CBO. \nWe learned on the health care legislation that CBO cannot just sort of \npush legislation into a machine and an hour later say: Here is your \nscore. It takes days and sometimes weeks. And the fact that just about \nevery procedural motion can be filibustered and delayed means we are \ngetting so close to the deadline that we would be in serious trouble.\n  Again, I repeat, I find it terribly disconcerting. It is hard to see \nanything but callousness toward the danger our Nation faces if we were \nto default by the House not being here this weekend because even a \nrudimentary knowledge of the House procedures--which I know the \nleadership of the House has--would indicate to them that if they do not \nget us something very, very soon and, in fact, they do not sit and \nnegotiate and compromise--which they have refused to do, driven by a \nhundred, perhaps, Congressmen, many of them new here, who sort of say: \nWe do not care if we default--the consequences of default would be \nenormous and staggering and would not just go away in a month or two \nbut would be with us for a decade. And here they are back home this \nweekend when America faces one of the greatest potential economic \ncrises that we have faced.\n  So I very much thank the leader for bringing this up and asking these \nquestions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I was witness a few minutes ago to an interesting and \ninformative exchange and wanted to comment on that briefly. Both the \nleader and the senior Senator from New York had some comments that I \nthink are important in the context of what is being discussed here \ntoday. But I wanted to come to the floor today because we have been \ngetting a lot of phone calls and letters from people back home who are \nwondering--people--what this is all about. These are folks who are out \nworking every day and raising a family and running their businesses. \nThey want to understand what the debate here is about. They get the \ngist of it, that there is this debt limit fight, and that Congress, if \nit does not do anything, may not be able to pay some bills beginning \nAugust 2.\n  But what is behind all of this? The best way to explain it to people \nis to equate it to the lives of real people in the real world.\n  Every single one of us as adults has a credit rating. In essence, \nthere are two or three companies out there that basically rate you as \nan individual. What they do is give you a credit rating that \ndetermines, No. 1, whether you are willing to pay back; and, No. 2, \nwhether you have the money to pay people back. Based on that you get \nsomething called a credit score. People are familiar with that. Every \ntime you try to go lease or buy a car or buy a house or anything on \ncredit, they are going to run your credit. It is going to tell them: \nThis is John Smith, this is so-and-so, and this is his credit rating. \nBased on that, people will decide whether to lend you money.\n  Countries have credit ratings too. It is based on two things. No. 1 \nis your history of paying people back; and, No. 2, on your ability to \npay them back in the future.\n  There are three major companies in the world that give credit ratings \nto countries--three major companies. What those companies are saying \nright now is we are looking at America and we are worried. We are \nworried about two things. They are worried about this debt limit issue, \nand the fact that if the debt limit is not raised, they are going to \ndowngrade us because we are going to miss payments on this, that, or \nthe other. They are worried about that.\n  But they are a lot more worried about something else. It is not our \nwillingness to pay back, it is our ability to pay back people who lend \nmoney to the United States.\n  Let me read you some of the quotes. This is from Moody's, which is \none of the top ones. They write: ``If the government avoids default, we \nwill likely affirm America's AAA rating.''\n  America has the highest credit rating in the world right now that you \ncan possibly get. They say: If we avoid default, they will likely \naffirm our AAA rating, but they will still assign us on something \ncalled a negative outlook, unless there is--this is the money line--``a \nsubstantial and credible budget agreement to cut the deficit.''\n  What they are basically saying is, if you raise the debt limit, you \nmay temporarily avoid being downgraded, but\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nultimately we are still putting you on a watchlist and we ultimately \nare still going to downgrade you unless we have a substantial and \ncredible budget agreement to cut the deficit.\n  What does that mean? They go on to elaborate. They say: The agreement \nshould include a deficit trajectory--basically a path of deficits--that \nleads to stabilization and ultimately a decline in your deficit, \nparticularly in how much money you owe compared to how big your economy \nis.\n  That is what they want to see, a plan in place that shows how we stop \ngrowing the deficit and then how we start reducing it. That is what \nthey are saying. Then they actually talk about specific numbers. They \nhave said, their analysts have said we think $1.5 trillion of cuts this \nyear--over the next 10 years--is a plan that is too little. We think $4 \ntrillion might be enough. That is from Moody's.\n  Standard & Poor's, the other rating company, wrote very clearly that \neven if the parties--meaning Republicans and Democrats--agree to raise \nthe debt limit, it may not be enough to avoid downgrade.\n  That is the second credit house. They are saying: Even if you raise \nthe debt limit, we may still downgrade you. In order to avoid a \ndowngrade, you need a plan that reduces annual budget deficits by at \nleast $4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  We hear the $4 trillion number again. This is the second rating \ncompany basically saying: Yes, the debt limit is a problem. What we are \nworried about is, do you have a plan to deal with the debt and the \ndeficit?\n  Then the third major company, called Fitch, wrote that they are \nlooking for an agreement on credible fiscal consolidation strategy in \norder to secure America's top credit rating, a triple A.\n  So the three major houses' rating which is what this is all about at \nthe end of the day, because if our credit rating goes down, interest \npayments go up on everything from your mortgage, to your car, but, more \nimportantly, on America's debt, which means we are going to have borrow \nmore money to pay the interest on the debt we already owe.\n  So we cannot allow our credit rating to go down. The three major \ncompanies that give us our credit rating are all saying the same. Here \nis what they are saying in plain English: The debt limit is a problem, \nbut it is the least of your problems. Your bigger problem is the debt. \nIf all you do is pass an increase to the debt limit and it does not \ncome with a serious, credible, substantial plan to deal with the debt, \nyou are in big trouble.\n  I would submit to you that the biggest issue facing us on this issue \nis not the debt limit. The debt limit is actually the easiest issue. \nThat is one vote away from being raised. Our biggest issue is the debt, \nand the fact is that as we speak, there is no plan in place to begin to \ndo anything about it. Our credit is in danger because of this. That is \nwhat we should be focused on like a laser.\n  What will a substantial plan look like? Let's take it from the words \nof these credit companies: It has to stabilize deficits and begin to \nshow how the deficits come down. We know that $1.5 trillion in cuts is \nnot enough. We know that $4 trillion might be enough.\n  This is what we need to do. How do you do this? How do you get there? \nIt is not rocket science. It is a pretty simple mix of two things that \nhave to happen. The first thing you have to do is you have to stop \nspending money at the rate you are spending. You cannot keep spending \nmore money than you have. If you are in debt and you keep borrowing a \nlot more money than you take in especially, it is only going to get \nworse. So you have got to control the amount of money you spend. Also \nwhat you have got to do is generate more money for government.\n  So if you can do those two things, if you can control how much you \nspend and you can generate more money for government, and you can do \nboth things at the same time, that is how you dig yourself out of this. \nThe debate we should be having here is how do you accomplish that.\n  On the do-not-spend side, we have two choices: You can either trust \nthat future Congresses will do what virtually no Congress in the \nhistory of this Nation has ever done; that is, control themselves. And \nI say this when Republicans were in charge, Democrats were in charge; \nthey have never been able to control spending. If you let politicians \nspend money they do not have, they will spend it, I do not care who is \nin charge. That is what history teaches us. So we can either trust that \nsomehow in the future Congress will not do that or we can put into law \nlimits on their ability to do that.\n\n  That is why I am for things such as a spending cap and a balanced \nbudget amendment, because I think if you do not have restrictions in \nplace, it is not going to happen. Almost every State in the country has \na balanced budget amendment. I come from a State where there is a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I assure you, I do not care who is in charge or how conservative they \nclaim to be. If you do not have laws in place that keep politicians \nfrom spending money they are borrowing, they will borrow the money and \nspend it. History will back that up.\n  The second is, how do you generate more money for this controlled \ngovernment? That is the crux of the debate we are having today. Some of \nmy colleagues believe the way you do it is you raise taxes, especially \non rich people. To some people this may sound appealing. Here is the \nproblem. It does not raise nearly enough money, if you could even \ncollect it. It does not raise nearly enough money.\n  From the only tax plans I have seen put out there by the \nadministration and some of my colleagues here on the other side of the \naisle, it adds up to less than 10 days' worth of deficit spending. We \ndo know, however, that these increases in taxes could kill jobs.\n  The other way you can generate more revenue for government--and it is \nthe way I think we should do it--is to grow your economy. You get more \npeople back to work, and so now more people are paying taxes. You get \npeople who are working to make more money because their businesses are \ndoing better and so they are paying more taxes. The government uses \nthat money not to grow government, it uses that money to pay down its \ndebt and control itself. How do you create more jobs and economic \ngrowth? You do it by encouraging people, not in this building but \noutside this building, to start businesses or grow existing businesses.\n  If you ask those people--not economists, not people on Wall Street, \nnot journalists, not professors, not politicians--if you ask people to \ncreate jobs: What would it take for you to start creating jobs again, \nwhat they are looking for is a tax system that is fair and regulations \nthey can comply with and then get out of the way and they will do what \nAmericans have always done. Those are our ideas.\n  Here is the problem. Even as we stand here today, there are few plans \non the table to do it. I have watched the President give press \nconferences. I have watched the President give speeches. I have yet to \nsee a plan from the President. With all due respect to my colleagues in \nthe other party in the Senate, I have not seen a plan from them either. \nThey are the majority party. They control this Chamber. They control \nthe Senate. I have not seen a plan from them.\n  A moment ago we heard this talk about we have to compromise. It is \nhard to compromise when the other side does not have a plan. What do \nyou compromise on? Where is your plan? You cannot compromise if only \none person is offering plans. There is only one plan that has been \nvoted on by any House to deal with this issue, and it is the one we are \non right now--cut, cap, and balance.\n  I would submit if you do not like cut, cap, and balance, if you do \nnot think we need to cut spending, cap spending, and balance our \nbudget, then show us your alternative. Or maybe you do believe we do \nneed to cut, cap, and balance, but you do not like the way this bill \ncuts spending, caps spending, and balances spending. Fine. Offer your \nversion of cut, cap, and balance. Let's proceed to this bill. Let's get \non this bill the House has passed. If you do not like it, change it. \nYou have got the votes here to do it. If you have got a better idea, \nbring this bill up and amend it and put your ideas on it.\n  But how could you ask for compromise? How could you scold Republicans \nin the House for refusing to compromise if you do not have a plan of\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nyour own? How can a person compromise if they don't have any ideas of \ntheir own? It is not a fair thing to say.\n\n  So I urge the leadership of the Senate and the President of the \nUnited States to offer their ideas on paper--put their ideas on paper \nand offer them so we can begin to work on this concept of compromise \nthey have offered.\n  We cannot compromise and negotiate with people who will not offer a \nplan. Why don't we vote to proceed to cut, cap, and balance--proceed to \nthis bill so we can debate it and they can offer their ideas on this \nbill. This is the perfect opportunity to do it. Stop negotiating in the \nmedia and through press conferences and start doing it on the Senate \nfloor, which is what the people sent us to do. I hope that is what will \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Richard Cordray\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, as we debate the best way to get \nour fiscal house in order, we must avoid, first of all, defaulting on \nour obligations while also working to make our economy stronger.\n  While our debt has been rising for several decades--and there is \nenough blame to go around--it has been exacerbated by the economic \ncrisis that has all too often turned workers and taxpayers into \ncollectors of unemployment insurance, housing assistance, and health \ncare assistance.\n  We must not forget that the economic crisis was brought on by a \nfinancial crisis that pulled our economy into a deep recession.\n  Some people in this Chamber--conservative politicians in Washington--\nlike to forget this financial crisis ever happened. But throughout the \nUnited States--in places such as Cleveland, Dayton, Chillicothe, and \nZanesville--fast-talking mortgage brokers in America steered Americans \ninto unfair loans that helped put our economy on the brink of collapse, \ncosting millions of Americans their homes and jobs.\n  While Wall Street has regained its footing, millions of Americans are \nstill struggling to finds jobs, stay in their homes, and afford health \ncare coverage. Businesses are struggling to access credit so they can \nhire new workers.\n  Thankfully, 1 year ago, we passed Wall Street reform. The President \nsigned the landmark legislation that was aimed at providing consumers \nwith protection from abusive rates, fees, penalties in mortgages and \ncredit cards.\n  The centerpiece of the bill--one of the centerpieces of the bill is \nthe creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is \naimed at giving consumers a voice as loud and powerful as Wall Street; \nfrankly, something this city is not used to.\n  Richard Cordray will be that voice. He is one of Ohio's most talented \npublic servants, who is strongly committed to protecting Ohio consumers \nand investors.\n  As Ohio's attorney general, he was a strong voice for Ohioans who \nstruggled during these tough times to stay in their homes, consumers \nwho faced unfair practices by big Wall Street banks who had deceived \nconsumers.\n  He has targeted institutions--including Fannie Mae--that hid material \ninformation from investors, in the process undermining pension funds \nthat provide retirement security for teachers, secretaries, police \nofficers, and janitors.\n  Coming from Ohio, he has seen firsthand how unscrupulous actors \nsteered Americans into unfair subprime loans that helped push the \neconomy to the brink of collapse, costing millions of Americans their \nhomes and jobs.\n  Rich took the unscrupulous actors, but he also worked closely with \nOhio banks, which are supporting his nomination to advocate the \nConsumer Protection Bureau because he played it straight and fair. He \nworked closely with them to promote financial literacy and craft \neffective, targeted legislation distinguishing traditional banks--those \nthat lend and are the lifeblood of any economy--from those banks \nengaged or those companies or Wall Street institutions that are engaged \nin predatory lending.\n  As he has been throughout his career, Rich will be a strong voice for \nconsumers as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau carries out his \nmission. It is a mission of bringing oversight and transparency to \nchecking accounts, credit cards, mortgages and student loans and \nensuring that our financial system continues to support job creation. \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is already starting to make a \ndifference. It is working to make sure credit card terms and loan \ncontracts are written in ways that regular people can understand--in \nplain English. It has earned rave reviews from industry and consumer \ngroups alike for the substance and process involved in creating a new \nmodel mortgage loan disclosure form.\n  The Consumer Product Financial Protection Bureau is helping our men \nand women in uniform, preventing them from being targeted by bad actors \ncommitting fraud and engaging in deceptive financial practices. You can \nsee them like vultures surrounding military bases as they do it--at \nWright-Patterson Air Force base in Dayton and other places.\n  When Rich was attorney general of Ohio, he was the first State \nattorney general in Ohio to take on unscrupulous bankers and sue a \nmortgage lender over foreclosure fraud. He recovered billions of \ndollars for Ohio.\n  I am proud to have worked with him to identify financial predators \nthat prey on homeowners facing foreclosure. When he was Ohio treasurer, \nhe worked across party lines to strengthen Ohio's finances.\n  Besides being a five-time Jeopardy winner, Rich is a great human \nbeing and a devoted family man. The challenges he will face in his new \nposition are great, but I know he will be strengthened by the support \nof his wife Peggy and twins Holly and Danny.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Richard Cordray to be head of the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. It will help consumers, banks, \nand our economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime during the quorum call be divided equally between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President and colleagues, I have been struck in the \ndiscussion about cut, cap, and balance that there has been virtually no \nmention--virtually no mention--of the No. 1 issue on the minds of the \nAmerican people, and that is jobs. What we need above anything else is \nto create more good-paying jobs. In this discussion about cut, cap, and \nbalance, the whole question of jobs has virtually not come up.\n  Now, what we know is that between the worst of this fiscal crisis and \nthe end of 2010 we lost 8.5 million jobs, and our country has only \nrecovered a small portion of those jobs. The fact is, many of those new \njobs that have been created don't pay as much as the jobs that have \nbeen lost. We also know millions of our people can't find full-time \nwork, and they have had to settle for part-time jobs to make ends meet. \nCut, cap, and balance virtually ignores that question.\n  I hear, for example, from our business community that they have a \nvery serious challenge in terms of generating sales. Sales are all \nabout middle-class folks coming into our stores and, in a consumer-\ndriven economy, making purchases. As we have seen a number of\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\ntimes, David Leonhardt--particularly over the weekend in an excellent \npiece in the New York Times--described how in one area after another, \nin terms of consumer durable goods, middle-class folks have essentially \nwalked off the economic playing field.\n  There is, however, one particular approach to job creation that has a \nproven track record--a proven track record--and bipartisan support, and \nit is one I hope the Congress will soon move to. I find that we have \nplenty of disagreement now in the Congress on a whole host of issues, \nbut whether one is part of the Warner-Chambliss group or any other \nparticular group, there is a sense that even though cut, cap, and \nbalance doesn't talk about it, job creation is the most important \nissue. The path to that--the proven path to that, Madam President--is \ntax reform.\n  The fact is, that is the one unused tool in the economic toolshed. \nThe Federal Reserve has thrown tremendous efforts at trying to boost \nthe economy. The Recovery Act was a path. Various steps have been taken \nwith respect to housing. Tax reform is the one area from the economic \ntoolshed that has not yet been picked up and actually used. I think the \ncountry understands what needs to be done. Certainly, the Congress \ndoes. We had the report from the Bush Commission--George W. Bush--that \nmade a number of excellent recommendations in their report. The Volcker \nCommission for President Obama had a number of sensible ideas.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with two very thoughtful \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--Senator Gregg, before he \nretired, and now Senator Coats--and we have picked up on the model that \npopulist Democrats and former President Ronald Reagan pursued in the \nearly 1980s. It was all about cleaning out scores of special interest \ntax breaks and using that money to hold down rates for everybody and \nkeep progressivity.\n  The reason I bring it up this afternoon--in the context of the fact \nthat I sure don't see any mention of cut, cap, and balance focusing on \njobs--is when Democrats and Ronald Reagan got together, the results on \njob creation were real, they were tangible, and we saw middle-class \npeople get a chance to get back into the economy and get back to work.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the 2 years after \nDemocrats and Ronald Reagan got together on a bipartisan basis to focus \non job creation, our country created 6.3 million new jobs--6.3 million \nnew jobs. Between 2001 and 2008, when tax policy was partisan, we only \ncreated about 3 million jobs. We have lost jobs in this last fiscal \ncrisis, looking particularly at the measure that I cited at the end of \n2010. So we have to get people back to work.\n  I see my friend from Iowa is here, and we have talked about tax \nreform on a number of occasions. Let me just cite an example of an \napproach on which Senator Coats, a Republican, and I have teamed up. We \ntake away the tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas.\n  Right now, there are a huge array of tax breaks for, in effect, \nexporting jobs, when the country wants to export goods and services--\ngoods made in the United States, where we add value to them in the \nUnited States and then we ship them somewhere. What Senator Coats and I \npropose is taking away those tax breaks for exporting jobs and using \nthose dollars for what I call red, white, and blue jobs--jobs that pay \na good wage in the United States so we can get full-time employment for \nsome of the folks so hard hit now who can't find more than 15 or 20 \nhours of work a week that doesn't pay a good wage so they can support \ntheir families.\n  Cut, cap, and balance doesn't raise those kinds of issues. It doesn't \nraise the fact that when we put people back to work, have good-paying \njobs in this country, that generates revenue Democrats and Republicans \nalike can support.\n  I know Senator Harkin has focused particularly on this question of \nwhere the revenue is going to come from to pay for our safety net with \nso many people hurting and falling between the cracks; tax reform that \nputs middle-class people back to work as we saw when Democrats such as \nDick Gephardt and former President Reagan got together that generates \nrevenue both sides can support, private sector job growth that puts \nfolks back to work and gets the middle-class consumer back into the \neconomy and back into our stores.\n  Look, for example, at the bipartisan proposal Senator Coats and I \nhave. The typical middle-class person can get $3,000, $4,000 worth of \ntax relief under our proposal, not by raising the deficit, not by \nspending more money, but by closing out some of these special interest \nloopholes. Where is that consumer going to go? They will have a chance \nin a consumer-driven economy to go back into the stores. Maybe they \nwill buy a washing machine, maybe they will buy a computer for their \nkids. They will go back into the economy and help, as we have seen time \nand time again over our history, to get our country back on its feet by \nmiddle-class people who have good-paying jobs going back into the \nmarketplace and helping our economy grow.\n  The numbers are striking. Again, after Democrats such as Dick \nGephardt got together with Ronald Reagan, in the 3 years after those \nreforms in the middle 1980s, Federal tax receipts for individuals and \ncorporations rose by $137 billion. That is the kind of revenue-raising \napproach that Democrats and Republicans alike can support. But we don't \nhear a word about job growth in the private sector under cut, cap, and \nbalance.\n  We hear a lot of technical terms about whether Federal spending ought \nto be 19.9 percent of gross domestic product or should it be 20 or 21. \nThose are important issues, but to their credit, one economist after \nanother has made it clear that we don't get to economic recovery in \nthis country just by cutting. We are going to have to do some growing.\n  Colleagues, we are going to have to do some growing. And, to me, to \nbe out on the floor talking about cut, cap, and balance and not paying \nany attention to a Tax Code that is a job killer rather than a job \ncreator for what I call red, white, and blue jobs in this country just \nseems to be a mistaken set of priorities.\n  The reality is, as Senator Coats and I have made clear in offering \nour bill, the Tax Code is larded down with so many special interest \ngoodies and sweetheart deals, and I just touched on one that we would \nactually be rewarding: the export of good American jobs. What we ought \nto be doing is taking away these foolish tax breaks and creating ones \nthat get the middle class back into the economy and get our companies \ninvesting in our country.\n  Now, it does not take a constitutional amendment to do what Dick \nGephardt, Ronald Reagan, Dan Rostenkowski, Bob Packwood, and a whole \nhost of Democrats and Republicans got together to do in the 1980s. It \nrequires Democrats and Republicans to work together to take on the \nspecial interests that currently benefit from the broken tax system.\n  Make no mistake about it. Those special interest groups are taking \ntax breaks that ought to instead go for real relief for hard-hit, \nmiddle-class families and American business to create jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I see colleagues on the floor. I want to wrap up with one last point, \nbriefly. I would not say for a second that tax reform is the only \ncomponent of economic recovery. Senator Blunt is here, and as chairman \nof the Trade Subcommittee on the Finance Committee, we have worked very \nclosely together on another important trade issue. What we have seen--\nand I know Senator Harkin is interested in this--is the Chinese have \nessentially been involved in merchandise laundering--some companies. \nWhat they have done after they have been found guilty of violating our \ntrade laws, instead of changing their practices and complying with the \ntrade laws, some of these Chinese outfits essentially go to another \ncountry and export through that country, and put on, for example, \n``Made in Korea''--big implications with these trade agreements--and \nend up shipping those goods to the United States.\n  Senator Blunt and his constituents have made the correct point that \nis again taking away jobs from middle-class folks. But we have to get \nback to the issue of jobs on the floor of the Senate. That is the most \nimportant question for our constituents.\n  Staff told me on the way over here that in a recent survey of \nbusinesses\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\ncites, again, their No. 1 concern is that sales are going down in their \nstores. I think everybody in the Senate knows you can often go to a \nstore on a weekend or an evening and you hardly see anybody there \nbecause middle-class people are very worried about what is ahead and \nsimply because of these economic times do not have the money to go in \nand buy those goods and arrange for those services that, in an economy \nthat requires they be in the marketplace, they simply don't have the \nresources for it.\n  So I hope my colleagues will oppose cut, cap, and balance. I hope \nthey will see the No. 1 issue in the country is jobs. Tax reform has a \nproven track record, colleagues--a proven track record: 6.3 million new \njobs in the 2 years after Ronald Reagan, a conservative President, and \nDick Gephardt, a populist Democrat, got together--a conservative \nRepublican President, a populist Democrat. That is the tool we ought to \ntake out of the economic toolshed and use as quickly as possible.\n  I hope we will move on certainly to tax reform in the fall, and I \nhope colleagues will remember that as we have this discussion about \ncut, cap, and balance. I think it misses the central question of our \ntime, which is job creation. For that reason, I oppose the bill.\n  Madam President, colleagues are on the floor. With that, I would \nyield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the President for recognizing me, and I will speak \nand then look forward to hearing the remarks of my good friend from \nIowa.\n  I agree with the simple premise of what Mr. Wyden had to say. I think \nprivate sector job creation should be the No. 1 target for the country \ntoday. Frankly, anytime we are not talking about that or what we can do \nabout spending, we are talking about the wrong two domestic issues.\n  I would suggest, however, it is not like the option today was to \nbring that bill he described to the floor. I would love to see it on \nthe floor. I would love to see a simpler, fairer, flatter more easily \nunderstood Tax Code because I do think certainty is one of the things \nthat makes a difference in that decision to invest. But I absolutely \nagree the No. 1 priority for the country at this minute should be \nprivate sector job creation. And I look forward, as he does, to working \non that.\n  My only fault I find with the premise that is not the reason to talk \nabout this is that is not what we were going to be talking about \notherwise. In fact, the week we were going to spend here that was \nsupposed to be the workweek during the Fourth of July, the bill the \nmajority brought to the floor was the Libya resolution, which I haven't \nseen since.\n  That was the week we were here to do something about spending, and \nthat is why we didn't do the other things we had scheduled because we \nwere going to talk about spending. The bill the majority was going to \nbring to the floor was the Libyan resolution, which was the most \nimportant thing in the world, apparently, that day, and we haven't seen \nit since that day.\n\n  So while I agree job creation matters, I don't agree that it doesn't \nmatter how much the Federal Government spends. In fact, I think there \nis a lot of difference in a country where the Federal Government is \nspending $1 out of $4 that the country can produce in goods and \nservices, or $1 out of $5. Now we are spending $1 out of $4.\n  For 40 years, before 2008, we spent $1 out of $5. In 2008 we didn't \nspend an average of 20.6 percent; we spent 19 percent. So we have gone \nfrom 19 percent of GDP spent by the Federal Government to 25 percent of \nGDP spent by the Federal Government, and it matters. That is why \nspending is the other issue.\n  What we are talking about with cut, cap, and balance is, How do we \nget that spending under control? If there is a better plan, I would be \nglad to see it. But I don't see a plan on spending control coming from \nanywhere else.\n  We all know we now have a record debt of almost $15 trillion, at \n$14.3 trillion and counting. We all know we have spent approximately \n$7.3 trillion and added almost $4 trillion to that debt since the \nSenate and President Obama passed the last budget the country had 813 \ndays ago. We all know unemployment has increased by 18 percent since \nJanuary of 2009.\n  In the 29 months since then, despite the so-called stimulus package, \nunemployment has been over 8 percent every month for 29 months, and it \nwas 9.2 percent in the month of June. We also all know that 40 cents \nout of every dollar the Federal Government spends is borrowed, and we \njust can't continue to do that. One option might be to raise taxes and \nthink that 40 cents would come in. I am not for that because I don't \nthink higher tax rates necessarily produce more tax revenue.\n  Until 1981, for 50 years the highest tax rates had been 70, 80, or 90 \npercent, and people don't pay that tax rate. People definitely don't \ntake a chance and invest in that tax rate. But the fact that we know \nmaybe most of all is we can't keep doing what we are doing now. The \nstatus quo is both unacceptable and unsustainable, and we have to look \nat what it takes, as Senator Wyden said, to meet the No. 1 priority, \nwhich is, What do we do that creates private sector jobs? I think \ngetting Federal spending under control is something that the moment, \nthe moment of August 2, creates an opportunity for us to talk about and \ndo.\n  Now, why was I one of the first cosponsors of cut, cap, and balance? \nIt is because I thought it had the potential, and I believe it has the \npotential, to do what needs to be done.\n  What was ``cut''? Cut was to go back not to 1980 spending levels, but \nto go back with nondefense discretionary to 2006--just to go back to \nwhat we were spending on nondefense discretionary in 2006. Rearrange \nthat as you may want to, rearrange that in a way that better meets 2011 \ngoals, but go back to that amount of money and then set caps.\n  By the way, in virtually all cases they were growing caps in various \ncategories of government spending for the next 10 years and working \nwithin those caps, but knowing every year what they were going to \nspend.\n  Then, the third element was, let's balance the budget. While I have \nalways been for a balanced budget and a balanced budget amendment, I \nbelieve now more than I ever have that it is the tool that ensures, not \njust 5 years from now, but 55 years from now that we just have to \nsimply get the resources of government and the spending of government \nin place. Forty-nine States, including my State of Missouri, have a \nbalanced budget amendment. Every family at some point or another has to \ndeal with the reality of a balanced budget amendment. These provisions \ntake us in the right direction.\n  President Obama has said he would veto this bill if it passed. It has \nalready passed the House. If it would pass the Senate this week, I \ndon't know that the President would veto it if he really was faced with \nthose options, but he said he would. I guess we might have to test \nthat. But we shouldn't not vote for this because the President said he \nis going to veto it. We should vote for this because it is the right \nthing to do to get the spending of the Federal Government under \ncontrol.\n  Missourians deserve better. Americans deserve better. Both parties no \ndoubt have contributed to where we are right now in our current \neconomic situation. Frankly, both parties have to find a way out. It \ntakes three things to pass a bill in Washington: It takes the House of \nRepresentatives, it takes the Senate, and it takes the White House. My \nparty, the Republican Party, controls one of those. Our friends on the \nother side control the other two. So how do any of us think we are \ngoing to get everything we want in this environment? But we have to \nwork toward the right result. I think cut, cap, and balance would \nproduce that result. I think we do have to get on with the work of \nbeing focused on what do we do to create private sector jobs, what do \nwe do to get this spending under control.\n  American families have to deal with this all the time. It is time \ntheir government dealt with it as well. I don't want to settle for \nbusiness as usual. We have a unique opportunity here. Are we going to \nbe like every other country, like Greece and Ireland and Portugal and \nItaly and so many countries in the world today? Or are we going to set \nout on a different path, a path that shows we are prepared to control \nand rein in Federal spending and do what is necessary to encourage \nprivate job sector growth? I hope we can join together and find a \nsolution. This is the moment we need to do it.\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\n  Madam President, I am looking forward to working with you and others. \nI know I am yielding the floor to my good friend, Senator Harkin from \nIowa. We are working together on the Missouri River working group. We \nare sponsoring legislation together for Special Olympics. We can find \nsolutions to these problems if we want to find solutions. That is what \nthe people we work for deserve. Let's find a way forward.\n  For me, the way forward would be cut, cap, and balance but I do know \nwe all have to work together or we are not going to arrive at any \nconclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I listened both to Senator Wyden and to \nthe remarks of Senator Blunt. They are both very thoughtful \nindividuals, thoughtful Senators. I enjoy working with both of them.\n  Madam President, why are Republicans refusing to agree to raise the \ndebt ceiling, something we have done 89 times since the 1930s, \nincluding 18 times under President Reagan? I might point out, the \nRepublicans at that time controlled the White House and the Senate and \nthe Democrats controlled the House.\n  Also, in September of 1987, President Ronald Reagan used his weekly \nradio address to urge Congress to increase the debt ceiling. He said--\nand here it is. I thought it was worth printing out. Here are the exact \nwords of Ronald Reagan spoken in September of 1987:\n\n       Unfortunately, Congress consistently brings the Government \n     to the edge of default before facing its responsibility. This \n     brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and \n     those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits. \n     Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would occur in \n     financial markets, and the Federal deficit would soar. The \n     United States has a special responsibility to itself and the \n     world to meet its obligations.\n\n  I didn't put it on here, but President Reagan went on:\n\n       It means we have a well-earned reputation for reliability \n     and credibility--two things that set us apart from the rest \n     of the world.\n\n  Today, so many of our friends on the other side, Republicans, \nconstantly invoke Ronald Reagan as a role model, almost as a kind of a \npatron saint. I wish they would heed his words and what he said in \nSeptember of 1987.\n  I also remind my colleagues when President Reagan realized that his \n1981 tax cuts were resulting in large deficits, he turned right around \nand supported corrective income tax increases in 1982 and 1984. That is \nright, President Reagan supported income tax increases in 1982 and \n1984. In stark contrast to President Reagan's example, today \nRepublicans reject any compromise that requires raising any new \nrevenues from the wealthy.\n  One of the things we are talking about is eliminating tax \nexpenditures. Those are special interest tax breaks that even Senator \nCoburn, on the Republican side, described as ``corporate welfare.'' As \nthe distinguished chair of the Budget Committee said in his remarks \nearlier today, Senator Conrad pointed out that tax expenditures now \ntotal more than $1 trillion, more than all of our discretionary \nappropriations in the Federal budget.\n  Here is the difference. The discretionary appropriations for the most \npart go out for programs such as health, education, research, \ntransportation, security, police, the judiciary--it goes out for that. \nWhat do tax expenditures go out for? They go out to support the \nwealthy. Here is why I say that. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans \nget 26 percent of the benefits from these tax expenditures. That is \nwhat Senator Conrad pointed out this morning.\n  Many of our Republican friends are perfectly willing, indeed eager, \nto slash Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, education, other programs \nthat undergird the middle class. But they have made it clear they would \nrather default on the debt than agree to a compromise that requires \nshared sacrifice from the most privileged people in this country.\n  The legislation before us, which is called cut, cap, and balance, and \nwhich should be more fairly described, as Senator Conrad and others \nhave said, as cut, cap, and kill Medicare, this bill that is before us \nnow would enshrine in the Constitution a requirement that two-thirds \nsupermajorities in both the House and Senate vote to raise revenues. \nFifty-one percent could cut spending but it would take two-thirds to \nraise any revenues.\n  What does that mean? It means as a practical matter that it would \npermanently lock in the benefits of the current tax breaks for the \nwealthy, such as the outrageous 15-percent tax rate for hedge fund \nbillionaires, and by building a firewall to protect tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans, this legislation would shift even more of the \nburden of deficit reduction onto the backs of middle-class Americans. \nReally, it should be cut, cap, and kill Medicare. That is what it is \nall about.\n  Let me take this a step further. In this bill before us that was \npassed over here from the House, it would cap Federal expenditures at \n18 percent of GDP. Where did they get that number? Is that an arbitrary \nnumber? Why isn't that 18.5? Why isn't it 19? Why is it 18? I will tell \nyou why. That number has a purpose. The last time Federal spending was \nat 18 percent of GDP was in 1966, right before Medicare kicked in and \nstarted expanding. So, guess what. They want to roll it back to a point \nin time before we had Medicare. This assault, now, on Medicare comes on \nthe heels of another Republican assault on Medicare. You remember the \nRepublican budget, the so-called Ryan budget. What was its centerpiece? \nA plan to dismantle Medicare, replace it with a voucher system that \nwould require seniors to spend $6,400 additional out of pocket for \nMedicare every year. It was basically the dismantling of Medicare, \nturning it into a voucher system. That was the Republican budget.\n  So now we have a two-front assault on Medicare by Republicans. One is \nthe Ryan budget, kind of a frontal assault, if you will, to dismantle \nit, turn it into a voucher system, and now we have the so-called \nbalanced budget amendment that takes an indirect backdoor approach. It \nwould simply defund Medicare. It would put the Federal Government in a \nfiscal straitjacket and allow it to spend no more than we did in the \nmid 1960s, before Medicare started. That is why it is at 18 percent.\n  I would say this legislation before us is also a direct assault on \nSocial Security, the bedrock of our American retirement system. It is \nvitally important to the middle class of America, to ensure that \nseniors are able to enjoy their retirement years without falling into \npoverty or moving in with their kids. Social Security's modest benefit, \naround $14,000 a year now, has become the biggest source of retirement \nincome for two out of three retired Americans.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I heard what \nthe Senator was saying about Medicare. Am I right about this? I know \nwhat some conservative politicians in this town think about Medicare. \nIn 1965 when Medicare passed, it was a lot of conservative Republicans \nwho opposed it. Later--I was in the House then. Senator Harkin was in \nthe Senate. But the first chance that Speaker Gingrich with the new \nRepublican majority had in the mid-1990s, they tried to privatize it. \nRemember, Speaker Gingrich talked about it withering on the vine.\n\n  Am I right, with the Ryan budget they tried to privatize Medicare \nagain and the public rose up against it a few months ago, so is this \nsort of a backdoor way of going after Medicare? They do not want to \nacknowledge to their constituents they do not like Medicare because 90-\nsome percent of Americans like Medicare and benefit from it. This is \nthis sort of backdoor approach to put these limits on spending so it \nwill force the privatization and unraveling of Medicare and ultimately \nSocial Security and these programs we care about?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think my friend from Ohio put his finger on it. Of \ncourse it is. It is a backdoor approach. We all want to have surpluses. \nWe don't want to have deficit spending. So it sounds good: We will \nbalance the budget. Most people say that sounds like a good idea, let's \ndo that, without looking behind this cap they put in of this 18 \npercent. Eighteen percent is a number picked by the Republicans because \nthat would take us back to where we were in 1966, before Medicare \nkicked in. It would throttle it, a backdoor approach as a way of \ndefunding Medicare and also as\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\na way of getting at Social Security, moving it to privatization, which \nthe Republicans never have given up on.\n  They started under Gingrich. My friend is right. I remember them \ntalking about privatizing Social Security. They have never given up on \nit. They cannot do it frontally but they are trying to do it through \nthe back door.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. If the Senator will yield again, imagine what \nwould have happened in 2003 and 2004 with the Senator in the Senate and \na lot of people all over the country--including a lot of Republicans \nall over the country, but not elected Republicans, when we were \nfighting the privatization of Social Security in 2004 and 2005--imagine \nwhat would have happened if so much of Social Security had been turned \nover to Wall Street. Imagine what would have happened if, in 2005, \npeople would have put all this money in Wall Street instead of their \nsecure lockbox, if you will, the Social Security fund, where nobody is \nmissing Social Security payments and people know what they are going to \nget. It is predictable, it is always there and always will be. If we \nput it in these private accounts, there goes the predictability and \nthere goes the solidness of Social Security, right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Another thing we ought to think about, I say to the \nSenator, is this: What the Republicans are saying--there are a lot of \nRepublicans who do not care if we default. They don't care if we \ndefault. In fact, Michelle Bachmann, Congresswoman Bachmann--who is one \nof their frontrunners for the Presidency--said she would never vote to \nincrease the debt ceiling no matter the circumstances. As President \nReagan said in 1987, it would mean that ``those who rely on Social \nSecurity and veterans benefits'' wouldn't get their Social Security \nchecks, and that is exactly right.\n  People have to think about this. If we default, that means all the \npeople who have put their money into Social Security in the past, what \nwe are saying is you may have put your money in there and guess what. \nWe are not going to pay you. Is that what we want to do as a country? \nSocial Security is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment--more than anything than Wall Street has ever gotten. Wall \nStreet can go under. The Senator is right, if we had put Social \nSecurity in the stock market it would be in the toilet now. But we put \nit into U.S. Government bonds because it is backed with the full faith \nand credit of the U.S. Government. That is why we have to support \nSocial Security. That is why we can't support this cockamamie scheme \nthey are trying to do here.\n  I thank my friend Ohio for pointing those things out. It is a \nbackdoor assault on Medicare and on Social Security. People are saying: \nWell, Social Security--we have to shore up Social Security. It is sound \nfor about the next 20-some years, but looking ahead, yes, we should \nshore up Social Security. One good way to do it is to raise the cap on \nSocial Security taxes. Well, right now the cap is $106,800 a year. What \ndoes that mean? That means if you make up to $106,000 a year, you pay \ninto Social Security on every dollar you earn. If you make over that, \nyou don't. Well, let me put it another way. If you make $50,000 a year, \nyou pay on every dollar you earn into Social Security. If you make \n$500,000 a year, you only pay on every 20 cents of every dollar you \nearn into Social Security. Why is that fair? Why is that fair that \nsomeone who makes $50,000 a year pays on every dime they earn, every \ndollar they earn, but someone who makes $500,000 a year only pays 20 \ncents on the dollar? If you want to shore up Social Security, raise the \ncap on payroll taxes. Raise the cap. That is something no one is \ntalking about. What are they talking about? Cut benefits. Cut the \nbenefits. Well, we don't have to cut Social Security benefits in any \nway. We just have to make it fairer in terms of how we raise the \npayroll taxes.\n\n  As I said earlier, the bill before us would require a two-thirds vote \nbefore we could even change that. So if we wanted to raise the cap on \npayroll taxes on Social Security, it would require a two-thirds vote. \nThat means we would never get it done. That means, yes, at some point \nwe would probably have to start reducing Social Security benefits. \nWell, again, as the Senator from Ohio pointed out, this is a backdoor \napproach to dismantling Social Security.\n  Republicans are rejecting any notion of shared sacrifice. They demand \nwe dismantle Medicare, slash Social Security, slash education, cut \ninfrastructure--all those things that undergird the middle class. They \nshred the safety net for the most vulnerable people in our society, as \nSenator Wyden pointed out earlier, but they insist on shielding the \nwealthiest people in our society from even contributing $1 to the mess \nwe are in.\n  Lastly, why are so many people here--to pick up on what Senator Wyden \nsaid earlier--obsessed with deficit reduction to the exclusion of the \nsingle largest priority we should have in this country: putting people \nback to work. That is the most urgent deficit we have--the jobs \ndeficit. Senator Wyden spoke eloquently about that.\n  My friend from Missouri, Senator Blunt, talked about that too. He \ntalked about private sector employment. Well, something has to happen \nto get that moving. It is not giving more tax breaks to the wealthy. \nThe old trickle-down theory, we tried that and it never worked. All \nthese big tax cuts we gave to the wealthy happened under George Bush \nand a Republican Congress. Look at the mess it got us into. We have \nbeen losing jobs for the last several years. Our jobs have been going \noverseas. It put us in a huge budget deficit.\n  One of the things we need to do now is not to turn a chainsaw on \nourselves but to recognize that the Federal Government can be a \npowerful force for stimulating the private sector. Again, one of the \nthings I think we need to do is to put more money into the \ninfrastructure of this country. We need to rebuild our roads, our \nhighways and bridges, and our sewer and water systems. We have hundreds \nof billions of dollars needed to remodel and upgrade our schools all \nover America. We need a new electric grid, a smart grid. We need to be \nputting more into green energy so we won't be importing so much oil \ninto this country. There is only one place that has the power to focus \non that in a large, comprehensive way, and that is the Federal \nGovernment. But then people say: We can't do that. We can't afford it. \nWe don't have any money. Well, they are right.\n  So there are two ways we can get these wheels of our economy going \nagain: We can either borrow the money or we can raise the revenue. I \nwould prefer that we raised the revenue. There is plenty of it out \nthere. The businesses in America are sitting on, I have heard, anywhere \nfrom $1 trillion to $2 trillion that they are not investing. Well, if \nthey are not investing it, I know where to invest it. Let's put it out \nthere rebuilding the infrastructure of America.\n  Now, that is not the government doing the work; it is simply the \ngovernment providing the input so that the private sector can go to \nwork. It is not government workers out there who would be building the \nroads, bridges, highways, remodeling our schools, and rebuilding the \nnew electric grid. No, this is the private sector doing it, but we can \nmarshal the forces from the Federal Government, marshal the power to \nfocus the funds in that direction to rebuild America, to make it a more \nenergy efficient, a better educated, a more innovative, technologically \ncompetent future for our kids and grandkids. Once we start doing that, \nthen other elements of the private sector will take off because they \nwill see we have made a commitment to the future, the growth of this \ncountry--not a dismantling, not a withdrawing, not a shrinking, but, as \nSenator Wyden said, a growth. Once the private sector sees we have made \na national commitment to growth, they will start investing.\n  How many times do we have to learn that the investment we have made \nin infrastructure has spun off into all kinds of private sector \nentrepreneurship and jobs and new businesses or research, the money we \nhave put into research and how that stimulates the private sector?\n  How many times have you heard this old Republican line--I hear it all \ntime--the government doesn't create wealth, it consumes wealth. I hear \nthat all the time. Well, that is nonsense.\n  Just about a month ago, I had a hearing before my committee, the HELP \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over the National Institutes of \nHealth. We\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nhad the National Institutes of Health here, and Francis Collins, who is \nnow the Director of it, brought us up to date on what the NIH is doing. \nHe pointed out something very interesting. Some 20 years ago, we began \nto invest taxpayer money--your money, taxpayer dollars--into something \ncalled mapping and sequencing the human gene. It was called the Human \nGenome Project. It became the Human Genome Institute at NIH. After 12 \nyears, they finished the process of mapping and sequencing the human \ngenome.\n  The Battelle Institute--a research institute that is privately owned, \nnot government, based in Ohio--did a study of what happened because of \nthat. We invested $3.8 billion in mapping and sequencing the human \ngene--$3.8 billion. The Battelle Institute said: In the last 8 to 10 \nyears, that $3.8 billion of taxpayer money invested in research \nresulted in over $790 billion of private sector investment. Let me say \nthat again: $3.8 billion of taxpayer money resulted in $790 billion of \nprivate sector investment. Tell me again that the government can't \ncreate wealth. Of course, it can because it can marshal the kinds of \nresources that this sector or that sector can't do. No private entity \ncould have mapped and sequenced the human genome. Well, they probably \ncould have, but it would have taken 40 or 50 years to do it. It took \nthe massive power of the Federal Government to get it done, and in a \nshort period of time.\n  So, again, this is what we ought to be thinking about: How do we \ncreate jobs? How do we put people back to work? I say it is by making \nsure we have the revenue to invest. We can invest in our \ninfrastructure. I don't mean just the physical infrastructure, I mean \nalso the human infrastructure. That means education and job training.\n  I just saw a figure the other day. This year, we are spending--of the \ntaxpayer money--$14 billion training Iraqi and Afghanistan security \nforces. That is for training, $14 billion this year. Yet here in \nAmerica, for all of our job-training and retraining programs for the \nentire country--all job-training programs--we are spending less than \n$10 billion. Do you think the American people think that is wise? Do \nyou think they don't know this? There is $14 billion going to Iraq and \nAfghanistan to train their security forces while less than $10 billion \nis going to retrain our workforce for jobs of the future.\n  Well, I see others have come to the floor, so I will wrap this up.\n  Deficit reduction is important--I am not saying it isn't--but it is \nnot the single most important thing right now. The single most \nimportant thing is to put people back to work. As Senator Wyden said, \nthat will start to create the demand. It will spur more private \ninvestment as the Federal Government begins to invest in the future of \nthis country. That is where we ought to be focusing. Once we get the \nwheels going again, once we get people back to work and the economy \nstarts to grow, that is when we start to reduce the deficit. To just \nfocus on deficit reduction right now to the exclusion of putting people \nback to work reminds me of when doctors used to put leeches on people \nwho were ill. It only made them more ill because it drained more blood \nout of their system. And most times it proved fatal, as it did to our \nfirst President, George Washington. Our urgent, No. 1 priority must be \nto create jobs and put people back to work. We shouldn't just turn a \nchainsaw on ourselves.\n  I look at this Republican cut, cap, and kill Medicare proposal we \nhave before us, and what I see is a budget predicated on fatalism--\nfatalism and fear of the future. We need a budget that is predicated on \nhope and aspiration, of putting our people back to work.\n  So put the ideology aside. Come together in a spirit of compromise \nfor the good of this country to have a balanced package--balanced--\nspending cuts that will take place in the mid-and outer ranges of our \nyears and revenue increases now so we can take that money and start \nputting people back to work rebuilding both the human infrastructure \nand the physical infrastructure of this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 2560 be equally divided between the majority \nleader and the Republican leader or their designee and that Senators be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the cut, cap, and \nbalance legislation. I plan to vote yes on Saturday morning to proceed \nto this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. I would also \nlike to explain why I think that is important.\n  Most of us understand what this bill does. It cuts spending next year \nby more than $100 billion. These are real savings and not smoke-and-\nmirrors. It caps total Federal spending as a percentage of the economy, \nand it puts us on a path to keep spending at 19.9 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. Right now, our Federal spending is at 25 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. Our revenues are at roughly 15 percent, so \nthere we have a 10-percent deficit totaling $1.5 trillion this year \nalone. Of course, those cumulative annual deficits make up our debt, \nwhich is now approximately $14.4 trillion.\n\n  This piece of legislation also links an increase in the debt ceiling \nto passage of a joint resolution to balance the budget, and this is an \nimportant amendment to the Constitution that is being proposed. I \nbelieve we have amended the Constitution 27 times so far. This is a \nprocess the Framers of our Constitution embodied in the original \ndocument to allow Congress and the American people to amend the \nConstitution as circumstances change. Clearly, it is obvious to anyone \nwho will look and pay attention that Congress has shown itself unable \nto constrain its spending and live within our means and to spend only \nthe money we have as opposed to money we borrow from future \ngenerations. As important, this constitutional amendment--this balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution--is not an extraordinary thing. It \nmay be for the Federal Government, but 49 different States operate \nunder a balanced budget requirement.\n  I support the cut, cap, and balance legislation because it meets the \nthree primary criteria I am using to evaluate proposals related to the \ndebt ceiling. The first of those three criteria is, No. 1, we must not \ndefault. That is not an option. Also, we must not lose the Federal \nGovernment's AAA credit rating. No. 2, we must not increase the tax \nburden on job creators during a fragile economic recovery. This is not \njust my position; this was the President's position last December when \nthe expiring tax provisions were extended for 2 more years. No. 3, we \ncannot resort to smoke and mirrors in the hopes of somehow fooling \neither the credit rating agencies or the American people that we are \nserious about the spending problem Washington clearly has.\n  Cut, cap, and balance earned bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I applaud the courage of those who crossed the \naisle to support this legislation in the House. I hope we see a similar \ndemonstration of bipartisan support for this proposal in the Senate.\n  I know some of our colleagues on the other side are dismissive of \nthis piece of legislation. I believe the previous speaker--I wasn't \nhere for most of his comments, but I did see his chart--is fairly \ndismissive of this proposal. For those colleagues who are critical of \nthis proposal, my question for them is this: Where is your plan? Where \nis your plan? To criticize what responsible Members of Congress are \ntrying to propose as a solution to a problem when they have no plan of \ntheir own is irresponsible, in my opinion.\n  The House of Representatives passed a budget earlier this year but, \nunfortunately, it has been more than 800 days since the Senate has \nadopted a budget--800 days. That is approaching 3 years. When asked, \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid, said it would be foolish for the \nSenate to pass a budget. I think he was saying that not because he \nbelieves it is foolish to have a budget, but perhaps he thought by \nattacking the House plan, while having nothing to propose on his \nbehalf, gained some marginal political advantage.\n  President Obama has ignored his own debt commission for months and \nthe debt problem. We know last December his fiscal commission, the \nSimpson-Bowles commission, rendered a very\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nimportant report documenting in sobering detail the debt problem the \nFederal Government has--unfunded entitlements, as well as our tax \nsystem, which makes very little sense and makes us noncompetitive \nglobally. It is our corporate tax system which encourages--because it \nmakes economic sense--businesses here in the United States to create \njobs overseas where it is more efficient, it is cheaper to do so, and \nwhere it affects their bottom line in a positive way. Why wouldn't we \nwant to encourage job creators to create jobs here at home by reducing \nthe disincentives and providing an incentive for job creation here in \nthe United States? Until recently, the President has shown very little \ninterest in that recommendation of his own deficit commission.\n  We know when the President proposed his own budget in February--this \nis a budget never taken up by a Democratically controlled Senate either \nin the Budget Committee on which I serve or here on the floor--the \nPresident's own budget proposed in February would actually make our \ndebt problem worse, not better. That is why, when we had a vote on the \nPresident's proposed budget a few weeks ago--not because our Democratic \nfriends proposed it and brought it up for a vote but because our side \nof the aisle asked for a vote on it--it failed 97 to 0. None of our \nDemocratic colleagues saw fit to vote for the President's budget \nproposal because they know it makes the problem worse, not better.\n  The President finally got engaged a few weeks ago. But the problem we \nstill have is we don't know what the detail of the President's proposed \nsolution to the plan is. He will not say publicly in detail what his \nplan is. Unfortunately--and this is sort of the nature of the beast--\nall the negotiations so far that apparently are still continuing are \nbehind closed doors. If there were a grand bargain to be, I am \nconfident what would happen is it would be rolled out on the floor of \nthe Senate or in the House at the last minute, without adequate time to \nreview it or to debate it or for the American people to read it and see \nhow it affects them and to give us feedback. We are representatives of \na constituency, and the 25 million people I represent in Texas would \nlike to have a chance to read it and then tell me what they think about \nit.\n  We know so far the American people are in the dark about the \nnegotiations, and that is not a good way to do business. That does not \nhelp gain public confidence in what Congress is trying to do in dealing \nwith a very serious problem.\n  Last week, I believe it was the Press Secretary at the White House \nwho actually said that ``leadership is not proposing a plan for the \nsake of having it voted up or down.''\n  I think that is a bizarre statement. A person offers a plan because \nthey believe it offers a solution to a problem, not because of some \nfear of having it voted up or down. That is, in fact, how our system \nworks. The majority rules. But, unfortunately, the President's \nleadership style is captured perfectly in that statement, and I think \nit sums up what is wrong with what is happening here in Washington.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of the challenge before us, and it is \nnot the debt ceiling; it is the debt. I think those who think it is not \nreal are just whistling past our fiscal graveyard.\n  Here is what one of the credit agencies, Standard & Poor's, said just \nthis morning, according to Reuters. They said:\n\n       If an agreement is reached to raise the debt ceiling but \n     nothing meaningful is done in terms of deficit reduction, the \n     U.S. would likely have its rating cut to the AA category.\n\n  Such a downgrade would have an immediate effect on other securities, \nas Standard & Poor's said:\n\n       We would downgrade the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . \n     . . the AAA rated Federal Home Loan Banks, and the AAA rated \n     Federal Farm Credit System Banks, to correspond with the U.S. \n     sovereign rating. We would also lower the ratings on AAA \n     rated U.S. insurance groups, as per our criteria that \n     correlates insurers' and sovereigns' ratings.\n\n  What would be the impact if these credit rating agencies--which seem \nto have an oversized influence on our lives but they are what they \nare--what would be the impact of them downgrading the quality rating of \nour national debt? We know it would yield higher interest rates for \nAmerican families, for small businesses, and for the U.S. Government. \nIn fact, we know interest rates are at a historic low now because of \nFederal Reserve policy, primarily. Those low interest rates we may \nthink are a good thing and they have provided some glimmer of hope for \nour struggling economy. But if they were as a result of a downgrading \nof our debt by these credit rating agencies or by a default which, to \nme, is unthinkable--just a 1-percent increase on the cost of credit we \nwould have to pay to people who buy our debt--just a 1-percent increase \nover current rates would mean $1.3 trillion over 10 years.\n\n  So the results of cuts in the billions of dollars are chicken feed \ncompared to what the credit rating agencies could wipe out almost \nimmediately by downgrading our debt. This is what we are risking by not \ndealing with this problem. This is what we are risking by political \ngamesmanship rather than trying to work together in a bipartisan basis \nto solve this threat to our country and to our future.\n  As the economist Larry Lindsey wrote in the Wall Street Journal last \nmonth:\n\n       If interest rates rose to their historical average over the \n     next 2 decades of 5.7 percent, our cost of borrowing would be \n     $4.9 trillion higher over the next 10 years.\n\n  So we are left with the obvious question: How can we stop this \neconomic calamity? We can pass this cut, cap, and balance plan or the \nPresident or our friends across the aisle could propose something they \nconsider just as serious and just as credible, but we have to do it \nquickly. So this deadline of August 2 is one we should not flirt with, \nwe should not play with, we should not ignore. We have to deal with it, \nand we can't just deal with it by raising the debt ceiling because as \nwe have seen from the credit rating agencies, that doesn't solve the \nfundamental problem. We need to solve the fundamental problem of \nunsustainable debt or our economic future will not be one of hope and \noptimism, as the Senator from Iowa was saying earlier; it will be bleak \nindeed, and it will be our fault.\n  I see my colleague from Kansas, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding I am recognized \nfor 15 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair, Senators \nmay speak up to 10 minutes each under the previous order.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I see. If I hit 10 minutes, I might ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 5, and seeing the smile on the Presiding \nOfficer's face, perhaps he will be conducive to that request. I also \nwish to associate my remarks with the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Every generation confronts challenges. The greatest generation \ndeclared victory over fascism and imperialism. The next generation \nfaced down an enormous competition between the United States and its \nway of life based on free markets, private ownership, and free \nexpression on one hand; and the Soviet Union and its way of life based \non central planning, collectivization and police state control on the \nother. Again, victory belonged to America and the free world.\n  A new generation in America has now come of age since the Soviet \nsystem collapsed. It is a generation that too often, in my opinion, \ntakes for granted the hardship and sacrifice of our forebears. It is \nthis generation that must confront the crippling $14.3 trillion debt--\nand climbing. We have met the enemy and he ``is'' us. The enemy today \nis our unsustainable debt, as has been pointed out by speaker after \nspeaker on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am privileged to represent the people of Kansas and the people of \nKansas are rightfully angry over the endless posturing and all the \nrhetoric and all the fingerpointing regarding yet another increase in \nthe national debt. That is right, another increase in the debt limit. \nHere we are again trying to reach agreement. I wish the President and \nthe House leadership well in their current talks. I wish the Senate was \nengaged. We certainly don't need to kick the can down the road any \nfarther.\n  We are faced with one issue; that is, to rein in spending. Let me \npoint out\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nthat in 2 years, the debt limit was raised nearly as many times as it \nwas in 8 years under the previous administration. It should come as no \nsurprise that the American people in general, and those in Kansas in \nparticular, reject these current spend-thrift policies.\n  I, from the first, decided it was time to stand up to spending, \ndeficits, and debt. I am talking about the time when we were \nconsidering TARP, and we went through that very difficult time when \nmany in the administration--the previous administration--indicated if \nyou did not vote for TARP you were taking a very dangerous road.\n  I must confess, I have written a lot of speeches down through the \nyears of public service I have been privileged to have. It is that old \nline of somehow or other we have to set our fiscal house in order not \nonly for us but for our kids and grandkids. How many times do we have \nto say that? How many times do we have to give the speech? I decided no \nmore during the TARP consideration. I voted no.\n  I remember the time when the administration folks came in to visit \nwith me to convince me to vote yes. I said: Can you explain to me what \na credit default swap is? I had not really heard that term before. They \ncould not. They said they did not have enough time to do that. I just \ndecided to vote no. I opposed TARP. I opposed the bailouts. I opposed \nthe stimulus. I opposed Dodd-Frank. I opposed ObamaCare. And I oppose \nany increase in the debt limit without real, tangible cuts in \ndiscretionary spending and meaningful, structural reform to mandatory \nspending.\n  I do not challenge the intent of people who promoted all of these \nthings, but the result has been an incredible increase in our national \ndebt.\n  Remember the line: Did you read the bill?--that was the question \npeople got when they went back home, faced up to the folks back home, \nespecially with the health care bill. All of a sudden people became \naware of the regulations and all the problems--now we have a hurricane \nof regulations pouring out of the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Now the question from folks back home is: Have you read the \nregulations? If we add up the costs of regulations, for goodness' \nsakes, clear back in 2008 alone it was $1.78 trillion in cost to the \nAmerican public. Figure that in regards to the debate about the \nnational debt. That was back in 2008. Think what it is today. It is \nprobably twice that amount. So, consequently, we really have a problem.\n  Now, since last November the President has spoken to this issue. As a \nmatter of fact, he has spoken rather continuously at the White House \nand campaign rallies. The problem is, there is no specific plan.\n  I know Republicans in the House are getting a lot of criticism for \ntheir plan. At least they have a plan. The cut, cap, and balance plan \nhas received, as I said, a lot of criticism, but at least it is there. \nOn the other side of the aisle we just do not find anything. There is \nno specific plan at all. We call that in Dodge City: Big hat, no \ncattle.\n  The President's first opportunity to put words into action came in \nFebruary when the White House submitted its budget request: $3.73 \ntrillion. It was estimated to add another $1 trillion to the debt. \nObviously, that did not work. That proposal was defeated 97 to 0 in the \nSenate. Not too many bills get defeated 97 to 0.\n  Then, all of a sudden, now, we got into the tax situation. Maybe if \nwe just got involved in a little more revenue enhancement--that is what \nwe call it here; it is called taxes back home. Taxing is not the \nproblem; the problem is spending money we do not have.\n  In May, the President's budget was, as I said, defeated. And rightly \nso. So here we are, more than halfway through the calendar year, 2 \nmonths away from the end of the fiscal year, and still no budget from \nthis body--over 800 days. Meanwhile, we have met the $14.3 trillion \ndebt ceiling, and it is climbing. Rather than make meaningful cuts and \nmeaningful reforms--specific reforms--the White House and some in the \nSenate want to increase the debt ceiling again.\n  Again, we have met the enemy, and he is us.\n  Mr. President, $14.3 trillion--it is a sum so large that it is \ndifficult to understand. Kansans with whom I visit and who call my \noffice express shock we have allowed it to get to this point. How did \nwe get to this point? Then, if, in fact, we kick the can down the road, \nwhat does it mean in regards to--as the Senator from Iowa pointed out--\nthe faith and optimism in our country? What does the future hold for a \ncountry that acts this way?\n  Paying down the debt should be bipartisan. What would Presidents \nTruman and Eisenhower say of a $14.3 trillion debt? I think they would \nbe pretty harsh. Both Presidents had pretty tough quotes in regards to \nfiscal responsibility. What we need in this Chamber, what we need in \nWashington is a very strong dose of common sense and a sense of \npurpose, as evidenced by previous Presidents when they put leadership \nfirst.\n  Here are the facts. They are stubborn things. They are clear. We \nborrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend. A lot of people hear that. \nThat is climbing. It is going to be 41 cents pretty quickly.\n  There is a lot of talk about tax breaks for corporate jets. Boy, am I \ntired of that. I am tired of this class warfare stuff in regards to \nsaying: If we just apply taxes to a certain, small segment of the \neconomy, or maybe a big segment like oil and gas--the bad guys, the fat \ncats--boy, if we get them, we can sure solve the problem.\n  Let's take corporate jets, which I would emphasize represents general \naviation. It is called general aviation because the general public uses \nit. It is not all Hollywood stars. It is not all rich people using \nthese so-called corporate jets. General aviation--it is the people who \nhave to get from here to there because for 90 percent of our airports, \na commercial flight does not land there.\n  What if you have a plant? What if you are a manufacturer? What if you \nare a farmer? What if you are a rancher and you have to visit several \nplaces in the country at one time, say, 5, 6, 7, 8, maybe 30? That is \nwhat general aviation is all about.\n  As a matter of fact, in the stimulus, the President recommended an \nextension of this same tax depreciation schedule. Now he is blaming the \nfat cats in regards to taking advantage of corporate jets. That is \nnuts. What the left hand giveth, the left hand taketh away in regards \nto this class warfare rhetoric. We make these jets in Wichita. They are \ngreat airplanes, and they service the general public for the public \ngood.\n  According to Charles Krauthammer, the renowned columnist, if we \ncollect the corporate jet tax every year for the next 5,000 years, we \nwould cover only 1 year of the debt the President has run up--1 year.\n  The general aviation industry will persevere, but we have come \nthrough some tough times. We are coming in on a wing and a prayer--that \nold World War II song that is almost revered. So we will persevere. But \ncan't we end this class warfare business? My Lord, the President talked \nabout it six times in two paragraphs. As I say, again, that is the same \nindustry he tried to help in the stimulus.\n  Here is another fact: Every cent of taxpayer money is used to pay for \nentitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt. All \ndiscretionary spending is borrowed. That is where we are headed; that \nis where we are at.\n  On average, we accumulate $4 billion in debt each day. It would cost \neach citizen $46,000 to pay the debt off. That means a family with a \nhusband, wife, and two kids would owe $184,000. That is rather \nstartling to Kansas families. They do not have that kind of money. I \nknow perhaps some would say that is apples and oranges with the \nfunction of government and the function of families, but it is a good \nillustration.\n  We have gone over 800 days--I think it is 810 now--without a budget \nin the Senate of the United States. During that time, this country has \nspent $7.3 trillion. We have spent $439 billion in interest on the \nmoney we have borrowed.\n  We do not have regular order. If Robert C. Byrd were here today and \nsitting in that chair, he would be appalled. He would be making a \nspeech in louder terms than I am, with short sentences, and he would \npoint out we are not doing our duty.\n  It used to be that we would have a budget. Then we would have \nappropriations bills. Then we would have the\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\ncommittees of jurisdiction meet those budget demands, meet that number. \nThen we would debate it on the Senate floor. Members would have an \nopportunity to bring amendments. That is how we worked. We do not work \nthat way anymore. There is no regular order anymore.\n  What we do is bring up huge bills such as Dodd-Frank and the health \ncare bill, usually written in private, and then we vote on it. Then the \nAmerican public says: Have you read the bill? Then they say: Have you \nread the regulations?\n\n  We have to restore regular order and restore the Senate back to the \nSenate. People are fearful. The American public is fearful today. They \nhave a real, conscientious worry that America is not the same as it \nused to be. Why is that? Because I think the American dream is that \nevery American youngster can climb on the ladder of success as fast and \nas high as he or she can, with nothing government made or manmade in \ntheir way. Regardless, they may stumble, hit their chin on a couple of \nrungs, but, by golly, they get back up and they go right up again.\n  Not anymore. We have, apparently, a national agenda to level \neverybody with everybody else. It is called social justice. Nothing \nwrong with social justice except if it is an agenda to affect \neverybody. We now have the President of the United States deciding who \nis rich. It does not make any difference if a person does not make \nanything 1 year and makes $250,000 the next year; he is rich--despite \nhis or her circumstances, family circumstances, or anything.\n  We have the national government, the Federal Government deciding \neverything: light bulbs, what you eat, rural fugitive dust. When a \ngrain truck goes down a gravel road in Kansas we have the EPA worried \nabout it. No kidding. We have navigable farm ponds now, farm ponds \ndeclared navigable waters. No self-respecting duck would even land \nthere.\n  We have regulation after regulation after regulation. I cannot talk \nto any manufacturer, any business, anyone in Kansas where I have the \nprivilege of speaking without somebody raising their hand and saying: \nPat, what on Earth are you doing back there passing all these \nregulations that really don't make any sense and are about to put me \nout of business?\n  My reply to them: I am not a ``you'' guy; I am an ``us'' guy; and I \nam sure trying to do something about that. I do have a bill on that, by \nthe way, and I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to look at it. \nI will be talking to you personally.\n  These are all serious issues, but the most serious matter is the \nnational debt. At the rate we are going, in a few short years we will \nspend more paying interest on the debt than on all discretionary \nspending outside defense. Mike Mullen has said this is the biggest \nthreat to our national security: $14.3 trillion. He is right. His \ncomments echo the calls I receive every day from Kansans.\n  There is a lot of rhetoric going on now, and I understand that. \nPerhaps I have added to it. If I have offended somebody, I apologize. \nBut let's all take a deep breath, if we can. Debate and posturing is \nnothing new in this body. In American history, in the earliest days of \nour Republic, it was between Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists on \none side and Thomas Jefferson and his allies on the other. The enmity \nbetween these men was so obvious through vitriolic rhetoric. Much of \nthe mudslinging that occurred then would be considered out of bounds by \ntoday's standards of political discourse.\n  Well, as the debate raged on between the early parties over the \ndrafting of the Constitution, it seemed possible that the great \nAmerican experiment would be over before it even began. Edmund Randolph \nwrote to George Washington, who at that time had retired to private \nlife, and begged him to ``rescue America from the impending ruin.''\n  Washington rose to the occasion the way a leader does. He did it for \nhis country, for his fellow Americans. He showed leadership because it \nwas the right thing to do. In the end, a compromise was reached--yes, \nit was a compromise--to have the Constitution as drafted by the \nFederalists but with the Bill of Rights included as drafted by the \nJeffersonians.\n  Later, after being elected our Nation's first President, Washington \nwas dismayed over the continuous bickering between Hamilton and \nJefferson--not so much different than we are doing today--over a wide \nrange of issues: how to interpret the Constitution, the powers of \nCongress, the relationship between the States and the Federal \nGovernment, and the public debt--even then. Sound familiar?\n  Well, amidst the feuding, George Washington wrote to Jefferson and \nsaid this:\n\n       How unfortunate, and how much is it to be regretted then, \n     that whilst we are encompassed on all sides with avowed \n     enemies and insidious friends, that internal dissension \n     should be harrowing and tearing our vitals.\n\n  That is pretty tough. That is the bottle we ought to drink from every \nmorning and stop to think about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, since the founding of our Nation, people \nthe world over have looked to us as a beacon of light because of our \nfreedoms. Others have watched the great American experiment with a \nperverse hope that it falls. We can only fail if we fail ourselves, if \nwe fail to balance the budget and bring down the debt.\n  America has always proven itself. We will meet any challenge and \nconfront any enemy. The enemy before us is our own fiscal \nirresponsibility. It is time to stop talking. It is time to start \ndoing. It is time for the President to come up with a specific plan, \nand in meeting with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the same \nin the Senate, let's do our duty.\n  In some of the toughest early debates in our country, Americans were \nfortunate to have steady leadership in keeping a hand on the wheel. I \nhope Members of this Chamber and the current President of the United \nStates can look to character, to leadership, to love of our country to \nguide us through these very trying times.\n  Every generation confronts a unique set of challenges. The challenge \nwe face today is the $14.3 trillion debt--and growing. I am so hopeful \nwe can close ranks and confront this enemy. We owe the American people \nand our forebears no less than victory in this fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have spent a considerable amount of time \ndiscussing the debt and the deficit crisis this country is facing \nduring the 112th Congress. Although we have heard from the President \nthat we must raise the debt limit, neither he nor any of his Democratic \ncolleagues, with the exception of the three Senators in the Gang of 6, \nhave presented us with a concrete plan to rein in spending and get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  Meanwhile, every day we are spending more money that we do not have. \nWhile my Democratic colleagues continue to talk about the need to \nincrease the debt limit and get our fiscal house in order, the House of \nRepresentatives has taken concrete action to make that happen. On \nTuesday night, 234 Members of the House of Representatives joined to \npass the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act.\n  The bill will put the country on a sound fiscal course at the same \ntime that it gives the President $2.4 trillion in additional borrowing \nauthority that he has asked us to provide. The problem we currently \nface is that we are spending too much money and borrowing too much \nmoney.\n  I agree with our colleagues in the House that it only makes sense for \nus to increase the borrowing authority if we put the country on a path \nwhere that borrowing will eventually end, even though it is a long way \nout.\n  The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act takes a three-tiered approach to \nfinding the right fiscal ship. First, it provides some substantial but \nreasonable cuts to spending immediately. The bill requires us to cut \nabout 3 percent in spending from the bloated Federal budget next year. \nThat cut amounts to more than $100 billion in spending next year.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n  The bill allows the House and Senate to determine where those cuts \nare most appropriate. Because we recognize the need to cut in \nappropriate areas, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act ensures there are no \nimmediate cuts to Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, or to \nour military colleagues.\n  At the same time we cut spending, the bill puts in place spending \ncaps that prevent us from spending above a specific amount and puts our \nspending trajectory on a path where we can achieve a balanced budget. \nWe all wish we could balance the budget tomorrow, but we are spending \nmoney at such an alarming rate that it just is not achievable. We are \nalmost borrowing as much money as we take in in revenue. The bill \nrecognizes that fact and gradually caps spending so we can achieve \nbalance.\n  Finally, the bill gives the President the ability to borrow an \nadditional $2.4 trillion he is requesting, subject to one condition: \nthat Congress passes a balanced budget amendment. We all agree we need \nto stop borrowing so much money. The only way to stop borrowing is to \nhave a balanced budget--not spending more than we take in.\n  We have a pretty good idea how much is coming in and how much is \ngoing out. That is why August 2 is the day of crisis, and that is \nincluding the money we borrow. When we pay the interest, we have to \nborrow 40 cents on every dollar to pay the interest.\n  If someone has a maxed out credit card and borrows to pay the minimum \nbalance, do you think they will ever pay that card off? Not a chance. \nThat is the situation we are in.\n  A balanced budget means we will not spend money we do not have. \nTherefore, if the President wants to borrow $2.4 trillion more from a \ncountry such as China, we need to know it will not force us to borrow \nmoney forever. Cut, cap, and balance does not ask for the time for \nStates to ratify a balanced budget amendment after it passes. Their \ntime to ratify gives us time to get where we need to go.\n  Like families across America, we are going to have to decide what \nspending is essential. Families have as many ideas for spending money \nas the Federal Government does. But they know it is not an option to \nspend what they do not have. They have to decide what is essential and \nwhat is nice to have.\n  I think it is important to take a look at the problem we are facing. \nIf we grasp the size of the problem, we will share my sense of urgency \nthat we must pass the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act.\n  Our national debt is around $14.3 trillion. Our national debt is \nalmost equal to the whole economy of the United States--everything that \nis produced and sold in the United States.\n  Our debt is almost equal to the whole economy of the United States. \nWe call it GDP. That is so we do not really know what we are talking \nabout. That means if we were to pay off the debt, every man, woman, and \nchild in this country would need to write a check for more than \n$46,000. It would be one matter if that number were projected to \ndecrease or if there were signs that we are making progress in bringing \nour budget back into balance. But that is not happening. Since the \nPresident took office in 2009, our national debt has increased by more \nthan $4.4 billion each day, for a total increase of $3.7 trillion.\n  I can already hear the President counter that he had a lot to clean \nup. At what point when things are getting worse instead of better is \nthe President going to take ownership and provide a solution on paper? \nLots of speeches, no paper.\n  The stimulus did not work, so let's not repeat it. If we keep doing \nwhat we have been doing, we should not be surprised when we wind up \nwith what we already got--the same result.\n  Margaret Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister, proved that putting \nyour fiscal house in order increased the economy. They already tried \nsome of the other things, but putting the fiscal house in order is what \nmade the difference.\n  In 2011 we are expected to spend $3.6 trillion. At the same time that \nwe spend the $3.6 trillion, we will have revenues of $2.2 trillion. \nThat is a $1.4 trillion deficit. If we follow the President's budget, \nwe will have a deficit the next year of $1.2 trillion. The 10-year \naverage, if we follow the President's budget proposal, is nearly $1 \ntrillion in deficits each year.\n  After his first term, the President's policies are expected to add \nalmost as much debt held by the public as all the Presidents in the \nhistory of the United States. That level of deficit cannot be sustained \nand, contrary to the opinions of my friends on the other side of the \naisle, we cannot tax our way out of this problem. Failure to \nlive within our means does not warrant taxing the taxpayers for \nWashington's failures.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 20 percent of \nincome earners paid almost 86 percent of all Federal taxes in 2007. \nThose individuals are the job creators in this country. Many of them \nare small business people who reinvest their profits, even though they \nhave to pay the taxes on them at that time. So they put the profits \nback into their businesses to make them grow.\n  Increasing taxes at a time of economic struggle will cost jobs and \nwill lead to more unemployment and higher deficits. Businesses are \nalready reluctant to expand because of the increasing and detrimental \nregulations coming out every day of this administration. Some of the \nregulations are not even from current law, so they will be fought in \nthe courts and they will be overturned. But it will be at a great \nexpense, a great delay, because it will take over a 5-year period to do \nthat, and we will experience more pain than any cuts we might make.\n  Now, rather than increasing taxes, we need to cut spending and reform \nentitlement programs. Mandatory and entitlement programs now account \nfor 62 percent of all Federal spending. That number continues to rise \nas the baby boomer generation retires. By comparison, mandatory and \nentitlement programs accounted for 33 percent of all Federal budget \nspending in 1964--33 percent up to 62 percent.\n  The numbers do not lie. Entitlement programs are placing a \nstranglehold on our budget, and yet there are still calls from my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to keep them as they are. \nMisinformation from campaigns and outside groups say there is not a \nproblem and we can fix our budget simply by cutting earmarks and \nfinding waste, fraud, and abuse. That is just not true. Even if the \nmoney from the Social Security trust fund that has been spent were \nreturned, the length of time a person now lives makes the fund \nactuarially broke.\n  These problems are too serious for us to ignore. Erskine Bowles, the \ncochairman of the deficit commission, said it best when he testified \nthat ``we are facing the most predictable crisis in our nation's \nhistory.''\n  Everyone knows we need to take action. Everyone knows we need to make \nthe tough choices necessary to right our fiscal ship. Yet there are \nsome who suggest we should not act or that we should wait to act.\n  To those Members, I say we have kicked the can down the road long \nenough. It is time for us to take serious action to change the \ntrajectory of our spending habits and get this country in a condition \nthat we can be proud to leave to our grandchildren.\n  We have known that this debt limit debate was coming for months. We \ncan all see that the government is spending money at a rate that will \nrequire us to authorize the Treasury Department to borrow more money. \nAlthough the date shifted, the fact that the government will have \nreached the debt limit should come as no surprise to anyone. That is \nwhy it is so perplexing the President and my Democratic colleagues have \nnot presented any written plan to get the country back on track.\n  Well, I guess the President did present one. We voted on it, and it \ndid not get a single vote in this Chamber--not one vote. He did not \neven talk one Democrat into voting for it. He had an outstanding \nopportunity to talk about the deficit crisis that the deficit \ncommission pointed out. He could have done that in the State of the \nUnion speech. He could have followed that up with a budget that would \nhave mirrored what the budget commission said. That is kind of where \nthis Gang of 6 is right now with their suggestion.\n  But that did not happen. Instead, we move on to the crisis and figure \nthat just raising the debt limit will solve everything. We have known \nit was coming for a long time.\n  In the House, Republicans passed a budget that would cut the spending \nby\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n$5.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Senator Toomey and Senator Paul \nin this body presented their own budget that would get our country back \non track. Senator Corker has introduced legislation that would cap \nspending levels and head us in the right direction. I have introduced \nlegislation that would require us to reduce spending by 1 percent for 7 \nyears and cap spending each year to balance the budget. It will work: \nIn 7 years, 1 percent.\n  Incidentally, that is probably how long it will take the States to \nratify the balanced budget amendment. If we are saying we can do it \nwithout a balanced budget amendment, we should also pass my 1 percent \nsolution bill and prove that we can. A backup plan is always a good \nidea.\n  Most businesses in the United States have to find a way to reduce \nspending by 1 percent to match the economy or to do the regulations we \nhave forced on them. Most families have to find a way to spend one \npenny less out of every dollar or face a financial crisis.\n  Why can't the United States do 1 percent--1 percent each year? By \nmaking the 1 percent spending cut, we would save around $7\\1/2\\ \ntrillion over the next 10 years, balance our budget, and we would put \nthe country on a sustainable spending path.\n  Republicans have offered all of these plans, and we continue to hear \nonly silence from the other side. The only plan presented by the \nmajority, as I mentioned, was President Obama's fiscal year 2012 \nbudget, which was unanimously opposed.\n  When the President and the majority do not lead, some bill has to \ntake the lead. Members of the House proved that on Tuesday night by \npassing a plan that allows the President to have his debt limit \nincrease and get our country back on track. The Cut, Cap, and Balance \nAct is a responsible solution to the problems we face. We are spending \ntoo much. Too much spending leads to too much borrowing.\n  To rein in spending, we must make immediate cuts that prove Congress \ncan act. We must cap future spending to ensure that our spending levels \ndo not grow at an unsurmountable level.\n  To prevent future borrowing, we need to put into place a mechanism \nthat will require us to balance the budget. Forty-nine States require a \nbalanced budget, and it is well past time for the Federal Government to \nshow the same fiscal restraint.\n  The President has asked us to give him the ability to borrow $2.4 \ntrillion more, which our children and grandchildren will have to pay \nback and, if the crisis worsens, it will move up to the current \ngeneration. It is money we will need to borrow from countries such as \nChina, which are our competitors in the world and which don't \nnecessarily share the same values. I don't take that responsibility \nlightly.\n  This responsibility requires immediate action to correct the problem \nand prevent future generations from having to make the tough choices \nour out-of-control spending has forced us to make. The House took the \nresponsibility seriously and passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act to \nright our fiscal ship at the same time we give the President the \nborrowing authority he so desires. The Senate should follow suit and \npass the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act immediately.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous subsequent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because we are \ndiscussing the cut, cap, and balance legislation, which I support. This \ngets back to a poster I have had at home with my kids over the years. I \nhave a copy of it here. It is called ``the two penny difference.'' It \nsays that if you earn a dollar and you spend the 99 cents, you are OK. \nBut spend $1.01 and you are heading for trouble. This is from many \nyears ago.\n  Today, spending seems more fashionable than saving. What once was \ncalled ``poor money management'' is now called ``deficit spending.'' \nWhatever it is called, it leads to inevitable headaches for people, \ncompanies, and even for governments.\n  Frankly, that is the situation in which we find ourselves today, a \nmajor headache, because as a nation we have continued to spend money we \ndon't have. As a result, we have been borrowing money, significant \namounts of money. Actually, it is about $4 billion a day. A lot of it \nwe are borrowing from overseas, and much of it from China. You say, how \ndoes one maintain oneself as an independent, strong, and forceful \nnation when it owes that sort of debt to someone else?\n  What the American people have told me as I traveled around my State \nis that Americans believe--and the people of Wyoming clearly believe--\nthey want Washington to cut spending, not increase taxes. The White \nHouse doesn't seem to hear that message. They are ignoring it, tuning \nit out. They have admitted they don't have a plan to cut Washington \nwasteful spending, and actually the President doesn't think he needs \none. I will quote the White House press secretary:\n\n       Leadership is not proposing a plan.\n\n  You know, it is saddening, but it is not surprising given this White \nHouse's track record of changing positions, saying one thing and doing \nanother, and nobody can predict what they will do. Last week, the \nPresident said he would not support a short-term increase in the debt \nceiling. He even warned the House majority leader: ``Don't call my \nbluff.'' We have all seen it on television. Now we know it was a bluff.\n  The President is now saying he might welcome a short-term increase in \nthe debt ceiling. Yesterday, the President announced--or it was \nannounced by his spokesman--that they would consider the short-term \nincrease. So it is hard to tell what they are thinking at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. A lot of times it depends which way the wind is \nblowing. White House officials aren't the only ones who think it is \nbetter to not propose a plan. The story in Roll Call yesterday said \nthat the senior Senator from New York warned the Democrats to not \nrelease a plan. The article even said they told the budget chairman not \nto propose a budget because it would give others around the country \nsomething to shoot at.\n  We have been here for over 800 days since a budget was passed through \nthe Senate, and a Senator tells the chairman of the Budget Committee \ndon't let them see the budget. According to this article, it said he \nthought it was politically helpful to spend time ``attacking corporate \njet owners and defending entitlements.''\n  Our entitlements are going to be bankrupt in just over 10 years, and \nsome folks don't want to produce a plan to save them or to strengthen \nthem. That is what we are hearing on the floor of the Senate.\n  People often try to figure out how large this debt is that we have. \nWe spend more on interest on our debt--just interest--each and every \nday than it would cost to buy several hundred corporate jets, which the \nsenior Senator from New York is railing against. And that is just the \ninterest alone on the debt. That is what kind of money we owe.\n  This isn't the kind of leadership America needs right now. Even \nthough the White House and my friends on the other side of the aisle \ncontinue to send different signals each day, Republicans remain \ncommitted to cutting spending. In fact, we put forward the only plan \nthat has passed either House of Congress. It is called cut, cap, and \nbalance. It will cut spending. The American people realize we continue \nto spend money we don't have. It will cap future spending, and it will \nrequire Washington to balance its budgets. Wyoming does that every \nyear. Every other alternative in the Congress, on the Hill, around \ntown, is either undefined or unfinished or only speculative.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will soon vote on cut, cap, and balance, \nwhich is a plan that is good for our country. It is common sense that \nwhen Washington is $14 trillion in debt, we must cut spending. When \nWashington borrows $4 billion a day, we must cap future spending. When \nWashington borrows $2 million every single minute, we must learn to \nbalance our budget.\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nAmericans understand our country can't continue down this same track. \nWe cannot continue to spend money we don't have. Cut, cap, and balance \nis the best plan for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, these are challenging and daunting times. \nWhile we are coming out of the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression, with continued high unemployment, our economy remains \nfragile.\n  The fragility is not simply a macroeconomic phenomenon. It affects \nevery family in this country who is worried about their employment, \nabout the future of their children, and about whether their parents \nwill still enjoy adequate coverage under Medicare and will still be \nable to draw some sustenance from Social Security checks. All these \nworries are in the daily lives of all Americans. We have to respond to \nthat.\n  The most salient fact that affects most Americans is the dramatic \nloss of employment, beginning in 2007, 2008, as the financial crisis \nengulfed this country.\n  The U.S. economy has lost about 8.8 million private sector jobs just \nin 2008 and 2009 alone. These were times when a Republican President \ncontinued to accumulate huge deficit spending--most of it beginning \nwith tax cuts, which my Republican colleagues supported \nenthusiastically; two wars that were not paid for, which was supported \noverwhelmingly by my Republican colleagues; and an expansion of Part D \nof Medicare, which again they supported. At no time did I hear the kind \nof outcry about growing deficits we are hearing today.\n  We all understand that after the 10 years of this decade--8 of which \nwere under the Presidency of George W. Bush--we are in a very difficult \ndeficit position. That position is made worse because our economy has \nnot generated enough jobs. One of the aspects of all these so-called \nplans--the cut, balance, whatever plan, and all the rest--should be the \nanswer to the fundamental question: How is it going to help us grow our \neconomy and grow jobs in Rhode Island, in Vermont, and in Wyoming? That \nseems to elude all the proponents of these plans at the moment.\n  We have seen, since President Obama has taken office, some growth in \nemployment, with 16 consecutive months of private sector job growth--\nabout 2.1 million jobs--in sharp contrast to what was happening during \nthe last 2 years of President Bush's administration. But we have a long \nway to go. Indeed, we have a long way to go to make up for the surplus \nwhich President Bush and the Republican Congress inherited in 2001 and \nthe deficit and economic destruction President Obama inherited when he \ntook office.\n  Our most immediate and pressing business is to reach some principled \ncompromise on raising the debt ceiling--something that was done, I must \nsay, rather routinely under President Bush about seven times, even \nthough Democrats had very serious disagreements with him on tax \npolicy--a tax policy that was increasing the deficit--and disagreement \non wars, which were increasing the deficit as well as distorting our \nstrategy internationally. At no time did we try to use the debt ceiling \nas the ultimate apocalyptic weapon to bring the President and, perhaps \nin doing so, even the country down. Yet I hear too many of my \ncolleagues on the other side talking in those terms, particularly in \nthe other Chamber.\n  The bill that has been passed in the House is an attempt to shrink \ngovernment, protect the wealthy and special interests in the Tax Code. \nIt ties the debt ceiling increase to passage of a constitutional \namendment that would require 38 States for ratification. Once again, we \nare taking what was routinely done and necessary so we don't default on \nour credit and making it the vehicle for altering the Constitution of \nthe United States, of building in even additional protections in the \nTax Code for our wealthier citizens. This approach they are taking will \nneedlessly jeopardize Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, while it \nenshrines in the Constitution further protections for loopholes in our \nTax Code and the tax benefits that many of the wealthy and the large \ncorporations enjoy today.\n  At the heart of what they are trying to propose in the House, and \nwhat they have sent to us, is to make it easier to cut these vital \nprograms--a range of programs that involve transportation security \nagents at our airports, flight controllers in the towers, and can even \ninvolve the distribution of agriculture programs, which affect large \nparts of our country--not so much in my State but large parts of this \ncountry. All that would be subject to the calculation of cutting, \ncutting, cutting, while it would be extraordinarily difficult to raise \nrevenues.\n  I don't think that makes sense. I don't think that is what the \nAmerican people want. From what I have seen from the polling, huge \nnumbers of Americans are frankly saying the wealthiest in this country \nare enjoying huge tax benefits. I believe approximately 80 percent of \nthe American public believes the first step we should take in balancing \nthe budget is to raise the taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That is \nwhat they are saying. They are not saying cut benefits from people who \nare on the margin, who are struggling--the working poor, who may be \njust under or over the line to qualify for Medicaid benefits in a State \nand get health care for their children. I think the American people are \nsmarter and more decent than some of the proposals that have surfaced \naround here.\n  Again, the caps on spending are all dressed up as if they will have \nno real effect on the important programs, but they will have an effect \non every program, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. \nFor people who are still struggling to find work, who are still \nstruggling to find some type of traction in a difficult economy, these \ncuts can be devastating. Indeed, one of the challenges we have is to \ngenerate more growth in our economy again. When we pull back from \nspending in the economy, that will further accelerate the lack of \ndemand and the lack of any incentive for private hiring.\n  We are already seeing companies cut back and cut back. What are they \nsaying? There is no demand. People aren't buying. People are saving. \nThey sense--not sense, they know--they have to save more because they \nare not quite sure whether they will get all of their Social Security \ncheck or their Medicare benefits or any other benefits. That drives \ndemand further down and slows the economy further down.\n  The Republican plan includes overall spending caps that reach 19.9 \npercent of GDP in 2017, but we have to look at this number in \nhistorical perspective. Over the past 40 years, this rate of spending \nis not only lower than the average spending but, moreover, outlays as a \npercentage of gross domestic product have only declined to 19.9 percent \nor lower when unemployment has been 6 percent or below. That makes \nsense. When the American economy is working, people don't collect a lot \nof benefits. They have a job and so they do not need the kind of \nassistance they need today. This cap of 19.9 percent is totally out of \nthe context when it comes to the present unemployment rate of 9.2 \npercent and, frankly, could perhaps cause an even larger unemployment \nrate if this program is enacted.\n  Again, I don't think this makes sense in terms of the simple \nmathematics or the history or the underlying policies it would \ninevitably produce in the country. Yet still, in this Republican \nproposal, we are protecting the most special interests in this \ncountry--Big Oil and corporations. Those tax breaks, those tax perks, \nare still there, and they will continue to be there.\n  We all recognize we have to make tough decisions about spending and \nabout revenue. What I find acutely ironic is Democrats did that in 1993 \nand 1997 and we heard about it for years and years, with Republicans \nassailing us. Of course, by 1998, we had a surplus. We had an economy \nwith an unemployment rate much closer to 5 percent than 10 percent. But \nall that hard work--without any assistance from the Republicans--was \ncompletely squandered beginning in January 2001. Now we are back to the \nsame challenge we faced in 1993 and 1994. But we did it before by \nmaking tough decisions. We did it over several years. We did it by \ntrying to balance both cutting expenditures and increasing appropriate \nrevenue and also by recognizing that working Americans need the \nassistance and support of their government. So we can do it again, and \nI hope we do.\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\n  But the first challenge--the one that has to be met--is to raise the \ndebt ceiling. Defaulting on our debt would have catastrophic \nconsequences. As we approach this deadline, the mere fact we haven't \ndone anything yet is prompting credit agencies to suggest they will \ndowngrade our credit rating. One of the most salient figures I have \nheard in this debate is that for every increase of 1 percent in our \ncost of credit and the interest we pay to borrow over 10 years, we will \nadd $1.3 trillion to our deficit. The longer we avoid raising the debt \nceiling, the closer we come to actually accelerating the deficit \ndramatically by increasing the rate we have to pay to borrow funds.\n  The final point I would make is, raising the debt ceiling is not for \nnew spending we want to borrow money for. This is for the accumulation \nof the deficit that began dramatically in January of 2001. So I would \nurge my colleagues to move promptly and responsibly to raise the debt \nceiling and then to get to the hard, difficult work of balancing our \nbudget, as we did, as Democrats, in the 1990s, and then later, in 1996-\n97, with a Republican Congress, further adding to the deficit reduction \nunder the leadership of President Clinton and not some magic plan that \nis produced overnight.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the things that frustrates the \nAmerican people about Washington is how hard it is to get reliable \ninformation and straightforward answers. We in the Senate and Congress \nhave that same difficulty. It is hard to know sometimes what numbers \nand statements and plans mean and what they will cost. Politicians \noffer a budget proposal and they say it cuts taxes even though taxes go \nup. They even come up with new names to disguise tax hikes, like \nrevenue enhancements or reduced spending in the Tax Code. It doesn't \nmean eliminating the earned income tax credit; it usually means some \ndeductions somebody is allowed to take, and that has been renamed as \nspending.\n  We hear people come to the floor and blame our massive deficit on \nanything and everything but our out-of-control spending, whether it is \nthe war in Iraq or it is a tax cut passed a decade ago, or it is \nspecial preferences for private yachts or Lear jets. We can't have an \nhonest budget if we can't talk honestly and factually about it, and I \nhope to be able to contribute in some way to clarifying the issues. I \nwill do my best today to plainly state some of the things I think are \nplainly true.\n  First, I wish to address the myth that the President has a $4 \ntrillion deficit reduction plan. Some believe that the President has a \nplan to reduce spending by $4 trillion, but the only plan the President \nhas put on paper and allowed anybody to see is his February budget, \nwhich doubles the national debt. The President has never put a single \nspending cut plan on paper that actually reduces spending, and he has \nno program that would substantially reduce the deficit. If he does, it \nis a closely guarded secret.\n  His budget, which he submitted earlier this year, increases taxes \nsignificantly but has greater increases in spending. By the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis, it would increase the deficit \nmore over the next 10 years than if the budget were not passed at all. \nIndeed, it would increase the gross debt of the United States by $13 \ntrillion, doubling the entire debt of the United States again in the \nnext 10 years.\n  If there is a secret plan that does exist somewhere, it should be \nmade public this afternoon. Let's see it. I would like to. I think \nmillions of Americans would feel the same way. Summaries don't work.\n  The President summarized his budget, which I just described, as \ncalling on Americans to live within our means and will not add more to \nthe debt. That sounds pretty good, because this year our deficit is \nprojected to be $1,500 billion. So we want to be living within our \nmeans again and we do not want to add more to the debt. But even by the \nPresident's own analysis, the plan didn't do this. The Congressional \nBudget Office, Congress's independent agency, analyzed the President's \nbudget and found that in 10 years, the lowest single annual deficit \nthat would occur would be $740 billion. The highest budget deficit \nunder President Bush was $450 billion. But under the President's \nbudget, the lowest deficit that would be accrued would be $740 billion. \nIt goes up in the outyears until it goes over $1 trillion, over $1,000 \nbillion in the tenth year of his budget.\n  How can that be living within your means? It will not add more to the \ndebt? Every single year would be adding to the debt. So we can't deal \nwith summaries and spin statements about a plan until that plan has \nbeen put in legislative language and scored.\n  We also have received no plan from our Senate Democratic colleagues. \nFor a time there a couple of months ago, the Democrats were on the path \nof producing a budget in the Budget Committee as required by statutory \nlaw. I, as ranking Republican, was very anxious to see it. We were told \nwe would get it the morning of the hearing, not a bit sooner. I \ngrumbled about that. I wanted to have a little more time to see it. But \nwe never received a budget. I think the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leadership, not our committee chairman, decided they didn't \nwant to have a budget. One of the committee folks said it would put a \ntarget on your back. Senator Reid said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget. Why would it be foolish to have a budget? Well, you can't say \nyour budget calls on you to live within your means if you actually put \nit out there. People can score it and find out whether it is true.\n  We haven't had a budget this Senate in 813 days. As of now, there is \nonly one debt limit plan on paper, only one plan available for public \nscrutiny and review, and that is the one we are considering today, cut, \ncap, and balance. It cuts spending immediately, it caps it so it won't \ngo up, and it requires the passage of a balanced budget amendment to \nensure that Washington ends deficit spending once and for all.\n  The American people do not support a Washington plan to pass some \ngrand deal with tax hikes that never go away and with spending cuts \nthat are talked about but never materialize. They are wise to the \ngimmicks and accounting of Washington. They are not happy with us.\n  At this very moment the people's Representatives in Congress preside \nover a country that borrows 40 percent of every dollar its government \nspends.\n  People in the Tea Party are angry. And why shouldn't they be angry \nwhen this kind of leadership has occurred in the Congress of the United \nStates of America? It is utterly, totally indefensible. It should \nnever, ever have happened. Yet, it has. It threatens our financial \nfuture. It threatens our economy and our economic growth. So the \nAmerican people are not happy about it.\n  That is why I introduced a piece of legislation that would require 7 \ndays to review any bill that would increase the debt limit, because \nthis is going to be complex. People want to bring it up at the 11th \nhour under a panic mode. Some warn that if we don't pass it tomorrow, \nthe world markets are going to be destabilized, interest could go up. I \ndon't know, some of those things could happen. So we absolutely should \ndo something. But we ought to not wait until the last minute and have \nplopped down in the Senate some big complex bill that has got to be \npassed before the sun rises the next day and nobody has time to analyze \nit or score it to find out what it means.\n  But our Democratic colleagues here in Washington are resisting the \ncut, cap, and balance bill because there is no gimmick in it. There is \nno accounting trick to get around if this becomes law. They know it \nwill work. And for the big spenders, the only thing you don't want to \npass is a piece of legislation that will work to contain spending. You \nsee, they want to spend more. They think if they continue to spend \nmore, then they can go and demand you raise taxes to pay for it.\n  Washington is going to have to end this spending spree. These kinds \nof difficult choices are the responsible choices families, cities, \nStates, and county commissions are making every day, every year.\n  In Alabama, Governor Robert Bentley oversaw an across-the-board cut \nof 15 percent from the general fund in the\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\ncurrent year because of the constitutional prohibition on deficit \nspending. Alabama is not going to run up debt. For next year, he has \ntaken a cautious approach. Hopefully we will have more revenue, but he \nis cautiously approaching next year and he has proposed cuts of up to \n45 percent for some agencies that he felt would be appropriate places \nto reduce spending. Those are tough choices. But unlike Alabama, the \nFederal Government is not required to live within its means.\n  Another myth I wish to address is the idea that our current budget \ncrisis is the result of two wars and a tax cut. We have heard that over \nand over again. The wars cost money, a good bit of money. Over the \nentire decade, the cost of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars is about $1.3 \ntrillion. That is a lot of money. Again, that is over 10 years, over a \ndecade. This year alone, the deficit is expected to be $1,400 billion, \nor $1.4 trillion. The deficit this year will be larger than the cost of \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over 10 years. So the driving force \nbehind our deficit is not the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not. \nWar costs represent only 4 percent of total outlays over the last 10 \nyears. The total amount of money spent since President Obama took \noffice is $8.5 trillion. By the end of his first 3 years in office, we \nwill have added $5 trillion to our gross Federal debt. These are \nstunning numbers.\n  As I said, President Bush had a widely criticized--in many ways \nrightly criticized--$450 billion deficit. Since President Obama has \nbeen in office, the deficits have been 1.2, 1.3, looks like this year \nit will be $1.4 trillion, each year, more than double the deficit under \nPresident Bush.\n  We are borrowing close to half of what we are spending every single \nday. In 2 years, nondefense discretionary spending increased 24 \npercent, 12 percent a year on average. This is our discretionary \nspending. This isn't Social Security and Medicare, which increase more \nthan that. The stimulus package alone added into law the largest \nexpenditure bill in the history of the American Republic. It cost more \nthan the entire war in Iraq has cost. In a single day in 2009 we passed \nit on this floor, over my objection, and every penny of it was \nborrowed. We were in debt, but they said: The economy needs to be \nstimulated so we are going to spend 850 or so billion dollars.\n  The spending when President Bush took office was less than $2 \ntrillion. Today, it is almost $4 trillion. It will be almost $6 \ntrillion by the end of the decade. There is only one honest answer to \nthe question of why our debt is rising so fast, and that is out-of-\ncontrol domestic spending.\n  Another myth that is circulating, which I wish to address, concerns \nthe outline from our colleagues and friends who participated and worked \nhard on the Gang of 6 proposal. I give them a lot of credit and respect \nfor the hard work they put into it. I wish it had been produced a month \nago so we could have actually had legislative language and know what it \nwould mean today.\n  The authors of the summary, though, that they just produced for us, \nclaimed the approach would reduce the deficit by $3.7 trillion over 10 \nyears. That is a little over one-third or so of the deficit we \nprojected to see in the next 10 years. But my staff on the Budget \nCommittee, taking the summary pages they produced for us, can only find \n$1.2 trillion in reduced spending in that outline, along with what is a \nvery clear $1 trillion tax increase.\n  Where does the other $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction claimed in \nthe outline come from? Chairman Conrad, one of the members of the Gang \nof 6 and our chairman on the Budget Committee, a man I respect and have \nenjoyed working with, even said the outline has a $1.5 trillion tax \ncut. But this is compared--this is how these numbers get bandied \nabout--it is compared against a baseline which assumes more than $3.5 \ntrillion in tax increases would occur. So they are only going to \nincrease taxes, I guess, by $2 trillion, and you can get savings by not \nhaving them go up as much. But based on the current tax rates that are \nin existence in America today, as we read their outline--and I think \nthey would agree--it increases taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years. That \nis a large amount.\n  The real cost of the tax changes, some who have looked at these \nnumbers say, is not $1 trillion but $2 trillion. That remains to be \nseen. Hopefully we will get the legislative language that can actually \nbe analyzed, and we would know how much our taxes would actually go up.\n  The last myth I would like to address is perhaps the most important \nof all, and this is the myth that we only need about $2 trillion in \nactual spending cuts over the next 10 years. That has basically been \nwhat our colleagues are saying. They float the idea of $4 trillion in \nsavings. What they mean is that you save $2 trillion by reducing \nspending and you increase taxes $2 trillion and you have saved $4 \nbillion over 10 years. I am not sure that is what the American people \nare expecting of us when we say we are saving money. By taking it from \nthem? It is not saving the American people more. It is not saving the \nprivate economy more, to take another $2 trillion from them. There is \nno free lunch. Somebody pays.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have said, although no plan has ever been \nmade public to this effect, that they could get behind the budget deal \nthat reduces the deficit $4 trillion over the next 10 years, half of it \ncomposed of spending cuts. This is not even close, frankly, to what is \nneeded to ultimately balance our budget. We are projected to spend $46 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. A $2 trillion reduction is only about \na 4-percent reduction in spending, and that is set to increase by \nalmost 60 percent.\n  Remember, we will say we are reducing spending. We are not reducing \nspending, we are reducing the rate of growth in spending by $2 trillion \non a $46 trillion plan. Think about it. We are not talking about \nreducing spending. This budget would have the expenditures go up \nsignificantly in the next 10 years to $46 trillion. The $2 trillion \nmeans we are just reducing the growth of spending by $2 trillion. The \n$2 trillion in tax increases would mean we would still spend the same \n$46 trillion, but we just would borrow $2 trillion less because we have \nextracted more from the American people.\n  In just a little over 2 months, our debt will reach 100 percent of \nour economy--100 percent of GDP. That is the gross debt. That would \nmatch the size of our economy. It costs us 1 million jobs or more a \nyear when gross debt reaches this level.\n  We have the Rogoff-Reinhart study that shows that when a country's \ngross debt climbs as high as ours has, it starts pulling down economic \ngrowth. Secretary Geithner said it is an excellent study. He said in \nsome ways it understates the problem we have. Secretary Geithner knows \nthis debt is a real problem for America.\n  We expected 3 percent growth the first quarter. It came in at 1.8 \npercent. Could that be because we have crossed the 90-percent debt-to-\nGDP threshold, and that debt is now a burden on the economy that is \nreducing growth? The experts have also downgraded the projected growth \nfor the third and fourth quarters of this calendar year. It is very \nserious.\n  Christina Romer, who used to be in President Obama's White House on \neconomic matters, said 1 percent growth means you will add 1 million \njobs. So if our economy grows at 2 percent instead of 3 percent we will \nfail to add 1 million jobs we could have added. And I truly believe the \ndebt is the reason we are having surprisingly low growth rates, below \nprojected rates. Maybe I am wrong, but we certainly have a study that \nseems to say that exactly, and it has been widely praised by economists \nall over the country.\n  The honest truth is that this President and his Democratic Senate are \nnot going to agree to the level of spending cuts in a debt deal that is \nnecessary to put our country on a sound path. I think that is a fact. \nWe have been negotiating and talking all year. The House laid out a \nbudget plan. The Senate has refused--813 days without a budget. They \nare determined not to reduce spending after increasing domestic \nspending, nondefense, by 24 percent. They say they will freeze \nspending--freeze spending at levels that have jumped 24 percent? We do \nnot have the money. We are borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we \nspend.\n  Unfortunately, we're in a battle over the vision for the future of \nAmerica. It is a big-government vision a lot of our Members have, and \nthey are going to work as hard as they possibly can to preserve that \nvision, preserve that spending. After running up this huge\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\ndebt by a 24-percent baseline increase--that does not count the \nstimulus package of almost $900 billion that is thrown on top of that--\nnow they want to go to the American people and say: We are not going to \ncut spending; you have to pay more in taxes. I don't think that is what \nthe American people want, so we have a national debate here.\n  This is the great debate of our time. It is not going to be settled \nin 2 weeks. A few people are not going to meet in secret and work out \nsome grand and glorious deal. I wish they could, but I don't think they \nwill. I would be pleased if they do.\n  I am confident that the good sense and wisdom of the American people \nwill ultimately prevail. I am confident we will eventually get our \nspending under control. We will restore the American principles of \nlimited government and build a better, freer future for our children. \nWe will raise the debt limit, but we will also put this country on a \nsound path. If we get our debt under control, I think our economic \ngrowth will rise quickly, and I believe we will see the progress we \nhave always seen in this great, productive, dynamic country.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, we have reached a point in this country's \nhistory that I never thought I would ever see, which is that the major \ncredit rating agencies have all said that our credit rating is in \njeopardy and that the United States may face a downgrade of its debt.\n  You and I both have had our issues with the credit rating agencies \nthat failed to predict the crisis we were driven into by very poor \nbusiness decisions. I can't even really call them business decisions--\nhorrible decisions that were made that drove our economy off a cliff, \nboth here and in our financial markets, both in Washington among our \npoliticians and among people who securitized debt, sold it off, and \ntook no responsibility for it. Having said all of that, I don't think \nthese agencies have any political incentive other than to shoot \nstraight on this question of the condition of our debt.\n  One of the greatest assets we have always had as a country is the \nsteadiness of our credit. Countries and investors all over the world \nuse it to finance transactions that otherwise would be difficult to do \nbecause we have an AAA rating on our debt.\n  Now we are facing a downgrade because we cannot even have an adult \nconversation, a polite conversation about a path forward. People should \nbe very clear about what this means. This is not just a Washington \nproblem. If we blow through our credit rating and if our interest rates \nrise by 1 percentage point--just 1 percentage point--that is going to \nadd $1.3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years. If it goes up 2 \npercentage points, that is $2.6 trillion added to the debt over the \nnext 10 years. That means we will continue to pay our borrowers \ninterest and we will continue to underinvest in the children of this \ncountry, in our infrastructure, in our research and development--in all \nof what will allow us to compete in the 21st century. For what? Just to \npay higher interest rates to people because we could not come to an \nagreement here in Washington.\n  I have spent the last 2\\1/2\\ years traveling around the great State \nof Colorado, a State which is complicated politically, which I enjoy, \nbecause we are one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, and one-\nthird Independent. If I had to boil down the essence of what I have \nheard from people in my State about what they want us to be doing, it \nis that they want us to approach this question the same way they would \napproach this question. They want us to materially address the problem \nwe have. They want a material solution to it. They know we cannot fix \nthis overnight, a $1.5 trillion budget deficit and a $15 trillion debt, \nbut they want us to fix it. They want to know that we are all in it \ntogether, that we all have a role to play to solve a problem that is \ntoo big for any one of us to solve or any group of us to solve. They \nwant it to be bipartisan because they have no confidence in my State in \neither party's go-it-alone approach.\n  I would add a corollary to all that: We need to satisfy the capital \nmarkets that the paper they bought is actually worth what they paid for \nit and that the United States of America is going to stand behind that \npaper and is going to be able to stand behind the paper. This is one of \nthe reasons I have supported an approach the Gang of 6 has brought \nforward--because it meets that test. It may not be perfect in all \nrespects. I know there can be disagreement about it. But that is one of \nthe reasons I have supported it. It is bipartisan, it is a measured \napproach, and I cannot say the same for the bill we are considering \ntoday.\n  Among other things, even if you thought this was a good idea, even \nthe proponents of the legislation say it would take 10 years before \nthis constitutional amendment would take effect. What we need to be \ndoing over the next 10 years is figuring out how to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. I have other issues with it as well, but I think the \npoint I want to make today is we need to work together in a bipartisan \nway to create a measured approach. You know what else. We cannot \ndeclare victory then even when we are able to say to the credit \nmarkets, you know what, we have had a disaster. This did not used to be \nour standard as Americans.\n\n  I know I have heard the Presiding Officer on the floor many times \ntalk about the state of the American economy, and I agree with him and \nhis diagnosis. If I had to pick one fact over the last 10 years from \nour economic life--and I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here, and I \nwill wrap up in 1 minute. What worries me the most is that median \nfamily income has fallen the last 10 years for the first time in this \ncountry's history. It stagnated for a while before that, but it has \nfallen for the first 10 years. The average family income went up over \nthat period of time. Median family income has fallen and the cost of \nhigher education has skyrocketed, the cost of health care has \nskyrocketed, and it is harder and harder for the middle class to get \nahead. Our economic production in this country is roughly the same as \nit was before we went into this recession, but we have 14 million fewer \npeople doing the work because they are unemployed. We need to have a \nset of tax policies, regulatory policies, that is driving innovation in \nthis economy and a policy to drive energy independence and make sure we \nare fiscally responsible.\n  Before I leave the floor, I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nwho is here today. He and I probably don't agree on most things--we \ndisagree about a lot of things--but I want to thank him and the other \nmembers of the Gang of 6 for the work they have done. I want to thank \nhim and Dick Durbin, in particular--one of the more liberal members of \nthe Senate--for voting for the deficit and debt recommendations that \nwere made by the bipartisan commission that was appointed to the \ndeficit and the debt committee. It took real courage for him to do \nthat. It took real courage for Dick Durbin to do that. It is going to \ntake real courage for the 100 Members of this body and for the Members \nof the other body to produce a plan to address this fiscal problem that \nno one would agree with every single aspect of but that we can come \ntogether and agree is worthy of the aspirations we have for our kids \nand our grandkids.\n  Time is very short. If we trip over this debt ceiling and if we fail \nto uphold the full faith and credit of the United States, no one is \ngoing to be asking any one of us what pledge we made about this or what \npledge we made about that. They are simply going to observe when we \nwere 1 of 100 Americans--out of over 300 million Americans--we let the \nunthinkable happen to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wanted to spend some time talking \nabout what is coming forth Saturday morning. As a member of the Gang of \n6, I am wanting us to solve our problem. But the best way to solve that \nproblem would be the bill that is going to be voted on Saturday \nmorning. Why is\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nthat? We are borrowing $4 billion a day, and I have enough gray hair to \nknow that regardless of all the good intention and regardless of all \nthe statements of the Members on the floor that we will never live \nwithin our means in Washington until we are forced to live within our \nmeans, and just because a constitutional amendment would take probably \n4 years to pass--given what the American people think about it--isn't a \nreason not to go on and do it no matter what we do about our short-term \nproblem coming up August 2. So the very fact people would say we are \nnot going to pass the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act because it won't happen \nin a period of time is exactly the same approach that got us $14.3 \ntrillion in debt, that has our credit rating at risk and puts us in the \nkind of problems we have today.\n  I have offered a plan I think is even better. I know not many of my \ncolleagues will, but here is a plan to cut $9 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. It is the only plan that specifically states what you would cut, \nwhere you would cut it, and why you would cut it. It is backed up with \nthe facts. Nobody else can claim it. You don't have to like all of \nthem, but what we do know is if something doesn't come out of this body \nbetween now and August 2 that cuts at least $4 trillion, this country \nis going to see significantly increased interest rates as a cost of \nthat. What so often happens is you hear wonderful words and wonderful \nspeeches on the Senate floor but nobody putting their name on where you \nwould cut. Well, I put my name on $9 trillion worth of cuts. It pinches \neverybody in this country. Everybody. But you know what. We are all in \nthis. We have lived for the last 30 years on the backs of those who are \ngoing to pay the taxes for the next 30 years. It is time we start \npaying back. It is time we start giving back.\n  The Senate is a different place today than when I came to the Senate. \nWhen I came to the Senate, the idea was not to block legislation but to \ndiscuss legislation, to have the courage and the backbone to vote \nagainst something and go home and tell your constituents why you voted \nagainst it, to offer amendments you thought would improve legislation \nand defend those amendments, and to vote for a bill you thought was in \nthe best interest of the country and be able to defend that. What has \nhappened in the last 3\\1/2\\ years in the Senate is we don't vote \nbecause the politicians of the Senate don't want to go home and explain \ntheir positions. So if you are not voting, you are not accountable and \nyou are not responsible.\n  That type of behavior is exactly the opposite behavior we need to \nhave. So Saturday morning, when Members of the Senate vote against \nproceeding to cut, cap, and balance, they will display either courage \nor cowardice. I am not talking about simple words. There is only one \nplan that has passed the House of Representatives that raises the debt \nlimit and addresses what is said to be needed by the rating agencies, \nand that is cut, cap, and balance. And to not allow proceeding to that \ndebate whether you agree with it or not--you can change it through \namendments. You have the votes to change it through amendments. But to \nnot allow it to proceed so the American people can see their elected \nSenators and their real positions and what they know has to be done--\nyou know, what happens around here is we say things so we can protect \nour political careers. You know what that does? We are not only \nbankrupting financially, we are bankrupting our country's history and \nheritage. The heritage of this country was sacrifice, and that means \neven sacrifice of political careers to do the right thing right now for \nthe country.\n  I believe if you were to pass something like this, we would lower our \ndebt by at least $2 trillion over the next 10 years, the economy would \nabsolutely boom, and we would quit undermining self-reliance and \nenforcing dependency. We would hold accountable a Pentagon that is \nwasteful, we would eliminate duplication of hundreds of programs that \nall do the same thing with multiple layers of redundancy and \nadministrative bureaucracy. If we were to do that, this proposal will \nnever come to a vote in the Senate nor any of the aspects of it because \nSenators don't want to make those hard choices, and that is what the \ndebate about cut, cap, and balance is all about. It forces Senators to \ngo back to embrace the heritage of this country and make the hard \nchoices. If you don't pass a balanced budget amendment and you don't \nforce the discipline, the political expediency of this country will \ncontinue to run and the problems will not be solved.\n  I would also say raising the debt limit doesn't have anything to do \nwith our real problems. That is just the symptom of the problem. The \nproblem is not living within our means. Somehow thinking the U.S. \nGovernment is different than all the State governments, all the city \nand county governments, every family in this country, every business in \nthis country, and every other organization in this country that has to \nlive within its means, I refuse to believe the American people will not \nhold Members of the Senate accountable for not giving them a chance to \nput those fixed parameters on us and their government for the future.\n  We are going to hear all sorts of reasons why we can't do that, why \nwe won't do that, or we may not hear many at all. What we will see is \nvoting against the procedure with no comment whatsoever. My plan is if \nthat happens, to be all over this country to make sure every citizen of \nevery State of every Senator who does not allow them to proceed is \naware of that. I want to personally make them aware of that. Because \nwhat you are doing is denying the liberty and the freedom of this \ncountry to hold you accountable to do the right thing. So we are going \nto see.\n  I wanted to spend a few minutes saying that the only thing that is \npossible right now to solve the problems in front of us--even though I \nhave endorsed a $9 trillion plan and $3.7 trillion plan--the only thing \nis this $6 trillion plan. It has passed the House of Representatives. \nThey voted to increase the debt limit and they put significant cuts \ninto our budget for next year. They put significant caps as we go \nforward and they said we have to vote to pass a balanced budget \namendment. Right now that is the only thing that will get us out of a \njam. You know what. That is not hard to do. The first point, we are \ngoing to cut another $111 billion at least next year, no matter whether \nthat passes. We are going to cap spending in the years that go forward \nwhether or not that bill passes. But the difference is as soon as we \nget our balance again, the politicians who don't want to make hard \nchoices will be back to not making hard choices and we will get in \ntrouble again. That is why it is absolutely critical that this \ncountry's citizens have the ability to hold us accountable within the \nparameters of living within our means.\n  We will hear all sorts of reasons why we can't do that, that it might \nhurt the poor. Nobody here wants to in any way intend anything other \nthan support for those who cannot help themselves. That is their \nexcuse, we can't do that. Well, let me tell you what is going to happen \nin our country. The very programs that help the poor are going to be \ndiminished in the future through fiscal necessity when we are mandated \nto make cuts to be able to borrow more money. So it is a false \nstatement because by not voting for a balanced budget amendment, what \nyou are saying is I want to plan one thing but I know something else is \ngoing to happen.\n  I paraphrase a statement by Martin Luther King that I think describes \nthis place more than anything I have ever known and it was this: Vanity \nasks the question: Is something popular? Cowardice asks the question: \nIs it expedient? Character asks the question: Is it true and right? We \nhave tons of vanity. We have tons of cowardice. We limit ourselves on \ncourage and character.\n  As we listen to the debate over the next 2 days on this motion to \nproceed on the only thing that will solve the problem in front of us \ntoday, I want my colleagues to listen for political expediency, I want \nmy colleagues to listen for vanity, and then I want them to search hard \nfor courage and character because we will see an absence of it from \nthose who oppose this. They know this will solve the problem. They know \nthis is one of the few things that can pass the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet we are not going to have it come to the floor for \nan amendment process, for a full debate, and for a vote. We are not \ngoing to allow it to have a vote because\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nwe are political cowards. We do not want to truly address the problem \nbecause it might affect our political careers. That is a sad commentary \non the heritage of this country--a sad commentary--but it is a \ncommentary to be expected; otherwise, we would never have gotten into \nthe position we are in today.\n  Let me talk about some details of what we can do. We are going to \nhear all sorts of reasons why we can't do things and all sorts of \nreasons why we couldn't come up with $9 trillion. But when the American \npeople truly know what is going on--if they go and read about it in \n``Back in Black''--when they find out about the background of all the \nwaste, all the duplication, all the stupidity that goes on in our \ngovernment, all the lack of accountability, the lack of responsibility \nin bureaucratic agencies, all the silly decisions that get made that \nspend billions of dollars and don't help anything--the Tax Code. Tax \nearmarks and tax credit and tax expenditures are nothing but, most of \nthe time, corporate welfare or socialism. The greatest tax in the world \ncomes when we allow the Federal Reserve to print money which devalues \nour assets through inflation and the earnings on those assets. So the \ngreatest tax in the world that is coming in America is we are going to \ndevalue the dollar and inflation is going to go up and what we can earn \non our assets is going to be limited by the interest rates, and the \ndifferential is that which we actually lose in real value of what we \nown every day.\n  The other thing I would point out is, through the tax earmarks and \ntax credits in our Tax Code, anybody who doesn't get one of those is \nactually paying for it. So if a person doesn't have an ``in'' up here, \nif a person doesn't have a lobbyist, if a person doesn't have some \nspecial interest looking out for them and they are not getting one of \nthose, they are paying for them through the increased taxes. It is \ninherently unfair.\n  Let's look at duplication for a minute. It is interesting to look, as \nwe have gone through the government programs in a detailed fashion, at \nthe GAO report. We have 100 different programs with 100 sets of \nbureaucracies for surface transportation. Why do we have that? Because \nCongress has mismanaged. That is why. Because of expediency, because of \nvanity, because of wanting to get reelected, we create another program, \nanother program, another program. It looks good and sounds good, but \nnobody ever does the research to see where they overlap. Nobody ever \nrequires us to ask if this program is effective, and nobody ever looks \nat the Constitution to see if it fits with article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution--the enumerated powers we are supposed to live by and \nwhich we blow by all the time doing things.\n  Today, the Judiciary Committee passed a bill for State prisons called \nthe Second Chance Act. When we passed it the first time, I finally let \nit go because it was supposed to be a demonstration and a limited \nprogram. It is now going to get reauthorized for 5 more years. It \nlegitimately has zero role for the Federal Government, and we are going \nto spend $600 million which we don't have. We will borrow. It is well \nintended, but it is not our role. It is the States' role. We have \nhundreds of thousands of examples such as that, where we have ignored \nwhat the Constitution says so we can look good politically.\n  We have teacher quality programs. Teacher quality programs--82 \ndifferent programs by the Federal Government to improve the quality of \nour teachers. Thomas Jefferson was truly the father of education in our \ncountry. He worked for years to establish the University of Virginia. \nHe was committed to the fact that a great education will produce great \nbenefits, not only for the individual with the education but for their \nfamily and our country as a whole. Here is what he said: For the \nFederal Government to become involved in education would require a \nchange to the U.S. Constitution, and he happened to be one of the \npeople who wrote it.\n  What have we done since the beginning of the Department of Education? \nWe have spent $2.6 trillion on education in this country at the Federal \nlevel and every parameter measuring a metric on the progression of our \nkids in school is worse or the same after that $2.6 trillion. Hey, it \nis not working. The reason it is not working is a person can be a \nteacher at home and the Federal Government looks at that person and \nthey don't know what to do, but we can hire that person to do the work \nin Washington and all of a sudden that person knows what they need to \ndo. So we have this massive bureaucracy that has ruined our education \nbecause we spend all our money filling out forms and requirements and \nmeeting mandates and we have taken the power and control of education \naway from the parents and teachers, the very people who care most about \nthe success of the kids. So $2.6 trillion with nothing to show for it, \nother than for the politicians to feel good about themselves and to say \nwe were doing something.\n  We have 88 different economic development programs, with $6 billion \njust in four of them. Not for 1 of those 88 programs is there a metric \nanywhere that says it is money well spent that gets a positive result \nfor the country. There is anecdotal evidence that says it worked here \nor it worked there, but we don't know what we are doing. We are \nthrowing money we don't have at things we don't know are working and \nwhen we go to vote for them to eliminate them, the Senate votes against \nit because it might bother their political position. It might bother \ntheir next election. We don't do it. We don't address it and do our \njob.\n  I will never forget in one of the committees I was on last year, two \nseparate times bills were brought up in committee that were doing \nidentical things that we were already doing in the agencies. The \nSenators and their staffs didn't know it. Had I not raised objections, \nwe would have created more agencies.\n  Eighty programs for transportation assistance--80. If it is our role, \nwhy do we need 80? Oh, by the way, has anybody measured to see if any \nof the 80 actually work? The answer is no. We have none that have a \nreport on whether they are effective to the goals of what they were set \nout to do because there is no oversight carried out by Congress. We \nwere so busy earmarking for so many years, everybody forgot to check to \nsee if what we intended to do is working, and we still aren't doing it.\n  We have 56 different programs to teach the American people to become \nfinancially literate--56. The Federal Government is teaching financial \nliteracy when we can't balance our budget. We have multiple programs. \nWe don't live within a confined budget. The first principle of \nfinancial literacy is living within your means. Yet we have this many \nprograms--56--to teach American citizens to be financially literate.\n  Job training. Here is one of the best. This is great. We have 47 job \ntraining programs that cost $16 billion a year. All but three overlap \none another. That is what the GAO says, and there is not a metric on \none of them to see if they are working. When we talk to the people who \ngo through the program, half of them say it is a waste, it is a joke. I \nhave actually talked to them. Yet we are spending that kind of money, \nin excess of $15 billion a year, on job training programs. There is no \nquestion we need job training programs, but we need job training \nprograms that work. Why would we need 47? So when somebody tells you we \ncan't balance our budget, you ought to blow a hole right through them \nwith your thought that says you obviously don't know what is going on \nin the Federal Government.\n  Homeless prevention/assistance, 20 different Federal programs. We \nshould be helping people who need our help. I am not denying that. But \nhow we help and the mechanisms of the way we help ought to be frugal, \nefficient, and effective.\n\n  I have served in Congress--I am in my 13th year, 6 years as a \nCongressman, 4 years out of here to get a breath of fresh air, and now \nmy seventh year in the Senate. What I know is, we don't know what we \nare doing, and it is obvious looking at our budget. It is also obvious \nlooking at the dysfunction of the Senate and the leadership in the \nSenate, that we--we haven't had a budget in 2 years. The one thing any \nfinancial counselor will tell you is the first thing you have to know \nis where you are and set up a plan. We have had no attempt to bring a \nbudget to this body in well over 2\\1/2\\ years--no attempt. What does \nthat tell us? It goes back to vanity. It goes back to cowardice. It \ngoes back to\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nus not doing what we are intended to do because we care more about our \nposition than we care about the country.\n  There are 18 programs to feed the hungry. We have 17 disaster \nresponse/preparedness, just in FEMA--17 different programs, of which 11 \noverlap. FEMA didn't set those up. The bureaucracy didn't create those; \nwe did. Every one of these programs was created by a Member of \nCongress. So we can't blame administrations and we can't blame \nPresidents. What we have to do is blame Congress.\n  We have 130 overlapping programs in the Department of Agriculture; 18 \noverlapping programs in the Department of Commerce; 230 overlapping \nprograms in the Department of Education; 17 in the Department of \nEnergy; 36 in the Department of Human Services; 32 in the Department of \nHomeland Security; 60 in the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment; 40 in the Department of the Interior; 53 in the Department \nof Justice; 35 in the Department of Labor; 6 in the Department of \nState; and 180 governmentwide if we look at all economic development \nprograms. We just listed the 88 that run through 4 of the agencies.\n  Is it any wonder we are going belly up? The problem is us. The \nproblem is we have a solution now that has come to us from the House \nand we are not going to let that solution go forward because \npolitically--politically--it is uncomfortable. Politically, we don't \nwant to allow the people of this country to decide whether we ought to \nlive within our means and put a bridle with a bit in our mouth that \nsays, whoa, you are not going to continue to destroy the future of this \ncountry and the prospects for our children anymore.\n  When I came to the Senate, I came after having read a book called \n``Running On Empty.'' It was written by a man by the name of Pete \nPeterson. He was bipartisan in his criticism of both parties, and he \nwas absolutely accurate. We are in trouble because parties matter more \nthan the country, because control matters more than the country, \nbecause political careers matter more than our children or our \ngrandchildren.\n  So I go back to talk about what is possible. A lot of people would \ndisagree with what is in here; this $9 trillion of what the House has \nsent us would take about 60 percent of it. But here is what I say to my \ncolleagues who don't want to vote on a balanced budget amendment, don't \nwant to vote on cut, cap, and balance. Where is your plan? I have \nlisted 625 pages of specific cuts, elimination of duplication, \nelimination of waste, elimination of fraud, and 3,000 footnotes that \nlooked at every program throughout the Federal programs--looked at \nevery CRS report, looked at every OIG report, looked at every GAO \nreport, looked at every OMB report, and looked at every other outside \nreport we could find.\n  The fact is, we could solve our problems tomorrow, America. We could \nsolve them tomorrow, with good old-fashioned common sense that the vast \nmajority of Americans have and is sorely lacking here.\n  We do not have a fiscal crisis. We have a commonsense crisis in this \nbody and in the leadership in Congress. We lack common sense, we lack \nsound judgment, and we need the hard bit of a bridle put on us through \na balanced budget amendment to control us. Because human nature is \nhuman nature in whatever we do today, we will be back to our bad habits \ntomorrow. Even if we pass cuts, even if we cap spending, if we do not \nhave a balanced budget amendment that forces us to live within the \nconstraints of our revenue, we will be back here again.\n  What does that mean? That means the future of America is suspect. It \ndoes not have to be. We do not have to go the way of every other \nrepublic. We do not have to fail over fiscal issues. We can cheat \nhistory. The American people are the greatest people in the world \nbecause they are a blend of all the people in the world and they desire \nfreedom and opportunity and that is limited because we have limited it.\n  We, through our profligate spending, our inattention to detail, our \nfailure to do oversight, have undercut the potential of our country. \nLet's restore it. Let's restore it Saturday morning by moving on to \nthis bill and allowing ourselves to have a debate, offer amendments, \nand truly debate--have what the Senate has not had in a year and a \nhalf: a real debate about the issues of our day and the reasons behind \nit.\n  But I would caution the American people. Remember what Martin Luther \nKing said as you hear that debate: Vanity asks the question, is it \npopular? Cowardice asks the question, is it expedient? But conscience \nand right and good asks, is it right?\n  I tell you, it is not right to have multiple programs doing the same \nthing, wasting our kids' future. It is not right for the Congress not \nto do oversight and eliminate programs. It is not right for us to spend \nmoney we do not have on things we do not absolutely need. It is not \nright for us to take the control of our children's education from the \nparents and teachers who have their best interests at heart and place \nit in a bureaucracy that has no compassion whatsoever, even though it \nfeigns that it does. It is not right. It may be politically expedient, \nit may be popular to some people, but it does not make it right.\n  As you look at this, here is how you get $9 trillion, and you can \npick any part of that to meet this cut, cap, and balance or you can \ncome up with your own. But the fact is, nobody wants to lay on the \ntable what they think. I have already been roundly criticized in the \npress for certain aspects of this by people who disagree. That is fine. \nI am planning on defending everything I put in here. With the best of \nmy knowledge and a great staff that spent thousands upon thousands of \nhours on this, we came up with a way to solve America's problems, and \nwe can do it.\n  America can be bright, can be growing, can be developing jobs, if we \nget the government out of the way and limit the role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I see my colleague from Delaware, one of my great friends. We hear \nthat said a lot here, but he is a great friend. It is not the \nconventional, common greeting. I believe I am over my time. I will be \nback to the floor to finish this conversation.\n  But America needs to know we do not have any problem we cannot fix. \nWhat we lack are leaders who will fix it. That is our deficit. It is a \ndeficit of courage. It is a deficit of will.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, thank you very much for this time to \nspeak.\n  Before Dr. Coburn leaves the floor, I thank him for the kind things \nhe just said. As to Tom Coburn and I--a lot of people say: Well, that \nis an unlikely duo who would end up working together as much as we have \nand actually having the sense of trust and friendship. There are things \npeople certainly find in me not to like, and the same is true of all of \nus. But I would say, there is nobody in the Senate who cares more about \ngetting our deficits under control. He and Dick Durbin have shown \nterrific courage and leadership, along with others in this so-called \nGang of 6, and also as members of the deficit commission, in trying to \nget us to a comprehensive, bipartisan solution as to how we rein in the \nbudget deficit without destroying our economy, making sure we do not \npierce the debt ceiling and have our financial world begin to crumble \naround us. So I very much appreciate what he said today. I heard most \nof it, not all of it. I have had a chance to work with him in a number \nof areas.\n  What we try to do, and Senator McCaskill--who is presiding at this \nmoment--what she tries to do, along with others of us who serve on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is we try to look \nin every nook and cranny of the Federal Government. Whether it is \ndefense spending, entitlement spending, domestic spending, we look at \nthe so-called tax expenditures, tax breaks, and so forth, and we look \nat all of them and ask this question: How can we get a better result? \nWhether it is health care, education, transportation, defense, how can \nwe get a better result for less money or how can we get a better result \nfor not much more money?\n  We need to do that across our government. We need to change, if you \nwill, the culture in the Federal Government from sort of a culture of \nspendthrift--which a lot of people think we operate under--we have to \nchange it to a culture of thrift and not just for a couple\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nweeks or a couple months or a couple years; I mean for as far as the \neye can see, until these pages who are sitting in front of me--who are \nrising juniors in high school--until they are rising juniors in college \nand out of school and off into the world and well beyond that. That is \nwhat we need to do. That is part of our obligation.\n  One of the recommendations--I am going to go back to over 1 year ago \nwhen we voted on whether to create a deficit commission that would have \na number of members who would be responsible--some elected, some not--\nthey would have a responsibility to look across the Federal Government \nand to come back to us at a date certain with ways to rein in the \nFederal deficit to get us back on a more fiscally sustainable and \nresponsible track.\n  We voted in the Senate. Our Presiding Officer will recall not all the \nfolks who were cosponsors of the legislation that created the deficit \ncommission actually ended up voting for it. In fact, seven of them who \nwere cosponsors--as I recall, I do not believe any of them were on this \nside of the aisle; I think they were on the other side of the aisle--\nended up voting against it, and we did not actually have the votes to \ncreate the deficit commission.\n  With that happening, a number of us encouraged the President to use \nhis Executive powers to create one by Executive order. He did that. \nLast year, the deficit commission was created, and there were 18 people \nnamed to it. Madam President, 12 were elected, 6 were not, and he named \n2 cochairs. One was Erskine Bowles.\n  Erskine Bowles, who is he? He used to be, in the second term of \nPresident Clinton's administration, Chief of Staff for President \nClinton. Erskine was asked by President Clinton to negotiate the \ndeficit reduction package with the Republican House and Senate. At that \ntime, during those years, Republicans were in the majority in the House \nand Senate. President Clinton said: Erskine, go out and negotiate a \ndeficit reduction deal, where some of the deficit reduction comes on \nthe revenue side and some comes on the spending side, so we can follow \nup on, actually, an earlier deficit reduction package adopted in 1993 \nwith only Democratic votes. But he said: Let's see if we can't actually \nbalance our budget. We had not done that since 1968.\n  God bless Erskine Bowles and the folks he negotiated with too. He \nwent to work in 1997 and came up with a deficit reduction package with \n50 percent revenues, 50 percent spending that had everything on the \ntable. A long story short, we ended up with a balanced budget--not 1, \nnot 2, I think at least 3 years in a row at the end of the Clinton \nadministration and handed off to a new administration balanced budget \nsurpluses as for as the eye could see.\n  I remember Alan Greenspan testifying, I think, before the Banking \nCommittee, when Alan Greenspan was the Federal Reserve Chairman. He \nsaid he was concerned at the time we were going to pay down our debt \ntoo soon, too fast. I mentioned to him later that concern was misplaced \nbecause we certainly did not pay down our deficit too fast. About \nstarting 10 years ago, we turned black ink surpluses as far as the eye \ncould see to red ink, to deficits as far as the eye could see.\n\n  A lot of people like to reinvent history. They say we did not do much \nto reduce deficits in the years from, say, 1993 to 2000. Actually, we \nhad two big votes, one in 1993, with all Democrats--and I am not saying \nthis in a partisan way--and one in 1997, where the Republicans in the \nHouse and the Senate actually negotiated in good faith with a \nDemocratic President. With those two packages together, with a strong, \nrobust economy, we balanced the budget not once, not twice, three \ntimes, created something like 21 million new jobs, and ended up for the \ndecade ending in the year 2000 among the nations with a balanced budget \nand the most productive workforce on the face of the Earth. Those were \nhalcyon days for our country. We need to get back to that.\n  So President Obama, naming the cochairs of the deficit commission, \ngoes back to an earlier President and taps the same guy, Erskine \nBowles, to be a coleader of the deficit commission.\n  On the Republican side, the President asked a guy a lot of people \nremember, Alan Simpson, a Republican Senator from Wyoming, here for a \nnumber of years, as maybe the funniest person who ever served in the \nSenate. He is also one of the most insightful, commonsense deficit \nhawks, and a great guy to be a partner with Erskine. They went \ntogether.\n  We had 12 Members of the House and Senate--6 Democrats, 6 \nRepublicans--and some other folks from civilian life. Dave Cote, who is \nchairman and CEO of Honeywell, was among the private sector \nparticipants. But they worked for months and gathered input from all \nkinds of sources and came up with a broad-based plan that was \nrecommended, adopted, endorsed by, if you will, 11 out of the 18 \nCommissioners. That was not the magic threshold of 14 before it \nactually would be the official recommendation of the Commission, but it \nwas a majority, and it included 3 Republican Senators: Judd Gregg, who \nwas then a Senator from New Hampshire, Tom Coburn, and Mike Crapo. I \nthought they were courageous, those Republican Senators.\n  On our side, among them included Kent Conrad and Dick Durbin, and I \nwant to say Mark Warner, but I may be mistaken. Mark has been all over \nthis stuff. I think he has been a real leader, but I am not sure if he \nwas the third Democrat. Yes, the third Democrat was John Spratt, \nDemocrat from South Carolina, chairman of the House Budget Committee. \nBut anyway, those three Democrats and three Republicans basically \nagreed to a package and said: Let's reduce the deficit over the next 10 \nyears by $4 trillion. Let's do it mostly on the spending side--two-\nthirds to three-quarters on the spending side--but let's have revenues \nas well.\n  They did not propose raising the rates. What they actually proposed \nwas to reduce the rates for business, put us more in line with other \nadvanced countries, bring us down from about 35 percent to somewhere \nroughly between 25 percent and 29 percent on the corporate income side, \nto reduce personal income tax rates for middle- to low-income families \nto as low as 8 percent, and to actually reduce the upper income rate \nfrom somewhere in the mid thirties to the high twenties. But at the \nsame time we would bring down the rates. We would eliminate not all but \na lot of the so-called tax expenditures.\n  The tax expenditures--what are tax expenditures? They are tax breaks. \nSome folks call them loopholes. Actually, a lot of them are \nmeritorious: the mortgage deduction, deductions that will encourage \npeople to make charitable donations, stuff that a lot of us will say: \nWe don't want to change that. We don't want to get rid of that. But if \nyou add all those tax expenditures over the next 10 years, do you know \nwhat that adds up to? Madam President, $15 trillion. Think about that. \nAdd all the tax expenditures for the next 10 years, and it is $15 \ntrillion. If we only were able to somehow reduce that by 8 or 9 \npercent, we would come up with the revenues that were called for in the \nBowles-Simpson deficit commission to be part of a $4 trillion package.\n  In order to be able to bring the rates down, to lower the rates, \nbroaden the base--in order to do that--we are going to have to take \nmore than 8 or 9 percent out of tax expenditures. They may have to be \nreduced by as much as 50 percent.\n  I would argue, at the end of the day, we should preserve the \ndeduction for interest we pay on mortgages, especially for our primary \nhome. Also, to encourage charitable donations, I think we ought to \npreserve the deduction for charitable donations. There are others as \nwell. But those are a couple of the good ones. But that was sort of the \nsum and substance they came up with.\n  Among the things the Bowles-Simpson commission also said we ought to \nhave on the table for deficit reduction is entitlement programs.\n  What are entitlement programs? Things that we are entitled to by \nvirtue of our age, our station in life. If we are 65 years of age and \nwe have paid into Social Security and Medicare, we may be eligible--we \nwill be eligible, in all likelihood, for Medicare. If we are disabled \nand totally unable to work, we will be eligible for Medicare even \nbefore age 65.\n  If we paid into Social Security for a number of years, we would be \neligible for early retirement for Social Security at age 62. If we want \nto take it later, we can take it at age 67 for full\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\nretirement benefits, which I think are roughly about $2,000 per month \nmax, something like that.\n  Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security are entitlement programs. They \nsaid they should all be on the table. They did not propose using Social \nSecurity to balance the budget. But they did say: We have a long-term \nproblem in Social Security with an imbalance between now, the amount of \nmoney that is coming into Social Security, and the amount of money that \nis going out.\n  As the baby boomers are starting to retire--my generation--we are \npaying out now, for the first time in a long time, more in Social \nSecurity benefits than we are raising. The reason is, for today it is \nroughly, for every one person receiving Social Security benefits there \nare about 2\\1/2\\ people working. Before long it will be for every one \nperson receiving Social Security benefits, it will be two people \nworking and paying into Social Security. The mismatch of inflow into \nthe Social Security trust fund versus the outflow is going to get worse \nnot better.\n  Sometime, a couple of decades down the road, we are going to start \nrunning out of money to pay 100 percent of Social Security benefits. We \nwill not have to stop them all together, but we will have to get them a \npretty serious haircut. I was a freshman Congressman, sworn in on \nJanuary 3, 1983. The day I was sworn in at the other end of the \nCapitol, they told all of my freshman class: We are going to run out of \nmoney in Social Security. That is what they said.\n  We said: Well, when? In a couple of decades or when?\n  They said: No. This year. This year.\n  We said: Are we going to provide a haircut, reduce Social Security \npayments?\n  They said: No, we are going to stop making them because we are \nrunning out of money in the Social Security trust fund.\n  That was where we were on January 3, 1983. Thanks to the good work of \nthe commission led by Alan Greenspan and others, but the good work they \ndid then, they handed off to us not just a problem but a solution. \nTheir solution was a combination of new sources of revenue for Social \nSecurity and some reductions in benefits, gradually raising the full \nretirement age over a period of 25 years from 65 to 67; requiring what \npeople pay into Social Security, State and local employees, among \nothers. A balanced plan.\n  Ronald Reagan, then President, provided political cover to Democrats \nto vote for that. Tip O'Neill, then Democratic Speaker of the House, \nprovided cover for the Republicans to vote for that. Almost everybody, \nHouse and Senate, Democrat and Republican, drank the Kool-Aid and voted \nto preserve Social Security. It preserved it for another 25 years. We \ndid not have to stop paying Social Security benefits that year or the \nnext year or the next year after that. We had a significant surplus \nthat has gone up in the Social Security trust fund.\n  But now it is beginning to be paid down. But the fund is going to be \ngoing in the wrong direction in the years to come. Over time the \noutflow will increase as my generation retires. The question is, Do we \nwait until the 2020s or 2030s to do something about it? I do not think \nwe should. I swore, 28 years ago, I did not want to hand off to the \nnext generation the problems we should solve today.\n  We have an opportunity not to use Social Security to balance the \nbudget, but actually under the plan that has been now sort of reworked \nfrom the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, the opportunity to secure \nSocial Security for the next 75 years, and to do it in a way that \ninvolves a number of, I think, relatively modest changes, some new \nrevenues, and to gradually increasing the full retirement age from 67 \nto 68 by 2050, and from 68 to 69 by 2075.\n  Remember, when Social Security was first introduced, signed into law \nby FDR back in the 1930s, a person had to be 65 years of age in order \nto receive Social Security benefits. The average life expectancy then \nwas just over age 60. Think about that. Back then a person had to live \nto 65 to draw benefits. The life expectancy for most people under 65 \nwas between 60 and 65.\n  We are talking today about a life expectancy closer to 80. People \nstill get early benefits for early retirement benefits under Social \nSecurity at age 62, but to gradually increase the full retirement age \nand make a couple of other changes as well that on the surface do not \nseem to be major changes--in fact, I think they are relatively modest. \nBut when we put them all together over many years, it is a lot of \ndollars and a lot of people.\n  We can put Social Security on a safe footing for another 75 years. \nThe idea is to actually kind of wall that off from the rest of the \nproblems so we are basically preserving Social Security for a lot \nlonger, for my lifespan and the lifespan of these young pages who are \nabout 16 years of age, throughout their lifetimes as well.\n  On Medicare--let me talk about Medicare, health care for people 65 \nand over, people who are totally disabled under the age of 65 and are \nunable to work. We will spend this year about $550 billion in \nMedicare--about $550 billion. The amount of fraud in Medicare--Eric \nHolder, our Attorney General, tells us that fraud each year from \nMedicare is about $60 billion. That is roughly 10 percent of the amount \nof money we spend in Medicare--$60 billion. Roughly 10 percent.\n  GAO keeps track of something else that is called improper payments. \nOne of the things GAO does is tell us every year how much we are making \nin improper payments in our Federal Government across the board. They \nsaid last year improper payments were about $125 billion. That is \ndifferent from fraud. That is just overpayments, accounting mistakes, \nthat sort of thing--$48 billion in improper payments for Medicare, and \nanother $60 billion, according to Eric Holder, just from fraud.\n  If those numbers are true, $60 billion out of $550 billion in \nMedicare payments, that is actually more than 10 percent. Well, let's \njust say it is only 10 percent or close to 10 percent.\n  How are they doing over in the private sector? How are they doing in \nthe private sector in terms of controlling their fraud? Well, their \nfraud costs are not 10 percent of their costs. That is probably not a \nsurprise. They are not 9 percent. They are not 8 percent. They are not \n7 percent. On balance, they are probably closer to 5 percent, and in \nsome cases less than 5 percent. Roughly half, their fraud cost, over \nMedicare. Maybe they are doing something over in the private sector to \ncontrol fraud in ways that we can learn from in the Federal Government. \nIf we can learn those lessons, maybe we can provide better rules for \nless money in Medicare.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. Improper payments. Last year \nMedicare had $48 billion in overpayments, mistakes, that kind of \nthing--$48 billion--separate from fraud. The President said we are \ngoing to cut it in half by the end of next year, from roughly $50 to \n$25 billion. If we do that for 10 years, 10 years times $25 billion, \nwhat does that add up to? $250 billion. That is real money around here, \none-quarter of a trillion dollars.\n  If Eric Holder, our Attorney General, is right on the fraud side, we \nactually have $60 billion in fraud losses for Medicare in a year, if we \ncould cut that in half--and we put in the health care law, the new \nhealth care law, all kinds of tools to do that kind of thing. If we can \ncut that in half, that would be a savings of $30 billion a year. Over \n10 years that is $300 billion--$300 billion in potential fraud savings, \n$250 billion in potential savings by cutting in half improper payments \nfor Medicare. That is $550 billion. That is over $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  For those who say we have to savage Medicare and Medicaid in order to \nreduce outlays in them and achieve savings in Medicare and Medicaid, \nthat is not correct. That is not true. Let me give you a sense for \nwhere some of the money is being lost in fraud.\n  I have learned a new term this last week called the ``death master \nfile.'' Maybe you have heard that term before but did not remember it.\n  But we are trying to keep track of the folks who are dying so that \nwe--when people die who are getting Social Security, we do not continue \nto send out Social Security checks forever for people who are dead. The \nsame thing with folks who are eligible for other benefits, whether they \nare benefits for--whether they happen to be educational benefits or \nhealth benefits. We do not want to pay benefits for folks who, frankly, \nare not with us anymore.\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\n  By the same token, we want to make sure that when doctors die, we do \nnot face the possibility that someone steals their provider ID number, \ntheir Medicare provider ID number, or their Medicaid provider ID \nnumber, if they have one, and write prescriptions for, among other \nthings, controlled substances. What we have today are crooks, \ncriminals, stealing provider ID numbers from dead doctors and using \nthose to write prescriptions for controlled substances, which then feed \nthe drug trade and provide profits to criminal groups.\n  The inspector general tells us in the most recent report in terms of \nbuying advanced wheelchairs, we spent almost $200 million a few years \nago. Over half of the payments did not meet the Medicare reimbursement \nrules for the wheelchairs.\n  We have to be smarter than that. Over in Japan--I have my friend from \nFlorida sitting here waiting for me. He is cooling his jets, but he \nwill not do it for long, so I will close with this: As he knows, we \nserved together on the Finance Committee, and we used to serve together \nin the House. He is an old friend and a good one. But as we wrestled \nwith health care reform legislation a year or two ago, one of the \nthings we heard in our hearings was, over in Japan--we compete against \nJapan, friendly competition, but they are our competitor in a lot of \nways: electronics, cars, any number of products, we compete against \nthem. They spend about 8 percent of GDP for health care. We spend 16 \npercent. They get better results: longer life, longevity, less infant \nmortality. They get better results. They spend half as much, they get \nbetter results. They cover everybody. They cover everybody.\n  I would like to say, they cannot be that smart. As smart as they are \nin Japan, they cannot be that smart, and we cannot be that dumb. There \nare any number of ways that we can actually save money that does not \nreduce benefits in Medicare or Medicaid. We can learn from some of the \nthings they are doing to uncover fraud and reduce improper payments in \nthe private sector and just navigate some of those ideas over to the \npublic sector, and find out what works.\n  I like to say--this was Alan Blinder's. Alan Blinder testified before \nus a couple of months ago, a month or two ago, as the Senator will \nremember.\n  Alan Blinder said: In terms of reducing the deficit, especially on \nhealth care costs, he said: I am not an expert on this thing, but here \nis my advice to you. Find out what works. Do more of that.\n  Think of that. Find out what works, do more of that. The converse of \nthat would be, find out what does not work, do less of that. If we do \nthat sort of thing, if we do it not just once or twice or for a couple \nof weeks or a couple of years, but we just make that a cultural change \ngoing forward, we will get us back on the right track. That is our \nchallenge.\n  It is not just Democrats, it is not just Republicans, it is not just \nthe Congress, we are in this with the President. We are all in this \ntogether.\n  In closing, that is a good thing for us to remember. We are all in \nthis together. We do not have all of the smart ideas on this side, \nneither do the Republicans. It has to be a combination of spending and \nrevenue. If we are smart about it, we will come out of this at the end \nof the day just fine.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I know that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has time. I just want to take this time while he is \ncoming into the Chamber to say that you can almost hear in the \nbackground very foreboding music as we are counting down the days. Here \nwe are in a situation in which we cannot get a certain group of people \nover in the House of Representatives to be willing to sit down, and, as \nthe Good Book says, to come and let us reason together.\n  If we are going to govern this country, we have to come and reason \ntogether, people of goodwill who will respect each other's point of \nview, to hammer out a final agreement in order to start bringing this \ncountry into balance. It is sad that it is taking this long and this \nmuch of a difficult torturous process.\n\n\n                           Florida's History\n\n  On a much happier note, at a subsequent time I want to share with the \nSenate the wonderful heritage that we have in this country, not from \nthe English but from the Spanish. We are about to celebrate 500 years \nof the discovery of what is now America, the United States, from the \nSpanish explorer Ponce de Leon who first came to the shores of my \nState. Then soon thereafter we will celebrate the 450th anniversary of \nthe oldest continuous settlement, a settlement that is 42 years before \nthe English came and settled Jamestown.\n  Those celebrations are going to be not just for Florida and not just \nfor St. Augustine but for all of Florida and all of the country. We \nhave a commission that has been appointed by the Secretary of the \nInterior. We have just kicked off that commission. I will be sharing \nwith the Senate a lot about this historical restoration in the public's \nmind of all of those Spanish explorers who helped establish this \ncountry, first with Ponce de Leon in 1513, and he came back in 1539.\n  By the way, the Puerto Rican community is quite energized and excited \nabout this because Ponce de Leon, when he came and found at the Feast \nof Flowers, Pascua Florida--and thus he named La Florida--he was the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico.\n  So they are quite excited, as they should be, and they will be part \nof this celebration.\n  After him came a Spanish explorer named de Ayllon, who sailed up the \ncoast.\n  Later, in 1527, came Spanish explorer Narvaez, who landed somewhere \nin the Tampa region and went up into the panhandle of Florida.\n  After him came the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in the late \n1530s. He ended up landing also in the Tampa Bay region when, all over \nFlorida, they celebrated the first Christmas because he had Spanish \npriests with him and was in what is today Tallahassee by Christmas Day. \nThey celebrated the first Christian Christmas by Europeans in this new \nworld of what is now the United States. That was the late 1530s. Then \nhe ended up traveling all over the United States, what is now the \nSoutheastern United States.\n  Then along came de Luna thinking he would have the first permanent \nsettlement in 1559 in Pensacola, and in 1561, along came a hurricane, \nand it wiped them out. We had the King and Queen of Spain in Pensacola \non that anniversary back in 2009.\n  Then later came the French thinking they were going to set up the \nfirst permanent settlement at Fort Carline at the mouth of what is \ntoday the St. John's River at Jacksonville in 1564. But when they heard \nthat the Spanish explorer Menendez had come 30 miles to the south to \nset up this permanent settlement at St. Augustine, they sailed to wipe \nout the Spanish colony and instead got hit by a hurricane and were \nshipwrecked and thus dispatched by the Spanish explorer Menendez. From \nthere, St. Augustine continued all the way to the present day. You \nought to see that restored city. It is a sight to behold, and it is not \nonly the history of St. Augustine, the history of Florida, it is the \nhistory of this United States.\n  I will share a lot more about our Spanish history, our roots in this \ncountry. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind indulgence \nso that I might share this with the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Florida. \nI am delighted to accommodate him and join with all Floridians in a \ngood celebration of a great part of our history.\n  Madam President, obviously everybody in America is well aware that \nthe date of August 2 is fast coming at us. They are also, \nunfortunately, well aware that the Senate and the Congress appear to be \nstuck yet again at this moment--in fact, here in the Senate we are \ndebating a constitutional amendment to balance the budget instead of \nbalancing the budget. I have heard a lot of sidesteps around here, but \nthis is what they call a message amendment. It is sending a pretty \nmixed message to America.\n  What we, in effect, ought to be doing is not trying to pass a piece \nof paper\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nthat tells us to do what we know we ought to do, we ought to be doing \nit. What we ought to be doing is stopping our country from defaulting \non debt that has already been obligated.\n  What people are refusing to do in the House on the other side of the \naisle is to live up to our obligations. This is not suggesting that we \nare giving permission to borrow more money to spend money on something \nresponsible in the future; this is paying the debts of our country--\nmoney already spent, already obligated.\n  Here we have the so-called Cut, Cap, and Balance Act that passed the \nHouse of Representatives. Everybody understands it is nothing more than \nan ideological message exercise. Everybody knows it is not going to \npass the Senate. We know even more that if it does pass, it is not \ngoing to be signed by the President of the United States. What it is \ndoing is taking up time that we ought to be spending with a real \nsolution on the floor of the Senate that addresses the needs and \nconcerns of the American people. We ought to be reaching that \ncompromise. What this does, unfortunately, in terms of message is it \nsends a message to the American people that this place may not quite \nget it still and that a lot of folks here are more prepared to play \npolitics than to really engage in the real business of our Nation.\n  If you look at the specifics of this legislation, which is not going \nto pass, it is divided into three parts. Each one of them is equally \nproblematic.\n  The cut part of the bill would require immediate cuts that would cut \nalmost 1 percent of our GDP, which economists tell us would result in \nthe immediate loss of 700,000 jobs. So they are coming to the floor \nwith a program to actually cut 700,000 jobs at a time when most \nAmericans believe job creation is the single most important thing we \ncan do in the country, as well as avoid defaulting on our debt.\n  The cap part locks into place the unrealistic spending levels the \nHouse passed in their budget, while at the same time preserving \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans and tax loopholes for the biggest corporations.\n  I think every American scratches their head and says: What? They are \ngoing to put in these unrealistic caps that would strip away research \nand development, education funding, the ability of kids to go to \ncollege--all of the things on which we build the future job base of our \ncountry. They are going to strip that away, but preserve the tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest people in the country, who, incidentally, may be \ninvesting the benefits of those tax cuts in China or in India or job \ncreation in many places other than here.\n  The balance part of this amendment requires the passage of a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment that would require a supermajority to \nraise any new revenue or close any wasteful tax loopholes. In other \nwords, you don't have to have a supermajority to decide where and what \nyou are going to wind up spending, but you have to have a supermajority \nin order to raise any revenue or close an egregious tax loophole--one \nthat may have no economic purpose, may be completely outdated, or may \nbe a sweetheart deal that got into the Tax Code over the course of the \nyears, but you still have to get a supermajority to get rid of that.\n  Everybody here knows how hard it is to get 60 votes. A lot of the \nbusiness in the Senate has been caught up by the eternal filibuster. \nEvery single nomination, every single small piece of legislation that \ncomes to the floor of the Senate--everything requires a motion to \nproceed, which requires 60 votes, which is effectively a filibuster \neach time. We have had a record number of filibusters in the Senate \nover the last three years compared to any other time in the entire \nhistory of the United States of America, so requiring that two-thirds \nsupermajority would lock in gridlock, it would lock in bad policies for \nthe future.\n  The constitutional amendment that is proposed would make all revenue-\nraising measures unconstitutional unless they secured a two-thirds \nsupermajority in both the House and the Senate.\n  Again, I repeat, we do not need a piece of paper, a new one--we do \nnot need an amendment to the Constitution, a group of words--to tell us \nto do our duty. Every single Member of the Senate raised their right \nhand and took an oath of office over there beside the Presiding Officer \nand said they promised to uphold the Constitution of the United States. \nAll we need is the courage and the conviction to make compromises and \ndo the business of the Senate. It is not going to get any easier just \nbecause you pass some words that tell you to do it.\n  We did this in the 1990s. What I am talking about is not pie-in-the-\nsky, it is not some theory; we balanced the budget in the 1990s. We did \nit without a constitutional amendment. We had people of good common \nsense who came together and voted on compromises, and we not only \nbalanced the budget, we created a $5.6 trillion surplus for America, \nand at the same time we created 23 million new jobs for Americans. \nGuess what. While we balanced the budget in a sensible way, without \nartificial caps and artificial, Draconian instructions but with common \nsense, while we did that, every single quintile of American income \nearners rose in their income. Every single American quintile saw their \nincomes go up. America got richer than at any time in America's history \neven as we balanced the budget without a balanced budget amendment.\n  So I will tell you, if we go down the road our friends on the other \nside of the aisle are proposing, we will see major reductions in \nMedicare, and much worse than what the Ryan budget proposed, and Social \nSecurity beneficiaries would receive a $3,000 reduction in average \nrecipient benefits within 10 years and be forced to see deeper cuts \ndown the road. I think it is safe to say, without exaggeration, that it \nwould put an end to Social Security and Medicare as we know them today.\n  This week, Eric Maskin, Robert Solow, and Alan Blinder--each a Nobel \nlaureate in economics--and other renowned economists sent an open \nletter to President Obama and Congress in strong opposition to a \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment. These economists stated that \na balanced budget requirement to the Constitution would be a ``very \nunsound policy'' that would adversely affect the economy.\n  They believe that adding arbitrary caps on Federal expenditures would \nmake the balanced budget amendment even more problematic.\n  A balanced budget amendment would mandate perverse actions in the \nface of recessions. By requiring large budget cuts when the economy is \nweakest, the amendment would actually aggravate recessions.\n  Madam President, in the 27 years I have been privileged to serve \nhere, we have already debated this several times. We have voted on it. \nAs I have said in the past, the most compelling argument against this \namendment doesn't come from me or from anybody on the floor; it \nactually comes from the real experts, the people who framed the \nConstitution of the United States. If they were here on the floor of \nthe Senate today, they would vote against this amendment because it \nviolates the Constitution's most basic tenet majority rule. The notion \nthat the most fundamental document of law can be set aside for a time \nis ludicrous and anathema to the very reasons for having a governing \ndocument at all.\n  Worst of all, this bill from the House Republicans, holds hostage the \nincrease in the debt limit needed by August 2 and it holds it hostage \nuntil a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is sent to the \nstates. We all know that is not going to happen. August 2 is looming. \nWe have to put aside this type of partisanship. We need to sit together \nand develop a bipartisan plan that works for America with no \npreconditions and not hide behind a constitutional amendment that makes \nchoices for us.\n  We can no longer afford to delay. We are facing a default that would \njeopardize Social Security payments, Medicare benefits, and troops' \npay, as well as send interest rates soaring in a way that would force \nAmericans to pay more for their mortgages, student loans, and small \nbusiness loans. And the whole world is watching to see if we make the \nright choices because the consequences would be cataclysmic.\n  Madam President, let's get real. President Obama offered to cut the \ndebt by $4 trillion--exactly what we know we need in savings and nearly \ntwice as much as the Republicans had\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nproposed--and Republicans turned it down. President Obama has gone the \nextra mile. He has put everything on the table, even things Democrats \nstrongly oppose. But the House Republicans simply will not budge \nbecause for them, this isn't about the deficit; it is about ideology, \nan extreme ideology.\n  But it needs to be about priorities. And leadership. President \nKennedy said ``sometimes party asks too much.'' Well, if the cost of \nideology is economic ruin, the House Republicans really are asking too \nmuch--much too much. Americans deserve better. They need the Senate not \nto be a slightly slower version of the House; no, they need the Senate \nto be the deliberative body of serious people the Framers expected us \nto be.\n  Madam President, I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate my friend's courtesy.\n  I want everyone who has any interest in this piece of legislation on \nthe floor today to know that now is the time to come and debate to \ntheir heart's content. If they want to debate it late tonight, we are \nhere to do it late tonight. If they want to debate it tomorrow for a \nperiod of time, they can do that.\n  I think this piece of legislation is about as weak and senseless as \nanything that has ever come to the Senate floor, and I am not going to \nwaste the Senate's time day after day on this piece of legislation, \nwhich I think is anathema to what our country is all about. So I want \neveryone to understand we are going to have a vote tomorrow. I am not \ngoing to wait until Saturday. We are going to vote tomorrow, and I feel \nconfident this legislation will be disposed of one way or the other.\n  The American people should understand this is a bad piece of \nlegislation--perhaps the worst piece of legislation in the history of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I hope we will move quickly to the real \nbusiness, which is avoiding default. Let me say, I think there is one \neffort we ought to be engaged in, and that is the serious effort of \npassing the McConnell-Reid, Reid-McConnell initiative, or whatever you \nwant to call it. Their initiative is not kicking anything down the \nroad. Their initiative requires, just like the base closing commission, \nfor the Senate to deal with the big deal in a very short period of \ntime. If colleagues want to speed that period of time up, I wouldn't \nobject. I think that would make sense.\n  What we need to do is to recognize that in the next few days we do \nnot have the time to put the kind of common sense to the task that will \nallow us to get the budget figures from the CBO, that will allow us to \nknow with certainty what we are doing with Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, or all of these other important initiatives are being done in \nthe most deliberative and thoughtful way possible. That is what this \ninstitution is supposed to be about. That is what makes the Senate the \nworld's most deliberative body, but it hasn't been particularly \ndeliberative on this subject in the past months.\n  We have the opportunity, with the Reid-McConnell initiative to be \nable to put in place a process that will guarantee we have up-or-down \nvotes on these critical issues after all the relevant committees have \nhad the opportunity to weigh in, using perhaps the budget commission's \nreport, together with what the so-called Gang of 6--which I don't think \nis a particularly appropriate name--has proposed, which I think is a \nvery constructive and important contribution to the debate. It helps us \nhave a starting point for this discussion, as Congress, in the next \nshort period of time, actually fashions the kind of budget decision \nthat benefits America and does credit to this institution as a truly \ndeliberative body.\n  That is what I hope we do, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in an effort to make that happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for, hopefully, no more than 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     FAA Reauthorization Extension\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, yesterday, at the direction of the \nleadership, the House passed an FAA extension. Unlike the 20 previous \nFAA extensions, their extension included changes to FAA policy that had \nnot been agreed to by both the House and the Senate--both Chambers. \nWhat is the effect? The effect is that move will begin to shut down the \nFederal Aviation Administration, beginning tomorrow at midnight, if we \ndo not reach agreement on a sensible path forward to pass a clean FAA \nextension bill.\n  The consequences of an FAA shutdown will be severe. This is not about \nme or the content of the extraneous provisions in the House bill. This \nis about being responsible and doing the necessary work to ensure our \naviation system continues to function at its highest level while \nCongress completes its business.\n  Over the past 4 years--which is how long we have been negotiating \nthis bill--we have been able to work together to do the right thing \neach time the FAA authorities were about to expire. Congress has \nconsistently acted to pass extensions to make certain the Nation's air \ntransportation system continues to operate safely. Therefore, we have \npassed 20 extensions over 4 years waiting to do the work we need to do \nfor an enormous Federal agency. In only one case were policy changes \nmade during the consideration of an FAA extension, and that was last \nyear. Airline safety measures were included because both the House and \nthe Senate negotiators agreed to them, and the extension passed \nunanimously in both Chambers. You don't pass an extension which has \npolicy riders on it unless they have been agreed to by both Chambers.\n  It is very unfortunate the House is taking a rash approach to pass a \nbill when we have made so much progress negotiating a complete FAA \nreauthorization package. From the time the House passed the FAA \nreauthorization, we have had more than 3 months of productive \nnegotiations, where staff engaged in more than 30 meetings and spent \nhundreds of hours developing this legislation.\n  Over this period, we have worked the entire number of items to be \nresolved from 281 separate issues to approximately 10 separate \nprovisions of consequence. House and Senate negotiators have compiled \nmore than 300 pages of text for a bill. All of the components of the \nlegislation represent needed aviation policy changes that will improve \nthe country's airspace system.\n  I remind you that our country, unlike virtually any other in the \nmodern world, basically uses radar as a way to approach landing or \ntakeoff. It is embarrassing. It is ridiculous.\n  I have been able to negotiate with the two other committees in the \nHouse--the Science Committee and the Homeland Security Committee--to \ndevelop workable agreements on all of our policy differences. The main \nitems that need to be made final are difficult, yes, partisan \nprovisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee--T, as they say--and its \nchairman, John Mica.\n\n  The House bill was developed in a partisan manner. It had a number of \nproblematic provisions added during floor consideration. Central to \nthese was the decision to include language that would reverse a \nNational Mediation Board decision from the previous year. The National \nMediation Board--the NMB--provision was so tainted that it passed by \njust seven votes in the House, which is overwhelmingly Republican. It \npassed by just seven votes. Consideration of the final FAA package \npassed in the House by a party-line vote of 223-196. Ultimately, the \nHouse FAA reauthorization bill garnered the narrowest vote margin for a \nHouse FAA reauthorization bill in almost 30 years. I am talking about \nthe House of Representatives.\n  As the House well knows, the White House has threatened on numerous \noccasions to veto any FAA package that includes the House's National \nMediation Board language. The House's addition of policy riders to the \nextension that are being considered as part of the FAA reauthorization \ndiscussions represent an abandonment, in my judgment, of the good-faith \nnegotiations we have been engaged in for the last 3 months.\n  The House acted without consulting the Senate on this FAA extension,\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nwithout engaging the Senate on putting policy riders into their \nextension. From their actions and public statements, it is clear this \neffort is designed to force the hand of the Congress on the National \nMediation Board provision that President Obama has singled out as a \nreason to veto the legislation. That is the legislation which basically \nsays if you have a vote for a union, or for whatever, and if you are \nnot present and don't vote, your vote is automatically counted as no. \nThis is a whole new concept of democracy in America, one which is very \nstrange and very wrong.\n  The House claims that negotiations on the FAA bill have been stalled \nover the NMB issue, but they have simply not done their work. It has \nbeen over 100 days since the House passed the FAA bill and they have \nnever even appointed conferees. We have done that; they have not. The \nSenate is ready to break this deadlock, but we have not been able to \nengage in a formal process because there are no House conferees. The \nSenate includes all of its conferees in negotiations and works through \neach provision to reach bipartisan agreement. And as I indicated \nearlier, we have gone from 281 down to 10 issues. The House only had \nChairman Mica, and now the House leadership, calling the shots on each \nnegotiated item. It makes it very awkward to negotiate anything at all.\n  If the House wants to move forward, it is time they appointed \nconferees and we will be able to determine where things stand on what \nremains in the FAA reauthorization bill. But the Senate cannot accept \nthe House sending over items that remain to be negotiated in a \npiecemeal fashion as part of this FAA extension, which is what they \nhave done; or for that matter, any future extensions. And it may come \nto that.\n  The American people expect Congress to work together to reach \nagreement. That is what I have been in the Senate for, to reach \nagreement, and not to have 20 extensions over 4 years. What an \nembarrassment, chopping the FAA continuity up into tiny little chunks \nso they can't even let out contracts or proceed with their work. The \nAmerican people expect Congress to reach agreement, and I believe we \ncan do this, but it is going to take some more time.\n  If the House continues its attempt to hold the Senate hostage on the \nFAA extension, it will result in a partial shutdown of the Federal \nAviation Administration, and people need to consider that very \nseriously. A majority of the Senate is more than willing to pass a \nclean FAA extension of any length. This week, I introduced S. 1387, \nwith Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Max Baucus, to do just \nthat. Our bill would give the FAA the necessary funding and authority \nto keep the agency functioning into September--I think September 16.\n  I have also indicated to the House on at least four occasions that I \nam willing to drop all of the remaining controversial items that are \nnot included in both bills in order to get us close to a deal. That \noffer--seemingly reasonable--has been consistently rejected by the \nHouse.\n  Despite the House's lack of appointing conferees on the FAA bill, and \nwillingness to threaten the agency with problematic extensions, I do \nremain committed to completing this process in a proper and responsible \nway.\n  Again, after spending 4 years trying to complete this bill, nobody \nwants a resolution more than I do. It is not a way to run a train, much \nless an airline.\n  I believe we can finish a comprehensive FAA reauthorization by August \nif the House will come back to the negotiating table in good faith. I \nam willing to sit down at the table anytime to move the larger FAA \npackage forward or to develop an FAA extension that can pass the \nCongress. We will try to move a clean FAA extension through the Senate. \nHaving said that, I ask that the other Members do support this effort \nwhen that happens, which will be shortly, and allow us to complete the \nFAA reauthorization bill.\n  I will say a word on the consequences of an FAA shutdown. An \nexpiration of the FAA will shut down any activities funded out of FAA's \nfour capital accounts, which I will not name. This includes a program \nto halt the airport improvement program, which provides $3.5 billion \nfor infrastructure projects at airports annually and is estimated to \nsupport more than 150,000 jobs a year now. Nonessential employees will \nbe furloughed, and approximately 4,000 FAA employees will be among \nthem.\n  If the FAA authorities do expire, the agency estimates it could only \noperate air traffic support services through about mid-August 2011. \nThis would mean services to smaller areas such as mine, West Virginia, \nwould need to draw down in the near term so that the FAA can focus on \nprimary traffic. That is not something we would look forward to.\n  A shutdown quickly starts to have safety implications too and safety \nprojects at airports. It also places a hold on testing and \nimplementation of NexGen efforts, Next Generation efforts. That is the \nmodern GPS-based system which is clear, precise, and reads where \nairplanes are and how fast they can land one after the other with great \nprecision. Fewer personnel will be available to dispatch to problem \nareas. So these are real concerns.\n  Madam President, I hope my colleagues will hear what I have said. I \nhope my colleagues in the other body will hear what I have said. I want \nto proceed in good faith. I have tried. It has not worked. The American \npeople are suffering as a result of it, particularly the aviation \nindustry and the Federal Aviation Administration. I would hope my \nspeech will be listened to.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. While the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee and my dear friend from West Virginia is on the floor, I \nwanted to illuminate a little bit of the difficulty on the FAA \nreauthorization.\n  I share concern with the chairman, as he knows, because we talked in \nthe well last night about our desire for a reauthorization of FAA and \nhow important it is to our economy. But the difficulty between the \nHouse and the Senate, in part, has been over the House version as it \ntreated the National Mediation Board versus the Senate's unwillingness \nto consider any change in current status with the NMB.\n  I have been the negotiator or the runner, or whatever you want to \ncall it, between the two bodies, Mr. Mica and Mr. Rockefeller. As the \nchairman knows, about 1 month ago I delivered Leader Reid a \ncomprehensive list of requests the House had asked for in the \nreauthorization. Senator Reid and his staff, after pondering it for a \nfew days, responded that they would not agree to any of the changes \nthat were requested.\n  I then went back and said, well, let me see what I can do to try to \nfind some common ground, and came back with a recommendation I gave to \nChairman Rockefeller that said give judicial review to the airlines, \nwhich the unions already have under the National Labor Relations Act, \nto have a balanced treatment in terms of a response in terms of NMB \nregulation. As it turns out, that was an unsatisfactory offer.\n  The House I think still insists that some provision addressing the \nNational Mediation Board should be included in the authorization, and \nthat--and if I am incorrect in any way, please, Mr. Chairman, correct \nme--I think that is the primary difficulty in getting to a final \nconclusion.\n  From my standpoint, I want everybody to understand clearly, I agree \nwith the chairman that we need a reauthorization. But I also think we \nneed a balanced playing field with NMB, and I continue to work to try \nand find some common ground to see to it that the aviation industry can \nhave judicial review, just as the unions already have, with regard to \nNMB regulations and NMB rulings.\n  I wanted that to be documented in the Record. I thank the chairman \nfor letting me have a little time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it has been reported that the White \nHouse has made an internal decision not to send Congress three long-\npending free trade agreements before the August recess. I wish to be \nable to reiterate that I, for one, remain as committed as ever to \npassing these job-creating agreements into law as quickly as possible, \ngiven the condition of our economy.\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\n  As I see it, every sticking point seems to have been resolved. The \nWhite House initially said it needed a deal on trade adjustment \nassistance on the substance. I think they have gotten that. Then they \nsaid they needed an agreement on the process. I believe we have \nachieved that.\n  I, myself, am personally committed to working with the majority \nleader to ensure a fair floor process for my Members so they have an \nopportunity to try to amend a stand-alone trade adjustment assistance \nbill separate from the three free-trade agreements. That way, if the \nadministration can generate the votes it needs, TAA will pass on its \nmerits.\n  I think we have a pretty clear path in front of us at this point. I \nrecognize that the calendar is tight, that we have got a lot of other \nurgent business to take care of around here, so I don't expect to \nfinish any of this before August. Still, I think the administration \nshould submit the agreements anyway as a show of good faith with our \ntrading allies in Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Then we can work to pass \nthem when we return. The administration has received everything it has \npublicly asked for on TAA. It is time to show they are serious about \ncreating jobs and getting those deals done.\n  This is an opportunity to create jobs in America for Americans. It \nwas snarled needlessly by the suggestion that TAA be dropped inside \nthese agreements. That now has been cleared up. We are going to have an \nopportunity to ratify all three of these trade agreements, which will \nbe good for the country, and the TAA issue will be dealt with \nseparately, and all indications are that the votes are there to pass \nthe TAA bill.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to tell my \ncolleagues why I support the issue of cap, cut, and balance.\n  On August 2, our Nation will be unable to borrow money to meet our \ncurrent obligations. We have known for a while this was coming. Our \nannual deficits have been near $1.5 trillion for the past 2 years and \nare going to be that large this year as well.\n  With deficits of that size, no one should be surprised that we have \nhit the debt ceiling, which raises the question then: What has the \nPresident offered to confront this looming crisis?\n  I ask that question because people expect a President to lead, and we \nhave had an executive budget and an executive budget law since I think \nthe 1920s putting the President in the lead on these issues.\n  So I ask another question: What has the Senate Democratic majority \ndone to address our deficit crisis? Because it is the responsibility of \nthe majority to present a budget to the Congress of the United States, \nand we have not had a budget resolution for more than 800 days now. So \nI think you can draw the conclusion, whether it is the President of the \nUnited States or the Senate majority, the answer is simple: Not much \nhas been done.\n  Last year, President Obama virtually ignored his own deficit \nreduction commission. Remember, in February 2010 the President \nappointed a lot of people to a deficit reduction commission to give us \na plan of what could be done about this fiscal situation that has \nhappened so dramatically in the last 2 years, and there was no \nrecognition in December when they reported that the President said that \nis the thing that should be done in this country.\n  This year, he did offer a budget, as he has to do under the budget \nlaw, February 14 of this year. That budget would increase spending, \nincrease taxes, and still add trillions to our debt.\n  Everybody would think that a Democratic President suggesting a budget \nwould be well-received in a body that is controlled by the same \npolitical party. But that budget he presented in February was so ill-\nconceived and out of touch that it was defeated here in the Senate by a \nvote of 97-0.\n  Let me emphasize that by saying not a single Senator of either party \nvoted for President Obama's budget. Of course, it is very obvious that \nevery member of the President's party said no to the President's \nbudget.\n  For most of this year, President Obama said we should raise the debt \nceiling without taking any measures to address our long-term deficits \nand debt. It was the position of this administration that Congress \nshould simply rubberstamp another debt ceiling hike with no plan in \nplace to reduce our deficits.\n  That plan was voted on in the House and was soundly rejected there as \nwell. All of the Republicans and nearly half of the Democrats in the \nother body voted against increasing the debt ceiling without deficit \nreduction.\n  So it seems to me we have a lot of bipartisan agreement, when people \nsay we have no bipartisan cooperation, that with the Senate's vote on \nthe President's budget and in the other body with nearly half of the \nDemocrats opposing a debt ceiling without deficit reduction, that there \nis a clear understanding in a bipartisan way in the Senate that the \nPresident's budget spends too much, taxes too much, and leaves too much \ndebt. In the House of Representatives, there is a strong feeling that \nis bipartisan that if you are going to have a debt ceiling increase, \nthere needs to be deficit reduction. So don't ever say there is not \nbipartisan agreement, because it has been expressed in votes in both \nHouses.\n  The President then gave a budget speech in April, and I presume he \nrecognized the inadequacy of his budget presented to Congress in \nFebruary. He outlined a budget framework that would reduce that budget \nthat was presented in February by $4 trillion over 12 years. So the \nPresident very quickly in about 60 days came to the conclusion that his \nbudget was out of step with what people of even his own political party \nfelt was necessary so he could find $4 trillion to trim out of it.\n  But do you know what he hasn't done yet that a President ought to do \nin an environment where we have an executive budget process? He still \nhasn't presented the details of that budget.\n  The Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. Elmendorf--as we \nall know, a person who is a devoted public servant, doing what is \nintellectually right all the time when he tries to help us decide how \nmuch money taxes are going to bring in or how much is going to be spent \non a particular policy of Congress--was asked if he could estimate the \nbudget impact of this new framework that came with the President's \nspeech on April 13, in which he came to the conclusion you ought to \nspend $4 trillion less than what he thought he could spend on \nValentine's Day. That is not necessarily a Valentine's gift in his \nFebruary budget.\n  This is what the CBO Director said in regard to that April 13 speech. \nHe said:\n\n       We don't estimate speeches. We need much more specificity \n     than was provided in that speech for us to do our analysis.\n\n  But, so far, the President has not provided those specifics. We have \nheard a lot from the White House about the need to come up with a plan, \nwhen the President has not presented a plan. The White House itself has \nnever offered a single debt ceiling proposal for voters, and the Senate \nDemocratic leadership has also seriously shirked its responsibilities \nbecause, as I said once before today, they have not put forward a \nbudget in more than 800 days, even though the law requires that they do \nit.\n  Every family in America who works hard and sacrifices to pay their \nbills ought to be ashamed of the failure of the Senate to offer a \nbudget, in violation of the law. In sharp contrast, Members of the \nHouse fulfilled their responsibility and passed a budget earlier this \nyear. So the very same majority party in this body that has not \npresented a budget for 800 days has done nothing in regard to the House \nbudget but demagog.\n  While they can't find time to compile their own budget, they sure \nfound time to make speeches that are derogatory about the House budget. \nThe House budget, then, obviously means the House of Representatives \ndid their responsibility under the law by presenting a budget and \nadopting a budget.\n  While Members on the other side come to the floor to oppose and \ndemagog the bill I am speaking about--the cut, cap, and balance bill--\nthey have offered no plan of their own. While there is now a framework \nfrom the so-called Gang of 6, their plan also lacks any specificity. \nPerhaps that is the political strategy the other side has chosen. \nVoters and the American people\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\ncannot be upset with the position you have taken if you have not taken \na position. It is like a rule for political leaders: You never get in \ntrouble for a speech you do not give. Perhaps this strategy may be \npolitically expedient, but it is going to drive our economy and our \ncountry off the cliff.\n  The strategy of placing a higher priority on the next election rather \nthan the economic and fiscal situation facing our country is how we got \ninto this mess. Based on the lack of proposals put forth by the other \nside, one could assume they are perfectly content borrowing 40 cents \nfor every dollar we spend. Are they pleased with the deficits of $1.5 \ntrillion annually? We could conclude they must be because they have not \noffered a plan to reduce the deficits.\n  On top of that, they have argued for tax increases. They must believe \nwe have a revenue problem. According to their argument, the American \npeople are not handing over enough of their money to satisfy the needs \nof Washington to spend. I am not sure we can ever tax high enough to \nsatisfy the attitude in Congress to spend. In fact, if somebody would \ntell me how much money they really need from the American people to \nsatisfy their appetite to spend, and I could get a limit on it and it \nwere a hard limit, I might even vote for it because I would like to \nhave people say they are finally satisfied, that government ought to be \nso big but no bigger. But I never get those sort of broad statements in \nthe Congress. So I have come to the conclusion that we cannot raise \ntaxes high enough to satisfy the appetite to spend.\n  But because we are borrowing money, the economy is not growing, and \njobs are not being created because Washington is spending too much. Of \ncourse, the other side believes the economy is not growing because we \nare not spending enough from Congress.\n  Remember, just a few years ago they passed the $800 billion so-called \nstimulus as a means to keep unemployment below 8 percent. That was \nearly February 2009. That is when Speaker Pelosi said: Yes, we wrote \nthe bill. We won the election.\n  So employment shot above 8 percent right away. It got up over 10 \npercent. It is at 9.3 percent. So the promise of a $830 billion \nstimulus keeping unemployment under 8 percent just did not work. What \ndid they do under those circumstances? They borrowed money and spent it \non government programs.\n  Where is the U.S. economy today? I will say it again: 9.2 percent \nunemployment, more than 14 million Americans out of work, and now the \nnational debt is more than $14.3 trillion. This experiment called the \nstimulus proved that government spending does not stimulate private \nsector job growth. Do you know why? Government consumes wealth; \ngovernment does not create wealth. The only jobs created by government \nare government jobs. They don't add value to the economy; they are a \ncost to the economy.\n  Do we have to have government? Yes. Do we have to have government \nemployees? Of course we have to have government employees. But to think \nwe can hire more government employees and create wealth is false. The \nfact is, we are the hole we are in because of our spending problems, \nnot because we do not have enough revenue coming in.\n  Look at this historically. Spending has averaged about 20 percent of \nour gross national product. That is probably over four or five decades. \nToday and in recent years spending has grown to 25 percent of the gross \nnational product. This level of spending cannot be sustained, \nparticularly when revenue has historically been around 18 percent of \nGDP. This very day it is less than 18 percent because the economy is \nnot growing, but a 50-year average is 18 percent of GDP.\n  For my colleagues who think we can reduce deficits by increasing \ntaxes, they need to understand it just does not work. Professor Vedder \nof Ohio University has studied tax increases and spending for more than \ntwo decades. In the late 1980s he coauthored, with Lowell Galloway also \nof Ohio University, a research paper for a committee of Congress called \nthe Joint Economic Committee that found that every new dollar of new \ntaxes led to more than $1 of new spending by the Congress.\n  In other words, raise taxes $1 and you think we would go to the \nbottom line and reduce the deficit? But, no, $1 coming in, we spend \nmore than $1, so we make the deficit worse. Professor Vedder has now \nupdated his study. Specifically he found:\n\n       Over the entire post World War II era through 2009, each \n     dollar of new tax revenue was associated with $1.17 of new \n     spending.\n\n  History proves tax increases result in spending increases. We know \nincreasing taxes is not, then, going to reduce the deficit. Instead of \ngoing to the bottom line, tax increases are a license for Washington to \nspend even more.\n  History also shows that tax increases do not increase revenue. \nEverybody thinks if we raise the marginal tax rates we will bring in \nmore revenue. But the taxpayers, workers, and investors of this country \nare smarter than Members of Congress are who believe that.\n  Regardless of the rate, over the past 40 years--I am sorry, I don't \nhave a chart with me. I had a chart with me a week ago that \ndemonstrated this. But if you listen closely, you will get the message \nof the chart.\n  Regardless of the rate of taxation, over the past 40 years revenue \nhas averaged, as I said before, about 18 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. Higher tax rates just provide incentives for taxpayers to \ninvest and earn money in ways that reduce their tax liability. We \ncannot tax our way out of this problem. We have a spending problem, not \na revenue problem. That is why I am supporting the only plan that has \nbeen put forth to address our deficit and debt problem: the cut, cap, \nand balance plan passed by the House with the bipartisan support of 234 \nMembers.\n  This plan is the only plan offered to cut spending in the near term. \nWe need to halt and reverse the trend of the last 2 years when \ngovernment spending increased by 22 percent, not even counting the \nfailed stimulus program of another $830 billion. We cannot increase \nexpenditures 22 percent when the growth of the economy is about 2 \npercent. It just does not add up. That is how we get into trouble, and \nthat is how we have increased a 50-year average of the national debt \nfrom about 35 percent of gross national product to--after 2 years, it \nis now 65 percent, and it is on a path to go over 90 percent.\n  We know where Greece is right now when they are over 100 percent. It \nis going to lead to failure. We are on that path right now, and we have \nto preempt that.\n  This bill before us also will impose budget caps to get our spending \ndown to a manageable level compared to our gross domestic product.\n  Finally, it would impose a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution, similar to what--I don't know whether it is 46 States or \n49 States--but most States have a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget. You know what. It works.\n  We have to stop to think, if a State that is as liberal as New York, \nif they can elect a liberal Democratic Governor, and if he can cut, \ncut, cut, to live within that constitutional requirement of a balanced \nbudget, it ought to be something we can do in Washington DC. It is a \ndiscipline that works in the States. It is a discipline that we need \nthrough our Constitution so when we take an oath to uphold the \nConstitution, the requirement of a balanced budget is something we \nswear to, and we will deliver on our promise to the American people. It \nonly makes sense to impose a requirement that we live within our means. \nWashington proves again and again that it needs this kind of \ndiscipline.\n  I say to my colleagues: If you do not support this plan, then offer \nyour own plan. You know the debt limit must be increased, but you also \nknow we must take action to reduce the future levels of deficits and \nbegin to bring our debt down. Where is your plan to do that? Where is \nyour budget resolution that has not been presented in the last 800 or \nmore days to the Senate, violating the budget law? How will you meet \nthe responsibilities, then, of being elected to this office where you \ntake an oath to uphold the laws and the Constitution of the United \nStates?\n  The trajectory of our debt is alarming. It will soon undermine our \neconomy and our economic growth. If we do nothing, our children and \ngrandchildren will have fewer economic opportunities than we have had. \nSo this is not just an economic issue, this is not just a fiscal issue, \nthis is a moral issue of whether this generation, my\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\ngeneration and people who are even younger than me but spending a lot \nof money, ought to live high on the hog and leave it to young people to \npick up the bill.\n  Without a plan to put our fiscal situation on a better path, the next \ngenerations will have a lower quality of life than the one we have \nexperienced. We cannot let that happen. We must take action to correct \nour course.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the cut, cap, and balance plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfrom 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2560 be equally \ndivided between the majority leader and the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the Cut, \nCap, and Balance Act of 2011. Rather than taking a balanced approach \nthat requires shared sacrifice, House Republicans have passed \nlegislation that would gut essential services for average Americans \nwhile asking nothing of the wealthy and privileged. Such a misguided \napproach would cost countless American jobs while doing nothing to \nsolve America's long-term deficit challenges.\n  In my opinion, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act fails to measure up as a \nserious proposal to address the structural deficit that our Nation \nfaces. It is misguided, and assumes that our Nation will pay no price \nif we fail to invest in our future. These are some of the assumptions \nof this bill. Highways will not buckle, pipes will not rust, bridges \nwill not collapse, and there is no need to invest in the next \ngeneration of innovators to keep America's competitive advantage. This \nbill would gut the very funding we need to revitalize our economy and \ninvest in the future.\n  Cut, cap and balance would render Congress essentially powerless to \naddress revenues, thereby pushing America further down the road of \neconomic inequality by ensuring that the wealthy do not have to share \nin any sacrifice. And whatever might be said about this legislation, to \ncall it balanced is a cruel irony. In fact, all of the sacrifice is \ndemanded of the poor and working families. This legislation forces \nCongress to slash programs that average Americans rely on for \neducation, housing assistance, food safety, safer air traffic control, \nand clean air and water.\n  We have an aging population, which means that increasing costs for \nSocial Security and Medicare are a reality that must be dealt with. The \nBaby Boomers are retiring, which increases the need for Social Security \nand Medicare. And while those programs are not subject to sequester, \nhow will we meet the higher costs and at the same time bring down \noverall spending to 18 percent of GDP, a level that has not been \nachieved since the 1960s? My colleagues should not kid themselves: \nmandating a balanced budget by 2020 while taking revenues off the table \nwill require draconian cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I take particular \nnote of the impact cut, cap, and balance would have on nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. A 10-year freeze on domestic spending that does \nnot adjust for inflation would have a devastating impact on the ability \nof all nondefense departments and agencies to carry out their missions. \nMy colleagues should know that over 10 years, such a cap would amount \nto a 33-percent cut in real dollars. Such a level of cuts would make it \nimpossible for the United States to compete on a global stage. Our \ninfrastructure, our education system, our technology, everything we \nneed to remain a great nation will be drastically underfunded, or \nsimply not funded at all.\n  I hope we all understand that we are not talking about nice to have \nthings, we are talking about investments that are necessary to maintain \nthe quality of life for the middle class. Education is not optional. \nRoads and sewers, clean air and clean water are not options. Meeting \nthe basic nutritional needs of our poorest children should not be \noptional. This great Nation was built on such investments, made in the \nbest interests of the American people--all the people, not just the \nwealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  I would like to take a brief moment to provide a few specifics about \nthe impact of this act. While it is not possible to predict specific \nimpacts 10 years down the road, it is certainly possible to give \nexamples of what the American people would experience in the near term, \nas a result of this deeply flawed bill.\n  In fiscal year 2012, Head Start funding would decrease by more than \n$900 million, eliminating comprehensive early childhood services for \nover 130,000 low-income children and their families and resulting in \nthe termination of 30,000 teachers, teacher assistants and related \nstaff.\n  The combined cuts to mandatory programs such as Food Stamps and \nSchool Lunch programs coupled with domestic spending reductions \ncontained in this legislation would be a double blow to the Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations. With these cuts, there would be 13 million \nfewer meals served to seniors. Let me be blunt, if this bill is \nenacted, children and seniors in this Nation will go hungry in far \nlarger numbers than today.\n  We all recognize that reducing waste, fraud, and abuse are essential \ncomponents of getting our fiscal house in order. Every billion dollars \nwe save is a billion dollars we can use to reduce the deficit or better \ninvest in America's future. And yet this bill would reduce funding for \nthe Internal Revenue Service by some $1.8 billion below the President's \nrequest for fiscal year 2012, which would cripple its efforts to find \nfraud and eliminate waste and abuse. The IRS could be forced to \nfurlough between 4,100 and 5,000 employees, mostly enforcement agents. \nFurthermore, a cut to IRS funding would increase the deficit by \napproximately $4 billion a year beginning in 2013, since every dollar \ninvested in enforcement resources brings in $5 in tax revenues.\n  Finally, I would note that a cap on the Federal budget means that we \nare unable to make smart choices about our future investments. As an \nexample, the Bureau of Prisons inmate population is expected to grow to \nroughly 250,000 Federal inmates by 2018, an increase of more than \n31,000 prisoners, or 15 percent, over the next 8 years. A growing \ninmate population coupled with a spending cap for Department of Justice \nactivities will mean further severe cuts to other important functions \nof the Department of Justice--Federal, State, and local public safety \nefforts will be cut in order to pay the required costs of housing \nprisoners.\n  Yesterday 97 Senators voted in favor of the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill. The Senate is perfectly capable \nof producing and passing fiscally responsible appropriations bills that \nmeet the Nation's needs and that have strong, bipartisan support. The \nreal answer to our fiscal crisis has not changed since this debate \nbegan. We must cut spending in a responsible fashion. We must reform \nentitlement programs to ensure that they survive for future \ngenerations. And we must reform our Tax Code to allow for sufficient \nrevenues to meet the needs of an aging population and the challenges of \na global economy.\n  Cut, cap, and balance does none of these things, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this misguided measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on Monday I, again, set forth the history \nof our efforts to extend the term of Robert Mueller as the FBI Director \nin response to the President's request. I am glad that the Senate is \nnow being permitted to proceed to pass the bill. The holds have finally \nbeen lifted.\n  I worked with Senator Grassley to respond to the President's May 12 \nrequest, and the Judiciary Committee reported a bill to do that more \nthan one month ago. I am pleased that a bill finally passed the Senate \ntoday. I hope the House will take up and pass the bill so that it can \nbe signed by the President, and the Senate can confirm Director \nMueller's renomination prior to August 3, 2011.\n  This important legislation, S. 1103, would fulfill the President's \nrequest that Congress create a one-time exception to the statutory 10-\nyear term of the FBI Director, in order to extend the term of the \nincumbent FBI Director for 2 additional years. Given the continuing \nthreat to our Nation, especially with the 10th anniversary of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks approaching, and the need to provide \ncontinuity and stability on the President's national security team, it \nis important that we respond to the President's request and enact this \nnecessary legislation swiftly. The incumbent FBI Director's term \notherwise expires on August 3, 2011.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I am voting no on S. 1103, a bill to \ncreate a second 2 year term for the FBI Director. I am opposed to \nchanging the term limits on this important position, which serve as a \nsafeguard and check against the significant power of the position. I am \nnot opposed to Director Mueller and will not oppose his renomination, \nbut I do oppose the idea that term limits should be changed when it is \nconvenient. I thank him and the Bureau for their cooperation and \nanswers to my questions over the last few weeks.\n  Mr. REID. I want to extend my appreciation to Senators Leahy and \nGrassley for together getting this matter done.\n  He has done a wonderful job for 10 years, and the country believes \nthey need him for 2 more years, and he has agreed to take that, and I \nappreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the foregoing actions \nwith respect to the bill are accomplished.\n  The bill (S. 1103), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The bill (S. 1103), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak on behalf of the resolution \nbefore us--the so-called cut, cap, and balance resolution--and explain \nbriefly why it represents a better approach to resolving the financial \ncrisis our country is faced with than the alternative, which seems to \nbe myopically focused on raising taxes, as if our problem in this \ncountry were taxes. Our problem is spending. That is why the reference \nto cutting spending, capping future spending, and ensuring that we \nnever go back to our errant ways by passing a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, which would forever prevent us from getting into \nthe same position we are in now where we have to keep coming back to \nincrease the Nation's debt ceiling. That is why the emphasis on \nspending.\n  Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, and certainly the \nPresident of the United States, say: I will not agree to anything \nunless you raise taxes.\n  Why are Republicans so opposed to the President's approach? Why are \nwe focused on reducing spending rather than raising taxes? Why is it \nimportant? First of all, because spending is the problem, not taxes. \nSpending in this country, under President Obama, has gone from the \nhistoric level of about 20 percent of our gross domestic product to now \n25 percent in just 3 short years. That is a historic growth in \nspending. We have never been this high. Under the Obama budget, as far \nas the eye can see, we are going to be above the historic levels--never \nbelow, I believe, 23 percent of the gross domestic product and, as far \nas I can see, very close to that 25 percent. Spending is the problem.\n  Some will say: Well, the government has collected less income taxes \nin the last couple of years.\n  That is true, but it isn't because tax rates have changed. We have \nhad the same tax rates for the last decade. They have been constant. \nThe only reason there is less revenue coming into the Treasury right \nnow--the so-called tax take of the government--is because the economy \nis in the tank. People are unemployed. They are not working. They are \nnot making as much money. Businesses are not making as much money, so \nthey are not paying as much in taxes.\n  So what is the answer? To raise tax rates and try to squeeze more \nblood out of this turnip, to try to get more out of a sick economy? No. \nThe answer, of course, is to try to get the economy well again so \npeople are working, they make more money, businesses make money, they \nall pay more in taxes, and then we will be back at the historic levels \nof tax-take by the Federal Government, and presumably the folks who say \ntaxes are the problem will then be satisfied.\n  But how do we grow the economy? How do we get it well? We know one \nthing for sure not to do; that is, impose taxes on an already weak \neconomy. The President himself, last December when we reached agreement \nbetween the Congress and the President on extending all of the current \ntax rates, made that exact point. He said:\n\n       To raise taxes at this time when the economy is weak would \n     be the worst thing for economic growth and job creation.\n\n  He was right. He was right then. If anything, our economy is in worse \nshape now. Now we are at 9.2 percent unemployment. We continue to \nstagnate. If we have a sick economy, the last thing we want to do is \nimpose more taxes on that economy.\n  One of our colleagues here in the Senate, our colleague from the \nState in which I was born, the Cornhusker State of Nebraska, Ben \nNelson, said:\n\n       Raising taxes at a time when our economy remains fragile \n     takes us in the wrong direction. If we start with plans to \n     raise taxes, pretty soon spending cuts will fall by the \n     wayside.\n\n  I couldn't agree with him more.\n  I think there is some bipartisan consensus--though certainly I \nrecognize many Democrats would like to raise taxes, but I think \neconomists and most Americans appreciate that when the problem is \nspending, when spending has gone up so dramatically, the answer is to \nreduce the spending, get it back down at a minimum to where it was, and \nnot raise taxes.\n  The second reason we are focused on the spending side and why we \ntherefore support the cutting of spending, the capping of that \nspending, and making sure we have the constraint of a constitutional \namendment to restrain us from our impulses in the future is because it \nnever fails that tax hikes always hit more than the people at whom we \nare aiming. It doesn't hit just the millionaires and billionaires; it \nhits a lot of other people.\n  When the alternative minimum tax was created, the idea was to make \nsure that--and I could be a little wrong on the number--I think it was \n125 millionaires couldn't use deductions and credits to get out of \npaying their taxes. We were going to create an alternative minimum tax. \nThey would have to pay some tax even if they had lots of credits and \ndeductions they could take. Well, 2 years ago it was going to hit 23 \nmillion Americans, and I think this year it is something like 32 \nmillion. Again, I could be a little bit wrong on the number, but let's \njust say between 20 million and 30 million people. So we started out \nwith about 125, and now that tax hits well over 20 million and I think \nover 30 million households a year. Why wouldn't we want to do something \nabout that? We do every year. We pass what we call a patch so that it \ndoesn't affect those people because we never intended it to affect them \nin the first place. We aimed at the millionaires, and we hit over 20 \nmillion other Americans.\n  The same thing would happen here. How many millionaire and \nbillionaire households are there that report income of above $1 \nmillion? The answer is 319,000. Out of the whole United States, there \nare 319,000. How many people would actually pay the increased tax in \nthe upper two brackets where these people are located? Well, that \nnumber turns out to be 3.6 million people right now. What will it be in \n20 years? We will probably be up to the 20 and 30 million category \nagain.\n  The point is, we aim at 300,000 people, and we end up hitting 10 \ntimes that many people--3.6 million people. That is how many people \nthere are in the top two brackets that the President's proposals would \nhit.\n  There is another unintended consequence. It doesn't just hit the \nmillionaires and billionaires, it hits small business owners. Small \nbusinesses create two-thirds of all of the jobs coming out of an \neconomic downturn such as we have had, out of a recession. Small \nbusinesses usually--or at least 50 percent of small business income--\nlet's put it that way--is reported in these top two income tax \nbrackets. We have an individual person, and he is not a corporation, so \nhe reports his income\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\ntaxes in one of the two top income tax brackets. What happens when we \nraise the tax on that 50 percent of the folks, the small business \nfolks? Are they more likely to hire or are they more likely to just sit \non their hands? Obviously, the answer is they are not going to hire \nmore people.\n  Earlier this week, I quoted from several small business folks who, of \ncourse, said precisely that. The experts all agree on this issue. When \nwe raise taxes on the top two rates, we hit a lot of small businesses.\n  One of the taxes the President proposed raising--as a matter of fact, \nhis own Small Business Administration did a study and reported that tax \n``could ultimately force many small businesses to close.'' So we aim at \nthe millionaire and the billionaire, and we end up hitting small \nbusinesses. By the way, since this Small Business Administration report \nhas been in the news, I have noticed the administration is not talking \nabout this particular tax anymore. Well, that is fine, but the reality \nis that the others they are talking about would also hit small \nbusinesses and force many of them to close.\n  Who else gets hit by this tax on millionaires and billionaires? We \nhave some experience. Back in 1990, we thought we would impose a luxury \ntax on millionaires and billionaires. We were going to tax things such \nas yachts and jewelry and luxury items, and so on. Well, that lasted a \nlittle less than 3 years when all the people who made the yachts \nmarched on Washington and said: Hey, you just put us out of business, \nand we repealed that tax. I think it was over 9,000 people who were put \nout of business.\n  It is interesting that the same proposition translates to today. What \nwas one of the provisions in the stimulus bill? Now, the stimulus bill \nwas opposed by all but I think two Republicans, and all the Democrats \nsupported it. Well, it was the tax treatment for corporate jets. \nRepublicans didn't support this special tax treatment for corporate \njets, but the President did. It was in his stimulus bill because it was \nthought it would help to create or save jobs.\n  Accelerated depreciation, which is the tax treatment here, was \nbeneficial to the people who make these airplanes--more beneficial from \na tax standpoint--and it might well be that jobs were either created or \nsaved as a result of that. But that tax provision that was so important \nto creating or saving jobs when the stimulus bill was passed now all of \na sudden is something that is evil because presumably people who fly in \nbusiness jets are people to be attacked, to be demagogued.\n  We have heard the President of the United States talk about this. He \ntalks about the special tax loophole for corporate jets. Well, it is \nhis tax loophole, and he put it in there because he thought it would \ncreate or save jobs. Now, who is it going to hurt? The business guys \nwill still fly on their corporate jets; it is just that the jets will \ncost more money, but probably fewer people will be working, making \nthose planes. Is that good policy or bad policy? I am all for having \nthat debate. I am not going to defend the corporate jets; I will defend \nthe people who make them. But let's have that debate in the context of \ntax reform, which we have all said we are for doing, so that if we \ndecide it is good policy to eliminate that accelerated depreciation \nprovision, we do that and then we apply the savings to reducing tax \nrates overall, which is exactly what the President said we should do.\n\n  In his State of the Union speech, he pointed out that America is not \ncompetitive with the rest of the world. We have the highest corporate \ntax rate in the world, and he said we have to get it down. What we \nought to do is eliminate loopholes in the Tax Code and then, with the \nsavings, reduce overall corporate rates, so instead of paying 35 \npercent, our corporations would pay maybe 20 or 25 percent, which is \nstill above the world average of developed countries, but at least we \nwould be more competitive.\n  So what is the right policy? Should we be demagoguing corporate jets \nor should we think through the policy? We might just be hurting regular \nAmericans, and maybe we should think twice about the kind of political \nlanguage we are using.\n  Even oil and gas--we have to tax the big oil companies. Everybody \nknows we put the tax on, and the next thing we know we are paying more \ntax when we fill up our car at the local service station. So we should \nthink through whom we are really going to hit with these taxes on \nmillionaires and billionaires and big corporations.\n  Even the death tax--the death tax is part of the taxes the President \nwould like to have rates go up on, to go back to the 45-percent rate. \nThat is almost half--45 percent--of the estates. Now, a lot of these \nestates are small businesses, farms, ranches, and a lot of times they \nhave to sell all or part of the business or the farm or the ranch in \norder to pay the estate tax. So who are we really hurting when we do \nthis?\n  I have a friend who had a small printing business in Phoenix. He was \none of the largest charitable givers in our community, a fine, \nwonderful man. His name was Jerry Wisotsky. He created the business \nfrom nothing, moved out from New York City, and had over 200 employees \nwhen he died. He had Boys & Girls Clubs named after him. He and his \nfamily contributed as much money to charity in Phoenix as anybody I \nknow. Well, they had to sell the business because the estate taxes were \neating them up. The out-of-State company that bought the business \ndidn't contribute to the local community. They didn't contribute to \ncharity. Who got hurt when we imposed that estate tax, that death tax \non Jerry's family?\n  So let's just stop and think. One reason we don't want to focus on \ntaxes and we would rather focus on spending is because a lot of times, \nwhen we focus on millionaires and billionaires, we end up hurting a lot \nof other people instead.\n  The third reason and, frankly, the most important from an economic \nstandpoint, of course, is the fact that tax hikes kill job creation and \neconomic growth, and I alluded to this in the second point I made. \nFifty-four percent of all of our jobs are from small businesses, and \nwhen we hurt small businesses' ability to hire people, obviously we are \nhurting families, we are creating more unemployment, and we are \npreventing the economy from rebounding.\n  I mentioned the fact that the top two brackets of our income-tax code \nis where at least half of all of the small business income is reported \nand taxes are paid. That is one of the areas where the administration \nwants to increase taxes. Why would we do this when, as the Small \nBusiness Administration says, it would force many small businesses or \ncould force many small businesses to close? It doesn't make sense. That \nis why we are focused on cutting spending, capping that spending over \ntime, and ensuring those caps stay in place through a balanced budget \namendment.\n  I think the American people have an understanding of this. There have \nbeen a lot of polls quoted lately. I just wish to refer to one, which \nis only a week old. It is the Rasmussen poll from last Thursday. The \nquestion was asked whether there should be a tax hike included in any \nlegislation to raise the debt ceiling--a pretty straightforward \nquestion. Rasmussen is a very reputable pollster. This was just 1 week \nago. Most voters said no. Only 34 percent thought a tax hike should be \nincluded. Fifty-five percent disagreed, said it should not. Among those \naffiliated with neither political party--the so-called Independents--35 \npercent favored it and 51 percent--a majority--opposed including a tax \nhike in the legislation to raise the debt ceiling.\n  So we are with the American people on this issue. It isn't necessary. \nTaxes aren't the problem. It affects a lot more people than they ever \nthink it will. Finally, if we want to really hurt economic growth, if \nwe want to really kill job creation, then just pile more taxes on to \nthe economy. It doesn't make sense. That is why we are so insistent on \nsupporting legislation that would cut spending rather than raise taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, yesterday, I was on the Senate floor \ntalking about this piece of legislation that is now pending before the \nSenate, passed\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nby the House of Representatives earlier this week. I am a sponsor and \nsupporter of cut, cap, and balance and believe it is a path toward \nresponsibility that we need to demonstrate in the Senate, in the \nCongress, and here in America.\n  It seems to me it certainly is irresponsible not to raise the debt \nceiling, but it is equally or more irresponsible not to raise the debt \nceiling without making adjustments in the way we do business in \nWashington, DC. Clearly, cutting spending is a component of that, \ncapping spending is a portion of our national economy, returning it to \nthe days, just a few years ago, in which we were spending ``only'' 18--\nI say ``only'' in quotes, perhaps--``only'' 18 percent of our gross \nnational product by the Federal Government. Unfortunately, in the last \nfew years that 18 percent has grown to 24.2 percent.\n  So reducing some spending, capping that spending in the intermediate \nfuture, so it does not exceed a certain portion of the national \neconomy, and, finally, passing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution seems to me to be a reasonable, rational approach to \nsolving the problems we face.\n  I also indicated yesterday that in my view there is a fourth \ncomponent. It is cut, cap, balance, and grow. I do not want us to \nforget the importance of a growing economy. The last time we had our \nbudget that was in balance, close to being in balance, was at the end \nof the term of President Clinton. Yes, there was some spending \nrestraint back in those days, in those years. Republicans and Democrats \ncould not get together and pass major pieces of legislation that \nincreased spending, so that spending restraint was an important \ncomponent.\n  But the other part of that is the economy was growing and people were \nworking and, as a result, they were paying taxes. That is the more \nenjoyable component of our work, in addition to restraining spending, \ncapping its percentage of the economy, and putting a balanced budget in \nplace so we do not get back into this mess.\n  The other aspect of that is to make sure we make the policy decisions \nin our Nation's Capital that allow a businessperson, an employer, to \nmake the decision that now is the time to invest in plant and \nequipment, now is the time to add additional employees. Yet there are \nso many aspects of decisions that have been made in our Nation's \nCapital over a long period of time that now come together and \ndiscourage an individual business owner, a potential employer from \nmaking the decision: I am going to invest in the economy.\n  We have all heard the numbers as to the amount of money sitting on \nthe sidelines in the U.S. economy. In my view, the recession we are in \nhas lingered longer than necessary because there is so much uncertainty \nin regard to what is going to happen next, and a large portion of that \nuncertainty comes from the inability to predict what policy decisions \nare going to be made in the Senate, across the hall in the House, and \nwhat the Obama administration is going to propose and potentially put \nin place in regard to rules and regulations.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues in the Senate will take the proposal \nby the House of Representatives as serious work. I certainly agree \nthere can be negotiations had. There has been, as I indicated \nyesterday, some concern about the specific language of the \nconstitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, and we ought \nnot draw the line in the sand and say it has to be exactly the way it \nis written.\n  Let's come together and work to find a reasonable, rational solution \nbased upon the outline this legislation provides. From time to time, it \nhas been considered a radical piece of legislation--labeled that way. \nYet so many of the things we do in our everyday lives, that States \nacross our Nation encounter and the way they conduct business are \ncertainly capsulized in cut, cap, and balance.\n  I know there has been significant talk about raising taxes. I heard \nthe Senator from Arizona speak to this before, just a few moments ago. \nWhen an individual is struggling to pay the bills, they do not often \nhave the opportunity to ask for a pay raise. What we do at home, what \nwe should do in our own lives, is to reduce our spending levels. Simply \nasking for more money to meet our current obligations is not usually an \noption.\n  That tax issue goes with my comments a moment ago about the \nimportance of growing the economy. Too often, we look at taxes as a \nsource of revenue. I am for raising revenue, but I am for raising \nrevenue by a growing economy and people being at work paying those \ntaxes, not by raising the tax rates but by improving the economy and \nallowing good things to happen to families, individuals, and businesses \nacross the country. So that Tax Code is an important component of this \nissue of growing our economy and getting our deficit back in line, back \nto some level of responsible behavior here.\n\n\n             One-year Anniversary of Dodd-Frank Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, the additional point I wish to make--in addition to \nwhat I have said already today but also in addition to what I said \nyesterday to the Senate--is that this is the 1-year anniversary of the \npassage of Dodd-Frank.\n  Huge financial regulations were put in place by legislation that, \njust 1 year ago today, was passed by the House and Senate and signed by \nPresident Obama. In my view, that legislation is another component of \nthe difficulty in knowing what is coming down the road--hundreds of \nregulations yet to be proposed, pursued, and enacted, so many of our \nbusinesses and financial institutions do not know what to expect and, \ntherefore, again are waiting to see what happens in the Federal \nGovernment, what decisions are made here, in this case not by Congress \nnow but by regulators up the street in our Nation's Capital.\n  So on this anniversary of the passage of that legislation, I wish to \nagain highlight what I think is a commonsense reform to that \nlegislation. A part of Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. A number of Senators have signed a letter to \nPresident Obama trying to make clear that before a head of that Bureau \nis going to be confirmed by the Senate, we believe that structural \nreform, change in the nature of that organization, needs to occur.\n  Again, these seem very straightforward and common sense to me. But \nrather than have a single head of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, I would ask that--in fact, I have introduced legislation to do \nthis, and my colleagues, in signing that letter, asked the President to \nhelp us change that individual to a board or commission similar to \nother government agencies charged with financial oversight, so the \npower does not rest in a sole individual.\n  Then, again, one would think Congress would never want to give up the \nauthority to determine the appropriations for this agency. Instead, the \nlaw, as currently written, provides for a draw against the Federal \nReserve as compared to where almost all agencies have to come to \nCongress and ask for their appropriations, which gives us, as \nlegislators--me, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as \nranking member of the Financial Services Subcommittee on \nAppropriations--the opportunity to review, to have input, to provide \noversight. We ought to change that formula by which the money comes \ndirectly from the Federal Reserve and put it back with the \nresponsibility of this Congress making those decisions.\n  Finally, we want to have banking regulators--who oversee the safety \nand soundness of our financial institutions today--given meaningful \ninput into the Bureau's operation, all designed to provide greater \nopportunity for us as Members of Congress, for the American people, to \nhave input and oversight over what will be one of the largest agencies, \nmost powerful regulators in our country's history, and certainly having \nsignificant creation of new rules and regulations that are going to, in \nsome fashion, affect the U.S. economy.\n  Many of my community banks feel so overregulated today. There is a \nreal concern or fear about making loans today--something that is very \nimportant for an economic recovery, that aspect of growing the \neconomy--because they do not know what the next set of regulations is \ngoing to be.\n  In fact, for the passage of Dodd-Frank--the legislation we are now \nobserving the 1-year anniversary of it becoming law--the GAO, our \nGovernment Accountability Office, estimates that the budgetary costs of \nDodd-Frank will\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nexceed $1.25 billion. In addition to that, the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that over the next 10 years, Dodd-Frank will take $27 \nbillion directly from the U.S. economy in new fees and assessments on \nlenders and other financial companies.\n  So as we look at the legislation that is pending before us--cut, cap, \nand balance--my hope is we will expand--once we pass that legislation, \nwe will get back to aggressively pursuing a projob, progrowth agenda. \nJobs certainly are important for us in generating the revenues \nnecessary to fund the Federal Government and to reduce our national \ndebt. But there is nothing more important to Americans, to Kansans \nacross our State, than being able to have a secure opportunity for \nemployment, to put food on the family table, to save for their own \nretirement and their children's education.\n  I do believe--seriously believe--that a significant message that was \ndelivered by the American people in the election of November 2010 was \nthe reminder to us that we have the responsibility--again, government \nis not a creator of jobs, but we are the creator of an environment in \nwhich the private sector can create jobs.\n  So let's cut, cap, balance and grow the economy and strengthen the \nopportunity for every American to have a valuable and viable job, with \nthe hope of improvement in their own lives, and, most importantly, make \ncertain we pass on to the next generation of Americans the ability to \npursue that American dream.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity of addressing the \nSenate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the bill that is \nbefore the Senate today. But as a part of that, we are now in the midst \nof a true fiscal crisis in this country, and I want to address \nsomething that has been debated over the last several days, discussed \nover the last several days, criticized over the last several days. It \nhas been the subject of a lot of misinformation--by colleagues on my \nside of the aisle particularly--about the proposal that has been \nsubmitted by the so-called Gang of 6, of which I happen to be a member. \nAnd I am someone who for the last 7 months has participated in \ndiscussions with two of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, as \nwell as on the other side of the aisle, to try to find a bipartisan \nsolution to being able to repay the $14.3 trillion our Federal \nGovernment owes, and that we have all participated in creating.\n  The misinformation that is going around from my friends is very \ndisturbing. People are here on this floor throwing out numbers that are \nwrong, giving specifics on a piece of legislation that has not even \nbeen written, and yet they are talking as though they are experts on \nthe subject of a matter that my five colleagues and I have been \ndiscussing and debating among ourselves for the last 6 months--and we \nhave not even put the legislation out there yet. So it is pretty \ndisturbing to me that there are some people in this body who want to \nsee nothing done and I assume want us to continue down the road of \nborrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we are spending. I am not \nwilling to do that. I think we were sent here with a commitment from \nour constituents to solve the serious problems this country faces. The \nonly way we are going to solve this fiscal problem we have is to \ngenerate 60 votes in this body in support of some proposal.\n  I am going to talk in support of the proposal we have under \nconsideration now because I think it is a potential solution. I am very \nappreciative of the authors of the cut, cap, and balance bill. I am \nappreciative of our leadership for at least trying to come forward with \nsomething and put it on the table to give us the opportunity to debate \nthose ideas.\n  I think there have been a number of very positive proposals that have \ncome forward and hopefully that will come forward in the next few days \nto allow us to debate this issue and to primarily solve the problem \nrelative to the debt ceiling and solve the problem relative to the \nlong-term debt we have.\n  I have to say, I am disturbed about some of the comments and \nstatements--even from folks who were critical of the plan we put \nforward for cutting too much spending. These are the folks who have \nbeen ranting and raving about the fact we are spending too much money \nin this town, and now they are complaining about the fact we are \ncutting too much in spending.\n  I look forward to continuing this debate. I want to say the proposal \nthat we put forward was intended from day one to be a framework, not \nthe final product, but a framework, for this body as well as the House \nto discuss as a way forward for solving the issue of how we are going \nto repay this $14.3 trillion. We never, ever intended for it to be in \nthe mix on solving the issue of the debt ceiling that needs to be \nraised, according to the Department of the Treasury, by August 2.\n  Because we happen to have come to a conclusion of our negotiations \nthis week, at the same time the debate on raising the debt ceiling is \nreaching its height, that has obviously created the impression on some \nfolks that our proposal is intended to solve the issue of the debt \nceiling. And it is not. It categorically is not. I want to make that \nperfectly clear.\n  That being said, if there is any part of our agreement, any part of \nour principles that can be utilized by the leadership of the House and \nthe Senate to figure out a way forward on the debt ceiling, for we have \nno pride of authorship. We hope leadership will take advantage of \nanything that can be used to try to generate the necessary support in \nthis body as well as in the House to solve the issue of this deadline \nwe are facing on August 2.\n  I rise today in full support of the cut, cap, and balance \nlegislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and I commend my \nfellow Senators in this Chamber who have taken it upon themselves to \noffer solutions to the large and growing problem of our debt and our \ndeficit.\n  A majority of Republicans here in the Senate as well as a majority of \nthose in the House believe that legislation that cuts government \nspending and makes tough enforcement mechanisms on the Federal budget \nis the right way to bring spending under control. I am also proud to be \na cosponsor of a separate balanced budget amendment. I firmly believe \nall of these proposals will structure and control the Federal \nGovernment's spending, just as Americans have demanded. We are in the \nmiddle of a fiscal crisis. Last year, the government spent at a rate of \n25 percent of our gross domestic product and took in revenues of about \n14 percent of our gross domestic product. The result of that is that \nlast year, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, we had in \nexcess of a $1.5 trillion deficit. It looks as though we are headed in \nthe same direction this year. This is totally unsustainable. Our \nfinancial markets have told us that. The folks who are in the process \nof putting together another sale of our bonds have told us that. We \nknow people who are looking at buying those bonds are looking very \nclosely at how this body acts over the next several days.\n  Some people have said the bond market is the most honest financial \nmarket out there, as the bond market tends to track truest to the \ndebtor's overall fiscal standing.\n  The bond-rating agencies have already told us that we are approaching \nthe edge of what the market will bear. We are close to the brink of our \nself-imposed debt limit of $14.3 trillion.\n  We must give serious, solemn consideration to any plan that will turn \nus immediately away from our overspending. We need to be mindful of the \nconsequences of a default. Forcing the administration to make spending \ndecisions is only one problem we face.\n  A default and the subsequent rise in interest rates means we will \nfind ourselves deeper in debt, and rampant inflation will prevent us \nfrom achieving fiscal solvency.\n  Current levels of discretionary and mandatory spending cannot be \nsustained. Mr. President, I say that with respect to every area of the \nFederal Government. We cannot allow any area of the Federal Government \nto go untouched. If we do, we will allow that area of government to \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\ngrow out of control. We must cut Federal spending anywhere we can and \nin every department of the Federal Government.\n  We also have to reform entitlements. We have to look at the issues \nthat are very difficult for a lot of us to deal with, and we have to \nmake some very tough decisions.\n  Too frequently we have engaged in political theater instead of \nearnest efforts to resolve these long-term budget issues. The American \npeople expect and deserve an honest budget debate and an honest budget \nprocess.\n  On Tuesday of this week, the House made an historic vote. Its Members \ndecided that Congress can no longer feign interest in securing our \nfinancial future. They took the right step of voting to cut spending \nand place rigid caps on remaining expenditures with tough budget \nenforcement mechanisms. I commend them for their efforts.\n  Now is the time to join our colleagues in the House. We must look for \nnew ways of ensuring that the Congress cannot break promises.\n  The best path forward toward fiscal stability will set a firm \nfoundation, and this legislation will do exactly that.\n  George Washington gave clear guidance when he told the House of \nRepresentatives that no consideration ``is more urgent than the regular \nredemption and discharge of the public debt.''\n  We can no longer allow the American people to suffer by not providing \nthe economic basis for recovery and growth. The equation is simple: a \nbalanced Federal budget that is free of excessive debt leads to a \nhealthy economy and sustainable job creation activities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2560, the Cut, \nCap and Balance Act.\n  I have been watching the debate on my TV back in the office this \nafternoon, listening to the arguments made pro and con, and thinking to \nmyself that back home in Georgia there are a lot of folks who live \naround me who are scratching their heads wondering why cut, cap, and \nbalance is such a bad idea because they have also had to cut, cap, and \nbalance.\n  The call I left before I came here to speak on the Senate floor was \nfrom a minister and his wife whom I know. They are retired. Both of \ntheir daughters are married and live away from Georgia. Both of them \nhave been in financial difficulty, and both are on the brink of losing \ntheir homes. Through the counseling of the minister and their support, \nthey counseled and showed them where to cap, cut, and balance so they \ncould make their mortgage payments and not lose their homes. Americans \nhave had to do that all over the country. The present economic \nsituation mandates that. There are no excuses with the IRS or bill \ncollectors or people with whom you may do business. If you don't pay, \nthere are consequences.\n  America as a country must ask of itself what we impose and ask of \nevery citizen in our country. I think also there are probably a lot of \nmembers of the Georgia Legislature who are watching this debate and \nscratching their heads. In my State, in the last 4 years we cut $5 \nbillion--from a $22 billion budget to a $17 billion budget. Do you know \nwhy? It is because our Constitution says we have to have a balanced \nbudget. We can't borrow to pay for everyday operations, and we must \nlive within our means. We have had to cut, and a lot of those cuts have \nbeen painful.\n  Many States are coming back now. There was an article the other day \nabout States that are coming back and showing future months of growth \nin revenues and in their income, and even looking to surpluses that \nwill come in the years to come. Why? Because when they had to do it, \nthey balanced their budgets and capped their expenditures, and they did \nwhat their Constitution requires.\n  This proposal tells us, first of all, to make cuts that would \nmaterialize early of about $51 billion. It would be a downpayment on \nthe process to continue the cutting process to reduce our deficit and \nour debt. It has a formula for capping expenditures in the future, \ngoing from 21.7 percent of GDP to 19.9 percent of GDP which, by the \nway, falls within the realm of the last 40-year average, until the last \nfew years when we have gone from 20, 22, 24, to 24.6 percent of GDP.\n  It is not unreasonable to ask us to impose upon ourselves a cap \nconsistent with the averages of our past. Remember this: As we get our \narms around our spending and live within our means, business will \nprosper, revenues will go up to companies, taxes will go up, and that \npercentage of GDP will give us a broader margin. It is only when we are \nin a declining economy, a recessionary environment, where revenues go \ndown, that caps are hurting a lot because we are not empowering \nbusiness, profits go down, and revenues go down for the country.\n  On the balanced budget amendment, this provision leaves room for \nnegotiation between the bodies as to what the caps will be in the \nbalanced budget amendment, whether it would be a supermajority of 60 or \n67 to raise taxes. It is a realistic approach to cause us to sit around \nthe table in Congress and negotiate what is wrong for the country. If \nit is right for almost every State in our Union to have to balance \ntheir budgets, to cap their spending, and to limit their borrowing, it \nshould be right for us.\n  This proposal is right for America. It is basically what we require \nof our citizens. It is now time we required it of ourselves. I am proud \nto join my fellow members of the Republican Conference of the Senate to \nvote for a new discipline for America that cuts excessive spending, \ncaps wasteful spending, and, over time, allows us a roadmap to have a \nbalanced budget and a GDP ratio to expenditures that is doable, \nworkable, and historically justifiable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Pilots' Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me make a comment on \nsomething totally unrelated to the subject of the day, which is that we \nhave a significant bill coming up that the occupant of the chair and I \nhave put together. It is called the pilots' bill of rights. The reason \nI want to say something about it is it is getting toward the end of the \nweek. It happens a week from today--the largest gathering anyplace in \nthe world of pilots who will get together in Oshkosh for the big event. \nI have been going to that for 32 consecutive years. We have probably \nthe most significant piece of legislation we have ever introduced at \nOshkosh. We are going to have literally thousands--I am talking about \n200,000 pilots who are single-issue people.\n  I have been a pilot for 50 years. I know how these people think. The \npilots' bill of rights is going to offer an opportunity to these \npeople, who might be accused of something by the FAA, to have access to \nthe evidence against them. It is something that everybody is for. As a \nmatter of fact, it is something that--I haven't said yet, but I just \nheard that the air traffic controllers are supporting this effort. So \nwe are going to have a lot of people. We already have 34 cosponsors.\n  The reason I want to say this, I know not many Members are listening, \nbut a lot of staffers are. Pilots are single-issue people. They are \ngoing to want to know who is cosponsor of the bill. We will be talking \nfor a period of 2 hours in two different settings. We will have \nliterally thousands of pilots there.\n  I encourage very strongly people who may be listening to us right now \nto have their Members look at this carefully. As I say, pilots are \nsingle-issue people, and this is their issue. I did this twice--once in \n1994, when we were able to use the population at Oshkosh to push over \nthe top the first product liability bill that changed our manufacturing \nof aircraft from a major importer to a major exporter. That all \nhappened at Oshkosh.\n\n  Another time it happened was with Bob Hoover, whom I think would be \nconsidered to be the best pilot in America today. He is up in years, \nbut this guy had a problem that we helped him with, an emergency \nrevocation. We did it in Oshkosh.\n  I hope we get a lot more people who are interested in general \naviation, and\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nparticularly if you are on the general aviation caucus and you are not \non this bill. There are going to be an awful lot of questions.\n\n\n                         Cut, Cap, and Balance\n\n  Let me make a few comments about the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. I can \nremember coming to the floor standing at this podium about 15 years \nago, and this was during the Clinton administration. I came here \nbecause the Clinton budget for the entire country at that time was $1.5 \ntrillion. I came down and stood here and said: How is it possible to \nsustain a level like $1.5 trillion? That was to run the United States \nfor the entire year of 1996.\n  Now I think the outrage this year is that in President Obama's \ncurrent budget, the deficit alone was $1.65 trillion. In other words, \nthe deficit alone, right now, is greater than what it took to run the \nentire country for a period of a year in 1996.\n  That is something we can't continue doing. I believe the spending has \ngone so out of line that it is not believable. It is not possible for \npeople to think this could be happening. President Obama has managed to \nincrease Federal spending by over 30 percent, to an average of $3.6 \ntrillion a year--$3.6 trillion. I was complaining about $1.5 trillion, \nand this is just 15 years later.\n  Is anybody listening out there? Does anybody really care? Maybe since \nI have 20 kids and grandkids I am a little more sensitive to the fiscal \ndestruction of this country. This has caused our national debt to \nincrease by 35 percent. Today, we have to borrow 40 cents for every \ndollar we spend. It just happened. This is something that we have to \naddress.\n  I think we are so wrapped up now in saying how are we going to get \nthis done by this deadline of August 2. I remind everybody of something \nthat most people don't know, and it is a shock. They think this is the \nfirst time in the Obama administration that we have talked about \nincreasing the debt limit. It is the fourth time. He keeps coming up \nwith trillions of dollars of deficit each time--$5 trillion in three \nbudgets. Believe me, it is not anybody else in this Chamber. It is not \nin the other Chamber, the House. It is one person--the President--who \nhas come out with his budget. He signs it and sends it to us.\n  Well, that is a total of $5 trillion over the last three budgets. \nSome may think it is just not possible that this could be happening. \nThis is the fourth time he wants to increase the debt limit.\n  This is the strategy: Go out and spend all this money like drunken \nsailors, and then come right up to the last minute and say the world is \ngoing to come to an end unless you increase the debt limit. You have to \nstop someplace, and I decided the last time he did this that I was \ngoing to stop unless we had some type of discipline.\n  The only discipline out there is the cut, cap, and balance budget \namendment. I think we need to look at this carefully because if you \nstop and put this down--what I normally do on something like this is \nsay: How does this affect the average person? This increase in debt \njust in this period of time would be $11,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild--an increase from the time this President took office. That is an \nincrease, and the total amount of debt they would owe would be $46,000. \nThat is the day they are born. Happy Birthday.\n  Well, over the past several weeks, we have talked about what to do \nabout the debt limit. I have looked at the three major plans out there. \nLooking carefully, the problem I have with the plan that has come up--\ncalled the Gang of 6, or the Gang of 7 depending on which group you are \nlooking at--is that it has some intangibles in there.\n  For example, the military cuts--it doesn't say where they are, but we \nare talking about it--almost $1 trillion over a period of 10 years.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee. I can tell you that I don't \nknow where that will come from until they come up with more specifics--\nand they might do it, and it might be plausible. As it is right now, \nthe cut, cap, and balance legislation is the only one I have seen that \nwould really work. I haven't been involved in all these discussions. A \nlot of people are certainly working to try to come up with answers, the \nones going to the White House every other day talking with the \nPresident. I don't happen to be one of those. My major concern right \nnow--and I will at least mention this, because I have done several \nshows today to try make people understand--is, yes, the deficit and the \nspending, all that is terrible, but what is equally as bad--and that \nnobody knows about--is what is happening in terms of the regulations. \nWe have all these programs this administration has tried to pass. I \nwould say the main one that people are familiar with is cap and trade. \nRemember the old thing that has been going on for 10 years now--the cap \nand trade? That would cost the American people somewhere between $300 \nbillion and $400 billion a year. That is a huge thing. Bringing that \nfigure down to every taxpaying family in my State of Oklahoma, it would \nbe a little over $3,000 a year, and you get nothing for it.\n\n  According to the President's own Director of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Lisa Jackson, when I asked her on the record if we \nwere to pass any of these cap and trade bills, would it reduce \nCO2 emissions--assuming you want to reduce CO2 \nemissions--she said no, because this is only applying to the United \nStates. Let me carry it one step farther. As we run out of ways to \ncreate energy in America, we will have a job flight from our \nmanufacturing base, which would have to go to places such as China, \nIndia, and Mexico, where they do not have any emission restrictions. \nSo, if anything, it would increase emissions.\n  I am very proud of the Senate, because now we have perhaps, at the \nvery most, 24 votes to pass cap and trade. So what does the President \ndo? He says: Fine, we will do it through regulations. So, through \nregulations, he is attempting to do that. And we will hear next week of \nanother example. In fact, there are six major areas where regulations \nare costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. Another one he \nis going to announce next week is going to be a tightening in the \nstandards on MACTs, and it is one that is going to cost in the \nneighborhood of $90 billion each year. So in just two of these \nregulations you have $400 billion a year in costs to the American \npeople. People just aren't aware of that.\n  Some smart guy in my office went back and said: You know, you are not \nthe first person to be concerned about the cost of these regulations. \nPoliticians don't talk about it because no one understands it. But \nRonald Reagan, back in 1981, said this:\n\n       Overregulation causes small and independent businessmen and \n     women, as well as large businesses, to defer or terminate \n     plans for expansion.\n\n  That is what he said. And then he said:\n\n       I have asked Vice President Bush to head a cabinet-level \n     task force on regulatory relief.\n\n  That was the first Bush he was referring to there. So they realized \nit back then, the cost of overregulation. But it has gotten to the \npoint now where it is every bit as important as the spending problem.\n  But we are talking about the spending problem right now, and there is \nnothing complicated about it. When you spend more than you take in, you \ngo into debt, and we can't keep doing that forever. We keep getting \nthese budgets from the President each year--three budgets now totaling \na greater increase in debt than all Presidents since George Washington \ncombined. Nobody seems to understand and no one seems to care that we \ncan't keep doing that. We are going to have to do something about it \nfor future generations. I think we are going to do it. I hope when this \nvote comes up--and I think it has been set for tomorrow--on the cut, \ncap, and balance legislation, it will be something that will be \nseriously considered, particularly by people who are coming up for \nreelection in 2012. They need to be thinking about this, because this \nwill be a huge issue. To stand here on the floor and not vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment--during this crisis we are facing now--is \nsomething everyone will have to answer to.\n  So while the caps we talk about in the cut, cap, and balance \nlegislation would be over a period of time, it is no good unless you \nhave some kind of enforcing mechanism. This bill we will be voting on \ntomorrow, I understand, does have that enforcement mechanism. It has \nsequestration. These are automatic cuts, so that if Congress decides it \nis going to spend above the caps that are\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nallowed, then automatic sequestration goes into effect. It works. It is \nenforceable.\n  We have watched spending go up. I am reminiscing here that this has \nbeen going on for a long time. People are saying: Well, we are not \ngoing to be able to pass a cut, cap, and balanced budget bill because \nthey have been trying to pass a balanced budget amendment for some 40 \nyears or so and they haven't been able to do it. I think this is a \nunique time that is different than the past 40 years. This is the first \ntime I have seen where the average person knows we can't sustain this \nthing. We can't go from a budget running the United States of America \nfrom $1.5 trillion and then all of a sudden it is $3.5 trillion under \njust one President. You can't continue to do that.\n  I remember way back many years ago, when I was in the State \nlegislature, there was a great Senator named Carl Curtis from Nebraska. \nCarl Curtis was quite elderly at that time, and he had been trying to \ndo a balanced budget amendment for probably 20 years at that time. This \nwas back in the 1970s. He came to me in the State legislature in \nOklahoma and said: I have an idea. The argument they use against a \nbalanced budget amendment is that three-fourths of the States would \nnever ratify it. So, he said: Let's preratify a budget balancing \namendment.\n  He was kind of a genius. I happened to be the first State legislator \nhe approached, and he asked me to take it on as a project. So the State \nof Oklahoma was the first State in history to preratify a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It was kind of fun. Then it was \nso popular that others started doing it, and we got right up to the \nthree-fourths but couldn't quite get over that. But that is something \nthat took place many years ago.\n  This is something we know is not easy, it is something that is \ndifficult to do, but we now have another chance. It is the first time \nwe have had a chance where the majority of the people, by polling, are \nexpressing their outrage and stating that we are going to have to do \nsomething. Even though we have raised the debt limit countless times, \nthis is the one time it is getting all this attention, and it is \ngetting this attention because we all know we have something that is no \nlonger sustainable. So we have another chance at the balanced budget \namendment provision in the cut, cap, and balance bill, and it would \nprevent the debt limit from being raised until Congress sends one of \nthe three balanced budget amendment proposals to the States for \nratification. In other words, the amendment would have to pass both \nChambers by two-thirds majority before the debt limit is allowed to \nincrease. This makes sense. It is a permanent solution to our problem.\n  Within 5 years of ratification, the amendment would require Congress \nto pass a balanced budget every year, and it would cap total spending \nat 18 percent of GDP. Right now it is above 20 percent of GDP, so it is \neven lower than the caps we have had before. It would also require a \ntwo-thirds majority to raise taxes. We all know conditions could \nchange--we could be in a war--so this does have a deficit provision \nwhich I think is very responsible. The balanced budget amendment is the \nonly reform that will put our Nation on a true path for permanent \nfiscal stability. It will force comprehensive and real changes to the \nFederal Government and its spending priorities. If it is ratified, it \nwould avert the risk of a debt crisis. In short, it would put our \nNation on a path to limited government it has not seen in years. So I \nthink this is the opportunity.\n  We have three different opportunities coming up. We have heard about \nthe proposal by the Republican leader and by, I think, the majority \nleader. That might be some kind of last effort, and maybe that is what \nwe will be considering. But the first and the best and the easiest--and \nthe most fiscally responsible--is the cut, cap, and balance bill. So we \nwill have that opportunity tomorrow. It is very significant we take \nadvantage of that opportunity. I am not the pessimist most people are. \nI think we have a shot at this thing. If the American people are \nwatching carefully, we could pass this thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come down here frustrated and hopeful. I \nwant to see the glass half full even though we have been through a \nfrustrating number of days and months dealing with our debt crisis, and \nhere we are careening toward another crisis. Congress went through this \nearlier in the year. It seems as though the only way we ultimately get \nthings done is to take it right up to the edge and then come through \nwith an agreement. I don't think it is fair to the American people. It \nclearly isn't a formula for providing certainty in our economy for \nthose who are running businesses and for households that are making \ntough decisions.\n  If there is one word that characterizes where we have been this \nentire year, it is ``uncertainty''--uncertainty about what the future \nis going to look like. Are we going to default or not? Do we have \nenough money to pay the bills or not? What are the consequences of a \npotential default? When we had the continuing resolutions to provide \nfunding for the rest of the year, we went from one extension to another \nextension to another. Everything is in limbo. How can you run an \neconomy, how can a business man or woman make a decision if they don't \nknow what is coming down the line in terms of taxes, in terms of \nregulations, in terms of the economic climate, in terms of whether \npeople will be buying, selling, or just sitting on their money?\n  Into the third year of a slowdown and recession, the economy is \ngrowing but not growing at a rate that is putting people back to work. \nWe all want to get the economy moving again, and inserting certainty \ninto the process will certainly be a positive step forward.\n  I think there is virtually unanimous consent that this government has \ngrown too big, it spends too much, it doesn't have the revenues to pay \nfor what it does, and there needs to be real reform taking place soon.\n  We are 12 days away from August 2, the date the Treasury Department \nhas indicated we run out of money and don't have enough to pay our \nbills. Obligations that have been committed to and promised can't be \npaid because we won't have the funds to do so on August 2.\n  We have known this day was coming for a long time. We were originally \ntold we would run out of money in March, and then for some reason it \nwas moved to May and then to August. I don't know how they are moving \nmoney around at the Treasury to extend this particular date, but it \nappears we are now at the end of the road, we are at the wall, and \ndecisions have to be made.\n  Are we going to take the necessary steps, make the tough decisions, \nand do what we need to do to control our spending, to put in place \nmechanisms that will ensure we don't continue to do what has been done \nover the past several years, and put policies in place that will \nstimulate our economy and get people back to work? After all, it is \nreally all about jobs. It is all about an economy that is providing \nopportunities for young people coming out of college and high school, \nopportunities for people to buy homes and raise their families and save \nmoney and send their kids to school, to keep a good-paying job, to be \nable to pay the mortgage and all the bills that come to the household \nevery month. That is really what it is all about. Unless we address \nthese issues before us here fiscally, we are not going to get to the \npoint where people have hope for the future.\n  I said I am frustrated, and I guess I just expressed some of that \nfrustration, but I am also hopeful. I am hopeful because in times of \ncrisis, solutions can be found. We wish we could do it in a more \nsystematic way. We wish we had done it in the past several months, but \nwe didn't, so here we are. And now I think the focus is clearly on \ngetting to a solution.\n  We are debating a plan called cut, cap, and balance--cut because we \nare spending more money than we can afford to spend; cap because we \nwant to put procedures in place not to spend more than we can afford in \nyears to come; and balance, a balanced budget\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\namendment to the Constitution so that when Members come here and put \ntheir left hand on a Bible and their right hand in the air and swear to \nuphold and support and defend the Constitution of the United States--\nand that Constitution says you can't spend more than you take in, you \nneed to balance your budget just like households and businesses all \nacross America, and virtually all of our States have these either in \nstatute or in amendment form, the Federal Government excepted.\n  I don't believe Congress has demonstrated the discipline necessary to \nrun a fiscal house that is anywhere close to balanced. Despite all the \nwonderful speeches that we are going to cut this and do that and \nprovide for this and provide for that, we have just seen an explosion \nof debt, an explosion of spending regardless of what the revenues \ncoming in happen to total. A constitutional balanced budget amendment \nwill give us the spine and backbone and the duty and responsibility to \nuphold the Constitution in that regard and achieve and make the tough \nchoices, make the tough votes every year.\n  This happens in our State every year. We somehow survive, and in fact \nwe are doing pretty well because our legislators have to go before the \npeople and say: That is a good idea; but we have to balance our budget. \nWe could raise your taxes to pay for that if you want that extra \nprogram or we can cut another program and substitute the money saved \nfrom that for this program or, we just can't go there. We don't have \nthe money. These are the choices we have to make, and this is the \nresponsibility we have.\n  I said I am hopeful. Why am I hopeful? I am a baseball fan, sports \nfan, basketball. I have seen so many sports situations where the \nannouncers have said or the spectators have observed that it is \nhopeless, there is no way they can come back, there is no way they can \npull this out, but then I have seen miraculous comebacks in the fourth \nquarter of basketball games, maybe the last 2 minutes, in the bottom of \nthe ninth where you have just about written off any chance of victory \nat all, and all of a sudden they come from behind. Whether it is \nsoccer, baseball, basketball, or any sport, we all have experienced \nsituations that give us hope.\n  Even though the clock is ticking down, as it is on this debt limit \ndate, and even though some are saying we are never going to get there, \nI am hopeful we can come forward with a sensible plan. In my opinion \nand in the opinion of many, the cut, cap, and balance is a plan that \ncan get us to where we need to go. Clearly, first we need--and cut does \nthis--to address our spending issue, and then cap so that we don't keep \nrunning into this year after year, and then balance so that we are \ncommitted to it for the long term. In order to get there, this \nprovision before us gives us the opportunity to do just that.\n  The reforms that we need to address--not just cutting but addressing \nthe out-of-control, deficit-driving entitlement programs that need to \nbe reformed in order to save those benefits and save those programs for \nthe future, not take them away and not watch them go into insolvency--\nall those need to be addressed, and I hope they will be, and this is \nthe plan that can get us there.\n  We will be voting on this tomorrow morning, and I am urging my \ncolleagues to look at this in a serious way.\n  There has been a lot of criticism of various plans that Republicans \nhave put forward. Yet the President hasn't put anything forward. My \ncolleagues across the aisle, the Democrats, haven't put a budget \nforward or a plan. We get criticism because they don't like this part \nof our plan or they don't like that part of our plan. We aren't saying \nour plan is perfect, but where is yours? We have nothing to measure it \nagainst. Democrats are in the majority in the Senate, but nothing has \nbeen brought forward here for us to debate or vote on. There is no way \nwe can stand here and say, here is our plan, what do you like about it, \nwhat don't you like about it, or for you to stand here and say, here is \nour plan. Let's work together to meld these two things together. Maybe \nwe can find a compromise. Nothing has been provided by the other side.\n  We are here with cut, cap, and balance, and people said: No, that is \nnot the one. People have said: Gang of Six--no, that is not the one. \nPeople have said that of other provisions that have been brought \nforward: No, that is not the one. Well, OK, fine. You don't like that? \nWhat is the one? What is the one that gets us there?\n  So as we approach the very end, we have to understand that the \nconsequences of what we do are enormous. Doing what is right for the \nfuture of America and the future of the American people, the future of \ngenerations to follow, is what ought to be driving us at this point \ntoward reaching a rational, sensible solution to put us on the path to \nfiscal responsibility and get our financial house in order.\n  Just hours are left before we have this vote, and if this vote \ndoesn't pass, as many are predicting it won't, and the President has \nsaid he will veto it if it does, I am still hopeful we can pull \nsomething out here in the bottom of the ninth. And if it doesn't pass, \nwhere do we go next? So we need leadership, and we need leadership from \nthe leader of our country to guide us where we need to go if they are \ngoing to just simply reject everything we put forward.\n  Let's be very careful how we evaluate our vote tomorrow and the \nimplications it has for the future of this country and the fact that \nthe clock is ticking louder as we careen toward a serious crisis on \nAugust 2.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, since I was sworn into office this January, \nabout 6 months ago, the House and the Senate have both been \nunderstandably and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps \neclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this half-year \nperiod of time; that related to our national debt and the anticipated \nexpiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks. \nMany Americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the \nconcern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of August 2 without \nraising the debt limit, there could be catastrophic financial \nconsequences.\n  In light of that, I, along with a number of my Republican colleagues \nboth in the Senate and in the House, have introduced legislation called \nthe Cut, Cap, and Balance Act to address the debt limit, to address it \nhead on. It says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are \nmet: first, that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary \nspending for the fiscal year 2012 budget; second, we need statutory \nspending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward \nbalancing our budget sometime within the next decade; third, we need a \nbalanced budget amendment passed out of Congress and submitted to the \nStates for ratification.\n  We think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we \ntake the significant additional step of raising the debt limit. Because \nof the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point, the point \nwhere, by the end of the year, we will have accumulated $15 trillion in \ndebt--about $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America, between \n$120,000 and $150,000 for every wage earner in America; this is a lot \nof money--before we extend that debt limit again by an additional $2.4 \ntrillion, we have to solve the problem. We have to address the problem \nthat led to its creation in a real, lasting, binding fundamental way.\n  That is why the most critical part of this legislation, while each \npart is important, happens to be found in that which rests upon the \nidea of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We as Members \nof Congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 \nyears, it might be a good idea to cut spending by $2 trillion, $3 \ntrillion, $4 trillion, $5 trillion, $6 trillion, perhaps more--but if \nwe made that promise today as a downpayment to the American people in \nexchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit, it \nis a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\n  This Congress was sworn in in January of 2011. Elections will be held \nin November of 2012 and a new Congress will be sworn in based on those \nelections in January 2013. The same thing will happen again in January \n2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our Republic. The \ndecisions we make right here, right now can affect the here and now and \ncan be binding for the here and now, but we cannot reasonably expect \nand we cannot ask the American people, when making a decision so long-\nlasting and precedent-setting as this one, to simply trust us that \nfuture Congresses will see things the same way we do.\n  The only way we can bind a future Congress is by amending our law of \nlaws, that 224-year-old document painstakingly ironed out by some of \nthe brightest men of the last several centuries in Philadelphia 224 \nyears ago.\n  When we amend the Constitution, we make it possible to bind a future \nCongress. That is what we need to do. We have had some interesting \ndebate and discussion surrounding this proposal. Last Friday, I \nlistened with surprise and dismay as our President said we don't need \nto amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget, but we do need \nto balance our budget. In the opinion of the President, Congress just \nneeds to do its job, not amend the Constitution.\n  I think I understand his point. I think he is suggesting that for \nCongress to do its job it needs to balance its budget. But I have to \nask the question, how has that worked out for us? Have past Congresses \nbalanced their budgets? Has the current Congress balanced its budget? \nOverwhelmingly, the answer is no. It happens every now and then. Some \nwould describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or \nthree decades as an accident; others, a momentary blip; still others \nwould suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an \nactual act of budget balancing when that occurred.\n  Regardless, we know that balanced Federal budgets are newsworthy \nindeed because they are very rare. I look forward to the day when they \nare no longer newsworthy, when they are customary, and the only way to \nmake them customary, based on our experience as Americans throughout \nmost of our Nation's history, is by amending the Constitution to \nrequire it, to make this a binding and permanent law.\n  I was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our Senate majority \nleader, Senator Reid from Nevada, stated just a few hours ago that he \ndoes not like this legislation. He made some very disparaging comments \nabout it, notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact \nthat this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit \nissue, right now it is the only legislation. It is the only legislation \nthat addresses this issue that is moving through Congress and that has \nbeen reduced to legislative language. It is certainly the only one that \nhas been passed by one body of Congress and is now moving over to the \nSenate.\n  He is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything. \nThis is the only show in town. Given how close we now are to the August \n2 deadline and, in part, because we punted this so long and, in part, \nbecause we have not been having the debate and discussion in Congress \nwe should have been having for months, this is it. This is the only \nproposal.\n  If Senator Reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal, \nI am all ears. I would love to hear what they are. If he has his own \nproposal, I would love to see what that is. But simply to stand from \nthat desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable, \nabsolutely inexcusable, given the fact that he has offered nothing.\n  Let me read some of his words. He said: ``The American people should \nunderstand that this''--``this'' meaning the Cut, Cap, and Balance \nAct--``is a bad piece of legislation, perhaps some of the worst \nlegislation in the history of this country.''\n  I don't know what he is referring to. He didn't give specifics, nor \nhas he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or \nhow it could be improved. My suggestion to our Senate majority leader \nis, if he has ideas, please put them on the table because, as we \napproach this debt limit deadline, we are running out of time. The \nclock has been ticking for 6 months. We have known this was going to \nhappen. This is not news to us.\n  Why, then, has there been so little debate and discussion in this \nbody? Why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks, often dealing \nwith legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this \nissue. The clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other \nlegislation far less important.\n  This, in my opinion, was a gross dereliction of duty. But we still \nhave a few weeks. We can still deal with it. We can still address it. I \nsuggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation \nthat has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and \ndiscussion.\n  But, no, we are told. Even after the House of Representatives earlier \nthis week passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, passed it with \nbipartisan support, by the way--no fewer than five members of the \nDemocratic caucus in the House of Representatives voted to support \nthis. That was passed Tuesday night. We were told later we would be \nhaving a vote on Saturday or perhaps Monday. Then, just a little while \nago, we were informed by the Senate majority leader that the vote would \nbe tomorrow, giving us little or no time for actual debate and \ndiscussion on the floor of what is still, to this moment, the only \nlegislation moving through to address this issue.\n  This is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery. Demagoguery on an \nissue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain. No one \ndisputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences \nassociated with not raising the debt limit. I do not dispute that, not \nfor a moment. That is exactly why I put my neck on the line in order to \nfile this legislation because nothing else was moving forward. I didn't \nwant to do it, but when I was sworn in as a Senator just a few months \nago, I understood it was my obligation to do what I could to make \nthings better, to make our constitutional system work. So I filed it.\n  It is an insult, not only to me and to my colleagues but to all \nAmericans when addressing an issue this important, to have so little \ndebate and discussion over this issue. I find it appalling. I find it \nreprehensible. I demand an explanation, and I demand an alternative \nsolution, if the Senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and \nsay he will not do it. Moreover, I will remind the Senate majority \nleader that just a few short years ago, in 2006, when we had a \ndifferent President, belonging to a different party, and this body was \nin control of another party, if my memory serves me correctly not only \ndid then-Senator Barack Obama vote against raising the debt limit, \ncalling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that \nhe was not willing to condone and perpetuate, but every single one of \nhis Democratic colleagues joined him in that vote. Not one of them \nvoted to raise the debt limit.\n  Here we are again approaching the debt limit. Here we are again with \nonly Republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution. Only \nthis time the solution is a permanent one. Unfortunately, in 2006 and \nprior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes, there was no \nserious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution.\n  We have to amend the governing document, the law of laws, the only \nkind of law that can bind future Congresses in order to solve this \nproblem. We have to do it now. This is part of what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  We, as Americans, crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree. \nEvery single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered \nexpansion of the Federal Government and all its power. We commit \nourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more \nand more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their \nFederal tax bills every single year. That is time they will not get \nback. That is time we will not get back. That erodes our individual \nliberty.\n  It also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that \nexists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are \nborrowing now more than $1.5 trillion every single year--not because of \nsome aberrational condition, some unusual development that requires an \nunusual expenditure of borrowed money, but just to cover our\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nbasic day-to-day operations. This is what fuels the perpetual expansion \nof government, and when government expands perpetually, our individual \nliberty is diminished, unfortunately, and to a corresponding degree. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  But there is a way home. The way home is found in limiting the role \nof government. We can limit the role of government most effectively at \nthis point in time, I believe, by limiting the pool of money to which \nCongress has access. The only way to do that is through a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has \nbeen used in response to and against the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. \nMany of its detractors are making the claim that I find extraordinary, \na claim that says: Why are you even supporting this because it can't \npass. It is a little bit akin to saying: Why do we even play the Super \nBowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team. \nWe have to play. But this one is not a game. This one is for real.\n  When we vote after debating and discussing, Members of this body can \nand will be held accountable to our constituents. So it will be up to \nme and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this \nissue. For those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against \nthis, notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the American people \nstrongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment; \nnotwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of Americans--both of these \nfigures according to a CNN poll today--support the principles \nunderlying cut, cap, and balance; notwithstanding the fact that this is \nthe only permanent way of solving our debt problem, if Members of \nCongress and Members of this body choose to vote against this \nlegislation, they will do so, I believe, at their own peril. They will \nhave to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were \nunwilling to raise the debt limit, unwilling to address this problem, \nunwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of Congress \nsimply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I think that is a tall order. I think that is difficult \nto explain. I think those who try to make that explanation to their \nconstituents will do so at their own political peril. But, more \nimportantly, the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of \nthe United States of America, of their liberty, of their economic \nstability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future.\n\n  We can turn this ship around, but in order do it we need robust \ndebate and discussion, and our constituents deserve more. The American \npeople deserve more than to have the kind of sleight-of-hand scheduling \nand the kind of dismissive, cavalier attitude toward what is being \ncharacterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation.\n  We need to pass the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. It is not only the \nbest solution, it is the only solution. The time is running out, and I \nurge each of my colleagues to support this.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Utah. I am just a bit taken \naback by the majority leader's decision to alter the course that I \nthought we were on that would allow for debate and work on a bill to \ndeal with the budget, the debt ceiling, and our budget deficit \ntomorrow. In some of his comments he made today after he changed his \nmind yesterday, he said:\n\n       I'm committed to allowing a fair and full debate on this \n     bill. I want the proponents and opponents to have time to air \n     their views.\n\n  And so forth. Then he says:\n\n       I think this piece of legislation is about as weak and \n     senseless as anything that has ever come before the Senate. I \n     am not going to waste the Senate's time day after day on this \n     piece of legislation which I think is an anathema to what our \n     country is about.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       The American people should understand this is a bad piece \n     of legislation, perhaps the worst legislation in the history \n     of this country.\n\n  That is what the majority leader said just a few hours ago. Well, let \nme ask Senator Lee--he is newly elected from the State of Utah. He has \ntraveled all over the State.\n  Did the Senator share with his people at various times in his efforts \nthat he thought a constitutional amendment, like so many States have to \ncontain spending, is good and sound policy? Did they hold that against \nthe Senator or does he think his election was an affirmation of the cry \nof the American people that we take some action that would actually \nconstrain spending?\n  Mr. LEE. On countless occasions throughout the State of Utah, I have \narticulated the fact that I believe we have no business raising the \ndebt limit without first adopting permanent structural change in the \nform of a constitutional balanced budget amendment. The people of Utah \nelected me in part based on that promise. Elections have consequences, \nand in my case this was one of them.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am flabbergasted by the majority leader's comments. \nHe said:\n\n       I think this piece of legislation is about as weak and \n     senseless as anything that has ever come up on the Senate \n     floor.\n\n  Well, wouldn't the Senator say that compared to all the other \nlegislation we are talking about passing--and some of it has some teeth \nto it, I acknowledge--but compared to all of that, a constitutional \namendment that requires us to live within our means is certainly not a \nweak piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LEE. I would hardly call it weak. Quite to the contrary. Calls \nfor legislation such as this date back a couple of hundred years. \nThomas Jefferson was arguably the first one to suggest this kind of \nproposal. He called for it again and again, and those calls have \ncontinued throughout most of our history, but they have accelerated in \nrecent decades. They have accelerated because this body has refused to \nbalance its budget, and it has abused its borrowing power to the point \nwe are spending more than $1.5 trillion a year more than we bring in. \nIt is bankrupting our country. We are burying our children under a \nmountain of debt. We are killing jobs, we are spending money we don't \nhave, and that is wrong.\n  I would hardly call legislation designed to deal with that in a \npermanent binding way senseless, and I am insulted that the majority \nleader would suggest that this is somehow senseless just because he \ndoesn't like it because it will make him less powerful.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I think that is getting to the nub of the matter. \nI think it is a sense in which--now for a constitutional amendment to \npass, it has to have a two-thirds vote in the Congress, both Houses, \nand three-fourths of the States. Once passed, no majority leader could \ncome in next year and say: Well, I know I have been in favor of \nbalanced budgets, but I don't want to do it this year. I have more \nspending I want to occur.\n  It would, indeed, curb the power of the majority leader and actually \nsome newly constituted Senate to spend more money than the government \ntakes in, would it not?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, it would. The whole purpose of the balanced budget \namendment is to restrict our power and give that power back to the \npeople where it belongs. The power has been abused here. It has been \nabused over a prolonged period of time, and it has been abused to a \nsevere degree. This is why the election of 2010 brought about some \nsignificant outcomes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. I think the American people \nrightly have concluded that our Congress of the United States that \nborrows 40 percent of the amount of money it spends--because it is \nspending more money than it takes in--is acting irresponsibly.\n  As I have noted earlier, somebody said: Oh, you know, the tea party \nis angry. Well, why shouldn't they be angry? We have completely \nmismanaged the American people's business. We are elected to be \nresponsible leaders. Nobody, I believe, would come to the floor of this \nSenate--I would like to see if it happens--and defend what we are \ndoing, borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend no matter what it is \non. And the President proposed his budget for next year that would \ninclude a 10-percent increase for education, 10-percent increase for \nenergy, 10-percent increase for the State Department, and we are \nspending money that we don't have.\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\n  So I think a constitutional amendment would require a major \nparticipation by the American people and all the States of America \nwould discuss it. If the American people decide they believe Congress \nneeds to be restrained and pass that constitutional amendment, what is \nwrong with that? Isn't that a legitimate way for the American people to \nhave their voices expressed according to the Constitution?\n  Mr. LEE. There is nothing wrong with it, and quite to the contrary. \nThis is exactly the kind of activity that our Constitution \ncontemplates, authorizes, and with good reason. I should note here it \nis significant that in this body each State is represented equally. A \nrelatively small State such as mine, the State of Utah, has the same \nnumber of Senators as a large, heavily populated State such as \nCalifornia or such as New York because we represent the States. We \nrepresent the States as States.\n  One of our jobs is to make sure that their sovereign interests are \nvindicated in this body. To suggest that we should not balance our \nbudget, to suggest that we should not propose a balanced budget to be \nconsidered by the States--keeping in mind that it is the States \nultimately that ratify it if three-fourths of them choose to do so--is \ninsulting to the very States we represent. It somehow suggests our \nStates can't handle it when the States overwhelmingly, almost every one \nof them, balance their budgets every year.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I agree with that, and it is just odd to me--and \ncontrary to the heritage of the Senate--for the majority leader to \nassume as much power as is being assumed now. I am ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee, and essentially the Democratic leadership told \nthe Budget Committee not to even mark up a budget this year even though \nthe statutes of the United States in the United States Code require \nCongress to have a budget.\n  I know the Senator is a skilled lawyer. His father was Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. It is probably the most prestigious \nposition a lawyer can have in America, in my opinion. To be able to \nstand before the U.S. Supreme Court and to represent the U.S. \nGovernment in court is an honor that is very high. So he is a student \nof the law, and I know he is familiar with the statutes of the United \nStates that require a budget. It doesn't say you go to jail if you \ndon't, I will admit, but it says we should have a budget.\n  Does the Senator think the people in Utah--and I think the people in \nAlabama--would think we should have a budget because it is the right \nthing to do, No. 1, and, No. 2, we should do it because it is the law?\n  Mr. LEE. It is the law, and notwithstanding the fact that we don't \nhave a court order enjoining us to do that, we still have taken an oath \nto uphold the Constitution. I think that means especially on an issue \nso fundamental, so important, so sweeping as the budgeting process, we \nshould be complying with that law or at least making an effort to do \nso.\n  What I see here is not only a lack of effort to comply with that law \nbut a deliberate, conscious effort made with malice aforethought to \navoid the law. That is damaging. That is wrong.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The House of Representatives passed this bill. They \npassed it by more than a few votes to spare and sent it here. I believe \nif the American people knew what was in it, they would favor it. The \npeople in my State would favor it. I think the American people would \nfavor it. How does the Senator think the good people in the House, the \ngood people of America, who overwhelmingly favor a restraint in \nspending and balancing our budget, would feel about the leader \ncurtailing our debate on this important subject and saying:\n\n       I think this piece of legislation is about as weak and \n     senseless as anything that has ever come on this Senate \n     floor. I'm not going to waste the Senate's time.\n\n  Mr. LEE. I think the American people would be profoundly disappointed \nby that statement. More importantly, they would be profoundly disgusted \nby the fact that it wasn't enough for the Senate majority leader simply \nto say: I disagree with it or to point out areas in which he might \ndisagree with it or might want to improve upon it. He went so far as to \nsay it is not even worth our time to debate and discuss this. That \nsmacks of tyranny. Americans don't respond well to tyranny, and this is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have to say I think we are having a problem in the \nSenate. I consider the majority leader a friend. I know it is a very \ndifficult job. I have said that many times. I wouldn't want it. Trent \nLott said it is like herding cats or it is like pushing a wheelbarrow \nwith frogs; you put one in and two jump out. It is a tough job, but he \nasked for it.\n\n  The Senate is a great institution. I don't know what Robert Byrd, the \nlate Senator from West Virginia, would say if he were here. I think I \nknow. I think he would be very uneasy about the process we have gone \nthrough this year when, through the power of the Chair, the majority \nleader has blocked legislation after legislation, has blocked us moving \nforward with a budget, refusing to allow the committees to move \nforward, and refused to allow the budget even to come up last year.\n  We are now I think 812 days without a budget in the Senate, running \nthe largest deficits the Nation has ever run, and those deficits are \nnot transient. They are not going to turn around when the economy picks \nup a little bit. It is a systemic, deep, structural problem, and we are \nendangering our future. We are being blocked from even being able to \ndiscuss it while people meet in secret over at the White House with the \nVice President, with the President, and a few others meet with a group \nof Senators. Nobody elected them, but they are good people. If they \nwant to meet, that is fine. We need to be seeing legislation, actual \nbills we can take to committee and score and see how much they cost.\n  Being the student of American law and the Constitution as the Senator \nfrom Utah is, and being knowledgeable about common people, does the \nSenator think the American people think there is something wrong with \nthis process, where we have gone all year long and not done anything of \nsignificance to deal with the most significant issue facing our Nation \nmaybe in the next decade, and that is the size of our debt?\n  Mr. LEE. Absolutely. Absolutely. Look, the American people understand \nthat power is most dangerous in government when it is consolidated into \nthe hands of a few people. It becomes even more dangerous when that \npower is wielded under cover of darkness.\n  The great thing about sunlight is it illuminates and it disinfects. \nWe need that illumination and that disinfectant during that process, \nbecause it is corrupt. A process that allows something of such profound \nimportance to be decided by a handful of people, who tell their \ncolleagues: You plebeians don't worry about it; this is for us high-\nminded people; we will decide; you will follow; and we will do it in \nsuch a way that you won't have time to read it, to review it, to debate \nit, to discuss it; this is corrupt, and it has to end.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think what the Senator has said is \nsadly too truthful. I do believe this is a corruption of the process. I \nbelieve it has been happening over a period of time since I have been \nhere. I have seen it happen more and more. Both parties have done a lot \nof this, but I do believe it has reached a new height this year.\n  I think Senator Reid believes in the Senate. I think he respects the \nSenate. I do. But I think he is under constant pressure, and they have \ndecided that--some of his Members, I guess, didn't want to stay here \nthis weekend. They wanted to go home. They had a speech they wanted to \ngive or a party they wanted to attend or a fundraising event they \nwanted to go to, so they don't want to stay here this weekend. Just \nyesterday, I think it was, Senator Reid was complaining about the House \ngoing home this weekend, and promising we would stay here and we would \nwork. Now, all of a sudden, anybody who stays here and wants to vote on \na bill that passed by a substantial majority in the House of \nRepresentatives, he says is acting--he says the bill is anathema to the \nSenate, and senseless, and not worth our time to talk about. How does \nhe get to decide this?\n  Mr. LEE. He gets to decide it only if we allow him to decide it. We \noutnumber him, and if we vote contrary to his will, we can overrule \nhim. If enough Members of this body are willing to stand up for truth \nand justice and the American way, debate and discussion\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nand the rule of law, this thing he is trying to do to us won't happen. \nWe can have actual debate and discussion.\n  We have responded. We have responded politely and well to his \ndirective that we would stay here this weekend. We had made plans. We \nhave canceled plans in our home States. All of a sudden, his high and \nmighty speech earlier this week telling us we had to stay here is no \nlonger important when he disagrees with some legislation we put \nforward. He would rather shut down debate and discussion. He would \nrather end the process that is absolutely necessary to avert this \ncrisis that is quickly coming than he would to have to confront the \nfacts, offer up his own solution and respond to the valid points that \nhave been made in this debate and in this discussion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is an important issue, I think. I really do. I wish \nto make this point: There is only one bill that has passed and been \nadvocated, that is actually on the floor of the Senate, that raises the \ndebt ceiling and changes our debt course in America, and that is the \nbill the Senator from Utah has brought up--the cut, cap, and balance \nbill--the bill he has been so articulately describing and advocating. \nThat is the only bill.\n  They say this is senseless. Well, do you have anything that raises \nthe debt ceiling and does something about the debt of America? Does \nanybody else in the Senate? Or, if they bring it up, will they be \nblocked from bringing it up? I don't see it. The only legislation is \nthis legislation. It is not senseless. It is very significant.\n  When I came to the Senate the first year in 1997, we voted on an \namendment to balance the budget, a constitutional amendment. We thought \nthe votes were there to pass it, taking all the people who voted for it \nand when they said they were going to vote, there were enough votes to \npass it, it appeared, and at the last moment several Senators changed \ntheir vote and it only got 66 votes. Had it had 67, it would have gone \nto the States. I am convinced that balanced budget amendment would have \npassed. Had it passed, we wouldn't be in the financial crisis we are in \ntoday. Now that is a fact, I believe.\n  I don't think this is a senseless process. I believe people--if they \ndon't agree with this legislation, if they don't agree with it, let's \nhear why. But to come down and trash it--trash the Members of the House \nwho voted for it, trash the American people----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To inquire, was there a time limit on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a time limit earlier, and it was 5 \np.m. to 8 p.m. equally divided, and now a Member of the other side is \nhere. All the remaining time has expired for the minority.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. I would \nsay, forgive me if I am a little bit offended. I don't think it is \nwrong to be offended when the majority leader walks in here and says a \npiece of legislation that is critical, I believe, to the future of \nAmerica is senseless, not worth discussing. He changes his mind \nentirely and is going to file a motion. I guess he figures he will have \nthe majority Members of his party who will stick with him and kill off \nthe legislation tomorrow morning. I think it is a very valid piece of \nlegislation, an important piece of legislation, and the only piece of \nlegislation in the Senate that would raise the debt ceiling. I think it \nis worthy of respect, it is worthy of full debate, and ought not to be \ndemeaned in the way it has.\n  I respect my friend, the majority leader. I am sure it is a \nfrustrating job and every now and then you kind of say things maybe you \nwish you hadn't, but I don't think this is a senseless piece of \nlegislation. I think it is important and worthy of the greatest \nconsideration in the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Lee for his efforts to promote it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise tonight to discuss the so-called \ncap, cut, and balance legislation that has come to us from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Congress is a coequal branch of the Federal Government. I have always \nbelieved it is a forum for informed, bipartisan debate of public \npolicies that we all agree should help us achieve greater equality, \nopportunity, and treatment under the law, while nurturing and caring \nfor our young and vulnerable, producing well-paying jobs, and investing \nin the future. That is why I have established good working \nrelationships with my colleagues in both the Senate and the House and \non both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, this legislation abandons \neach of these principles.\n  The challenge facing Congress today is urgent. The stakes are \nextremely high. Congress must raise the debt ceiling to fulfill our \ncommitments and take meaningful steps to reduce our deficits and debt. \nHowever, the policies needed to achieve these goals cannot be \nnegotiated at the expense of the safety net that our seniors, children, \nworking-class, long-term unemployed, and minority communities depend \nupon, nor should they come at the cost of good government.\n  The House legislation falls far short of what is needed. It makes no \npretense to partisanship. On the contrary, it is a model of extreme \nbipartisanship. Moreover, it threatens to turn a recession into a \ndepression. It will cut, cap, and kill Medicare, and it will leave \nmillions of the Nation's sick, disabled, poor, long-term unemployed, \nand elderly to bear an unreasonable share of burden of deficit and debt \nreduction. These are our citizens who are already struggling. \nMeanwhile, the ``cut, cap, and kill'' bill would protect and defend the \ntax havens and shelters of the wealthiest.\n  The balanced budget amendment portion of this legislation would do \neven more long-term harm. It would make future periods of economic \nweakness worse and restrict our ability to respond. Even though we all \nknow it is not a part of the regular Federal budget, it would use \nSocial Security revenues and spending as part of the formula to \ndetermine whether the Federal budget is in balance and, if not, Social \nSecurity would be subjected to the same cuts as other Federal spending. \nWe cannot forget that an important reason Americans expect us to fix \nour debt and deficit is to preserve and protect their Social Security \nand Medicare benefits.\n  I will continue to work to preserve our Nation's social safety net \nand seek a balance between raising revenues and cutting spending in \nwhich all Americans contribute to the solution.\n  That said, I will oppose the House bill because it will not do any of \nthat. This legislation was quickly and poorly considered. It leaves the \nvulnerable exposed to harm and seeks to weaken Congress's power to \ngovern. I cannot support it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2560, \nwith time allotted to the majority.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wished to come to the floor \nthis evening to join a number of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle who are concerned about the Federal budget and our ever-\nincreasing deficits and debt.\n  But today I am also speaking on behalf of the 4.5 million Coloradans \nwho are worried we will not have the discipline to do anything about \nit. They know our great Nation will not win the global economic race \nunless we take some responsible action on the floor of the Senate and \nsoon.\n  I have to say, I do not think the debate we have been having offers \nthem a whole lot of solace. I say that because instead of getting to \nwork on the bipartisan Gang of 6 deficit reduction plan, which draws \nfrom the President's bipartisan fiscal commission, headed by--I have to \nsay this--two true American patriots, former Senator Alan\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nSimpson and North Carolinian Erskine Bowles, instead of getting onto \nthat plan and the substantive proposal it makes, we are debating what \nlooks to be a bumper sticker campaign gimmick called cut, cap, and \nbalance. I have a hard time even saying it.\n  But I have to say, I have spent a good deal of time analyzing budget \ntools. After all, I was one of the first--and one of currently only a \nfew--Democratic Senators who signed on to a balanced budget amendment \nto our Constitution this Congress.\n  I have also been fighting for many years for other smart budgeting \ntools, including pay-as-you-go budgeting, a line-item veto, and a ban \non earmarks, which would help reduce waste and rein in Federal \nspending.\n  But let me be clear that cut, cap, and balance is not about balancing \nthe Federal budget because when we read the bill, it becomes clear it \nis simply about ideology. While the name of the bill seems reasonable \nenough--it is conveniently designed literally to fit on a bumper \nsticker--the language of the bill does not represent a balanced \napproach to deficit and debt reduction, and for that reason alone I \ncannot support it.\n  As I said, I have supported the idea of a balanced budget amendment, \neven though a number--maybe I should say most--of our caucus has \nopposed the idea. However, the balanced budget amendment contained in \ncut, cap, and balance is not about balance. It is about locking in--if \nwe look at it--special interest tax breaks for corporations and the \nwealthy, which would then force Draconian program cuts that would harm \nour Nation's middle class, not to mention the most vulnerable in our \ncommunities all across our country.\n  I have to say, this is not a balanced way to pursue deficit \nreduction. It makes a balanced budget nearly impossible to achieve when \nwe get into the guts of this idea because it ties literally one hand \nbehind our back by preventing the Congress from closing wasteful \nspecial interest tax breaks.\n  In addition, the bill in front of us holds the increase in the debt \nlimit hostage. The debt limit needs to be raised by August 2 to avoid a \nfirst ever government default on our debt obligations. Cut, cap, and \nbalance dictates that the debt limit cannot be increased until Congress \napproves a constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  Even if one is the most optimistic person in the world, a scenario \nfor passage, ratification, and implementation of a balanced budget \namendment shows it is unlikely to take effect for at least 10 years--10 \nyears--not 10 days, 10 years.\n  I have always maintained that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution--which, again, I wish to mention I support--should be a \nbackstop put in place only after we have made the tough decisions about \nreducing our spiraling deficits in the here and now.\n  If we were to tie our Nation's obligations to pay its bills to the \npassage of a one-sided and partisan balanced budget amendment, that \nwould be bad enough as it is. But cut, cap, and balance would also lead \nto severe--severe--cuts in Social Security and Medicare, and it would \nactually lock in billions of dollars in tax breaks currently in our Tax \nCode which benefit the wealthiest citizens as well as Big Oil and \ncorporations that have spent decades shipping jobs overseas.\n  This is such an egregious proposal that I have a sneaking suspicion \nit was not actually designed to pass the Senate. I believe it was \ndesigned to be a campaign gimmick because it certainly does nothing to \naddress the problems we face right here and now, which is the looming \ndefault of our government, the U.S. Government.\n  Let me be clear--and I think the public has begun to understand \nthis--raising our debt limit is not about future spending or paying for \nmore government; it is about paying our previous bills. Business \nleaders, economists, rating agencies, and especially Treasury Secretary \nGeithner have told us our credit rating, were we to default, would take \nyears to rebuild and that our country would never be the same if we \nwere to default on our debt.\n  You know this, Mr. President. You are a businessman. We cannot ask \nfor a do-over, a mulligan, if we default on our debt. We cannot say: \nOh, we were just kidding. This is truly the real deal.\n  I wish to share some ways we would be directly affected by a \ngovernment default. Paychecks for soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq and \nat bases around the world conceivably would not go out. FAA towers \ncould shut down. Border crossings could close. Operations at the FBI \nand the CIA would be put at risk. Safety inspections of the food we eat \nand the cargo that enters our ports could halt.\n  The resulting spike in interest rates would ironically make our debt \neven harder to tackle because each 1-percent rise in interest rates \nalone would result in $130 billion in increased interest payments on \nour national debt each year.\n  Perhaps most important, hard-working American families would also \nfeel the crunch. A spike in interest rates would effectively force a \ntax on all Americans and American businesses due to increased consumer \ncosts. As important, failure to raise the debt limit would lock up \ncredit markets because the United States would no longer be seen as a \nreliable credit risk.\n  Coincidentally, yesterday, an important consumer protection law, \nwhich Senator Lugar and I introduced and passed--and the Presiding \nOfficer helped us with on the floor last year--went into effect. It \nprovides Americans with free access to their credit scores, which is so \nimportant to understanding their own credit risk.\n  FICO--this is some good news in a day that has a few dark clouds \nhanging over it--FICO has estimated as many as 500 million credit \nscores will be given to Americans for free each year because of this \nimportant bipartisan law.\n  In working on this legislation, I learned a lot about credit scores: \nwhat they mean, how they are calculated, and how critical they are to \neconomic success. But--and I am tying this back to our discussion \ntoday--it got me wondering, what would America's credit score look like \nif we defaulted on our debt? Nearly two-thirds of a credit score is \nbased on an individual's total debt and payment history.\n  So here is how I think our great Nation would score if we do not \nraise the debt limit by August 2. We all know our debt is spiraling out \nof control. That is demerit No. 1. But if we now also are unwilling to \npay our debts--demerit No. 2--we will be left with the credit score of \na deadbeat.\n  I do not think that is the way we see ourselves or want to see \nourselves in the 21st century's global economic race. We want to be at \nthe head of the pack. We want to win that race. But to see ourselves as \na deadbeat, that is not what America represents to me. It certainly is \nnot the way Coloradans see us.\n  The people see this very clearly. They are ahead of us. They \nunderstand the risks we face. I wish to share a couple letters that \nColoradans got into my hands just this last week.\n  Sarah Jane wrote me last week, and she was to the point. She said:\n\n       Dear Senator, I am furious about the games being played \n     with the debt ceiling. This is really abusive to this \n     country.\n\n  Another Coloradan, Nicholas, sent me an e-mail that said:\n\n       Dear Senator Udall, Republicans are calling for big cuts to \n     vital programs and refusing to increase revenue. This is \n     lunacy. As a native Coloradan, I and most others here work \n     for a living. We don't own yachts, planes, or mansions. The \n     thought of Republicans gutting the social safety net in order \n     to prevent millionaires and billionaires from paying a little \n     extra tax makes me wonder what we really value in this \n     country.\n\n  I could not agree more. We have some tough choices to make, but some \nMembers of Congress are so lost in their ideological rhetoric that \nfinding an agreement on our deficits and debt seems out of reach. It \nfeels to me--I truly do not want to say this, but it feels to me as if \nsome of our colleagues would be perfectly fine with shutting down the \nFederal Government out of the belief it has grown too large. They \nbelieve a catastrophic shock to the system is the only remedy.\n  But I have to say, our fiscal imbalances are not caused by the things \nthey keep saying they want to cut. Foreign aid, Federal salaries, and \nother programs are a tiny percentage of overall spending. In fact, \nAppropriations Chairman Inouye, the dean of the Senate, the President \npro tempore of the Senate, noted last week that ``in constant dollars, \nadjusted for population growth, non-defense discretionary\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\nspending is at the same level in Fiscal Year 2011 as it was in Fiscal \nYear 2001, when the Federal Government ran a $128 billion surplus.''\n  The fact is, our fiscal imbalances are caused by three historical \nirregularities: record low revenues, an increasingly aging population, \nand heightened security needs in the wake of September 11. They each \ndemand thoughtful and balanced solutions, and only a bipartisan deal \nwill get us those balanced solutions.\n  I have to say, no matter how much bloated rhetoric we hear, there is \none simple fact; that is, we are all in this together. But it seems to \nme often--and unfortunately--we are in the same canoe paddling \nfuriously upstream away from the waterfall behind us off our stern, but \nhalf our crew has thrown their paddles overboard in protest.\n  I do not get it. I do not understand it. What is so agonizing is that \nwe have a bipartisan solution right in front of us. As I mentioned at \nthe beginning of my remarks, I was thrilled to see the Gang of 6 this \nweek report a responsible, balanced, and very bipartisan agreement. I \ndo not agree with every aspect of it. I do believe, however, that the \nplan would responsibly reduce our debt and protect our middle class, \nwhile also allowing our economy--not only allowing but incenting our \neconomy to grow.\n  This plan has already received bipartisan support--not just here but \nacross the country. It is my feeling rather than arguing we ought to be \nacting on those recommendations. Many of us just want to get to work. \nIt is hot here. We have taken our jackets off and can roll up our \nsleeves. I know there are Members on both sides of the aisle who share \nthat sentiment even if others here are demanding they remain quiet \nabout it.\n  There is no question that the fiscal challenges in front of us demand \na bipartisan solution, but the clock is running, the sand is rapidly \nrunning out of the hour glass, and we have to get to work on making the \nnecessary changes to get our fiscal house and its foundation in order.\n  Frankly, some issues should rise above partisanship, politics and \ncampaigns--our country's economic and national security. By the way, \nthe two are linked. Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen--the Presiding \nOfficer and I serve on the Armed Services Committee--made it very clear \nthat they see one of our biggest threats as the country's fiscal \nsituation. A broke country is going to be a weak country. So our \neconomy and national security fall in the category that ought to be \nabove politics and partisanship.\n  Cut, cap, and balance is wrong for our country. It represents more \ndivisiveness, way too much gamesmanship, and more politics. Let's \nlisten to our constituents. I shared letters from two of them from my \nState of Colorado who are pleading with us to get to work and focus our \nattention on the sensible, bipartisan Gang of 6 plan.\n  Let's combine it with a debt limit increase to ward off default and \nwork together and pass it into our laws before our national credit \nrating is downgraded and it damages our chances of winning the global \neconomic race.\n  That is what Coloradans are expecting of me, and that is what I \nexpect of the 100 of us who are so fortunate enough to serve in the \nSenate. I am not being dramatic. I am not a particularly dramatic \nindividual. But I have to tell the Presiding Officer and my colleagues \nthat I think nothing less than the fate of the U.S. economy hangs in \nthe balance.\n  I am willing to stay here day and night, weekends, holidays, to help \nput a long-term balanced and bipartisan plan in motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Bruce Sundlun\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \ndebt ceiling that is rapidly approaching. But on this particular day, I \ncannot come to the floor and speak about anything without just making \none, I guess I would say, note of personal privilege; that is, that \ntoday is a particularly sad day in my home State of Rhode Island \nbecause one of the great Rhode Islanders has passed away.\n  Former Gov. Bruce Sundlun, whom I worked for for many years and \nformed a very devoted affection for has died peacefully at home with \nhis family after one of the most accomplished and eventful lives in \nRhode Island history.\n  I know my senior Senator, Jack Reed, and I will be back on the floor \nat a later time to give Gov. Bruce Sundlun his proper due and \nrecognition. But for all he has meant to me, for all he has meant to \nour State of Rhode Island, for all he has meant to the people whose \nlives have been made so much better or who have been protected from \nvery bad outcomes by his courage and by his determination, I simply \ncould not overlook that at this point. So more will follow on my dear \nfriend, Bruce Sundlun.\n  So to the matter at hand. Less than 2 weeks from now, our Nation is \ngoing to hit its statutory borrowing limit, and it may begin, for the \nfirst time in its history, defaulting on its obligations.\n  Unless we act very soon, the Treasury of the United States of \nAmerica, long the issuer of the safest and the most conservative \nsecurities in the world, will simply run out of money. Social Security \nchecks, as the President has already said, would be at risk. Millions \nof American families would suddenly lose their household income. The \nTreasury would have to suddenly stop paying more than 4 out of every 10 \nFederal dollars, choking off all the economic activity supported by \nthose funds.\n  Private sector projects across the country that depend on Federal \ndollars or Federal permits or Federal regulatory approval, all would \ngrind to a halt--a catastrophic triple whammy on our economic activity.\n  In addition, an increase in interest rates would likely freeze \ninvestments and cause the financial markets to plummet. So reaching the \ndecent limit will not just put us back into recession, it would risk \neconomic calamity. With the stakes so high and with time so short, it \nis unfortunate that the House Republicans who created this completely \nunnecessary crisis have sent us this so-called cut, cap, and balance \nbill.\n  This bill, which cuts no tax loopholes, not one, and puts no cap on \ncorporations offshoring jobs or earnings and dodging U.S. taxes, would \ndo one thing: It would kill Medicare. Consistent with the Republican \n2012 budget, this bill puts the costs of deficit reduction right down \non those who can least afford it: senior citizens, the disabled, and \nour children.\n  The cut, cap, and kill Medicare plan the House Republicans have \nproposed would begin with steep cuts to Federal programs in 2011, while \nwe are still in this recession, slashing domestic spending by over $111 \nbillion, and eliminating 700,000 jobs from our economy when we need \nthem the most.\n  It would also require immediate cuts to social safety net programs \nlikely reducing--or eliminating even--student loans, Pell grants, \nschool lunches, Medicaid, and food stamps, some of the most important \nprograms to families who are struggling to get back on their feet \nduring this prolonged period of high unemployment. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The second part of the cut, cap, and kill Medicare bill would limit \nFederal spending beyond 2012 to levels significantly lower than during \nthe Reagan Presidency. In fact, our Nation has not seen spending at \nthose low levels since 1966. Mr. President, 1966 was a time when only \n9.2 percent of the population was retired and drawing benefits, \ncompared with 12.9 percent today.\n  So the effects of those spending levels would be even harsher. The \ncap on Medicare and Social Security makes no adjustment for the $2.5 \ntrillion of Social Security reserves that Americans have paid into that \nsystem, that the government then went and borrowed. It makes no \nadjustment for that being their money or for the aging population that \nwe are experiencing.\n  So with a fixed cap, and baby boomers retiring in greater numbers, \nthe Republican plan forces devastating cuts to Social Security and \nMedicare benefits. There is simply no other way. It would address our \ndeficit in the worst way possible, by taking an axe to the retirement \nprograms on which tens of millions of retired Americans rely and which \nmost every working person in America looks forward to.\n  For ordinary Americans, this approach is wrong. Frankly, it is \nunthinkable, although it is the goal of a few determined extremists who \nare\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\ndriving things within the House Republican Party.\n  Finally, the cut, cap, and kill Medicare bill would hold the debt \nlimit hostage to an extremist constitutional amendment that has been \nwidely criticized, even by many responsible voices on the right. If \nthis dangerous constitutional amendment were to pass, the Congress of \nthe United States would be unable to respond to an economic or national \nsecurity emergency without steep supermajority votes, giving even more \nleverage to small extremist factions in Congress, as if it is not clear \nthat is already not too much of a problem.\n  As dangerous, this constitutional amendment--this is hard to \nbelieve--this constitutional amendment would make it easier to cut \nMedicare and Social Security benefits than to take away tax subsidies \nfrom Big Oil, from offshoring corporations, and from billionaires. It \nwould make it easier, as a matter of law, to cut Social Security and \nMedicare benefits than it would be to go after these special interest \ncorporate tax loopholes and the gimmicks that allow billionaires to pay \nlower tax rates than truck drivers in this country.\n  It builds a constitutional preference for corporate and special \ninterest loopholes into our Constitution, a Constitution renowned \naround the world for its commitment to equality. Into this great \ndocument that has shown the light of equality around the world, we \nwould build a preference for corporate special interests over working \npeople and the retirements they count on.\n  Constitutional amendments traditionally move this country forward. \nThis would be a colossal step back. In summary, adding all those \ndifferent features of the cut, cap and kill Medicare bill together, the \nRepublicans in the House would require such severe spending cuts that \nthe only way to achieve them--the only way to achieve them--would be \nto, in fact, get rid of Medicare as we know it and slash Social \nSecurity benefits for seniors.\n  It would hurt those who depend on government the most, while giving \nspecial protection to special interests and corporations with tax \nloopholes and subsidies that permit them to pay lower tax rates than \nmiddle-class families--in some cases, with some of our most profitable \ncorporations--no taxes at all. That is what gets protected.\n  House Republicans know their cut, cap and kill Medicare plan has zero \nchance of passing the Senate. It is not going to happen--not now, not \never. It has already drawn a veto threat from President Obama. \nNevertheless, as this deadline looms closer and closer, with those \nterrible consequences portending, the House Republican extremists have \nforced this piece of political theater while ignoring serious and \nconstructive proposals for deficit reduction such as Budget Committee \nchairman Kent Conrad's plan, which would reduce deficits by $4 \ntrillion, more than the House's budget plan. We actually do better at \nsolving the deficit than they do. But we do it with every dollar in \nspending cuts matched by a dollar in new revenue from closing tax \nloopholes and tax gimmicks. This plan would stabilize the budget and \nwould reassure the financial markets, and would do so without cutting \nSocial Security and Medicare benefits on which our seniors rely and \nwhich all working Americans are counting on. It is one of the basic \nfreedoms we have as Americans--to know that that is waiting for us.\n\n  I was proud to introduce a resolution earlier this month which would \nexpress the sense of the Senate that ``any agreement to reduce the \nbudget deficit should not include cuts to Social Security benefits or \nMedicare benefits.'' I am grateful to Senators Blumenthal, Sherrod \nBrown, Merkley, Franken, Boxer, and Gillibrand who have joined with me \non the resolution, and I invite all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  The Conrad budget proves that we need not attack Medicare and Social \nSecurity to deal with our deficit. His budget is living proof that \nthere is no reason to attack Medicare and Social Security to get \nthrough our deficit situation. That attack on Medicare and Social \nSecurity is a willful and unnecessary act by the Republicans.\n  Well, Rhode Islanders, in increasing numbers, have been writing to me \nurging me to continue fighting to preserve these retirement programs, \nto preserve this infrastructure of American freedom. Time is running \nshort, and Americans are counting on their elected representatives to \ndo the right thing. It is time to do the right thing.\n  Let me close by reading a piece from an editorial in The Economist \nmagazine. The Economist is a very conservative publication, and it is \nvery much in favor of free markets. I would say, by and large, it is a \nRepublican journal. Here is what The Economist said about the situation \nwe are in now:\n\n       The sticking point is not on the spending side. It is \n     because the vast majority of Republicans, driven on by the \n     wilder eyed members of their party and the cacophony of \n     conservative media, are clinging to the position that not a \n     single cent of deficit reduction must come from a higher tax \n     take. This is economically illiterate and disgracefully \n     cynical . . . even Ronald Reagan raised taxes when he needed \n     to do so. And the closer you look, the more unprincipled the \n     Republicans look. Earlier this year, House Republicans \n     produced a report noting that an 85 percent to 15 percent \n     split between spending cuts and tax rises was the average for \n     successful fiscal consolidations, according to historical \n     evidence. The White House is offering an 83 percent to 17 \n     percent split (hardly a huge distance) and a promise that \n     none of the revenue increase will come from higher marginal \n     rates, only from eliminating loopholes. If the Republicans \n     were real tax reformers, they would seize this offer. Both \n     parties have in recent months been guilty of fiscal \n     recklessness. Right now, though, the blame falls clearly on \n     the Republicans. Independent voters should take note.\n\n  So it is not just Democratic Senators coming to the floor to point \nout that the crisis we are at is an unnecessary one. It is a \nmanufactured crisis, a crisis driven by extremism, and it is a crisis \nthat threatens the survival of Medicare and Social Security--two \ncornerstone programs in the economic security and in the freedom of \nordinary Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4795-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Elaine Hays, \nwhose story has been chosen to be recorded as part of the London, KY \n``Living Treasures'' project.\n  Born in Elkhorn City, KY, on March 19, 1924, Mrs. Hays has lived in \nand been a part of the Kentucky community her entire life, and has \ncalled London home since 1949. She is the granddaughter of Austrian and \nGerman immigrants, and even has one ancestor who was on the McCoy side \nof the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud. Growing up in the Floyd County \ncommunity of Betsy Layne, Mrs. Hays saw firsthand the development of \nthe coal mining industry, as well as the devastating effects of the \nGreat Depression.\n  After receiving her degree in home economics from Western Kentucky \nUniversity, Mrs. Hays, sister to three war veterans, opened and \nsubsequently ran a cannery at the Belfry High School in Betsy Layne \nwhere she was already working as a home economics teacher. Mrs. Hays \nwanted to help both the Nation and the families of Betsy Layne during \nthe war by preserving food.\n  Mrs. Hays married her husband Earl in 1947 and taught alongside him \nat Belfry High until 1949. After an extensive interview process, The \nHayses were hired by Sue Bennett College as teachers and program \ndevelopers. Mr. Hays was to set up and run the college's farm which \nsupplied food for the college dining hall, while Mrs. Hays was to \ndevelop a home economics program. In later years, Mrs. Hays became a \n``first lady'' of sorts when Earl was chosen to become president of the \ncollege, a position he filled from 1958 to 1985. In between teaching \nand raising her two sons, Jim and Lon, Mrs. Hays still found the time \nto entertain students and other guests of the college. The eventual \nclosure of Sue Bennett College was a somber day for Mrs. Hays, and her \nfamily alike, but its influence on their lives has been unforgettable.\n  Mrs. Hays retired in 1998 after working in the education field for 55 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nAfter Earl's death in 1999, her retirement has been made happier by her \nthree grandchildren.\n  Kentucky is lucky to have women such as Mrs. Elaine Hays who put \naside their own needs in order to better serve their family and their \ncommunity. It is an honor to record Mrs. Hays' story, for it is a story \nof an outstanding Kentuckian.\n  The Laurel County-area newspaper the Sentinel Echo recently published \nan article detailing the life, accomplishments, and contributions of \nMrs. Hays' life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, June 22, 2011]\n\n                   London's Living Treasures: Part 4\n\n       The last installment of the London Treasures project is the \n     story of Mrs. Elaine Hays, who shares rich memories of her \n     mountain heritage and her life as the president's wife at Sue \n     Bennett College. Mrs. Hays is a very faceted, elegant woman \n     who has spent her life learning and teaching others.\n       ``I am Elaine Hays, oldest child and only daughter of Lou \n     and Elizabeth Weber Roberts. My three brothers and I spent \n     our childhood in the coal mining areas of Pike and Floyd \n     counties. We all have a strong sense of home, our origins and \n     a strong loyalty to family.\n       I was born on March 19, 1924, in Elkhorn City, Ky., on an \n     island in the middle the Russell Fork of the Big Sandy River. \n     My grandmother Ida Eiler Weber, an Austrian emigrant, ran a \n     hotel there for tourists and mining officials. She came to \n     New York City and met Thomas Edward Weber, whom she later \n     married. Tom was from Magdeburg, Germany. As he read, wrote \n     and spoke several languages, he was hired by large coal \n     companies to meet the boats at Ellis Island and hire \n     immigrants to work in the coal-fields of Ohio, Virginia, West \n     Virginia and, Kentucky. He became a mining superintendent and \n     many of the miners followed him from one place to the next; \n     Elkhorn City being the last. Mamaw, as we called my \n     grandmother, was a wonderful cook and loved to dance, \n     especially polkas and waltzes. My grandfather traveled a lot \n     and was an avid reader. He kept us supplied with books and \n     piano rolls for the player piano. My mother sang beautifully \n     and sang for audiences at the local movie theatre while they \n     were changing the old movie reels.\n       My parents married in Elkhorn City in 1923. My father, Lou, \n     was the son of Ricely and Caroline Ratliff Roberts. His \n     mother died after the birth of her eleventh child, a sad fate \n     of many mountain women. Grandfather Ricely was primarily a \n     logger. He and his older sons would clear ``new ground'' and \n     raft the logs down the Big Sandy River to Catlettsburg or \n     Ashland. When I was 8 years old, I rode horseback with him to \n     visit his family. He lived in a big, two-story log house. My \n     father's great-grandmother was Cherokee and his grandmother \n     was Maryetta McCoy Roberts, of the infamous Hatfield-McCoy \n     feud.\n       My dad had a great respect for women and believed they \n     should be well-educated and work for equal wages. My mother \n     owned a grocery store and eventually get into the restaurant \n     business and he supported her in those efforts.\n       The first 10 years of my life there was always one, \n     sometimes two, of Dad's sisters living with us and going to \n     high school. In the mountains during the 30s, high schools \n     were only in county seat towns or larger towns. Children \n     living up creeks and hollows had to live away from home to go \n     to high school.\n       We moved from Elkhorn City to Hellier, a dusty little \n     mining village. We played in polluted creeks, catching \n     minnows and crawdads. We roamed the nearby hills. We also \n     picked up every disease, including diphtheria. In Hellier, we \n     saw miners go to work before daylight and return after dark, \n     always with carbide lamps on their caps. I was impressed with \n     the big commissary owned by the coal company where miner's \n     families purchased food, clothing and household goods. My \n     mother told me we couldn't afford to trade at the company \n     store.\n       We moved to Betsy Layne in Floyd County when I was in \n     seventh grade. Betsy Layne was a nice community with two \n     hollows where there was a big mine and where the miners \n     lived. It was owned by the Pittsburgh Coal Company. One \n     excellent thing that mining companies did was to support the \n     school programs. At Betsy Layne, the emphasis was music. We \n     had music every day through the eighth grade. The high school \n     had band, orchestra, girl's glee club, men's glee club and \n     various trios and quartets. Athletes all participated in the \n     glee club.\n       Many evenings, our band director gathered the neighborhood \n     band members and came to our home. We played our instruments \n     and sang. Mother provided refreshments. Betsy Lane had been \n     our favorite place to live. I was greatly influenced by my \n     family's love of music and their heritage. When I was a \n     teenager, my grandmother moved to Brooklyn and I visited her \n     there in the summers in the 1930s. She took me to Radio City, \n     Statue of Liberty, Battery Park Aquarium, Metropolitan Museum \n     of Art and History and to many ethnic restaurants.\n       My most formative years were in Betsy Layne. It was during \n     the Depression and there was so much unemployment. My dad \n     always had a job, but the whole family had to work to make \n     ends meet. We didn't have a car, but travel was convenient as \n     there were four passenger trains a day that stopped at Betsy \n     Lane. My brothers and dad raised a big garden and mother \n     canned and preserved food. I helped string beans and thread \n     them on a string and hung them to dry for ``shuckie'' beans. \n     We hung them to dry rather than drying them flat. We had a \n     cow and the boys cared for her and did the milking. I learned \n     early how to churn and make butter and cottage cheese. Mother \n     shared the milk from the cow with less fortunate neighbors. \n     Mother was a great cook, but didn't cook as most mountain \n     women did. She used cookbooks and measured ingredients. She \n     taught me basic cooking terms and at 12 years old, I could \n     cook a simple summer meal that would probably be green cooked \n     with new potatoes on top, slaw and cornbread. We seldom fried \n     anything. Mother broiled meat, except chicken, which she \n     fried. In November and December, the making of fruitcakes was \n     a family project. My brothers cracked and shelled pecans and \n     Mother and I cut up candied fruits. I have continued the \n     fruit cake tradition and have sent them to my brothers for \n     Christmas for over 50 years--Mother's recipe, of course. She \n     had the newest kitchen tools just as my grandmother did \n     always and served food attractively and used parsley to \n     garnish it. It was my job to set the table and make it look \n     pretty and I still enjoy doing that. My mother was a great \n     influence in choosing my college major of home economics. In \n     1982, I wrote a cookbook called ``Along the Way'' that had \n     recipes from three generations of my family and those from \n     many friends as well. The book has travelled through several \n     generations since that time.\n       My brothers had lot of chores and all of us developed a \n     strong work ethic in those years. The boys would dig ginseng \n     and sell it for spending money. Though we all worked, we had \n     good play times and there was always a baseball game going \n     on. I played on the teams with the boys and we all played \n     tennis on clay courts on the high school playground that was \n     just across the street from our home.\n       Dad helped us daily with our studies, checked our homework \n     and taught us what we didn't understand. It was very \n     important to him that his children did well in school and he \n     encouraged the neighborhood kids to attend school, too. In \n     fact, he bought baseball equipment and kept it with him at \n     the C depot where he worked. After school, the neighborhood \n     boys would go to the depot and get the bats and gloves and \n     play ball. During World War II, he received many letters from \n     those boys telling him they were glad he had encouraged them \n     to stay in school. Dad realized his dream of having college-\n     educated children. I went to Western Kentucky University and \n     majored in Home Economics. Gerald graduated from Annapolis \n     Naval Academy and became a commander. Lon Edward graduated \n     from Pikeville college, University of Virginia, and \n     University of Louisville Medical School and practiced \n     medicine. Gene had three years of college and became a county \n     commissioner in Titusville Florida. My three brothers served \n     in World War II, Vietnam and the Korean War.''\n       In the summer of 1940, I had just graduated from high \n     school and Earl Hays, the man who later became my husband, \n     just out of Berea College, came to Betsy Layne to teach \n     agriculture. I would see him often when I was home on \n     vacation from Western. The war years came along and he \n     enlisted in the Army. In the meantime, I graduated from \n     Western in 1943 and went to Belfry, Pike County, to teach \n     home economics.\n       Belfry High School was fairly large and I taught 120 \n     freshman girls. In the summer of 1944, I went to University \n     of Kentucky to learn how to operate a community cannery. I \n     didn't stay in Belfry, but went to Betsy Layne to teach home \n     economics. The ag teacher and I set up and operated a \n     community cannery. It was part of the national war effort to \n     help families preserve their own food.\n       Earl came back from the Army to Betsy Layne in 1945. We \n     dated a year and a half and were married December, 1947. Earl \n     and I were very compatible and had the same values. He was \n     one of the kindest and most thoughtful men that I have ever \n     known. Our wedding was a community affair. Our students \n     decorated the small church with fresh greenery and candles. \n     Our friends gave the reception and Mother baked a gorgeous \n     wedding cake.\n       We taught at Betsy Lane High School until 1949. It is \n     interesting how we came to London and Sue Bennett College. \n     Our Methodist minister was at the annual Methodist Conference \n     and met Oscie Sanders, president of Sue Bennett. She said, \n     ``Bob, I'm looking for an agriculture and home economics \n     teacher and preferably a married couple.'' He said, ``I know \n     just the couple.'' After much communication and several \n     interviews, we were employed to come here. Earl was to \n     supervise the college farm which supplied food for the \n     college dining hall and I was to set up a home economics \n     program.\n       Earl was born and raised in McKee, Ky., but his mother's \n     family was from London. His grandfather, Creed Russell, had a \n     general store about where Porters store is now and his \n     grandmother, Ellen Hale Russell, named the post office at \n     Lida and was postmistress there for many years.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\n       In the early 1950s, we began attending University of \n     Kentucky on Saturdays and summers. Earl's emphasis of study \n     was horticulture and mine was child care and family living. \n     We received our master's degrees in 1953.\n       Earl supervised the farm but gradually it and the dairy was \n     discontinued. He became dean of students, taught basic \n     horticulture classes and did public relations. I taught \n     orientation, folk dancing, and later home economics courses. \n     My favorite two courses were Marriage and Family and \n     Appalachian Sociology--which I developed. These courses were \n     the result of my taking graduate courses from UK in \n     Appalachian history and culture. I continued taking classes \n     in guidance and counseling and became certified in that \n     field.\n       Our son, Jim, was born in 1954, and in 1957, our son Lon \n     was born. Both of them later attended Sue Bennett College. \n     Their background at Sue Bennett College served them well. Jim \n     became a biologist, and Lon, a psychiatrist.\n       Earl became president in 1958 after President Oscie Sanders \n     retired. Upon his retirement in 1985, he had served in that \n     capacity longer than any other Kentucky junior college \n     president. A new president's home was built in 1960, and we \n     moved on campus.\n       Unkowingly, when Earl became president, I became an \n     unofficial hostess. I enjoyed having students and visitors in \n     our home. Some of our happiest Thanksgiving dinners were when \n     foreign students were with us. We and our sons met and \n     enjoyed many interesting people.\n       In 1977, I left Sue Bennett as a teacher and became the \n     first guidance counselor for adult students at Laurel County \n     State Vo-Tech. I enjoyed working with adult vocational \n     students. It was as if I had made the full cycle in \n     vocational education.\n       Earl retired in 1985 and we moved to our retirement home \n     just off campus. The campus was a great place to raise our \n     sons. They enjoyed the students and college activities and I \n     appreciate the great influence Sue Bennett College had on our \n     family.\n       After working in the education field for 55 years, I \n     retired in 1998. My retirement years have been made happier \n     with my three grandchildren. My oldest grandchild, Lon \n     Stuart, and his wife Alina are both attorneys. Karolyn \n     graduated from Centre College this year and he sister, \n     Kathryn, will be a sophomore at Centre this fall. London has \n     been a great place for my to continue living after my \n     retirement and Earl's death in 1999.\n       Any time I'm in town, I see and chat with many former \n     students. The greatest joy from teaching is seeing former \n     students succeed. I always feel surrounded by friends.\n       I am still a part of a group of friends that we met the \n     summer we came to London. Though the group has expanded and \n     decreased through the 62 years. the original ones still have \n     dinner together monthly. That's friendship.\n       I think one of the saddest days for my family and Laurel \n     County was the closing of Sue Bennett College. Earl and I and \n     my sons feel privileged to have been a part of the college, \n     which played a huge role in the development of our entire \n     region.\n       It has been a joy to have been acquainted with people who \n     have worked hard to improve our area. The beautification \n     efforts on Main Street and those who are working for historic \n     preservation are just the latest examples. I truly love the \n     people of London-Laurel County and have enjoyed making this \n     our home since 1949.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4797-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4797-S4798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we mark today the first anniversary of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law was \nCongress's earnest attempt to answer a vital question: How do we avoid \na repeat of the financial catastrophe from which we are still \nstruggling to recover?\n  I would like to describe the findings of our Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations report on the origins of the financial crisis, and \nhow those findings informed my thinking and that of some of our \ncolleagues about how to address Wall Street reform and design effective \nlegislation. Then I would like to talk about a specific provision in \nthe Dodd-Frank Act that my colleague, Jeff Merkley, and I--as well as \nSenator Reed and others--fought hard to include in Dodd-Frank, and why \nI believe that provision has the potential to remedy key failings of \nour financial system that helped contribute to the financial crisis. \nAnd then a few minutes on how, at the law's 1 year anniversary, we are \nfighting a second battle, just as important as the first, on how to \nimplement Dodd-Frank.\n  Many of my colleagues, and particularly Republican colleagues \nsubscribe to the view that banks and the market know best. It is the \nsame view espoused by those who told us in the 1990s that we should \nderegulate finance, give free rein to so-called financial innovation, \nand place our trust in the belief that the market was ``self-\ncorrecting.'' It was a big mistake, and it led us to the brink of \neconomic disaster, when only a massive taxpayer bailout of large banks \nprevented a second Great Depression. I can't imagine how one could look \nat those events and come to the conclusion that we need relaxed \nregulations.\n  Our subcommittee reviewed literally tens of millions of documents, \ninterviewed hundreds of witnesses, and held four lengthy hearings. We \nfound that the financial crisis was the result of unchecked greed and \nconflict of interest up and down the line. Financial institutions that \nwere too big to be allowed to fail engaged in reckless risk-taking in \npursuit of massive, but short-term, profits. Government regulators and \ncredit rating agencies, who were supposed to be the cops and \nindependent referees to keep those reckless impulses in check, instead \nallowed or even encouraged them, in part because of their own conflicts \nof interest, which gave them incentive to go along.\n  Our investigation started upstream, with mortgage lending. We looked \nspecifically at Washington Mutual Bank, which was the Nation's largest \nthrift when it began a campaign of aggressive subprime mortgage \nlending, even though the bank's top executives recognized there was an \nunsustainable bubble in housing prices. We found massive evidence of \nfraud in WaMu's lending, fraud that people inside and outside the bank \nrecognized. But bank executives ignored the red flags, allowing WaMu to \nmake its fraudulent and high-risk loans, package those loans, flooding \nthe financial system with toxic mortgages, and led their bank to the \nlargest bank failure in our history.\n  WaMu's primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, utterly \nfailed to stop WaMu's reckless lending, despite identifying and logging \nnearly 500 serious deficiencies at the bank that they were supposed to \nregulate over 5 years, doing nothing about it. The OTS director--\nperhaps out of deference to the fact that fees from WaMu were the \nbiggest single source of OTS's budget--referred to WaMu as a \n``constituent,'' which surely would come as a surprise to his agency's \nreal constituents, the American people, who counted on OTS to walk a \nbeat--and not to toe the WaMu line.\n  WaMu and other banks were aided and abetted in their pollution of the \nfinancial system with toxic securities by credit rating agencies that \nfailed to accurately and objectively assess risks. Our investigation \nexamined ratings failures at Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The \ntestimony of employees of the two firms, corroborated by internal \ndocuments, show that the rating agencies were more focused on growing \nmarket share for themselves and increasing revenues than in improving \nrating accuracy. In other words, their ratings failed in part because \nthey relied for their revenue on the same banks whose products they \nwere supposed to impartially assess, a conflict of interest that led to \nAAA ratings being given to shoddy securities.\n  Wall Street firms facilitated this whole chain of shoddy securities. \nThey were hungry for mortgages, even poor quality mortgages, to package \nand sell, taking in large fees to underwrite these toxic financial \nassets. Some reaped huge returns by trading those assets for their own \nprofit. The subcommittee found that some investment banks, such as \nGoldman Sachs, were engaged in conflicts of interest. Goldman misled \nits clients. It packaged mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to \nrid their own inventory of assets the firm's employees called ``junk,'' \n``crap'' and worse. Goldman Sachs bet secretly against their own \nproducts, bet that they were failed, and not only sold these products \nto unsuspecting clients, but misrepresented their own interest in the \ntransaction.\n  The four hearings we held in the spring of last year laid out this \nevidence in damning detail. Those hearings took place as the Senate was \nconsidering the legislation whose 1 year anniversary we are marking \ntoday.\n  We saw the impact of our hearings on the law. For instance, Dodd-\nFrank did away with the Office of Thrift Supervision, which failed so \ncompletely in the years leading up to the crisis. Dodd-Frank included \nimportant reforms in how credit rating agencies operate and attempted \nto resolve some of\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nthe conflicts of interest that tainted their work by taking steps to \nkeep financial firms from shopping for high ratings.\n  Dodd-Frank tackled abusive mortgage lending in many ways. We banned \nthe ``liar loans'' that WaMu and others issued so recklessly to \nborrowers who provided little or no documentation of their ability to \npay. We required banks to keep some of the mortgage-backed securities \nthey issue on their books rather than making bad loans and selling 100 \npercent of them and the risk they carried. We prohibited banks from \npaying their employees more when they persuade home buyers to take out \nhigh-risk loans. We established a consumer protection agency with \nauthority to police abusive lending.\n  Throughout the debate, I focused in particular on an issue I see as \nthe connecting thread tat ran through our hearings and our report: \nrampant, unchecked conflict of interest. The subcommittee's work showed \nhow time and again, institutions within the financial and regulatory \nsystem chose their own short-term interests over the interests of their \nclients.\n  We found a particularly vivid example in a $2 billion deal called \nHudson Mezzanine issued by Goldman Sachs. Hudson was a collateralized \ndebt obligation--that's a security that references or is backed by a \npool of loans and other assets, in this case mortgage loans. In \nmarketing Hudson to its clients, Goldman told clients that its \ninterests were ``aligned'' with the buyers of the CDO, and that the \nCDO's assets had been ``sourced from the Street,'' in other words \noutside of Goldman. In fact, most of the assets backing Hudson were \nfrom Goldman's own inventory, assets the bank knew were risky and \nwanted to unload. And far from being ``aligned'' with its clients, \nGoldman's position was opposed to its own clients, because it held the \nentire short side of the CDO, making a $2 billion bet that Hudson would \nplunge in value. When it did, Goldman effectively took $2 billion out \nof its clients' pockets and made a handsome profit. And injecting those \njunk securities into the financial system did real damage to that \nsystem.\n  The question of accountability is important here. I have said before, \nit is up to the appropriate authorities, and not to us in the Senate, \nto decide whether those responsible for transactions such as Hudson \nshould be punished. But what I can say is I think it is vitally \nimportant that those authorities address and resolve that question. \nThat is why our subcommittee forwarded our report to law enforcement \nauthorities. They have the job of providing the Nation with the \naccountability that so far has been lacking.\n  The congressional role is legislative. The amendment that Senator \nMerkley and I offered on the Senate floor, known as Merkley-Levin, \ncodified the so-called Volcker rule, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker's \nrecommendation that we rein in proprietary trading by banks. Firms such \nas Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed in part because their \npursuit of short-term profit led them to risky trades that blew up in \ntheir faces. Merkley-Levin says that if you are a commercial bank \nprotected by taxpayer-funded Federal deposit insurance, you can't \nengage in high-risk proprietary trading. Even if you are not a \ntraditional bank, but because of your size, your collapse would damage \nthe stability of the U.S. financial system. You are now required to \nadhere to certain capital requirements and other limitations.\n  Merkley-Levin also breaks new ground in the area of conflict of \ninterest. It explicitly bans the kinds of conflict of interest we saw \nso vividly in Goldman's Hudson transaction. It prohibits firms from \nassembling an asset-backed security and selling it to clients while \nbetting against that same security, acting not as a market-maker, but \nas an investor for its own profit. You are either for your client or \nyou are for yourself.\n  We had to fight hard for Merkley-Levin's passage. When the Senate \npassed its version of Dodd-Frank, Republicans engaged in complicated \nmaneuvers on the floor to block the Senate from even considering our \namendment. But we succeeded in getting it included in the bill produced \nby the House-Senate conference committee, and despite intense lobbying \nby banks against Merkley-Levin, it is now law.\n  But the battle is far from over. Since passage, regulatory agencies \nhave been working to turn the provisions of Dodd-Frank into detailed \nregulations and have been subjected to the same barrage of bank \nlobbying that accompanied our debate in Congress. Banks have spent more \nthan $50 million so far this year lobbying to weaken Dodd-Frank.\n  Consumers and the American economy won an important victory one year \nago today. But that victory will not be secure until Dodd-Frank has \nteeth--tough rules backed by conscientious enforcement. Some are \npulling every trick in the book to slow these regulations and weaken \ntheir impact. But the success we had in passing Dodd-Frank shows that \nthe powerful interests don't always win.\n  Supporters of reform made their voices heard a year ago, and today, \nthey are working to ensure that Dodd-Frank is implemented forcefully. \nThey are telling regulators--many of whom once subscribed to the notion \nthat banks know best--that the American people will not allow a return \nto policies that so recently did so much harm. Just like we need a cop \non the street to enforce the traffic laws, we need a cop on the beat on \nWall Street. Anything less threatens a repeat of disaster.\n  Anything less will also damage confidence in our financial system, \nand we will not have a market that holds the confidence of investors \nand potential investors. That should be everybody's goal. The free \nmarket is incredibly important. We all depend on it for economic \ngrowth. But that market must be honest. That is in the interest of \neveryone. Whether you have invested in the market or thinking about \ninvesting in the market, that is in the interest of the American \npeople. We are not talking about weakening the market--we are talking \nabout strengthening it. And that is just what the Dodd-Frank Act can \naccomplish, if we implement it as Congress intended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4798-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4798-S4799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO HOSPITAL CORPSMAN SECOND CLASS JACOB EMMOTT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional U.S. \nSailor, HM2 Jacob Emmott, known as ``Doc Emmott'' to the marines with \nwhom he serves. ``Doc'' was awarded the Silver Star medal on July 14, \n2011, for his extraordinary bravery and service.\n  Petty Officer Emmott, a resident of Wakefield, RI, served as a \nplatoon corpsman with Company C, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in Helmand \nProvince, Afghanistan. On April 20, 2010, Petty Officer Emmott was on \npatrol with his fellow marines when they began receiving heavy fire \nfrom multiple enemy positions. One of the marines sustained multiple \ngunshot wounds and, with complete disregard for his own personal \nsafety, Petty Officer Emmott rushed through enemy fire to aid the \nfallen marine. While tending to yet another fallen comrade, Petty \nOfficer Emmott sustained a gunshot wound directly to his face, \nrendering him unconscious. After Petty Officer Emmott regained \nconsciousness, he refused morphine in order to supervise the care of \nthe other wounded marines. His courage and dedication to duty rallied \nthe spirits of his squad mates as they were evacuated from the \nbattlefield.\n  The Silver Star Medal is the third-highest military decoration that \ncan be awarded to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces for valor while \nengaged in an action against an enemy. Petty Officer Emmott is clearly \ndeserving of the Silver Star medal for his actions to aid his fellow \nmarines at his own personal risk.\n  I join all Rhode Islanders in expressing deep appreciation and \ngratitude for Petty Officer Emmott's extraordinary commitment and \nservice to our Nation. We also thank his family for their support and \nsacrifice. Congratulations and best wishes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Navy HM2 Jake \nEmmott of Wakefield, Rhode Island for his exceptional service to our \ncountry, which earned him one of our Nation's highest military awards \nfor gallantry during combat. Last week, I had the honor of joining Jake \nand his family as he was presented with the Silver Star Medal for \nheroic acts that went above and beyond the call of duty.\n  On April 20, 2010, Mr. Emmott was serving as platoon corpsman with \nCompany C, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nHelmand Province, Afghanistan. That day, Mr. Emmott's squad was on \ncombat patrol when it came under intense enemy fire. Upon seeing a \nmarine in his squad fall from multiple gunshot wounds, he rushed \nthrough the firefight to provide first aid.\n  Mr. Emmott and other squad members proceeded to transport the injured \nmarine to the casualty collection point, when a second marine was shot \nin the thigh. Mr. Emmott ignored the chaos around him and worked calmly \nto aid the second casualty. After stabilizing the second marine, Mr. \nEmmott was struck directly in the face by a bullet, which pierced his \nsinus cavity and just narrowly missed his carotid artery. The blow \nknocked him unconscious. His squad leader, who saw him get shot, \nthought he was dead.\n  When Mr. Emmott regained consciousness, he refused morphine in order \nto supervise the treatment of the injured marines. Despite difficulty \nspeaking and choking on his own blood, he provided precise instructions \nto another combat lifesaver on how to administer aid to the injured. \nThen, despite excruciating pain, he managed to stagger to the medical \nevacuation helicopter, so that the other injured marines could be \ncarried on stretchers.\n  Today I would like to offer my humble thanks to Mr. Emmott for his \nselfless service, leadership, and courage. We all admire his strength \nand willingness to put others before himself, especially as he faced \nhis own life threatening injuries. He is truly an inspiration and role \nmodel for all Americans. At the young age of 22, he has already \naccomplished feats of excellence that few could do in a lifetime. I \ncommend Mr. Emmott for his unwavering commitment to his comrades and to \nhis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4799-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STENNIS LEADERSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, some 9 years ago, the John C. Stennis Center \nfor Public Service Leadership began a program for summer interns \nworking in congressional offices. This 6-week program is designed to \nenhance their internship experience by giving them an inside view of \nhow Congress really works. Each week, the interns meet with senior \ncongressional staff and other experts to discuss issues ranging from \nthe legislative process, to the influence of the media and lobbyists on \nCongress, to careers on Capitol Hill, and more.\n  Interns are selected for this program based on their college record, \ncommunity service experience, and interest in a career in public \nservice. This year, 25 outstanding interns, most of them juniors and \nseniors in college who are working for Democrats and Republicans in \nboth the House and Senate have taken part.\n  I congratulate the interns for their involvement in this valuable \nprogram and I thank the Stennis Center and the senior Stennis fellows \nfor providing such a meaningful experience for these interns and for \nencouraging them to consider a future career in public service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of 2011 Stennis congressional \ninterns and the offices in which they work be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Matthew Becker, attending the University of Mary, interning \n     in the office of Senator John Hoeven\n       William Bergstrom, attending Harvard College, interning in \n     the office of Senator John Hoeven\n       Kathleen Bouzis, attending the University of Wyoming, \n     interning in the office of Senator Mike Enzi\n       Tyler Brandt, attending the University of Wisconsin-\n     Madison, interning in the Senate Special Committee on Aging\n       Andrew Bunker, attending Wake Forest University, interning \n     in the Office of The Speaker\n       Jessica Casperson, attending the University of Wisconsin-\n     Oshkosh, interning in the office of Senator Herb Kohl\n       Kaitlin Chandler, attending Boston University, interning in \n     the office of Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach \n     Committee\n       Andrew Clauw, attending the University of Michigan, \n     interning in the office of Representative Hansen Clarke\n       Todd Garland, attending Louisville Law School, interning in \n     the office of Representative Geoff Davis\n       Sarah Gokey, attending Smith College, interning in the \n     office of Senator Kent Conrad\n       Emily Holman, attending Miami University, interning in the \n     office of Representative Tammy Baldwin\n       Mark Kauzlarich, attending the University of Wisconsin-\n     Madison, interning in the office of Senator Herb Kohl\n       Aubrey Lauersdorf, attending the University of Wisconsin-\n     Madison, interning in the office of Representative Tammy \n     Baldwin\n       Alan Ledford, attending the University of Virginia, \n     interning in the office of Senator Orrin Hatch\n       Anna McCracken, attending Elon University, interning in the \n     office of Senator Jon Tester\n       Nicholas Muncy, attending the U.S. Air Force Academy, \n     interning in the office of Senator Mike Enzi\n       Lilly Nottingham, attending Harvard University, interning \n     in the office of Representative Mike Coffman\n       Andrew Podrygula, attending Middlebury College, interning \n     in the office of Senator Kent Conrad\n       Hannah Postel, attending Middlebury College, interning in \n     the House Committee on Foreign Affairs\n       Emily Risch, attending Minnesota State University Moorhead, \n     interning in the office of Senator Kent Conrad\n       Jeff Swartz, attending The George Washington University, \n     interning in the House Committee on the Budget\n       Allison Tilt, attending Georgetown University School of \n     Foreign Service, interning in the office of Senator Jon \n     Tester\n       Kim Touch, attending Northern Virginia Community College, \n     interning in the office of Representative Don Young\n       Deana Veal, attending the University of Georgia, interning \n     in the office of Senator Saxby Chambliss\n       Dan Wolgamott, attending St. John's University, interning \n     in the office of Representative Tim Walz\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4799-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4799-S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NASA RECOGNITION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, earlier today, in the early morning \nhours before sunrise, humankind once again touched the Earth after \nexploring the universe. On the day when 42 years earlier, Ohio's Neil \nArmstrong became the first human to walk on the Moon, I rise to honor \nthe men and women of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration's, NASA, Space Shuttle Program on reaching the historic \nmilestone of the 135th and final flight of the Space Transportation \nSystem, STS. I especially honor the men and women of NASA Glenn in \nCleveland, OH, for their achievements with the Space Shuttle Program, \nthereby advancing the human exploration of space, driving scientific \nadvances and technology development, and enriching the lives of all \npeople throughout the United States and the world and inspiring our \nnext generation of explorers.\n  The first firing of a hydrogen/oxygen rocket engine occurred in 1953 \nat the NASA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, now known as NASA Glenn \nResearch Center. Early design work and testing of turbopumps, seals and \nbearings, main combustion chamber injectors, baffles, heat transfer \ntesting, development of the electroforming process, and testing of \nnozzle shapes and lengths was all performed by NASA engineers in \nCleveland, OH. These research and development activities led to the \ncurrent design of the Space Shuttle Main Engine. Three space shuttle \nmain engines combined delivers more than 37 million horsepower, the \nsame amount of energy as 13 Hoover Dams.\n  NASA Glenn is also a leader in fuel cell research and development. \nScientists performed vital research to improve the performance and \nefficiency of the fuel cells to generate electricity for the space \nshuttle. Today, that work continues as NASA Glenn is a leader in \nalternative energy, from fuel cells to wind turbines to batteries that \nare now changing the way Americans live and work.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, NASA Lewis ran aerodynamic wind tunnel tests \non scale models of the solid rocket boosters, orbiter and external \ntank, and complete scale models to gather data for the new Space \nTransportation System. Some of the models even had gaseous hydrogen-\noxygen rockets and solid propellant booster rockets, which were fired \nin the wind tunnel to test their behavior during ascent. These \nactivities helped NASA to catalogue important flight characteristics of \nthe Space Shuttle for launch and landing.\n  NASA Glenn not only fostered the Shuttle program's achievements, but \nit also comforted its setbacks. After two unfortunate accidents--the \nChallenger, STS-51L, on January 28, 1986, and the Columbia, STS-107, on \nFebruary 1, 2003--Glenn engineers performed many shuttle safety \nimprovements and aided the return to flight.\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n  And as the Space Shuttle Program progressed through breakthroughs and \nheartbreaks, numerous microgravity experiments have been designed, \nbuilt, and operated by NASA Glenn and conducted on-orbit on the space \nshuttle. The results of NASA Glenn experiments have been used to \nimprove fire safety, emissions reduction, energy efficiency, \nhealthcare, and electronics.\n  On the ground Ohio's NASA engineers explored the universe with Ohio \nastronauts on-orbit. Nineteen astronauts from Ohio flew on the space \nshuttle, some multiple times. Former astronaut-turned-U.S. Senator John \nGlenn flew on STS-95, and STS-70, the ``All-Ohio Crew,'' flew in 1995 \nwith four Ohio natives on the crew, and the fifth crewmember was made \nan honorary Ohioan.\n  As we congratulate NASA on the Shuttle Program and honor all those \ninvolved in its success, the true measure of the importance of the STS \nProgram will be where NASA goes next.\n  I have had the privilege to meet many of the scientists, engineers, \nand workers at NASA Glenn. They are dedicated and compassionate, guided \nby the scientific patriotism that displays a nation's pursuit in \nunderstanding the world in which we all live.\n  The space shuttle has enabled the United States to continue its \nleadership in space, science, and technology. I am proud of NASA \nGlenn's role in the design and testing of the space shuttle, and \nespecially of its leadership in numerous scientific experiments that \nhave been conducted on the space shuttle.\n  I am confident that both NASA and the United States will refocus to \ncontinue to push the boundaries of science--fueling technology \nadvancements and inspiring our children to become the next generation \nof scientists, engineers, and explorers. NASA Glenn and Ohio will \ncontinue to play a major role in that effort.\n  Our Nation is defined by the spirit of discovery, pushing westward on \nland, navigating the oceans, and sending humankind into what was once a \nmere vision seen only through Galileo's eye. We are a nation of \nexplorers. And we all have a responsibility to safeguard that defining \nAmerican spirit and to inspire a new generation of American explorers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4800-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNIZING WAY WAY STORE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is always devastating when a \nbusiness that has been part of the fabric of a local community closes, \nwhether it is the drycleaner, the candy shop, or the grocery store. \nThat was the case with the Way Way Store in Saco, ME, which closed its \ndoors 8 years ago after nearly 80 years in business. However, due to \nthe entrepreneurial spirit of a local couple, the Way Way Store has \nrecently reopened, reinstating the original store's dedication to \noffering personal service and affordable products. Today I commend the \nWay Way Store for its grand reopening and discuss its remarkable \nhistory.\n  The Way Way Store was originally opened in the southern Maine town of \nSaco in the late 1920s by the Cousens family. Eugene Cousens \nconstructed the store from handmade concrete blocks, an effort that \nresulted in the building being placed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places. Today, the building's exterior retains its original \nred-and-white color scheme, and the original cash register still sits \natop the counter. Through the 1940s, the Way Way Store was essentially \na rest stop for travelers as it offered gasoline, clothing, outhouses, \nand food. Over time, the Way Way Store began to focus on selling candy \nand other foods and quickly became a popular local establishment.\n  Like many other established small businesses, the Way Way Store \nplaces a strong emphasis on family. The Cousens family owned the Way \nWay Store from the time that it opened until Peggy Tyrell and Catherine \nCousens decided to close the store in 2003. Eight years later, Peter \nScontras, a retired historian and schoolteacher, and his wife Bridget \nreopened the store last month to much acclaim, thus restoring a local \nlandmark. They remain determined to honor the legacy that the Cousens \nleft behind while adapting to ensure the store's success.\n  The Way Way Store has been something of an institution in Saco, and \nthe reopening has provoked a strong positive response in the town. \nPeople who frequented the Way Way Store before it closed in 2003 are \ncoming back to take in the atmosphere that harkens back to the mid-20th \ncentury and to enjoy the wide range of sweets that the store offers. By \noffering a multitude of traditional favorites like penny-candy and \nemploying original ideas like a takeout ice cream window, the Scontras \nfamily has proved to be shrewd business owners, and the new Way Way \nStore has endeared itself to yet another generation of Mainers.\n  As many specialty shops fall to the wayside due to competition from \nlarger chains, it is inspiring to see a small business rediscover \nsuccess and continue its contribution to the local economy. People in \nthe Saco area have expressed their gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Scontras \nfor reinvigorating a true gem in York County. I join them in thanking \nthe Scontras family for the risk they have taken in opening a small \nbusiness in this tumultuous economy and commend them on their hard work \nand dedication to their customers and to the Way Way Store's grand \ntradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4800-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ISABEL, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to ensure that all Americans have access to waivers \nfrom the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have just \nabout every week since the health care law has been passed, with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law. I have great \nconcerns about the law that was forced through this Senate.\n  I come to the floor because it seems that the more Americans find out \nand learn about this health care law, the less they like it. A majority \nof Americans now in national polls say they want out. They absolutely \nwant out.\n  Since October of 2010, the administration has granted waivers--\nwaivers--to unions, businesses, insurers, and actually to whole States \nbecause they cannot afford the health care law's burdensome mandates.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services continues to release more \nwaivers and did so again last Friday. They have now granted a total of \n1,471 annual benefit limit waivers, and this has covered 3.2 million \nAmericans.\n  That is why I come to the floor to introduce a bill that will allow \nevery American--every American--to apply for a waiver from the \nPresident's health care law.\n  Under my bill, any American can submit a waiver application seeking \nrelief from any or all of the health care law's mandates. All those \nAmericans will have to do is simply show what unions and corporations \nhave shown in order to get their waivers--nothing more, nothing less.\n  Waivers will be granted to individuals who show that the health care \nlaw is either increasing their insurance premiums or decreasing their \naccess to benefits. That is all they have to show.\n  So far, this administration has ignored most Americans demand for a \nway out of the health care law, and Americans are looking for a way out \nof it. Instead, this administration has granted half the waivers--half \nthe waivers--to people who get their health coverage through unions. \nAlthough those people represent a very small percentage of the workers \nin America, they got half of all the waivers. It is neither fair nor is \nit reasonable.\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\n  These are the same unions--the same unions--that lobbied for and \nsupported the health care law. But now that they have actually read it \nand found out what is in it, even though it has been passed--too late \nnow; we thought too late--but they have been getting waivers so they do \nnot have to live under the mandates of the health care law.\n  We are talking about unions such as the Service Employees \nInternational Union. This is what they said about the health care law. \nThese are people who lobbied for the health care law. Now they have \nfound out what is in it, and they say to live under it would be \nfinancially impossible. A union that lobbied for the health care law \nnow says it would be financially impossible to live under it.\n  It does not just apply to that union; it applies to Americans all \nacross this great land. So I do not think any Americans should have to \nbear financially impossible costs because of the law.\n  The financially impossible mandates and elements of this bill have \nabsolutely become more obvious to more Americans as they have taken the \ntime to look at the rules and the regulations. That is why, frankly, \nthis steady drip of waivers coming out of Health and Human Services--\ngiving waivers to many of their friends--has become such an \nembarrassment for this administration and why they actually recently \nabruptly changed the rules.\n  In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced \nthat all employees and organizations that cannot afford the law's \ncrushing mandates--and there are many--must jump through a new set of \nhoops. It used to be that they would get a 1-year waiver. Now all \nemployers and organizations, even those that have already gotten a \nwaiver, must apply for long-term waivers by September of this year. The \nlong-term waivers will last all the way until 2014.\n  Instead of ending the waiver process, the administration should \nextend the waiver process to include all Americans. That is what my \nbill does. If not, families, companies, and organizations of all sizes \nwill soon be hit with these crushing mandates.\n  Under the administration's current plan, employers will be forced to \nprovide $750,000 worth of coverage to every employee this year. By next \nSeptember, that number balloons to $2 million. Beyond that, there is no \nlimit--it continues to go higher and higher. So if you are an employer \nand you cannot afford $2 million in coverage next year, well, you \nbetter apply for your waiver now, that long-term waiver, before \nSeptember of this year; otherwise, you are going to be stuck with costs \nthat only get higher and higher. This, to me, is what the \nadministration wants to do because they do not want to put out waivers \nin 2012, an election year, which is going to cause additional attention \nto how unpopular this health care law continues to be.\n  Let's talk about some Americans who get together--people in any \ncommunity, in my State, in your State, Mr. President--and want to start \na new business. They are thinking about starting a new business after \nSeptember, thinking about, Do we do it this summer? Do we wait until \nthe fall? If these people want to start a new business and hire people \nand they want to start that business after September, they are going to \nbe faced with two difficult choices: They can offer high-cost, \ngovernment-approved health insurance--that is what the health care law \nsays--making it very expensive for them to try to open a new business, \nto try to hire workers, to put America back to work--we are at a time \nwhen there is 9.2 percent unemployment in this country--or these people \ntrying to start a new business can refuse to offer coverage at all \nbecause they can't afford the health care law's sky-high mandates.\n  So the incentives in the health care law will encourage businesses to \ndo what? Well, to drop insurance coverage if they are providing it \nright now. Under the law, businesses are permitted to drop out of \npaying for employer-provided coverage as long as they pay a fine. The \nfine is going to be $2,000 per employee. The fine is far smaller than \nthe exploding costs imposed by the health care law. So I think this \nexplains why McKinsey & Company recently reported that up to 50 percent \nof employers are expected to stop offering employer-provided health \ncare coverage.\n  The employees who are dumped--what happens to them? Well, they will \nbe forced to get their insurance through a government exchange, an \nexchange run by Washington, which is heavily subsidized by the American \ntaxpayers. They are going to be dumped into the exchange. The annual \ncost of subsidizing these ballooning numbers of insurance policies, by \nmy calculation, is about $900 billion. Well, that is nine times higher \nthan what the White House has claimed. In short, the taxpayers of this \ncountry will be stuck with a bill of nearly $1 trillion every year.\n  Well, I am going to continue to come to the floor week after week, \ncontinue to fight to repeal and replace this health care law with \npatient-centered care--patient-centered care--that lowers costs for all \nAmericans and improves their care. So I will continue with the second \nopinions because until we are able to repeal and replace the health \ncare law, I am going to move forward with what is now the Waive Act. \nThis bill offers all Americans the freedom to choose--the freedom that \nhas been taken away from them by the President's health care law. It \ngives them the right to seek and be granted a waiver out of the \nPresident's health care law. It is time to transfer power from \nWashington back to the American people. This will ensure they can get \nthe care they need from the doctor they want at a price they can \nafford.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. \n        Klobuchar):\n  S. 1399.

A bill to amend part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act to provide full Federal funding of such part; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service I \nhave focused on ensuring that each and every child with a disability \nhas a right to a good education. To this end, I have fought tirelessly \nto safeguard the rights of children with disabilities under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, the landmark \nlegislation that has been improving the educational outcomes of \nmillions of students across the nation since 1975 through the \nprinciples of inclusion and equality. When Congress passed IDEA with \nstrong bipartisan support, we understood that our commitment to provide \nhigh-quality educational opportunities and serve the needs of students \nwith disabilities in our classrooms entailed excess costs compared to \nother students, which would have a significant financial impact on \nStates and school districts. As a result, Congress committed to cover \nup to 40 percent of the excess cost of educating students with \ndisabilities; however, we have failed to deliver on that promise and \nthe law has been greatly underfunded. This is why I am pleased to \nintroduce the IDEA Full Funding Act, with my colleagues Richard Durbin, \nFrank Lautenberg, Richard Blumenthal, Patty Murray, Sheldon Whitehouse, \nPatrick Leahy, Michael Bennet, Al Franken, Barbara Mikulski, Jack Reed, \nJeanne Shaheen, Tim Johnson, and Mark Begich, which will meet the full \nFederal commitment at no additional cost to taxpayers. Given the \ncurrent financial difficulties that many State and local governments \nare facing, this legislation is more essential than ever for ensuring \nthat students with disabilities get the high-quality education and \nservices they need to fulfill their potential.\n  Since the enactment of IDEA, students with disabilities across the \nUnited States have made tremendous progress. Today, over 6.6 million \nstudents receive special education services designed to meet their \nindividual needs. Mr. President, 95 percent of students with \ndisabilities attend a neighborhood school, and almost \\2/3\\ of those \nspend at least 80 percent of their day in the regular school \nenvironment. Nearly 350,000 infants and toddlers receive early \nintervention services. Almost 6 out of 10 students with disabilities \ngraduate high school with a regular diploma--twice the percentage of 25 \nyears ago. Moreover, approximately half of students with disabilities \nenroll in postsecondary education. We must do our best to continue this \nprogress and make good on a 36-year-old promise because we still have a \nlong way to go: students with disabilities who graduate from high \nschool have an employment rate that is less than half the employment \nrate of the general population.\n  Today, the Federal Government provides about 16 percent of special \neducation costs or less than half of the committed level of 40 percent. \nIn the current fiscal year, this means that Federal funds are almost \n$24 billion short, which forces States and school districts to make up \nthe Federal shortfall at a time when they are cash strapped. The IDEA \nFull Funding Act will fully fund the Federal commitment to IDEA by \ngradually increasing the Federal Government's share of the excess costs \nof educating students with disabilities to its committed level over 10 \nyears. Specifically, this legislation will increase the Federal dollars \nappropriated from $11.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $35.3 billion in \nfiscal year 2021.\n  By making good on our 36-year-old promise, which has a history of \nbipartisan support, we will supply schools with the necessary funding \nto enhance the quality and range of services available to students with \ndisabilities. The funding increase will help to raise salaries for \nteachers and related services personnel, thereby allowing districts to \nenhance recruitment and retention possibilities, and will support \nschool districts in increasing graduation rates and postsecondary \nenrollment rates of students with disabilities.\n  In these difficult times, it is essential for Congress to provide \nthese revenues without increasing the deficit. The IDEA Full Funding \nAct is fully paid for by doubling the tax on cigarettes and small \ncigars and setting equivalent increases to other tobacco products. In \naddition to the benefit of offsetting the cost of fully funding IDEA, \nthese tax provisions will help an estimated 1 million Americans reduce \ntheir tobacco use or quit altogether and prevent an estimated 2.2 \nmillion children from taking up smoking in the first place. The stakes \nare incredibly high: smoking kills more people than alcohol, AIDS, car \naccidents, illegal drugs, murders, and suicides combined, with \nthousands more dying from spit tobacco use. Every day at least 1,000 \nchildren become new regular, daily smokers in the U.S. and of those, \nalmost a third will ultimately die from it. Furthermore, every year \nAmericans incur the cost of $96 billion in public and private health \ncare expenditures caused by smoking, including an estimated $54.6 \nbillion in Federal Medicare and Medicaid Federal expenditures. Overall, \nthis legislation, which I hope will enjoy bipartisan support, will \nimpact children's lives in important ways, both by improving the \neducational outcomes of students with disabilities and by improving \ntheir health through smoking prevention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1404. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease participation in medical flexible spending arrangements; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical FSA \nImprovement Act of 2011. I am joined in this effort by Senator Enzi and \nI thank him for his support. Our bill would allow employees who have \nmedical FSAs to cash out unused amounts, effectively repealing the \ncurrent ``use-it-or-lose-it'' policy.\n  Our legislation would modernize and encourage participation in FSAs, \nwhich are a helpful tool for health care consumers who face significant \ncost sharing burdens. It would remove the penalty on employees who act \nprudently throughout the year and save their FSA dollars.\n  Flexible spending arrangements are an important benefit for many of \nmy constituents in Maryland, Federal, State, and private sector \nemployees, that allows them to set aside a portion of their income tax-\nfree to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as co-payments for \ndoctor visits and prescription drugs, medical supplies, and equipment.\n  Nationwide, about 35 million Americans have FSAs, and the median \nsalary of FSA participants is $55,000. It is estimated that one-third \nof Federal employees contribute to an FSA. Currently in Maryland, there \nare over 50,000 Federal employees who benefit from FSAs. These plans \nare efficient, the administrative costs are between two and three \npercent of claims, far lower than other health insurance administrative \ncosts, and over 90 percent of claims can be substantiated \nelectronically, meaning that paperwork for participants is minimized.\n\n  More than 85 percent of America's large employers offer FSAs, but \nonly about 20 percent of eligible employees enroll. According to \nseveral surveys of eligible participants, the primary reason for \ndeclining to enroll or for underfunding accounts is concern about the \n``use-it-or-lose-it'' rule, which requires participants to spend their \nentire contribution before the end of the plan year or risk forfeiting \nthe unused funds back to their employer. This ``use-it-or-lose-it'' \nrule was initially enacted to prevent participants from putting \nexcessive amounts in their FSA, and it served to regulate what used to \nbe an uncapped benefit. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act \nin 2010, annual contributions to FSAs will be capped at $2,500 \nbeginning in 2013, which makes the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' rule \nunnecessary.\n  It is unreasonable to expect FSA participants, especially those with \nchronic conditions, to be able to accurately forecast their out-of-\npocket medical expenses a year in advance, and it is unfair to penalize \nthem at the end of the plan year if their estimates are incorrect by \nmaking them forfeit any unspent amounts. Ending the ``use-it-\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nor-lose-it'' rule and allowing for this cash-out option is a wise and \nsensible improvement to FSAs that will encourage more efficient \nparticipation in medical flexible spending accounts.\n  It is time to modernize FSAs to eliminate this burdensome ``use-it-\nor-lose-it'' rule. It is both fair and sound health policy to allow FSA \nparticipants to cash-out remaining funds at the end of the plan year \nrather than forfeiting the balance to their employer. The amounts \ncashed out would be taxable for the year of the cash-out. Moreover, \njust as it is at the discretion of employers to establish FSAs for \ntheir employees, it would be the employer's option to offer the cash-\nout feature. But I believe many employers will offer this option, as \nthey too will save money through increased employer payroll tax \nsavings.\n  Data provided by WageWorks shows that the average unused balance in \nthe end of the year in an FSA is about $100, and each year a total of \nnearly $400 million remains in FSA accounts. The static analysis, \nbefore considering the effects of greater participation in FSAs, would \nindicate that allowing a cash-out of these funds and taxing these \nunused amounts would increase federal revenues by about $70 million a \nyear, holding everything else constant.\n  Our legislation is supported by the Employers' Council on Flexible \nCompensation, representing more than 100 member companies, including \nemployers, accounting and consulting firms, third party administrators, \nand actuarial companies. I am also pleased to announce the support of \nthe National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than \n150,000 Federal employees in 31 agencies.\n  I commend Representatives Charles Boustany and John Larson for having \nintroduced a bipartisan companion bill in the House of Representatives, \nand urge my colleagues to support this common-sense measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1405. A bill for the relief of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto. \nMr. Tape and Ms. Toto are citizens of the Ivory Coast, but have been \nliving in the San Francisco area of California for approximately 17 \nyears.\n  The story of Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were subjected to numerous atrocities in the \nearly 1990's in the Ivory Coast. After participating in a demonstration \nagainst the ruling party, they were jailed and tortured by their own \ngovernment. Ms. Toto was brutally raped by her captors and several \nyears later learned that she had contracted HIV.\n  Despite the hardships that they suffered, Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were \nable to make a better life for themselves in the United States. Mr. \nTape arrived in the U.S in 1993 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Ms. Toto \nentered without inspection in 1995 from Spain. Despite being diagnosed \nwith HIV, Ms. Toto gave birth to two healthy children, Melody, age 13, \nand Emmanuel, age 8.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement and a strong work ethic. They are \nactive members of Easter Hill United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. Tape is employed as a security guard and unfortunately, in 2002, \nhe was diagnosed with prostate cancer. While his doctor states that the \ncancer is currently in remission, he will continue to require life-long \nsurveillance to monitor for recurrence of the disease.\n  In addition to raising her two children, Ms. Toto obtained a \ncertificate to be a nurse's aide and currently works as a Resident Care \nSpecialist at a nursing home in San Pablo, California. Ms. Toto \ncontinues to receive medical treatment for HIV. According to her \ndoctor, without access to adequate health care and laboratory \nmonitoring, she is at risk of developing life-threatening illnesses.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto applied for asylum when they arrived in the \nU.S., but after many years of litigation, the claim was ultimately \ndenied by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Although the regime which subjected Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto to \nimprisonment and torture is no longer in power, Mr. Tape has been \nafraid to return to the Ivory Coast due to his prior association with \nformer President Laurent Gbagbo. As a result, Mr. Tape strongly \nbelieves that his family will be targeted if they return to the Ivory \nCoast.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to \nremain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have \non their two U.S. citizen children. For Melody and Emmanuel, the United \nStates is the only country they have ever known. Mr. Tape believes that \nif the family returns to the Ivory Coast, these two young children will \nbe forced to enter the army.\n  This bill is the only hope for this family to remain in the United \nStates.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 235, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 235) designating 2011 as ``The Year \n     of the Family Caregiver.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution recognizing 2011 as the 11-year anniversary of the National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program and declaring 2011 The Year of the \nFamily Caregiver. This year, caregivers across the country and the \nAdministration on Aging are celebrating family caregivers and working \nto improve the support family caregivers receive.\n  Today's resolution recognizes the 65 million Americans who serve as \nfamily caregivers for their family members, friends, and other loved \nones living with a disability, chronic illness, or other condition \nassociated with old age. Family caregivers are the backbone of our \nNation's long-term care system, accounting for 80 percent of all long-\nterm services provided in the United States. They provide high-quality \nservices that improve the lives of the people they care for and benefit \nour society.\n  I created the National Family Caregiver Support Program in 2000 to \nstrengthen the Older Americans Act so it may meet the day-to-day needs \nof our older Americans and their caregivers. The program is a \npartnership between States and Area Agencies on Aging. The National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program provides counseling, training, respite \ncare, adult daycare, and other support services to 600,000 caregivers \nso that families can get the resources they need to care for their \nloved one. The program helps American families take care of older \nparents while raising children of their own and pursuing a career. It \nalso helps grandparents who are taking care of grandchildren. The \nNational Family Caregiver Support Program helps families provide care \nlonger and delays the need for costly nursing home care.\n  Family caregiving continues to place a lot of stress on families in \nterms of time, energy, and finances, but American families are up to \nthis challenge. I ask my colleagues today to join me in applauding the \nwork of family caregivers and those who support them every day.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 235\n\n       Whereas there are more than 65,000,000 people in the United \n     States serving as family caregivers for a family member or \n     friend with a disability, chronic illness, or the frailties \n     associated with old age;\n       Whereas family caregivers in the United States are family, \n     friends, partners, and neighbors who choose to provide care \n     out of feelings of love or a sense of duty;\n       Whereas family caregivers deal with significant medical and \n     psycho-social issues that require complex care management and \n     coordination with numerous medical providers;\n       Whereas family caregivers provide 80 percent of all long-\n     term care services in the United States;\n       Whereas despite the physical, psychological, and financial \n     hardship that caregivers endure, these individuals provide \n     high-quality services that bring countless benefits to their \n     care recipients and to society; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should acknowledge \n     the vital role of family caregivers, enable such caregivers \n     to live healthier, less stressful lives, and enhance the \n     ability of family caregivers to improve the health and well-\n     being of those that they care for: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the year 2011 as the 11-year anniversary of \n     the National Family Caregiver Support Program;\n       (2) applauds the Administration on Aging and national and \n     community based organizations that support family caregivers;\n       (3) applauds the family, friends, partners, and neighbors \n     who provide long-term care services; and\n       (4) designates 2011 as ``The Year of the Family \n     Caregiver''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/21/senate-section/article/S4811-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2011 AS ``NATIONAL SPINAL CORD INJURY AWARENESS \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
