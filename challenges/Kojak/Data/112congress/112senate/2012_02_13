Mr. President, in the 1950s, America embarked on the \nlargest public works project in its history: a new web of interstate \nhighways. This came about as a result of then-President Eisenhower \nreflecting upon a time when he was given an assignment as a young major \nto bring a caravan of vehicles across the country as part of his duties \nin the Army. It was a terrible experience--roads were dilapidated, \nrutted--and it was something he never forgot.\n  When he became President of the United States, he decided something \nshould be done about that. This was a tremendous undertaking; 47,000 \nmiles of highways would, for the first time, connect businesses and \ncommunities from sea to shining sea. President Eisenhower--of course, a \nRepublican--said the investment would pave the way for a new era of \nAmerican growth. He said:\n\n       America will be a nation of great prosperity, but will be \n     more than that: it will be a nation that is going ahead every \n     day. . . . The expanding horizon is one that staggers the \n     imagination.\n\n  President Eisenhower said a new highway system was essential to our \neconomy, our safety, and our progress as a nation. That is just as true \ntoday as it was in 1954.\n  Today, America depends on more than 4 million miles of roadways to \nkeep our economy humming. We use those roads to take the kids across \ntown to school and to take products across the Nation to market. But \nthe system of highways, roadways, railways, and bridges upon which the \nAmerican economy depends--and in which we invested our great resources \nduring the last century--has fallen into a state of disrepair.\n  This is hard to comprehend, but more than 70,000 of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient. They need major repairs or need to be replaced \ncompletely--70,000 bridges. Every month in America enough pedestrians \nare killed to fill a jumbo jet. Many of these deaths could have been \nprevented by proper sidewalks and crosswalks. Bus and train ridership \ngrows every year while public transportation dollars shrink every year. \nOne of every five miles of American roads is not up to safety \nstandards.\n  Let me repeat: We have 70,000 bridges that are structurally \ndeficient, and we\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nhave 20 percent of our roads not up to safety standards. Crumbling \ninfrastructure is a terrible drag on our economy. But this crisis is \nalso an opportunity. By rebuilding our transportation system, we can \nput 2 million Americans back to work and boost our economy right away.\n  The surface transportation bill that is on the Senate floor this week \nis one of the most important pieces of legislation we will consider the \nentire year. It will help modernize our transit system, rebuild \nAmerica's roads and bridges, and create or save millions of middle-\nclass jobs. And, it will do it in a fiscally responsible way.\n\n  Democrats and Republicans agree that making America's transportation \nsystem great again will boost our economy, and that is what this bill \nis all about. It is a bipartisan bill sponsored, of course, by the \nchairman of the committee Barbara Boxer and the ranking member of the \ncommittee Senator Inhofe.\n  President Reagan called a world-class transportation system an \ninvestment in tomorrow that we must make today. So it is no wonder this \nstrong bipartisan surface transportation legislation passed the \ncommittee unanimously. I am cautiously optimistic that spirit of \ncooperation will continue this week.\n  I hope the junior Senator from South Carolina did not speak for the \nmajority of Republicans last week when he said, ``We don't have shared \ngoals with the Democrats.'' I would like to believe Republicans share \nour goal of strengthening the economy and creating millions of jobs for \nAmerican workers. I would like to believe they share a goal, as \nEisenhower and Clinton and Reagan did, of rebuilding a world-class \ntransportation system to support a world-class economy.\n  This week Republicans have an opportunity to prove they share these \ngoals. The surface transportation jobs bill is too important to get \nbogged down with ideological amendments. Unrelated legislation that \nwould limit women's access to health care has no place on a \ntransportation bill. So let's stay laser-focused on our most important \ntask: putting 2 million Americans back to work rebuilding our roadways \nand railways. Together we can keep this Nation, as President Eisenhower \nsaid, ``moving ahead every day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S546-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, President Obama released a budget today \nthat isn't really a budget at all. It is a campaign document. The \nPresident's goal isn't to solve our problems but to ignore them for \nanother year, which will only ensure they get even worse. Once again, \nthe President is shirking his responsibility to lead by using this \nbudget to divide us.\n  The game plan is perfectly clear. Rather than reach out to Congress \nto craft a consensus budget, the President will take this budget on the \nroad, as he did today, and talk about the parts he thinks audiences \nwill like. What he will not say is that it is bad for job creation, bad \nfor seniors, and it will make the economy worse.\n  The President's budget is bad for jobs because it includes the \nbiggest tax hike in history and continues policies such as the \nDemocrats' health care law that is making it harder for small \nbusinesses to hire.\n  A little more than a year ago, the President extended current tax \nrates because he thought raising them would be bad for jobs. Today he \nwill call for raising them anyway because he thinks it is good for him.\n  The President's budget is bad for our seniors because it doesn't \nprotect the security of Medicare and Social Security and assures those \nprograms keep careening toward insolvency.\n  The President's budget is bad for our country's economic security \nbecause yet again the President failed to take the prime opportunity \nthis budget provides to address the Nation's $15 trillion debt.\n  Contrary to the President's claims out on the road, this budget is \nliterally loaded with deficit reduction gimmicks that would trigger an \nIRS audit for anybody else and make our current economic situation even \nworse.\n  Now, the President isn't going to mention any of those things, but \nAmericans deserve to know the whole truth about this budget. They \ndeserve to know why the President's own party doesn't want to vote on \nit and why his own top advisers are trying to deflect serious questions \nabout what is really going on here.\n  Yesterday, the President's Chief of Staff said the reason this budget \nwill not get anywhere in the Senate is because it would take 60 votes \nto pass--60 votes to pass--and the Democrats don't have that many votes \non their own.\n  Well, I would suggest Mr. Lew review his Sunday briefing materials a \nlittle more closely next time. As someone who has run the Office of \nManagement and Budget for two different Presidents, he knows as well as \nanybody in Washington a simple majority is all it takes to pass a \nbudget resolution in the Senate, a simple majority. In other words, \nDemocrats could pass this President's budget without a single \nRepublican vote--not one.\n  The inconvenient truth that President Obama and his own top advisers \ndon't want to admit is that this budget isn't going anywhere because \nthe President's own party doesn't want to have anything whatsoever to \ndo with it. Indeed, the majority leader in the Senate has already \ndeclared it ``dead on arrival.''\n  Now, Jack Lew knows this as well as I do, and the fact that he does \nproves beyond any doubt the President has no intention of this budget \never actually being implemented. If he can't even count on members of \nhis own party to support it, who does he expect is going to support it?\n  The truth is, Democrats want to have it both ways. The President \nwants to be able to take his budget around the country to talk about \nthe parts of it he thinks people will like, and Democrats in Congress \nwant to be able to avoid a vote on it because it is so damaging for job \ncreation and seniors and the economy.\n  Well, if anybody wants to know what a failure of leadership looks \nlike, this is it. This is it. Three years ago, President Obama promised \nto cut the Federal deficit in half by the end of his first term. He \nhasn't even come close. Here he is once again proposing the same failed \npolicies that have prolonged this economic crisis well into the \nPresident's fourth year in office. After the national debt increased \nunder his watch by more than 40 percent, he is still throwing good \nmoney after bad. He is still spending money we don't have on things we \ndon't need. He still refuses to lead.\n  Democrats in Congress have been more than happy to enable him. They \nhaven't passed a budget of their own in 3 years, and all indications \nare they will not pass one this year either--a failure of congressional \nleadership that will surely go down in history. At this point, nothing \nseems capable of rousing this President to action. Every day we hear \nthe alarm bells sounding from across the Atlantic. It doesn't seem to \nphase him. Every day we hear the warnings from experts and economists \nthat our fiscal situation is unsustainable.\n  Just a few months ago, the unthinkable happened when America's credit \nrating was actually lowered for the first time in history.\n  What is this President's response? A budget he knows even his own \nparty will not support. That is his response to this $15 trillion debt. \nSo this is a charade--a charade. The only question is when this \nPresident's own refusal to lead will catch up to all the rest of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to continue the comments along the \nline of our distinguished Republican leader and talk about the \nPresident's proposed budget that was released today.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget proposes more debt, more \nspending, and higher taxes. It is bad news for job creation and for \nAmerica's job creators and portends nothing good; indeed, only does it \nportend ominously for our country getting back on the right economic \ntrack and creating the kind of growth that will generate jobs and \nprosperity.\n  The President's proposed budget again ignores his own bipartisan \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\ncommission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which concluded in December \nof 2010 that America faced ``a moment of truth'' because we simply had \nspent more money than we were taking in for too long and had \naccumulated too much debt, which was killing economic growth and \nthreatening to turn us into a Western European country, which we see \ntoday that the eurozone is in jeopardy.\n  One week from today, millions of Americans will celebrate President's \nDay, our national holiday that honors all our Commanders in Chief. But \nthis year, President Obama will share a distinction that no other \nPresident has ever had: He has proposed a budget that dwarfs all the \ndebt accumulated over more than 22 decades by all his predecessors.\n  When President Obama took office in January 2009, the national debt \nwas about $10 trillion or, broken down for every man, woman, and child \nin America, about $33,000, something that neither political party could \nbe particularly proud of.\n  Today it is far worse: more than $15 trillion, an increase of more \nthan 50 percent in 3 years. Under this budget proposal that the \nPresident released today, Federal borrowing will never stop. The \nnational debt will more than double to $26 trillion or $75,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child in America. Simply put, the President's \nproposed budget makes it worse, not better.\n  We all know we can't keep this up. The sad part is the President \nunderstands this too but simply refuses to provide the leadership \nnecessary to put us on the right path.\n  We have heard it before, but I will repeat it. Former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, said the debt is the biggest \nthreat to our national security. How could that be? It is because, as \nAdmiral Mullen knows and we are now learning, when we live in fiscally \nconstrained times, some of the first cuts that occur are to the Defense \nDepartment. In fact, while the Defense Department incurs roughly 20 \npercent of discretionary spending, it has so far been planned for 50 \npercent of the cuts, increasing the national security risk to every \nAmerican.\n  After promising the American people he would cut the deficit in half \nby the end of his first term, the President's most recent plan means \nAmerica will have an annual deficit of more than $1 trillion for every \nyear of his Presidency. That is right, $1 trillion of deficit for each \nof the 4 years of his first term in office. This is unprecedented and \ndangerous. It is dangerous to our prosperity and to our Nation's \nfuture.\n  While the President seems to be unwilling to come to grips with the \nnature of our debt crisis, my constituents in Texas understand that the \nnational debt poses very real security risks because they are already \nbeginning to see the cuts that are occurring or are planned in our \nnational security spending. My constituents in Texas are also \nconcerned, in a State that happens to be growing faster than almost any \nother part of the country, that the threat of higher taxes discourages \nthe people to whom we look to create jobs, to start new businesses.\n  Rather than have a comprehensive review of our Tax Code, as the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission proposed, this budget proposes to target \ncertain industries, such as the domestic oil and gas industry, despite \nrising prices at the pump. The White House seems oblivious to what \nwould happen to the jobs that are generated by this industry and all \nthe revenue the government would lose if we outsource even more of our \nenergy production to foreign Nations.\n  The President appears to feel like small businesses are undertaxed \nbecause the so-called millionaire's tax he has proposed will hit many \nsmall businesses that we depend upon to create jobs. Indeed, as Senator \nMcConnell just acknowledged, it was only December of 2010 when the \nPresident himself agreed to extend expiring tax provisions because, as \nhe stated, higher taxes would be the last thing we would want to do \nduring a fragile economic recovery because we know it will serve as a \nwet blanket; it will be a disincentive on job creation.\n  We need a serious discussion on tax reform. The Simpson-Bowles \nCommission made a responsible proposal--not perfect but a good start. \nBut the President has simply ignored the recommendations of his own \nbipartisan commission since those recommendations were made in December \nof 2010.\n  The President's budget also proposes about $1.9 trillion in new \ntaxes, as I indicated. The good news, from my perspective, is that we \nalready had a number of votes last year on these kinds of tax \nincreases, and the Congress has rejected them. The bad news is these \nassumed tax increases help mask the true size of the deficits in the \nPresident's proposed budget and will do damage to any hope of sustained \njob creation.\n  Then there is the phony accounting, the gimmicks. Unfortunately, all \nwe have to do is look at the Gallup poll to see in what regard Congress \nis held; and it is the kind of gamesmanship and the gimmicks in this \nbudget which contribute to people's cynicism about their elected \nofficials and about their government.\n  What does the President do? He says we are going to save money from \nfuture war spending, and we are going to use that as an offset for new \nspending and to reduce the deficit. But I have to observe, that is \ncynical at best. His budget is claiming artificial savings from money \nthat never would be spent in the first place for wars that hopefully \nwill never be fought. But he is saying, because we will not fight this \nunspecified war, then we are going to take that savings as if we would \nand save it and offset it to try to balance the budget.\n  Even this gimmick cannot hide the fact the President wants to \ncontinue the record-level stimulus spending that began on his watch. \nYou will recall Christina Romer, head of the White House Council of \nEconomic Advisers, told us if we just pass this $787 billion stimulus \nbill, unemployment will never go above 8 percent.\n\n  If we go back and look at those same charts and what they say about \nthe first quarter of 2012, they project unemployment at 6 percent. \nObviously, that stimulus failed to meet its own projections, and what \nPresident Obama wants us to do is more of the same and to spend more \nborrowed money.\n  The vacuum of leadership that starts at the White House extends, \nunfortunately, to this Chamber, a Senate led by Majority Leader Reid, \nin which he has no plans to present a budget for the third year in a \nrow. Even before the President released his budget, the Senate majority \nleader already told the American people the Senate will ignore it. He \nwas quoted in the press saying it would be foolish for the majority to \npropose a budget.\n  Why? Because he doesn't want to subject members of his own caucus to \nhard votes, to tough decisions. These are exactly the kinds of tough \ndecisions the American people sent us to make, and these are exactly \nthe kinds of tough decisions every household and every small business \nin America is expected to make in order to cope with this economic \ncrisis we find ourselves in. But this is exactly what Majority Leader \nReid has chosen to protect his members from making. Why? Because it \nwill help solve the problem? No. Because he doesn't want them to be \nheld accountable in the next election.\n  We know it has been more than 1,000 days since the Senate passed a \nbudget, and it is just unthinkable, to me, that we would fail to meet \none of our most basic responsibilities. Can you imagine a family or a \nsmall business operating without a budget? We know why it is so \nimportant and why the absence of a budget has encouraged and \nfacilitated runaway spending: Because when we budget, we figure out how \nmuch money we have and we figure out what we must have and what our \npriorities are. Then we figure out what we would like to have but maybe \ncan't afford to have now so we need to put off. And then we figure out \nwhat we want but we can't afford that so we are going to have to do \nwithout.\n  Congress has simply, under Senator Reid and the Democratic majority \nof the Senate, refused to meet its responsibilities for fiscal \ndiscipline. It is clear they are running out of excuses.\n  Senator McConnell pointed out that Jack Lew, the President's new \nChief of Staff, said: The reason why Democrats can't pass a budget, \neven though they hold the majority, even though they control the \nagenda, is because of those mean old Republicans, because it takes 60 \nvotes to pass a budget.\n  Mr. Lew has been around a long time and he knows that is not true. I \nhad\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\nhoped he would have corrected the record because he knows--and we all \nknow--it takes a simple majority of the Senate to pass a budget. But \nbefore we can pass a budget, Majority Leader Reid has to call it up and \nbring it on the floor of the Senate and schedule a vote, which he has \nsimply refused to do.\n  So instead of acting responsibly and proposing a budget and voting on \na budget and allowing it to be debated, the President has chosen to \ntake the low road and, last year, simply to attack chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee Paul Ryan and House Republicans for the budget \nthey passed. It is not perfect, but it was trying to do their job and \nto make a responsible proposal. But rather than meet that responsible \nproposal with a counterproposal and try to work out the differences \nduring the legislative process, the President, unfortunately, took the \nlow road and attacked and attacked and attacked, rather than trying to \noffer a viable solution.\n  It should come as no surprise that under the President's watch, the \nnational debt has grown to more than $15 trillion and is now larger \nthan the U.S. economy. That is right, our debt is 100 percent of our \ngross domestic product. Government spending is now 25 percent of our \neconomy; unfortunately, revenue is about 15 percent. So we have a 10-\npercent gap, which represents the annual deficit, and the cumulative \ndeficits make up that $15 trillion debt.\n  We know our Nation has lost its AAA credit rating from Standard & \nPoor's because they are becoming concerned about our willingness--\nindeed, about our ability--to meet our most basic responsibilities. All \nthree major rating agencies have assigned a negative outlook to our \nNation's long-term rating. What that means is potentially the specter \nof higher interest rates that we have to pay when China and other \ncountries buy our sovereign debt. A 1-percent increase, if they became \nworried about our ability to repay our debts and they simply charged us \nmore, would wipe out any savings we might otherwise be able to make \nthrough cuts.\n  The warning sound has been heard, and the fiscal tsunami that many \nbudget experts have said in the past would not hit this Nation is fast \napproaching. It is a challenge that faces the country today, not just \ntomorrow, and we need solutions. The way the American people feel about \nthis overhang of debt and the lack of clarity with regard to taxes and \nregulation in our future is shown in the stagnant job growth we have \nseen.\n  No sensible job creator is going to start a new business or to expand \nan existing business with such huge debt and such great uncertainty \nabout their taxes, the regulatory overreach, and the economic \nenvironment. They are simply not going to do it. All we have to do is \nlook across the Atlantic Ocean and watch our European friends and what \nthey are going through today and see what will happen when governments \noverspend and debt is allowed to run unchecked.\n  What is so disappointing is that President Obama has had multiple \nopportunities to embrace a bipartisan fiscal overhaul plan. The one I \nkeep mentioning is the Simpson-Bowles plan, and the reason I do is \nbecause it is his debt commission that he appointed. It was bipartisan. \nWe had three Republican Senators who were on that commission who voted \nfor it; $4 trillion worth of cuts, tax reform that would lower the \nmarginal tax rates, eliminate $1 trillion-plus in expenditures, and \nwould create economic growth and certainty for our economy and help put \nAmerica back to work in the meantime. Unfortunately, the President, \ninstead of embracing that bipartisan proposal, with the budget \nsubmission he makes today indicates he has chosen once again to remain \non the sidelines and to campaign rather than try to come up with real \nsolutions. The President's plan fails to right the ship and will \ncontinue to lead us down the path of more debt, higher taxes, and \nrunaway spending--a path that has brought the economies of many \nEuropean countries to the brink.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \nPresident's budget, which he submitted today. In an era of trillion-\ndollar deficits and historic debt and the greatest level of government \nspending since World War II, I believe the President's submission today \nwas not a responsible budget. Instead of keeping his campaign promise \nto cut the deficit in half in his first term, this budget assumes \ncontinued deficits this year and next in the trillion-dollar range.\n  Given the promises President Obama made when he came to the White \nHouse and how poorly the last budget was received by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike in Congress--in fact, it was voted on here on the floor \nof the Senate, and it was defeated by a vote of 97 to 0--given those \nthings, I hoped President Obama would step forward and turn the \nrhetoric into action and put forward a responsible budget to deal with \nthe fiscal problems our government faces--no more punting, no more \ngimmicks, a real budget that honestly faces the fiscal crisis we have \nand helps put us back on track. Instead, we see a document today that \nis really more tailored toward campaign talking points than really \naddressing the long-term solvency of the Federal Government.\n  The President begins by proposing a new $350 billion in stimulus \nbill. By the way, that is $350 billion with no offsets--in other words, \nno spending reductions to pay for it.\n  The President's budget then claims $5.3 trillion in deficit reduction \nover the next decade. As I have looked at this budget today, it seems \nto me that only a minuscule amount of this is from new spending cuts. \nIn fact, as I read this budget, 99.9 percent of the claimed deficit \nreduction consists of the following: No. 1, tax increases, about $1.9 \ntrillion; No. 2, Iraq, Afghanistan war savings, which is viewed by most \nhere in Congress, both sides of the aisle, as a gimmick--in other \nwords, spending money that was not going to be spent anyway--$848 \nbillion; No. 3, already enacted discretionary caps and entitlement \nchanges, primarily from the Budget Control Act, these so-called \nsequesters or across-the-board spending cuts that Congress has already \nenacted, and that is $1.7 trillion; and then finally net interest \nsavings from those policies, which the budget says is going to be $800 \nbillion.\n  Out of the claimed $5.3 trillion in deficit reduction, that leaves \nabout .1 percent--$4 billion--of the claimed savings over the decade. \nSo 99.9 percent of the deficit reduction he claims is through tax \nincreases or, again, changes in spending that either have already \noccurred or they are not going to occur. On top of that, the President \nhid in his baseline--in the baseline he assumes for his spending, he \nhides about $479 billion in new spending. Now, this is on Pell grants \nand on the Medicare doc fix. So the claimed savings--even the $4 \nbillion--vanish completely.\n  Overall, when compared to the current policy baseline, the President \nwould tax $4 trillion more and spend about $2 trillion more over the \nnext 10 years of this budget. The yearly deficit would end the decade \nin the $600 billion range, even assuming peace, prosperity, and \nhistorically low interest rates. The national debt over the next 10 \nyears would rise by $11 trillion, for a total debt of over $25 trillion \n10 years from now.\n  The main tax hike would end the 2001-2003 tax cuts for singles making \nover $200,000 and couples making over $250,000. There will be a lot of \ndebate on the floor regarding this tax policy over the next year as we \ncome to the end of the year when all of these tax cuts--$5 trillion of \nthem--are scheduled to end, but just with regard to this tax hike, this \nwill result in lower economic growth and more job losses according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office. They have now testified before the \nBudget Committee as to the fact that this will result in higher \nunemployment next year. This is in large part because, according to \nInternal Revenue Service data, 48 percent of small business income \nwould be subject to higher taxes under this budget proposal.\n  I support tax reform. I think it is important. But simply taking the \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\ncode and adding higher tax rates is going to have an impact on small \nbusinesses and therefore on our economy and on jobs. This is ultimately \nabout jobs. It is about everyday economic concerns people in Ohio and \naround the country have.\n  In this budget document, we do see some honesty, but it does not make \nme optimistic at all. Acknowledging the impact this budget will have on \nthe economy, the President's budget actually concedes unemployment \nrates next year higher than this year, and the year after higher than \nthis year. His prediction is that unemployment rates will be 8.9 \npercent in 2012 and 8.6 percent in 2013--totally unacceptable and a \ntestament to the fact that Washington cannot continue to rely on short-\nterm sweeteners and budget spending gimmicks to grow our economy and \nget the country out of this fiscal mess.\n  Again, I am disappointed in the budget we have seen today. I hope the \nSenate will work its will, put together its own budget, taking the \nPresident's budget and other ideas but then coming up with something \nthat actually does address the very real fiscal problems we face, bring \nsuch a budget to the floor of the Senate, have it debated by both \nsides, and work out what we have not done in this Senate for over 1,000 \ndays, which is prepare a blueprint for the fiscal and economic future \nof our country. Until we get such a budget, I fear we will continue to \nsee this lack of economic growth and job loss that all of us would like \nto see addressed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the \ndevelopments of the past few weeks which, in my view, have been \nincredibly tragic but maybe, on the other hand, reassuring. On the one \nhand, it is tragic that our own government launched an attack on first \namendment rights. The President launched this assault unapologetically \nin the black-and-white print of a rule that clearly restricts religious \nliberties. It says contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs must be \nprovided free of charge to women. What the President did not anticipate \nby his rule was the backlash it would generate.\n  It is reassuring, on the other hand, to know that Americans will make \ntheir voices heard when their constitutional rights are being \ntrampled. For the first time in many years, people of many different \nfaiths, as well as the defenders of the Constitution, have found a \nunifying rallying cry. They are sending the message that enough is \nenough; it is time to stop this administration's march into every \nsingle facet of our lives. At issue is one of the very basic rights in \nthis country. It is one of the basic rights this country was founded to \nprotect. It is the right to freely exercise religion--a right this \nPresident pledged to uphold when taking the oath of office.\n\n  Many Americans were lulled into complacency in 2009 by promises that \napparently the President did not intend to uphold. Back then I came to \nthe Senate floor to address this identical issue. In the thick of the \nvery contentious health care debate, I urged my pro-life colleagues and \nthe pro-life community to stand up against the health care bill that \nwas being considered here in the Senate. I pointed out that the Hyde \namendment, which prohibits taxpayer dollars from being used for \nabortion, was absolutely absent in the bill, something that now appears \nto be no accident whatsoever. On that day I shared the National Right \nto Life's very real concerns that the bill ``tries to conceal that \nunpopular reality with layers of contrived definitions and hollow \nbookkeeping requirements.'' Unfortunately, though, empty promises that \nthe bill respected life were enough to convince my presumably pro-life \ncolleagues to support the bill. After all, they had heard the promises \nstraight from the President's mouth.\n  Remember when the President told Americans ``under our plan, no \nFederal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and Federal conscience \nlaws will remain in place.'' Congress ignored the warnings, charged \nforward, blurry eyed, voting in the middle of the night, and passed the \nhealth care bill that we all now know violates the very conscience \nrights the President himself by his own words promised to protect.\n  As the law is being put into place, we are truly heading into \nuncharted waters for this Nation. On Friday, after weeks of criticism, \nthe President announced a so-called compromise. We were told by his \nChief of Staff that it will be that way or it will be the highway. So \nwhat is the compromise? It would still force every plan to offer free \ncontraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs, even plans offered by \nreligious organizations with deeply held religious beliefs.\n  The President claims religious employers with objections won't \ntechnically be required to offer the coverage because insurance \ncompanies will be forced to offer it free. What? Are we, as Americans, \nexpected to believe that the many religious organizations paying the \nemployer's share of the health care costs are not paying for these \nservices? What kind of accounting gimmick is that? What kind of sleight \nof hand is that?\n  The President is blinded by his ideology. This fight is about \nreligious and moral beliefs. It is not about accounting. What we have \nwitnessed this past week is another attempt to hide the unpopular \nreality with layers of misleading rhetoric and hollowed promises. The \ntruth? The truth is that many individuals who object to contraceptives \nand abortion-inducing drugs as a matter of religious principle will \nstill have to provide them and pay for them. Don't fool yourself; they \nare not going to be free. Drug companies don't walk in and give away \nfree drugs. Pharmacists don't dispense them free. Of course, the cost \nwill be passed along to every employer and every American in the form \nof premiums that we pay. Calling these services free is flat wrong. \nThere is a cost and, unfortunately, it is a high one at that. They come \nat the cost of our religious freedoms.\n  The administration's position is that it can force insurers to \nprovide contraceptive coverage for ``free'' because the drugs are \ncheaper than the cost of being pregnant. Our government said that at \nthe very highest level. That logic is unprecedented and it is downright \ndisturbing. Who is to say that in days to come the administration won't \norder health plans to cover abortion free on the premise that it is \ncheaper than the cost of prenatal care, birth, and caring for human \nlife? The same twisted logic could apply for physician-assisted suicide \nand a whole array of controversial procedures.\n  Many out there may try to refute this by repeating the President's \nclaim that the law prohibits mandated abortions, but that same claim \npromised to protect the religious liberties he is now forcing many to \nviolate. Well, many of us will not sit idly by and watch this \nunprecedented effort, and I am not alone. The President should listen \nto the country. The gimmicks of the 2009 bill may have put some to \nsleep. This time Americans are not being fooled. Americans of all \nfaiths, all beliefs, of different views on a whole variety of topics \nshare a love for their Constitution and the rights embodied in that \nConstitution. Well, they are awake now and their eyes are fully open.\n  As a Catholic myself, I could not be more proud of the Catholic \nbishops for standing strongly. Their statement rejecting the \nPresident's smoke-and-mirrors compromise is compelling and it is spot \non. The bishop said:\n\n       . . . today's proposal continues to involve needless \n     government intrusion into the internal governance of \n     religious institutions and to threaten government coercion of \n     religious people . . . to violate their most deeply held \n     convictions.\n\n  And they go on to say:\n\n       In a Nation dedicated to religious liberty as its first and \n     its founding principle, we should not be limited to \n     negotiating within these parameters. The only complete \n     solution . . . is for HHS to rescind the mandate of these \n     objectionable services.\n\n  Yes, we were told by the President's Chief of Staff negotiating is \nover, it will now be our way or the highway.\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nWell, the bishops responded. The bishops called the President's attempt \nto appease them unacceptable. Yes, America has been awakened and now \nCongress must act on their objections.\n  There is legislation waiting to be debated that would protect the \nreligious liberties granted in our Constitution. The legislation \nintroduced by Senator Roy Blunt holds President Obama to his promises. \nThis legislation continues the 200-year tradition of this great Nation \nensuring those who believe in the sanctity of life are not forced to \nhave a hand in someone else's death. It protects conscience rights \nacross the board. There is a bottom line and the bottom line is this: \nIf President Obama is allowed to dictate to religious organizations \nwhat beliefs they will be allowed to hold or not to hold, then this \ncountry we all love will be a much different place and it will be a \nmuch different place for our children and grandchildren.\n  If the President succeeds, then our Constitution is no longer the \ndefining document of a great Nation. Well, we do know the position of \nthis administration, and I stand here today to categorically reject it.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I came down today to talk about the \nhighway bill we are on, and I want to say I appreciate the way we are \ndealing with each committee's portion of the bill as we go along. I \nknow we are on the base bill at present, but before I get into that, I \ndo want to make some comments about the budget.\n  I know we have had an inability in the Senate to pass a budget over \nthe last 1,100 days. I know the Acting President pro tempore--a friend \nof mine--led a city and had to do this each year. We had to do the same \nin our State and city. I think those of us who come to this body are \nalways shocked at the lack of fiscal discipline that takes place in \nWashington in general, but I have to say in looking at the \nadministration's budget that was put forth today, it makes a mockery of \nthe American people.\n  Our State has been blessed. We have had Governors who have been \nRepublicans and Democrats, we have had people on both sides of the \naisle, and our State has been governed well for a long time. I believe \nif a Governor of our State put forth a budget such as the budget put \nforth today, they would be run out of our State because it is not a \nserious budget.\n  I know the Acting President pro tempore and I have been to many \nmeetings and looked at some of the proposals that have been put out by \ngroups like Bowles-Simpson, and it is stunning to me when we know the \nbiggest issue our country faces is ourselves--meaning our own inability \nto deal with the fiscal issues that are before us and to deal with all \nof the reforms we know have to take place. When we know we are our own \ngreatest enemy, to have a document that has been put out the way this \none has been put out in almost a flippant way, is almost to say we \ndon't have to deal with this serious issue that our country has to face \nwhich is pretty unbelievable.\n  There is no focus on the kind of tax reform that I think so many of \nus support that would broaden the base and lower marginal rates and \nhave tremendous economic growth. There is no focus on dealing with \nprograms such as Medicare and Social Security that people depend upon, \nthat people have counted upon all of their lives and yet we know they \nare not going to exist in a very short amount of time unless we do \nsomething. Instead, this document totally puts its head in the sand on \nthese issues. It doesn't deal with them.\n  To the Acting President pro tempore I will say that I think it is \nirresponsible for a President, facing the kinds of issues our country \nis facing and who is seeking another term, not to lay out what he \nbelieves is the approach for us to deal with these issues, just as I \nbelieve, by the way, that whoever the Republican nominee is, I think it \nis incumbent upon him to do exactly the same. I think all of us need to \nknow what our Chief Executive Officer's plans are for this country as \nthey relate to, again, the most important issue we have to deal with.\n  The most appalling about it is we have millions of people looking for \njobs right now. Unemployment is exceptionally high. I think almost \nevery Member of this body who talks to people out there who actually \nare part of small business job creation knows they will tell us they \nare concerned about the future of our country. That is the biggest \noverhang that is keeping them from investing. So these issues are tied \ntogether in a most unique way. The greatest threat to our future is our \ninability to deal with fiscal issues. Our Chief Executive Officer, the \nPresident, has laid out a laughable document, one that, again, makes a \nmockery of the American people; yet at the same time it is us acting on \nreal fiscal discipline that actually would drive our economy to grow \nand create jobs.\n\n\n                           Transportation Act\n\n  I am very disappointed, which brings me to the point at hand. We have \na highway bill. It is the first time I think we have dealt with a \nhighway bill since I have been in the Senate for 5 years. We keep \nkicking the can down the road. It is my understanding that the EPW \nCommittee passed this out 100 percent--Rs and Ds passed this out. \nApparently they did some very good work, working together, to pass a \nbase bill.\n  It is also my understanding, though, that the Finance Committee is \ncharged with paying for this and has come up with pay-fors that work \nlike this: We are going to spend this money over a 2-year period but we \nare going to pay for it over a 10-year period. Again, I look at the \nActing President pro tempore, somebody I know was responsible in the \njob he had prior to being here, and I am sure he is in this job too. \nBut here is what we are doing: We are going to have Republicans down \nhere constantly railing against the President's budget. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle won't do that out of respect, but I am sure \nthey are wondering what in the world has been handed to us. At the same \ntime, we have a piece of legislation on the floor that we are going to \nbe dealing with that candidly does a lot of the same thing. We are \ngoing to spend money over the next 2 years and yet we are going to pay \nfor it over the next 10. I think that is absolutely irresponsible. I \nhope before this highway bill leaves the floor we will either reduce \nthe amount we are spending on it--which I hate to see happen because I \nknow we do need to spend money on infrastructure around our country--or \nwe will figure out a way to pay for it where if we are going to spend \nmoney over a 2-year period, we will also generate revenues to pay for \nit over a 2-year period. This bill does not do that.\n  I do want to remind my Republican friends--I know we had some \nRepublican support on the Finance Committee--that one of the things we \nrailed about most with the health care bill that has divided our \ncountry in so many ways was that we took 6 years worth of cost and 10 \nyears worth of revenues. All of us said it was a sleight of hand, and \nit was a sleight of hand; there is no question. I mean it was not \nhonest in the way it was presented. But even since that time, with this \nmost controversial bill, what we have done is actually moved away and \nnow we are talking about in this highway bill spending money over a 2-\nyear period but using pay-fors over a 10-year period. What that means \nis the next time we pass a highway bill under this same mode, we are \ncontinuing to run up tremendous debts. These young people who are \nsitting before us as pages, who come here to learn about how our \ncountry operates, want to see, hopefully, Senators acting in a \nresponsible way.\n  The fact is there will be a lot of focus today on the President's \nbudget, and I know there is a lot of disappointment on both sides of \nthe aisle regarding what that budget says. But the thing we can do in \nthis body over the next week or so as we are looking at this highway \nbill is to ensure we don't fall into that same trap here in Congress in\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\npassing a highway bill that is not paid for, that uses future revenues \nwhich we will probably never see because we will flip them out and \nchange them and use them in another way right after this bill is \npassed.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this \nafternoon before the debate on President Obama's just-submitted budget \ndescends into the arguments over the smaller little details that, quite \nfrankly, are not going to have that great of an effect on our whole \ndebt and deficit issue. What I would like to do is take a look and ask \nthe American people to take a look at the larger picture. I would like \nto do it with a few charts and graphs.\n  The first chart I would like to put up really describes, from my \nstandpoint, the root cause of the problem. It really is the size, the \nscope, all of the rules, all of the regulations, all of the government \nintrusion into our lives and the cost of government. What this graph \ndepicts is that as of last year the Federal Government was 24 percent \nof the size of our economy. So 24 cents of every dollar our economy \ngenerates flows through the Federal Government. When you add on State \nand local governments, which are about 16 percent, the total take of \ngovernment at all levels of the United States now--last year was 39.2 \npercent. Again, 39 cents of every dollar flows through some form of \ngovernment.\n  I do not find government particularly effective or efficient at so \nmany things they do. To make this relative, we are watching what is \nhappening to Greece right now. It is in flames because that social \nexperiment is collapsing. But if you compare the United States in terms \nof its size of government to European-style Socialist nations, you can \nsee that Norway spends 47 percent of its GDP on government; Greece, \nwhich we just mentioned, 50 percent; Italy, which hit a mini debt \ncrisis of its own, 52 percent; and France is 55 percent. Unfortunately, \nAmerica has arrived at the lower limit, the lower level of European-\nstyle socialism. That is not a good metric.\n  The next chart I want to describe--so many people, I understand, want \na balanced approach: revenue and spending reform to address the debt \nand deficit issue. Listen, I want more revenue too, but I think we need \nto raise revenue the old-fashioned way--by growing our economy. \nEverything we do in this country, everything we do here in Washington \nneeds to be targeted toward economic growth.\n  But I think what this chart describes is the fact that we have a \nspending problem. It is not that we tax Americans too little; it is \nbecause we spend way too much. Ten years ago our Federal Government \nspent $1.9 trillion. Last year we spent $3.6 trillion. We doubled \nspending in just 10 years. And, of course, the President's budget that \nhe just unveiled today will spend $3.8 trillion in 2013.\n  In the argument moving forward, nobody is talking about cutting \nspending. All we are talking about is reducing the rate of growth in \nspending. You can tell by the chart. According to President Obama's \nbudget, 10 years in the future, in the year 2022, he is proposing \nspending $5.8 trillion. Last year's House budget would have spent $4.7 \ntrillion. That is what the argument is about--spending $3.6 trillion \nlast year and increasing it to either $5.8 trillion or $4.7 trillion.\n  Another way of looking at that is taking a look at 10-year spending \nnumbers. In the nineties--a very successful decade--the Federal \nGovernment spent $16 trillion over a 10-year period--$16 trillion. Over \nthe last 10 years, we spent $28 trillion. And, again, the debate moving \nforward is President Obama, in his just-released budget, wants to spent \n$47 trillion over the next 10 years. The House budget from last year \nwould have spent $40 trillion. By the way, when you hear about that $6 \nor $7 trillion of Draconian cuts, that is what we are talking about. \nAll we are talking about is reducing the rate of growth in spending in \nthe size of government.\n  You have seen an awful lot of charts describing the Nation's debt and \nhow it has exploded. I like this chart because we start it on September \n30, 1987, when our entire Federal debt stood at $2.3 trillion. It took \nus 200 years to incur $2.3 trillion worth of debt. Last year, in the \nBudget Control Act, we gave the President the authority basically--I \ndidn't, I voted against it, but this body gave the President the \nauthority to increase the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. We will blow \nthrough that debt in around 2 years. Think of that.\n  So you can see what is happening. In 2001, we were at $5.8 trillion. \nIn 2008, right before President Obama entered office, we were at $10 \ntrillion. Currently we are at about $15.4 trillion, and in the \nPresident's just-released budget, he is proposing adding about $10 \ntrillion to our debt over the next 10 years, to come in at a whopping \n$25.9 trillion. The question is, Will we really be able to borrow that \nmuch or are we going to face the day of reckoning, when world investors \ntake a look at the United States and say: You know, I am not going to \nloan you any more money. What is more likely to happen is they will \nsay: I will loan you some money but at dramatically higher interest \nrates. That is what we need to be concerned about. That is what a debt \ncrisis is going to be. Take a look at Greece. Take a look at Italy.\n  One more chart I want to put up shows the extent of the problem of \nthe unfunded liabilities together with the debt. Now, this is actually \nlast year's chart. We have not been able to get the new one printed \nyet. But last year the trustees of both Medicare and Social Security \npublished the unfunded liability of those two programs. When you add \nthose unfunded liabilities to the Federal debt and what we owe Federal \nretirees, the total liability of the United States as reported last \nyear was $99 trillion. The new figure for this year--the accountants in \nthe Federal Government have rejiggered the figures, and now they are \nclaiming it is only $72 trillion. But whichever figure you take, if you \ncompare that to the private net assets of the United States--that is, \nhousehold assets, small business assets, large business assets--that \nnumber is $79 trillion. So the Federal Government has made promises and \nincurred debts that are equal to or exceed the entire net private asset \nbase of the United States. Now, that is the definition of a problem. \nThat is the definition of a huge problem that unfortunately this \nPresident and this town are not grappling with. We are not coming to \nterms with that.\n\n  Let me specifically hone in on one of those entitlement programs--\nSocial Security. In 2010 we went net cash negative in Social Security, \nwhich means the amount of taxes collected were $51 billion less than \nthe benefits that were paid out. Last year we were $46 billion in the \nred. If we take a look at this chart, what we see, without reforming \nthe program, without providing the reforms that would actually save \nSocial Security, within the next 24 years, by the year 2035, we will \nincur a $6 trillion cash deficit in Social Security. Again, when you \ntake a look at the President's budget this year, is that even being \naddressed?\n  The House budget addressed Medicare last year, and people like my \nCongressman from Wisconsin were demonized for doing it. Here you had an \nindividual who had the courage to first of all acknowledge the problem \nand then put forward a proposal, and he is demonized. Political \ndemagoguery is not going to solve our problem. A serious budget is what \nwe need to solve the problem.\n  Because we are not serious about even putting forward a budget--and \nunfortunately, in this body, the majority leader is saying he will not \neven bring a budget to the floor for a vote; there is no need to. We \nare only going to incur $10 trillion more debt in the next\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\n10 years. I want the American people to think about that. I have been \ninvolved in business for 33 years. I am an accountant. This is the \nfirst time I have been involved with a financial entity--and let's face \nit, America is the largest financial entity in the world--where I have \nbeen working with an entity that does not have a budget. That is a \nnational scandal. We need to correct that.\n  But let me talk about some of the deficit risks, because we are not \nserious, we are not even addressing, much less--we are not \nacknowledging. It starts with what I started talking about earlier in \nterms of not dealing with the debt and deficit issue dramatically \nincreases our risk of higher interest rates, higher interest expense. \nThe CBO reports that for every 1 percent increase in the interest \nexpense--let's face it--times $15 trillion, times 10 years, that would \nadd $1.5 trillion to our debt--$1.5 trillion. Greece--when they hit \ntheir debt crisis, their interest rates spiked by 8 percent. If that \nhappened here, it would cost us $1.2 trillion. It would wipe out all \ndiscretionary spending. That is the day of reckoning we need to avoid \nby putting forward serious proposals.\n  Another risk we are really not talking about is what happens if we do \nnot grow according to the projections the President lays out in his \nbudget or the CBO projects? Well, again you look to the CBO. For every \n1 percent we miss our growth targets by, add $3.1 trillion to our debt \nand deficit over the next 10 years--$3.1 trillion.\n  Another risk is the true cost of the health care law. Thirty-seven \nRepublican Senators sent a letter to CBO Director Elmendorf pleading \nwith him to please reassess the very unrealistic estimates the CBO made \nin terms of the number of employees who will lose their employer-\nsponsored care.\n  Their estimate says only 1 million. But we have studies that were \nconducted that say 30 to 50 percent of employers will drop coverage. \nWhen that happens, when the employees who lose their employer-sponsored \ncare and get dumped into the exchanges at highly subsidized rates, the \ncost of ObamaCare will not be $95 billion a year; it will more likely \nbe $\\1/2\\ trillion to $1 trillion a year. Multiply that over 10 years \nand we can see the depth of risk inherent in the health care law. It \nneeds to be repealed.\n  The last point I wish to make is a key part of President Obama's \nsupposed deficit reduction in his budget is a tax on millionaires, \nwhich, by the way, is defined by couples making over $250,000. That is \ninteresting math right there. Two points: I said earlier we should not \nenact anything in Washington that would harm economic growth. \nIncreasing taxes will do that. That is what CBO says, and that is what \nthe Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke says. It just makes common sense. \nI want any American who would think that is a good idea to ask \nthemselves one question: How many jobs will that tax increase create? \nHow will that tax increase actually help us grow our economy? The \nanswer is, it will not.\n  There is an interesting study just released on Maryland's \nmillionaires' tax they enacted in 2007. When they passed that tax, they \nestimated it would raise $330 million. The facts are in. That tax \nincrease only generated $120 million--only 36 percent of what they \noriginally estimated. President Obama is hoping to raise $1.5 trillion \nwith the millionaires' tax. Maybe it is only $1 trillion; I have not \nseen the details. Take that number and multiply it times 36 percent, \nthen look at the harm it will cause economic growth and reduce it even \nfurther. It simply will not work. It might feel good, but it will do \ngreat harm to our economy. To sum it all up, what this country needs is \nreal leadership. We need the President to lead. We need a serious \nbudget. We need the Senate to pass a complete and serious budget for \n2013.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some remarks about the \nPresident's budget which he submitted today. This is it--the real \nbudget. The President asked that the press pay for their copies this \nyear. Maybe that will save a little money. It is a real document that \nis submitted every year by every President according to the law.\n  Although the law also requires the Senate to pass a budget every \nyear, we have violated it for over 1,000 days. In fact, the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, said it would be foolish for him to produce a \nbudget--foolish for our colleagues to produce a budget, and I can only \nassume he thought it would not be good politics. It would not be \nfoolish for America to have a budget. I will make a commitment that if \nI have anything to do about it and this Republican conference were to \nachieve a majority in the Senate next year, we will have a budget. It \nwill change the debt course of America. It will be 10 years. It will be \na document that brings debt under control and, to the maximum extent \npossible, will encourage economic growth.\n  That is a responsibility that leaders have to deal with now, I \nbelieve. The President has produced this budget that claims to reduce \nthe deficit by $4 trillion--I will talk about that--but it does not \nreduce the deficit $4 trillion. Basically, it doesn't reduce the \ndeficit at all. This is his fourth year as President. This is the last \nbudget of his Presidential term. He has an opportunity to lay out a \nplan for the future--to suggest what taxes we ought to have, how much \nspending we should have, where we can save money by reducing spending, \nwhat we need to do in the short run, and in a 10-year term, 20-year \nterm, and 30-year term, all of that can and should be dealt with. The \nPresident, like a Governor or mayor of a city that is in financial \ntrouble, or a State that is struggling financially--they have to deal \nwith their debt. They present their proposals, they fight for them \nbefore the legislature, they make compromises, when necessary, and that \nis how they do their business. But because we don't have a \nconstitutional amendment that requires a budget to be balanced, it \nbecomes easier to borrow the money, not cut spending, and continue the \ndeficit course we are on.\n\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, and for the few \nhours we have had the budget, and the few hours we have had over the \nweekend to see some of the tables, we have reached a number of \nconclusions that are not good. I would say a couple of things. At the \nBudget Committee hearing last week, Senator Conrad--who is the chair of \nthe committee--announced we should have a $5 trillion reduction in \nspending over 10 years--not 4--and also said, he wishes to see a \nbalanced budget. I think Senator Conrad is right on both counts. But he \nhas basically been told if he even has a budget in committee this year, \nit won't be brought up on the floor. So I don't know what we will do, \nwhether we will have a budget markup or not.\n  But Mr. Bernanke indicated during that same hearing that when you \nreach debt levels as high as we are today--gross debt being 100 percent \nof the gross domestic product--the country is at risk, particularly \nwhen inevitable shocks in the world occur and you don't have the margin \nof strength necessary to perhaps ride out those crises.\n  And we could go into crisis. I happened to see this morning on MSNBC \nthat Mr. Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, \nsaid we could have a debt crisis next year. Talking about Greece, he \nsaid we could have a Greece-like crisis next year, and he laid out the \nscenario. This is the Council on Foreign Relations, one of the most \nprestigious world organizations around.\n  Here are some indisputable facts about the budget before us. First, \nthere is no $4 trillion deficit reduction. There is not a $4 trillion \ndeficit reduction. I know that is hard to believe. We are talking about \na difference of $4 trillion. When the President submits a budget, and \nwe worry about all these accounts, and then we are $4 trillion off, \nwell, it is a hard thing to imagine. But I will explain to you why I \nsay that.\n  What we know is this: Under the President's budget and the numbers he \nhas provided us, based on his growth projections and other projections \nthat are in it, he projects when 10 years are up--in 2022--we will have \nadded to the total debt of America $11.2 trillion. We\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nwill have added that much debt. Every year, hundreds of billions of \ndollars of debt, with the lowest single year being $575 billion worth \nof deficits. The debt increases annually each year. So it would be \n$11.2 trillion higher.\n  Under the Budget Control Act that passed last summer that had the \nsequester in it and the reductions in spending--under that--if left \nunchanged. And that is the current law. This budget deals with what to \ndo now--what to do on top of the current law we have. Under the Budget \nControl Act, the debt would increase over 11 years by $11.5 trillion--\nperhaps $270 billion less debt accruing under the President's budget \nthan current law. Well, that is not much.\n  The budget deficit this year is $1,300 billion. We are talking about \n$11.5 trillion--that is $11,500 billion. So we are going to reduce that \n$11,500 billion by $270 billion or so and claim somehow we have changed \nthe debt course of America? It is not true.\n  The American people are tired of this. It is this kind of talk, this \nkind of misrepresentation and gimmickry that has gotten us to the point \nwhere the Nation is on a fiscally unsustainable path, as every expert \nhas told us. Indeed, we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar that is \nspent this year. So we take in $2.5 trillion and we spend $3.8 \ntrillion. That is not an acceptable path, and we have been told that.\n  We have seen these gimmicks before. I have a bill called the Honest \nBudget Act that tightens up on a lot of the more common, smaller \ngimmicks that need to be eliminated. My bill is called the Honest \nBudget Act. But let me say we have never seen gimmicks this large. They \nare so large it is hard to believe anyone would attempt to use them, \nbut so large people don't think it is possible the administration would \nnot be completely truthful in asserting them.\n  For example, the budget the President submitted for this year claims \ncredit for cuts that occurred last year as part of the budget control \nprocess--the $2.1 trillion in Budget Control Act cuts. He claims he is \ncutting the budget counting those numbers. Those are not the numbers we \nare operating under today. Those have already been done. That is one of \nthe biggest spins I think we have ever seen in terms of making numbers \nlook better than they are.\n  But there is more. Amazingly, this budget eliminates--erases--the \n$1.2 trillion in Budget Control Act sequestered spending reductions. We \ncan argue whether they are done in the right way and whether some, \nparticularly Defense, are taking too big a cut under that sequester, \nbut we should not give up on the sequester. We should not acknowledge \nthe sequester is not viable. And to say the $1.2 trillion we agreed to \ncut less than a year ago is no longer operable and we are going to \nspend that money and not cut any more is a stunning reversal. It is the \nkind of thing that validates the charges we hear from the American \npeople: Oh, yes, you promised to cut money in the future--you have a \n10-year plan to cut spending--but we know what you politicians are \ngoing to do 5 years, 3 years, 6 years down the road, when those \nspending cuts come up. You are going to say, oh, we can't do that. We \nhave constituents who are complaining. We can't cut this or that. And \nwe will put the money back in and the savings will never occur because \nthey are false promises for the future.\n  People have complained about that, and correctly so. That was part of \nthe tea party movement--a growing disrespect for the integrity of \nCongress when it makes projections for the future.\n  But look at this: In August, we agreed to $2.1 trillion in total cuts \nincluding $1.2 trillion in the sequester. Less than a year later, the \nPresident says, oh, that is too much, we can't do that. We are going to \nspend $47 trillion in the next 10 years, but we can't cut 1.2, when we \nare facing the biggest debt crisis the Nation has ever faced? What kind \nof world are we living in? No wonder we are going broke. And people are \nout to hide what we are doing. I don't think it is right.\n\n  The President says, yes, I am not cutting that $1 trillion, I am \ngoing to spend the $1.2 trillion. I am going to spend that, but don't \nworry, I am raising taxes to pay for it. But his budget prognosticators \nand commentators and his promoters, in their statements about this \nbudget, claim it reduces the deficit--this tax increase does--by $1.2 \ntrillion. Well, if you increase spending 1.2 and raise taxes an equal \namount, you haven't saved any money; you just are not increasing the \ndebt any more than you would have. So we have eliminated the cuts, \nmaking spending go up, and then we raise taxes. That is a wash. That is \nnot another $1.2 in savings. That is how they get the $4 trillion. That \nis a sad state of affairs, to claim credit for that in a way that is \nnot fair.\n  Then we have the problem with the war cost. I was disappointed at the \nState of the Union when the President said we are going to spend half \nof the war savings on highways. Well, I am for highways. I would like \nto spend more on highways. I am unhappy we have diverted money to \ngeneral stimulus spending instead of being spent on highways, as was \npromised. However, the President said we are going to spend half of the \nsavings from the war on highways. But there are no war savings. \nCongress has treated this war throughout as an emergency. The attack on \n9/11 we treated as an emergency. The money was borrowed. Every dollar \nspent on the war has been borrowed. There is no source of money being \npaid out to the war so that when the war costs drop you can grab that \nmoney and spend it. There is no money there. When the war cost drops, \nthe American people have a right to expect we will borrow less money or \nthat we don't have to borrow as much.\n  But they are claiming the natural reduction of war spending creates a \nsurplus of money that can be spent. How illogical is that? There is no \nmoney in the war budget account. It is all borrowed. There was never \nany money to be saved in the war account, only less money to be \nborrowed as the war came down.\n  Whoever thought the war would continue at $100-plus billion per year? \nWe always expected those costs to come down. It has been a long, \ndifficult process, and I am glad to see we can bring troops home. \nHopefully, we are doing it in a way that is not risking the efforts \nthousands of Americans have given to our country to put us in a \nposition to withdraw successfully. I hope we are not going so fast we \nwill jeopardize that.\n  Well, what about taxes? The President has been arguing for some time \nthat, well, we can't cut the deficit without tax increases. I know we \nhave to cut spending, but we can't cut the deficit without tax \nincreases. We have to have more tax increases.\n  First he said he wanted a tax on the rich that would bring in $800 \nbillion. Now, this budget calls for additional taxes of $1,900 \nbillion--$1.9 trillion--in new taxes all across, in a lot of different \nareas. But at any rate, this is what we are talking about.\n  In his statement released with his budget, he said there was 2.5 in \nspending reductions for every $1 of tax increases. We have been talking \nabout, well, what should be the ratio? Some people say: Look, I know \nyou shouldn't have 1-to-1 taxes increased for every spending reduction, \nbut we have to get the deficit down. We have to reduce the deficit. And \nyou Republicans who don't like taxes, we will talk about 4 to 1, $4 in \nspending cuts for $1 in tax increases. The President said in the spring \nlast year 3 to 1, and that was a figure that was being bandied about.\n  But what does this budget do? Is it 2.5 to 1? Is it 3 to 1? No. Their \nstatement that it is 2.5 to 1 is utterly untrue.\n  I remember people telling us if we raise taxes, they would not reduce \nthe deficit. They will spend it. We have heard that over and over \nagain, and that maxim is certainly proved by this budget. The taxes \nthat are in this budget are used to pay for more spending. There are no \nspending cuts in the budget. The budget calls for $1.5 trillion in \nincreased spending, and the taxes are on top of that. So the taxes are \nnot going to be used to reduce the deficit, just like people have \nsuspected all along that is not an accurate statement. But, indeed, \ntaxes are used to create more spending to create even bigger \ngovernment.\n  What about the debt size in its entirety? What are the numbers there? \nLet's look at this chart. The red is the increase in deficits over the \nnext 10 years as occasioned by the Budget Control Act that is the \ncurrent law that\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nwas passed last August-September, and the President's budget is the \ndotted line.\n  So if we look at what is occurring over the 10-year period, we are \nstarting at $15 trillion in debt today. Where does it end up? It ends \nup at $26 trillion in debt under the Budget Control Act that saved $2 \ntrillion, supposedly. I guess that would have reduced the total debt \nfrom $13.5 trillion to $11.5 trillion. We have made some progress. We \nall knew that wasn't nearly enough, but it was at least a step. Our \nDemocratic colleagues didn't want to cut any more money, so that was \nthe number reached last year and we agreed we needed to come back and \ndo some more work.\n  The President's budget, which claims to reduce the growth in our debt \nby $4 trillion, actually only reduces the growth in debt less than $300 \nbillion, from 11.5 to 11.2. That is not enough. We have had expert \nafter expert tell us we need $4 trillion to $5 trillion to $6 trillion. \nMany believe we ought to put this country on a path to a balanced \nbudget and stay there, as I do. We can do that. So the numbers I would \nsay, $273 billion, only alters this red line by the slightest amount, \nnot nearly enough to make a difference in the financial markets, not \nnearly enough to create confidence in the business community the United \nStates has a plan for its future that will work.\n  Furthermore, the President's plan does not provide any noticeable \neffective effort to do something about Medicare, Social Security, \nMedicaid--these programs that are moving every year gradually and \ninexorably out of control, into default, and will endanger those \nprograms for future generations. I think that is a serious criticism we \nshould make.\n  Finally, I would note the interest on the debt. What do we pay on the \ninterest of the debt? This year this Nation, in 2012, will pay $225 \nbillion in interest on the debt. That is almost half the entire defense \nbudget. But under the plan submitted by the President--and these \nnumbers I am quoting from are in the President's own budget, and I am \nsimply restating the numbers his Office of Management and Budget have \ndetermined. Interest in 2022, 10 years from now, will be $850 billion, \nfrom $225 billion to $850 billion. The increase in interest alone \nexceeds the defense budget; $850 billion exceeds any item, including \nSocial Security and Medicare, in our budget today and certainly exceeds \nthe defense budget.\n  It would be the fastest growing item in the entire budget because \nwhen we run up debt and we go from $15 trillion gross debt to $26 \ntrillion gross debt--and we have extraordinarily low interest rates \ntoday. They will not hold. Some think they are going up more than the \nPresident estimates in his account. But when we add the interest \nchanges and the large amount of additional debt added, it goes from 225 \nto 850, crowding out spending for a host of programs that we are going \nto have to deal with. Where are we going to find this 500 billion? By \nthe way, this is 1 year's interest payment, not 10 years. In 1 year we \nwill be paying $850 billion.\n  So we take that $500 billion a year and run it on for 10 years and we \nare talking about $5.7 trillion in interest to be paid over 10 years. \nWhat about the next 10 years when it is running $1 trillion a year in \ninterest as we age and our entitlement programs continue to go into \ndefault?\n  Mr. John Hinderaker, an analyst and blogger, has suggested that this \nwhole debt we are seeing today and this claim of $4 trillion in savings \nis why we should never have had the secret negotiations all year. The \nPresident has asserted all year that he had a plan to save $4 trillion. \nI guess this is it. What does it do? Nothing. Does it change the debt \ncourse? No. It leads us on a course that is unacceptable. It does not \ndeal with the surging entitlements that indeed count for over half of \nthe spending already in the United States of America. Entitlements like \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security are already nearly 60 percent of \nthe Federal Government's spending. How can we control spending if we \ndon't even talk about those programs? And they are growing faster. The \nonly thing growing faster is the interest on the debt. So we have a \ndeep and serious challenge to bring those programs under control.\n  I would just close by saying that our debt course has not been \naltered. Our debt course is unsustainable. We now are moving to $26 \ntrillion in debt. I remember last year when the Chairman of the Fed, \nMr. Bernanke, testified before the committee and said something to this \neffect: You see those projections of your spending and debt trajectory? \nAnd in the outyears, you have these projections and what it is going to \nbe like. Basically, he said: You are not going to get there because you \nare going to have a debt crisis before that happens, before those years \npass.\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles, the man chosen by President Obama to head the \ndeficit commission, with Alan Simpson, they signed a written statement \nto the Budget Committee last year, and they said: The course we are on \nwill lead America to the most predictable financial crisis in our \nhistory.\n  So we can clearly see the path we are on. It is a path to financial \ncrisis. We have to realize we cannot continue to put this off, and I \nfind it deeply disappointing that the President of the United States, \nin his fourth year in office, lays out a plan that does nothing to \nimprove the financial status of our country, does nothing to talk and \ndeal seriously with our entitlement programs.\n  Indeed, what he has indicated is that anybody else in Congress, \nwhether it is Congressman Ryan in the House Budget Committee or Members \nof this Senate who have the temerity to make any suggestions about \ncontaining and saving Social Security and Medicare, will be attacked by \nhim.\n  So not only is he not proposing a plan that would help the situation, \nhe is lying in wait to politically go after anybody who seriously \nproposes changes that can put America on a sound debt course. I don't \nthink that is acceptable. I am deeply disappointed in the budget. I \nwish it would have been so much better because I truly believe he could \nhave had support from Congress to do some things of a historic nature. \nThey were discussed in some of these secret committee meetings but \nnever came to fruition.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S554-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have \nbeen here during the time of President Ford, President Carter, \nPresident Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, President Clinton, \nPresident George W. Bush, and now President Obama. I have been here \nwhen the Senate was in Republican\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\ncontrol and when it was in Democratic control. Never during all that \ntime have I seen anything where the majority leader has had to file so \nmany cloture motions on superbly qualified judicial nominees, whether \nit is a Republican or Democratic President.\n  The nominee we have before us is a former Federal prosecutor and \ncurrent Federal District Court judge in the Southern District of \nFlorida. Judge Adalberto Jordan is the kind of nominee who in the past \nwould have been confirmed without delay. It probably would have been \ndone on a voice vote shortly after having come out of our committee, \nrather than having to wait 4 months for Senators to consent to proceed \non his nomination.\n  This nomination has the strong and committed support of the senior \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, as well as that of Mr. Rubio, the \nother Senator from Florida. Not only does he have the support of the \ntwo Senators, one a Democratic Senator the other a Republican, but the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer will recall that when we voted on him \nlast October, every single Republican and every single Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee voted for him. He came out unanimously. It would be \na little bit strange if any of those Senators now switched their votes \nbecause there is nothing different today than there was back in October \nof last fall.\n  When he was nominated to the District Court by President Clinton in \n1999, even while Senate Republicans were pocket filibustering more than \n60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees, Judge Jordan was confirmed \nwithout delay. It was an overwhelming vote: 93 to 1. Any of us in \nelective office would like to have had margins such as that.\n  The needless delay in Judge Jordan's nomination is the latest example \nof the tactics that have all but paralyzed the Senate confirmation \nprocess. They are actually damaging our Federal courts. It should not \ntake 4 months and a cloture motion, which is hard to schedule because \nof all the other things we have to do, just to proceed to a nomination \nsuch as that of Judge Jordan to fill a judicial emergency.\n  This is not just filling a normal vacancy, it is a judicial emergency \non the Eleventh Circuit. This good judge has already demonstrated as a \nFederal prosecutor and as a district judge his qualities. They need him \non the Eleventh Circuit.\n  It should not take many more months and more cloture motions before \nthe Senate finally votes on the nearly 20 other superbly qualified \njudicial nominees who have been stalled by Senate Republicans for \nmonths while vacancies continue to plague our American courts and delay \njustice for the American people. At all these courts where they are \nbottlenecked because there is no judge, the people who have cases in \nthose courts do not say: I am a Republican or I am a Democrat, they say \nI have an important case to be heard. Why won't the Senate confirm the \njudge who has been nominated?\n  On every single one of the judges that are being stalled, every \nsingle Democratic Senator has agreed long ago to a vote. The objection \non every single one of these judges being held up is because of \nRepublican objections.\n  Let's talk about Judge Jordan for a moment, why he is so exceptional. \nWhen he is confirmed, he will be the first Cuban-born judge to serve on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which encompasses \nFlorida, Georgia and Alabama. Born in Havana, Cuba, Judge Jordan \nimmigrated to the United States at age six. He went on to graduate \nsumma cum laude from the University of Miami law school. Following law \nschool, he clerked for Judge Thomas Clark on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Eleventh Circuit, the Court to which he is nominated, and \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. He then became a \nFederal prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida, where he served \nas Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Appellate Division. Judge Jordan \nhas also been a professor. Since 1990, he has taught at his alma mater, \nthe University of Miami School of Law, as well as the Florida \nInternational University College of Law.\n  It is no surprise that the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Judge Jordan ``well qualified'' to serve on \nthe Eleventh Circuit, the highest possible rating from its nonpartisan \npeer review. Everybody should be down here cheering and supporting this \nnomination. He should be commended and supported, not filibustered and \nobstructed. Judge Jordan is a consensus nominee. What has the Senate \ncome to, if somebody such as this man has to go through and overcome a \nfilibuster to be confirmed? At this moment, ``Moses the Lawgiver'' \nwould have a hard time being confirmed.\n  I say this because this judge is the kind of consensus nominee I have \nbeen urging Senate Republicans to stop stalling. He represents the kind \nof consensus nominees this President has sent the Senate who have been \nneedlessly and harmfully stalled in the Senate for months and months \nfor no good reason. It needs to stop. Last Thursday, Professor Carl \nTobias wrote: ``Most troubling has been Republican refusal to vote on \nnoncontroversial, strong nominees--inaction that conflicts with a \nvenerable Senate tradition. When the chamber has eventually voted on \nnominees, the Senate has overwhelmingly approved many.'' I expect Judge \nJordan to be confirmed with a strong, bipartisan vote, as well. There \nis no justification for delaying this action over the last 4 months \nwhile a judicial emergency vacancy has gone unfilled. There is no \njustifiable reason for forcing the majority leader to file cloture for \nthe Senate to hold a vote on this qualified consensus nominee. There is \nno justification for Senate Republicans' refusal to hold votes on \nnearly 20 Senate nominees who also remain stalled waiting for a vote.\n  The filibuster of Judge Jordan is just the current example of Senate \nRepublicans' delaying tactics with respect to President Obama's \nqualified consensus nominees.\n  Let me give you a little history and a few facts. As we enter the \nfourth year of President Obama's administration, we are far behind the \npace set by the Senate during President George W. Bush's first term. By \nthe end of 2004, the Senate in those 48 months confirmed 205 district \nand circuit nominees. One hundred of them were confirmed during the 17 \nmonths that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I moved \nPresident Bush's judges notwithstanding the fact that 60 of President \nClinton's judges had been pocket filibustered. I wanted to change that \nfor the good of the Federal judiciary. I wanted to restore respect in \nthe Senate as well as the Federal judiciary, but now we have gone back \nto the same old Republican obstructionism.\n  The Senate has confirmed only 126 of President Obama's district and \ncircuit nominees, nowhere near the pace there was for President Bush. \nThat leaves 86 judicial vacancies. In fact, the vacancy rate is likely \nto remain twice what it was in 2004. But I would suggest to this body \nthat the slow pace of confirmation of President Obama's judicial \nnominees is no accident. It is the result of deliberate obstruction and \ndelays. For the second year in a row, the Senate Republican leadership \nignored long-established precedent and refused to schedule any votes \nbefore the December recess on the nearly 20 consensus judicial nominees \nwho had been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. Here we are \nin the middle of February, fighting to hold a vote on 1 of the 19 \nnominees who should have been confirmed last year. Fifteen of the \nnominees stalled by Senate Republicans were reported with the unanimous \nsupport of their home state Senators and every Republican and every \nDemocrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  During President Bush's administration, Republican Senators insisted \nthat filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional. They \nthreatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to guarantee up-or-down votes \nfor each of President Bush's judicial nominees. Many of them said they \nwould never, ever support the filibuster of a judicial nomination--\nnever. Well, that never lasted. Once President Obama, a Democratic \nPresident, came in, the Senate Republicans reversed course. They \nfilibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination, that of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana, a widely-respected 15-year veteran of \nthe Federal bench who had the support of the most senior and longest-\nserving Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The Senate rejected \nthat filibuster and\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\nJudge Hamilton was fortunately confirmed. The same Senators who had \nsaid solemnly on the floor of the Senate that they would never \nfilibuster a judicial nomination--oh well, we have a new Democratic \nPresident, now we ought to filibuster. Come on. You wonder why people \nare concerned about those who represent them.\n  In fact, that first filibuster portended what was going to happen, \nand the partisan delays and opposition have continued. Senate \nRepublicans have required cloture votes even for nominees who \nultimately were confirmed unanimously when the Senate finally overcame \nthose filibusters and voted on their nomination. So it was with Judge \nBarbara Keenan of the Fourth Circuit, who was confirmed 99-0 when the \nfilibuster of her nomination finally ended in 2010, and Judge Denny \nChin of the Second Circuit, an outstanding nominee with 16 years \njudicial experience, who was ultimately confirmed 98-0 when the \nRepublican filibuster was overcome after four months of needless \ndelays.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans have successfully filibustered the \nnominations of Goodwin Liu and Caitlin Halligan. I have warned that \nSenate Republicans have imposed a new standard that threatened to make \nconfirmation of any nominee to the D.C. Circuit virtually impossible in \nthe future. At the time, The Washington Post noted: ``GOP senators are \ngrasping at straws to block Ms. Halligan's ascension, perhaps in hopes \nof preserving the vacancy for a Republican president to fill.'' I urged \nSenate Republicans to stop playing politics with the D.C. Circuit, and \nto allow an up-or-down vote on Ms. Halligan after more than 15 months \nof delay. Regrettably, the nomination of such a highly-qualified public \nservant, who had the support of law enforcement, appellate advocates, \nformer Supreme Court clerks, academics and practitioners from across \nthe political spectrum, was prevented from an up or down vote.\n  But I would also say that aside from the gamesmanship involved, this \nobstruction hurts the whole country. There are currently 86 judicial \nvacancies across the country. That means nearly 1 out of every 10 \nFederal judgeships is vacant. The vacancy rate is nearly double what it \nhad been reduced to by this point in the Bush administration when \nDemocrats, showing unprecedented speed, cooperated to bring judicial \nvacancies down to 46.\n  It is the American people who pay the price for the Senate's \nunnecessary and harmful delay in confirming judges to our Federal \ncourts. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are seeking \ntheir day in court to find one in 10 of those courts vacant. When an \ninjured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of medical expenses, that \nplaintiff should not have to wait for years before a judge hears his or \nher case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute. \nWith 18 more judicial nominees stalled and cloture motions being \nrequired for consensus nominees, the Senate is failing in its \nresponsibility, harming our Federal courts and ultimately hurting the \nAmerican people. If you are one of the people seeking justice in a \nFederal court--and here is a sign saying: Closed; nobody at home--when \nyou imagine this happening, is it any wonder that only 10 percent of \nthe American people view Congress favorably? Actually with this kind of \nactivity, I am surprised it gets up to 10 percent. I am wondering \nwhether my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Senate \nRepublicans, are intent on bringing the approval rating even lower, \ninto single digits.\n\n  Some Senate Republicans are now seeking to excuse these months of \ndelay by blaming President Obama for forcing them to do it. They point \nto President Obama's recent recess appointments of a Director for the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and members of the National Labor \nRelations Board. Of course, those appointments were made a few weeks \nago, long after the delay of Judge Jordan's nomination began. Moreover, \nthe President took his action because Senate Republicans had refused to \nvote on those executive nominations and were intent on rendering the \ngovernment agencies unable to enforce the law and carry out their \ncritical work on behalf of the American people. Some Senate Republicans \nare doubling down on their obstruction in response. They are apparently \nextending their blockage against nominees beyond executive branch \nnominees to these much-needed judicial nominees. This needless \nobstruction accentuates the burdens on our Federal courts and delays in \njustice to the American people. We can ill afford these additional \ndelays and protest votes. The Senate needs, instead, to come together \nto address the needs of hardworking Americans around the country.\n  Judge Adalberto Jose Jordan is precisely the kind of qualified \nconsensus nominee we need. He is the kind of person we all will say, \nwhen the press asks, this is the kind of nominee we need; this would \nhelp our country and our judicial system if we had this kind of \nnominee. But then we filibuster.\n  When introducing Judge Jordan to the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nOctober, Senator Rubio praised the nominee's knowledge of the law, \nexperience, participation in community, stating that ``he looks forward \nto [Judge Jordan's] appointment.'' I certainly believe what Senator \nRubio said. I find him to be very truthful in these things. The day we \nreported him out of the committee unanimously, every single Democratic \nSenator in this Chamber was ready to go forward with the vote. The only \nplace we had objections was on the Republican side, and that has gone \non for 4 months.\n  I hope we get this cloture vote and the Senate is finally allowed to \nvote to confirm this nomination. Again, I urge Senate Republicans to \nstop the destructive delays that plague the confirmation process. The \nAmerican people deserve Federal courts ready to serve them, not empty \nbenches, not long delays, not partisan games.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak today, along \nwith my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, about the nomination of \nJudge Adalberto Jordan. A lot of our folks refer to him as Judge \nJordan. He has been nominated to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. \nAt this time, when we have a very sizable judicial vacancy rate with a \nlot of these judicial positions empty, we need to get them filled with \nqualified judges who are going to rule and rule expeditiously. \nConfirming Judge Jordan to the Eleventh Circuit, which is one of the \nbusiest in the country, is going to be a good step forward in filling \nthe need for all of these judges.\n  We have in Florida a long history of bipartisan support for our \njudicial nominees. That is especially so with my colleague Marco Rubio, \nas we participate with our judicial nominating commission, which the \ntwo of us appoint, and they screen and interview the applicants for the \nvacancies on the district court. As a result, we have nominees who come \nto us who have already been screened, and it takes the politics out of \nit. In the case of Judge Jordan, it is a continuation of that \nbipartisan support even though he did not go through that process. He \nwas selected by the President and is a sitting Federal judge who has an \nexcellent record, and thus we see the bipartisan support.\n  Judge Jordan received his undergraduate and his law degrees from the \nUniversity of Miami. After law school, he clerked for Judge Thomas \nClark on the Eleventh Circuit. Then he moved on to become a clerk for \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. He continued his legal career in private \npractice at Steel, Hector & Davis and then became an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the appellate division of the Southern District of Florida. \nHe began his judicial career in 1999 as a U.S. district court judge for \nthe Southern District of Florida, where he still sits.\n  Based on his experience, Judge Jordan is extremely qualified for this \nposition. Once confirmed, he will become\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nthe first Hispanic judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court. So I urge our \ncolleagues to confirm this nominee without further delay.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Rubio, from the \nState of Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nelson for that \nintroduction.\n  The first thing we have to decide is how to pronounce his last name. \nEveryone knows whom we are talking about. He has an extraordinary \nreputation in our community.\n  I have a few things I wish to add. I have a bias because I also \ngraduated from the University of Miami School of Law, where I have both \nmy law degree and my student loan, so I am grateful to them for that.\n  He was only 37 years old when he was appointed to the bench. It says \na lot that over the years he has garnered a reputation for being fair \nbut also for his intellect. He is highly regarded for his intellect. \nOne will find in legal circles particularly in south Florida that Judge \nJordan is somebody for whom people have a tremendous amount of respect, \nnot just for his fairness but for his intellect, his ability to \nunderstand complex legal issues. His background is one that would lead \na person to that conclusion. He was the chief of the appellate division \nin the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, which is \nextremely busy, one of the busiest districts in the country for the \nJustice Department. As Senator Nelson has already pointed out, he spent \na year clerking on the U.S. Supreme Court. He also clerked with the \nEleventh Circuit, where he now seeks to return and hopefully will \nreturn today as one of its judges.\n  Let me say a couple of things about the Eleventh Circuit. It has two \ncurrent vacancies--one in Florida and one in Georgia. It is the busiest \nper judge in the entire country. They have caseloads that range in \ncases from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. They include death penalty \nappeals. It is so overwhelming that they routinely invite judges from \nother circuits to hear its cases. So it is critically important that we \nfill these vacancies, and that is hopefully what we will do today.\n  There are a couple more points I wish to make about the judge. He \ncontinues to be very involved in our community, both through his family \nand as an individual. He teaches courses at both the University of \nMiami School of Law and at the Florida International College of Law, \nwhich is a new school that started operations a few years ago.\n  He is an integral part of my community. I can tell my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that, being from south Florida, running in the \nsame circles in which he has run in terms of the legal community, he is \nhighly respected. I think as a nation we are fortunate to have someone \nsuch as Judge Jordan, who is willing to bypass the many comforts of \nprivate practice and serve his country in a role such as this. I hope \nthat as a body we will confirm him in an overwhelming and bipartisan \nfashion.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for this opportunity, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of \nJudge Jordan to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit. He is \ngoing to fill the vacancy that has been created by Judge Susan Black \ntaking senior status.\n  Looking back, I think the Senate accomplished much last year, passing \nlegislation and confirming a significant number of judicial and \nexecutive nominations. I would note that even the majority leader \nrecognized we have done a good job on nominations and have accomplished \nquite a bit as well.\n  We could have confirmed more nominees had the President indicated he \nwould respect the practice and precedent on recess appointments. He \nwould not give the Senate that assurance, so a number of nominations \ncould not be confirmed and now remain on the Executive Calendar. As it \nturned out, the President went on to violate the practice and \nprecedent.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues and those who might be listening that \nthe Constitution outlines two ways in which the President may make \nappointments: One is with the advice and consent of the Senate; the \nother is he may make temporary appointments when a vacancy in one of \nthose offices happens when the Senate is in recess. Given that the \nSenate was not in recess, it seems clear to me that advice and consent \nwas required but not obtained by the President.\n  It is for the Senate to determine its own rules and procedures, \nincluding designation of when it is in recess, within the constraints \nof the constitutional provisions found in article I. Consequently, this \nis not a matter within the purview of the executive branch. In other \nwords, under the Constitution of the United States, the President is in \nno position to tell the Senate when we adjourn and when we do not \nadjourn.\n  These so-called recess appointments break a longstanding tradition. \nThey violate precedents followed as recently as 2008 under President \nBush.\n  This is a matter of concern to my Republican colleagues, as it should \nbe for all Senators. In fact, I am quite puzzled and disappointed by \nthe silence from the other side. This is more than just a policy issue \nor disagreement on a particular nominee. The underlying concern is a \npower grab by the President. I would think all Senators would rise to \ndefend the prerogatives of the Senate and the constitutional principles \nwhich have been violated by the President. In other words, if the \nConstitution of the United States says the Senate determines when we \nare in adjournment, how does the President get the power to do that?\n  When a President thinks he can do anything the Constitution does not \nexpressly prohibit, the danger arises that his advisers will feel \npressure to say the Constitution does not stand in the way.\n  At that point, a President is no longer a constitutional figure with \nlimited powers, as the Founders intended. Quite to the contrary, the \nPresident looks more and more like a King the Constitution was designed \nto replace. You remember George III, I hope.\n  Generally, I am willing to give the President's nominees the benefit \nof the doubt when the nominee on the surface meets the requirements I \nhave previously outlined. But as I have indicated over the past few \nweeks, we are not operating under normal circumstances. The atmosphere \nthe President has created with his disregard for constitutional \nprinciples has made it difficult to give his nominees any benefit of \nthe doubt.\n  Despite the conditions the President has created, the committee is \nmoving forward with hearings and with markups. As we see, we continue \nto have floor votes and confirmations. We are making progress.\n  This will be President Obama's 26th circuit nominee whom we have \nconfirmed. That means over 62 percent of the President's circuit judge \nnominees have been confirmed. This is the same pace of confirmation for \nPresident Bush's circuit nominees at a comparable point in his first \nterm.\n  Furthermore, President Obama's nominees are moving through the \nprocess at a quicker pace. The average time for President Obama's \ncircuit nominees to be confirmed is about 140 days. For President Bush, \nthe average time was quite longer, at 350 days--more than twice as \nlong.\n  With regard to judicial vacancies, I would note progress has been \nmade. We have made significant reductions in the vacancy rate. I hear \nsome mistakenly state that the vacancy rate is at historic highs. The \nclaim is not true. I would point out that the current vacancy rate is \nabout where it was at the beginning of the Presidency of George W. \nBush. In terms of historical highs, I would like to remind my \ncolleagues of some history. When George H.W. Bush assumed the \nPresidency, the vacancy rate was around 5 percent. During his term, the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate let the vacancy rate rise to 16 \npercent--nearly double what it is today.\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\n  Those who continue to complain about vacancy rate should also be \nreminded that for more than half the vacancies, the President has \nfailed to even submit a nomination to the Senate. This has been a \npattern throughout this administration. This is the case even for \nvacancies designated as judicial emergencies. Nineteen of those thirty-\nthree emergency vacancies have no nominee. Furthermore, President Obama \nis significantly behind in the number of nominations he has made. So it \nis no surprise he would be a little behind in the confirmations as \nwell. In other words, if the President wants the Senate to move faster, \nsend the nominations up here.\n  I would like to say a few words about the nominee we will be voting \non today. Judge Jordan presently serves as a U.S. district judge for \nthe Southern District of Florida. He was appointed to that court \nbyPresident Clinton in 1999, and was confirmed by the Senate later that \nyear.\n  He received a bachelor of arts from the University of Miami in 1984, \nhis juris doctorate from the University of Miami School of Law in 1987.\n  Upon graduating from law school, the nominee clerked for Thomas A. \nClark of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and then \nfor Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He then began his legal \ncareer as an associate attorney with Steel Hector & Davis where he \nhandled first amendment matters and commercial litigation cases.\n  In 1994, he became an assistant U.S. attorney in the appellate \ndivision of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of \nFlorida. He was made deputy chief of the division in 1996, and chief in \n1998. The nominee also worked as an adjunct professor of law at the \nUniversity of Miami School of Law since 1990. He has taught many \ncourses, including a death penalty seminar, federal courts, a judicial \ninherent power seminar, and a Federal criminal practice seminar.\n  Since becoming a district judge in 1999, he has presided over nearly \n200 cases and has sat by designation frequently on the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated this nominee with a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \nrating. I concur in that rating and will support the nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the cloture motion \nhaving been presented under rule XXII, the clerk will report the \nmotion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the nomination \n     of Adalberto Jose Jordan, of Florida, to be United States \n     Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit:\n         Harry Reid, Joe Manchin III, Sherrod Brown, Tom Udall, \n           Patty Murray, Mark Begich, Herb Kohl, Bill Nelson, \n           Frank R. Lautenberg, Jeanne Shaheen, Richard \n           Blumenthal, Benjamin L. Cardin, Chris Coons, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Patrick J. Leahy, Richard J. Durbin, Joseph \n           I. Lieberman, Charles E. Schumer\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Adalberto Jose Jordan, of Florida, to be U.S. Circuit \nJudge for the Eleventh Circuit shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

One Senator was holding up the works in that he would not \nagree to the consent that you dismiss the 30 hours of debate. That is \nnow causing us to delay this action.

Madam President, I rise because I want to point out to \nthe people of this country who may be watching this proceeding that \nwhat has happened tonight on the Senate floor is just ridiculous. \nSenator Bill Nelson--I think he was restrained, frankly. I know him. He \nis a very close friend--was restrained in his comments.\n  One Senator is stopping us from being able to ensure that justice is \ndone, getting a great judge on the bench. It is sad. It is a historic \nnominee. It is a bipartisan situation with Senators Nelson and Rubio \ntogether, but it goes beyond this.\n  In addition to holding up the Senate and wasting time here--because \nwe can't vote on the judge now; we have to wait until hours and hours \ngo by--what happens after? We are supposed to be on a highway bill, a \nbill that will protect 1.8 million jobs and create an additional \nmillion jobs. Mr. President, 2.8 million jobs are hanging in the \nbalance.\n  We have obstruction from my friends on the Republican side--and they \nare my friends. I don't know what they are doing. I don't know whom \nthey think they are helping, but it is not the American people. Whether \nit is standing in the way of this judge or whether it is stopping this \nhighway bill, they are hurting America. I want to tell them to wake up \nand smell the roses--we are trying to get out of this recession. This \nis a jobs bill that is just waiting to happen. We have myself and \nSenator Inhofe as partners in this effort. We have Senator Baucus \nworking with the Republicans in the Finance Committee. We have Senator \nJohnson working in concert with Senator Shelby on the Banking \nCommittee. On the Commerce Committee, we have a few bumps in the road, \nbut we are going to straighten those out because Senators Hutchison and \nRockefeller are working together.\n  Why is it that we are doing nothing? Is it because Senators on the \nother side do not want us to move ahead? It is no wonder we have 13 \npercent approval from the American people. I will tell you, if they did \nnot let our families vote, it would be less. How low can it go? We are \ngoing to know.\n  I have to say we want to get to this highway bill. It also had an 85-\nto-11 vote to move forward--an 85-to-11 vote to move forward--and guess \nwhat the first amendment is. It is not about making sure our highways \nkeep up with the demand. It is not about how we can make sure our \ntransit systems are functional. It is not about how we make our bridges \nsafer. It is about birth control. Excuse me, the first amendment my \nfriends on the other side want to offer is about birth control? I honor \nmy friends' views on birth control. I personally believe, as the vast \nmajority of Americans believe, that it is important women have the \nability to have their insurance cover contraception. It saves money, it \nsaves lives, and it reduces abortions by the tens of thousands. It \nsaves insurance companies 15 percent because it avoids so many \nproblems. Fifteen percent of the women who use birth control use it for \nnon-birth-control reasons, such as helping prevent an ovarian cyst from \nturning into a dangerous situation. They use it to prevent \nendometriosis. They use it to prevent debilitating pain.\n  It is a highway bill. I am interested to see what Senator--I have to \nread again what he is offering. I think it is so broad, it says that \nanybody in America--any employer can refuse to offer any part of \ninsurance they want if they say it is a religious objection. So let's \nsay you are a Christian Scientist and you run a big organization and \ndon't believe children should get chemotherapy--and we have had those \ncases. Under the Blunt amendment, I guess you don't have to do it. You \njust say it is a religious objection. It is so sweeping. My point \ntonight is to say that such an amendment does not belong on a highway \nbill. To that end, and I will stop here, we received a letter today: \n``To the Members of the United States Senate.'' This is one of the \nclearest letters I have ever seen. Here is what it says:\n\n       The time is now to pass S. 1813, Moving Ahead for Progress \n     in the 21st Century, the bipartisan highway bill crafted by \n     the Environment and Public Works Committee. Last Thursday 85 \n     Senators voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to \n     S. 1813, clearly demonstrating bipartisan support for passing \n     the highway and transit bill. While we are encouraged by the \n     show of support, the undersigned organizations are concerned \n     that progress may be impeded if non-germane amendments are \n     offered as part of the deliberations on this bill.\n\n  I love this letter. Listen to what they say.\n\n       The organizations that we represent may hold diverse views \n     on social, energy, and fiscal issues, but we are united in \n     our desire to see immediate action on the Senate's bipartisan \n     highway and transit reauthorization measures.\n\n  This is to every Senator.\n  Senators, please listen carefully.\n\n       Therefore, we strongly urge you to abstain from offering \n     nongermane amendments that would impede the passage of this \n     legislation, which is essential to job creation, economic \n     growth and to the long-term stability of vital transportation \n     programs.\n\n  I will read who signed this:\n  AAA, the American Association of State Highway and Transit Officials, \nthe American Bus Association, American Concrete Association, American \nCouncil of Engineering Companies, American Highway Users Alliance, \nAmerican Moving and Storage Association, American Public Transportation \nAssociation, American Road and Transportation Builders Association, \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, American Traffic Safety Services \nAssociation, American Trucking Associations, Associated General \nContractors of America, Associated Equipment Distributors, Association \nof Equipment Manufacturers, Association of Metropolitan Planning \nOrganizations, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, Governors Highway \nSafety Association, Intelligent Transportation Society, International \nUnion of Operating Engineers, Motor and Equipment Manufacturers \nAssociation, the National Asphalt Pavement Association, the National \nAssociation of Development Organizations, the National Construction \nAlliance II, National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, Portland \nCement Association, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Listen, we have to put aside these wedge issues, these ``gotcha'' \nissues. We have the equivalent of 10 Super Bowl stadiums filled with \nunemployed construction workers. We have business after business that \nis struggling.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. This will save 1.8 million jobs and create \nan additional 1 million jobs, and we are talking about birth control \namendments, line-item veto amendments, amendments about foreign policy. \nI have to say to those colleagues of mine, whatever side of the aisle \nthey are on--at this time I only know Republican amendments, but anyone \nwho comes forward with a nongermane amendment and tries to put it on \nthis important bill--let me say this as best I can, either they don't \ncare a hoot about jobs for our people or they just want this economy to \ntank for political reasons. Because if we don't pass a highway bill--\nand the authorization ends at the end of March--I am going to be blunt \nwith you. What is going to happen? Our States are going to start \nshutting down these projects and people will be unemployed and we will \nsee reversal in this very delicate economic recovery.\n  This is a critical bill, and I am going to be on this floor every \nsingle day and I am going to be going on my Facebook and I am going to \nbe going on Twitter and TV and radio everywhere. Why? To say a very \nsimple thing to my colleagues--get out of the way of this jobs bill. \nGet out of the way. All of America supports it, from the left to the \nright, to the center and everything in between.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I have filed Amendment No. 1536 \nto the pending surface transportation reauthorization bill. This \namendment is also supported by Senator Boxer.\n  This amendment would change the railcar procurement rules to allow \ntransit systems to contract for delivery of railcars for up to 5 years \nfrom the date of delivery of the first railcar.\n  Current law requires the purchase of buses and railcars to be \ncompleted\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nwithin 5 years of the date the contract is signed, not the date of the \nfirst delivery.\n  So this amendment would give transit operators the chance to sign \nlarger and more cost effective contracts, which in some cases can save \nsubstantial money.\n  The current rules do not make sense for rail operators. They are \ndesigned to stimulate competition among manufacturers, and they prevent \ntransit agencies from locking themselves into contracts for outdated \nbuses in a market that is constantly evolving and advancing \ntechnologically.\n  But these rules do not recognize the reality of purchasing and \nproducing railcars.\n  A light rail system's car designs must maintain a basic design for \ncompatibility reasons, so rules designed to promote innovative design \nhave little benefit.\n  But by forcing the transit rail agency to buy cars with the same \nbasic design in two orders instead of one, these rules almost certainly \nincrease total costs. It may also lead to the purchase of different \nmodels from two different orders, increasing maintenance costs in the \nfuture.\n  For instance, the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, or BART, is \nreplacing its entire fleet of 669 railcars and buying an additional 106 \nfor an expansion project.\n  BART's railcars have been in use for about 50 years, and they have \nbecome too costly to maintain. It is clearly time that they be \nreplaced.\n  The current 5 year procurement rule, however, would force BART to \nissue two small procurements, instead of one large one.\n  BART estimates this will cost taxpayers and transit riders $325 \nmillion and they will buy the same number of cars either way.\n  This amendment would allow transit agencies like BART to sign one \nsingle contract, to purchase in bulk, and to save money for strapped \nsystems.\n  Buying in bulk means cheaper flooring, seats, and all other component \nparts needed to build a railcar. BART also risks increased prices of \ncomponent parts between contracts.\n  This amendment empowers transit systems to apply lessons learned from \nthe airline industry in order to make transit more efficient and less \ncostly.\n  As BART has pointed out in their letter on this amendment, Southwest \nAirlines is their model.\n  Southwest flies only Boeing 737s, making it the lowest cost \nmaintenance system in the country. BART wants a single railcar design, \nto bring about the same type of savings.\n  BART hopes to purchase one model and keep their maintenance costs low \nas well.\n  The bottom line is this amendment gets Federal rules out of the way \nof transit agencies that want to use their market power.\n  It helps transit get the best possible price when purchasing \nequipment.\n  It stretches limited Federal dollars much, much further.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ensure that \ntaxpayers' money is used in an efficient manner. During these critical \neconomic times, every cent of the people's money should be spent \nwisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S560-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S560-S561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE AUTO INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, earlier today I toured Alcoa's \nCleveland Works plant. The plant houses an engineering and \nmanufacturing marvel of a 50,000-ton Mesta forging press. It stands 87 \nfeet high; 36 feet below the surface, 51 feet above the surface. The \npress has enough steel to lay 42 miles of railroad track. That is \nroughly here to Baltimore or Akron to Cleveland. It is massive, and one \nof only five heavy closed-die forging presses in the United States. It \nis officially considered by the Mechanical Engineering Association a \nnational historic engineering landmark.\n  Its original purpose was to build components for large airplanes \nduring World War II. During the war, we discovered that German aircraft \nwere being built with structural elements that could only be made by \nlarge forging processes that we thought had not yet been invented. So \nonly as it could do, our government, through the Air Force, initiated \nthe Heavy Press Program to compete with the Germans and to show that \nadvanced manufacturing matters to our country.\n  After the war, we brought the Mesta supergiant forging press to \nAmerica and to Cleveland, where it remains critical to the commercial \nand defense aerospace industries. It formed the basis of a public-\nprivate partnership, it stamps the ``Made in America'' label on some of \nthe world's most advanced technologies and products.\n  Today Alcoa is investing $100 million to complete and restart its \nredesign of the massive press. Alcoa invested in America and it is an \ninvestment in Ohio manufacturing. It shows the company's ability to \nleverage public resources to meet industrial-based needs as well as \ncommercial demands of the market. It is for our national security, and \nit is for our domestic security to build a middle class. It is an \nexample of how partnerships can still pay dividends six decades later \nand will do so with continued investment for decades to come.\n  At the time it was about our national pride and need in times of war. \nToday it is about creating and retaining jobs. It is about showing that \nmanufacturing is about building and it is about innovation. \nManufacturing is about high-tech production, it is sophisticated \nengineering, it is advanced technologies, and it remains a ticket to \nthe middle-class.\n  We are finally seeing recognition in Washington that manufacturing is \ncritical to our economic recovery. For 12 years--from 1997 through the \n8 Bush years into 2009--we had seen a decline every single year in Ohio \nmanufacturing and in American manufacturing, but for the last 21 months \nwe have seen an increase in manufacturing jobs in America and an \nincrease in manufacturing jobs in Ohio. It started, in part, with the \nauto rescue where if some conservative politicians in Washington had \nhad their way, they would have allowed the auto industry simply to \ndeclare bankruptcy with no ability to finance or restructure the auto \nindustry. Instead, the President, in working with the Senate and \nworking with the House, rescued that industry by investing in that \nindustry.\n  Today in my State we are seeing thousands of auto jobs in the auto \ncompanies, in Chrysler and in GM, jobs that wouldn't have been there if \nwe had not done auto rescue, and we are seeing all kinds of auto supply \njobs. For instance, at the Chrysler Jeep plant in Toledo, where 3 years \nago only 50 percent of components came from domestic sources, today \nmore than 70 percent come from domestic sources.\n  Today plants in Toledo, in Lordstown, and in Defiance are hiring \nworkers. The Chevy Cruze--one of the hottest selling cars in America--\nis as close to an all-Ohio car as you can get. The engine is made in \nDefiance, the transmission is made in Toledo, the bumpers are made in \nNorthwood, the stamping is done in Parma, the steel comes out of \nCleveland, the aluminum comes out of Cleveland, part of the sound \nsystem comes out of Springboro, and the assembly is in Lordstown--\nthousands and thousands of autoworker jobs, tens of thousands of jobs \nof auto suppliers supplying the Cruze, supplying Honda, supplying the \nJeep plant in Toledo, supplying the Ford plant in Avon Lake.\n  In the last year alone, Honda and Chrysler and Ford and GM announced \nmultimillion-dollar investments in Ohio alone and, in many cases, \naround the country. Honda announced it would build and develop its most \nstate-of-the-art sports car ever right in Ohio. We see the same jobs \ncreating investments from Chrysler, its Toledo assembly complex, from \nFord at the Avon Lake plant, from GM at its Defiance powertrain plant.\n  As it did when the Nation needed the forging press for aerospace \nmanufacturing, our government did only as it could do; it stepped up to \ninvest in America and the American auto industry. So those who complain \nabout the auto rescue need to read a little history to understand that \nso often American manufacturing partnered with U.S. taxpayers to make \nsure these industries were strong and solid and created good-paying \njobs to build the middle-class. It is paying off dividends today. It \nwill continue to do so in the future.\n  I have a unanimous consent request after I speak, that the Senator \nfrom Oregon is recognized.\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. One more point I wish to make. We must remain \nvigilant in enforcement of our trade laws. Our progress in autos is at \nrisk of being undercut if we allow China to continue to cheat on trade \nrules, flaunt its predatory auto trade practices in our faces.\n  Only 10 years ago, our trade deficit in auto parts with China was \nonly about $1 billion. That has grown 800 percent to about $9 billion \nto $10 billion. That means more than 1.6 million American jobs are at \nrisk. Our trade deficit with China is continuing to cause difficulty \nfor middle-class Americans. China has begun placing tariffs on \nAmerican-made automobiles. These massive illegal subsidies are worsened \nby indirect predatory subsidies such as currency manipulation.\n  That is why I am encouraged by the President's announcement of a new \ntrade enforcement panel. It is borne of the realization that the stakes \nare too high for our workers and our economy if we don't fight back. We \nneed an all-hands-on-deck approach among the USTR, the State \nDepartment, and the Commerce Department to be involved, to be more \naggressive, especially by initiating more trade cases.\n  I know from representing Ohio in the Senate since 2007 what trade \nenforcement laws do. Trade enforcement by the Commerce Department and \nthe International Trade Commission against China's cheating created \njobs in Lorain, OH, in the steel industry; created jobs in Findlay, OH, \nin the tire industry; created jobs in paper and other industries around \nthe State and resulted in a new steel mill, V Star Steel, in \nYoungstown, OH, where about 1,000 building trades people are building \nthat plant and 500 or 600 steelworkers will be working in that plant \nthat manufactures Oil Country Tubular steel--jobs that would have been \nin China if the President of the United States and the Commerce \nDepartment and the International Trade Commission did not enforce trade \nlaws.\n  That is why that matters. That is why the new trade enforcement panel \nthat the President is setting up as part of his budget is so very \nimportant for the future of our national security and for the future of \nthe middle class and our great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S561-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S561-S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address legislation we hope \nwill soon be pending on the floor of the Senate, the Moving Ahead for \nProgress in the 21st Century Act, better known as the highway bill. \nThis bill is dedicated to rebuilding both our highway and \ntransportation system. It is a critical downpayment on both America's \neconomic recovery and our long-term economic success.\n  Infrastructure is a doubly effective investment. First, in the short \nterm, infrastructure projects create much needed jobs, particularly now \nwhen the construction industry is flat on its back. It is one of the \nhardest hit sectors in this downturn. So rebuilding and repairing our \ncrumbling roads and bridges is one of the best actions we can take to \ncreate jobs.\n  Second, infrastructure investment supports jobs in the long term. \nThink of how many businesses in this country rely on America's \ninfrastructure to move their goods to consumers-- businesses in every \nState of our Nation, from our most rural communities to our largest \ncities; small businesses, the largest corporations, and everything in \nbetween.\n\n  Creating the infrastructure that gives these businesses the tools \nthey need to grow is an essential ingredient for future job growth. \nYet, over the past generation, our commitment to infrastructure funding \nat the Federal level has not reflected its role as a key to our \ncompetitiveness.\n  China is spending 10 percent of its gross domestic product on \ninfrastructure. Europe is spending 5 percent of its GDP on \ninfrastructure. The number here in America is 2 percent--barely enough \nto keep our roads and transit systems in repair. There are those here \nin Washington pushing to cut the investment even further.\n  This is not a recipe for success in the 21st century, nor should this \nbe a partisan issue. When I go home to Oregon I hear from businesses, \nlarge to small, from liberal to conservative, telling me that this \ntransportation bill is a good investment in our future. Likewise, more \nthan 1,000 organizations ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to \nlabor groups to local governments have urged Congress to act without \ndelay and pass this highway bill. It is time for Congress to recognize, \nas our constituents do, that if we want jobs, if we want growth, if we \nwant competitiveness, this is one of the best investments we can make.\n  I am very pleased that the committee responsible for this, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, was able to pass a strong bill, \nand it is going to be merged with work done by three other committees, \nin all cases with bipartisan votes, and they will bring this bill to \nthe floor with significant support on both sides of the aisle. But our \nwork is not going to be done until we pass this bill through this \nChamber, until we pass this bill through the House, and until we put it \non the President's desk.\n  This bill is a downpayment on the next phase of our economic growth. \nIt puts construction workers back on the job, creating 1.8 million jobs \nover the next 2 years. That is a sizable number--1.8 million jobs. That \nwill make a huge difference to construction workers who are still \nstruggling with an unemployment rate of 18 percent--more than twice the \nnational average.\n  Second, this bill gives States the flexibility to direct more of \ntheir own funds, putting more power in the hands of local communities \nto decide what their most important transportation priorities are.\n  Finally, it is an investment in the 21st century system that will \nmove us all forward.\n  Of course, there are always ways that a bill can be stronger, and I \nwill work with my colleagues to bring a number of amendments to the \nfloor. There are, for example, several loopholes in the ``Buy \nAmerican'' provisions that we should fix. We already recognize in \ncurrent law that if we are spending taxpayer dollars to buy materials \nfor American infrastructure projects, it makes no sense to shift those \ndollars overseas when they could stay in our economy and support growth \nand jobs right here. All highway and transit projects have requirements \nto use American-made materials for public infrastructure and transit. \nBut two specific loopholes have enabled States to buy Chinese steel \ninstead of American steel and shift jobs out of the country. First, we \nshould close the freight rail loophole in our ``Buy American'' laws. \nThe industrial might of this Nation was built on American railroads, \nmade from American steel. As we update and improve that freight rail \nsystem, it is only right that those bridges and tracks continue to be \nmade in America.\n  This summer, construction of a rail bridge in Alaska to a military \nbase was awarded to a Chinese company because the Federal Rail \nAdministration, unlike the Federal Transit and Federal Highway \nAdministrations, doesn't have any ``Buy American'' provision. An \nAmerican company was ready to build this bridge but because of this \nloophole, the contract went to a Chinese company using Chinese steel, \npaid for with American tax dollars. That is a huge mistake. Let's shut \nthat loophole.\n  Second, we should close the segmentation loophole. This loophole \nallows projects to be split into little pieces in order to bypass the \nrequirement for American-made materials. The Bay Bridge in California \nwas split into nine separate projects instead of one bridge project so \nthat Federal funds and, therefore, ``Buy American'' provisions would \nonly apply to two out of the nine projects. This allowed the bulk of \nthe bridge to be built with Chinese steel and Chinese workers, with \nAmerican tax dollars. That is a mistake. Even Republican Members of the \nHouse know that is a mistake. They have put forward an amendment to \nclose this loophole. Let's close this loophole as well on the Senate \nside.\n  In addition to closing these two loopholes, we need to strengthen the \nbike and pedestrian provisions in this bill. Bike and pedestrian \nsystems are essential components in an integrated transportation \nsystem, reducing congestion and reducing pollution in a highly cost-\neffective manner. With gas prices on the rise, many families are \nlooking for increased opportunities to get around on their bikes and on \nfoot. In many\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\ncommunities around the Nation such as Portland and Eugene in my home \nState of Oregon, and many other cities in Oregon, biking and walking \nhave become a way of life, with families commuting, running errands, \nand getting around town. When they are able to do that, they decrease \nthe load on the highway system. They reduce the congestion. They reduce \nthe pollution. It is a win-win at every level.\n  But Federal funding has not kept up with this shift. Just as traffic \nlights and highway lanes are necessary to make our roads safer and \nfaster for drivers, pedestrians and bikers need basic infrastructure to \nmake their trips safe and efficient. Yet there is no dedicated Federal \nfunding stream for bike and pedestrian infrastructure. This is a \ngrowing demand in many communities and States. Despite the fact of \ndecreasing congestion on the roads, it is one of the most cost-\neffective strategies we could possibly follow. Biking and walking \ninfrastructure costs little, but it has a big bang for the buck. In \nPortland 2 percent of the city's transportation dollars were spent on \nbiking and walking, but the percentage of commuters traveling by bike \nwent up 140 percent. Imagine if all those bikers were in cars by \nthemselves, as are so many of us who drive to work. Congestion in \nPortland would have increased instead of staying constant over a 10-\nyear period as it has.\n  I am supporting an amendment that will retain the current level of \nfunding at 2 percent for bike and pedestrian projects, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to be smart with the Federal dollar and support this \namendment.\n  This bill--the broader highway bill--is a critical investment in our \nshort-term and long-term economic success. Over the next 2 years, it \nwill provide an immediate boost to a struggling construction industry, \ncreating jobs where they are needed most. And over the next generation, \nit will act as the downpayment we need on infrastructure for our \nbusinesses to grow and prosper in the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to build \nsupport around this bill; indeed, to get this bill to the floor for \nconsideration. While there are some in this Chamber who want to fight \nsocial battles by putting unrelated amendments up, there are millions \nof Americans in need of jobs, there is an infrastructure that needs to \nbe rebuilt, and there are citizens who want us to put aside the games \nand do the work here so they can do the work back at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S562-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROMA BRIDGE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, at the end of January, something \nremarkable happened: Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Rudolf Chmel made a \npositive statement about Roma. Saying something nice about Europe's \nlargest ethnic minority may not seem newsworthy, but it is and here is \nwhy.\n  The Deputy Prime Minister reacted to an escalation of anti-Roma \nrhetoric in the runup to Slovakia's March 10 parliamentary elections by \ncalling on political parties not to play the ``Roma card.'' But more \nthan that, he welcomed a landmark decision of the European Court on \nHuman Rights holding that the sterilization of a Slovak Romani woman \nwithout her consent had been cruel and inhuman. He welcomed the \nfindings of a Slovak court that concluded Romani children had been \nplaced in segregated schools in eastern Slovakia. And he commended the \nhuman rights organization that had helped litigate both these cases.\n  To say that statements like these are few and far between is an \nunderstatement. On the contrary, officials at the highest levels of \ngovernment frequently perpetuate the worst bigotry against Roma.\n  For example, after four perpetrators were convicted and sentenced for \na racially motivated firebombing that left a Romani toddler burned over \n80 percent of her body, Czech President Vaclav Klaus wondered if their \n20-plus-year sentences were too harsh. Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor \nBaconschi suggested that Roma were ``physiologically'' disposed to \ncrime. Last year, President Silvio Berlusconi warned the electorate of \nMilan to vote for his party lest their city become a ``Gypsyopolis.'' \nAnd French President Nicolas Sarkozy has explicated targeted Roma--from \nEU countries--for expulsion from France. The common thread in most of \nthis rhetoric is the portrayal of Roma as inherently criminal.\n  Nearly 20 years ago in the New York Times--Dec. 10, 1993--Vaclav \nHavel described the treatment of Roma as a litmus test for civil \nsociety. Today, Europe is still failing that test miserably. As \nHungary's Minister for Social Inclusion Zolton Balog has argued, Roma \nare worse off today than they were under communism. While a small \nfraction of Roma have benefited from new opportunities, many more have \nbeen the absolute losers in the transition from the command-to-a market \neconomy, and vast numbers live in a kind of poverty that the United \nNations Development Programme described as more typically found in sub-\nSaharan Africa than Europe. Endemic discrimination has propelled \neconomic marginalization downward at an exponential pace, and the past \n20 years have been marked by outbreaks of hate crimes and mob violence \nagainst Roma that are on the rise again.\n  In the current environment, those who play with anti-Roma rhetoric \nare playing with a combustible mix.\n  In the near term, there is the real prospect that fueling prejudice \nagainst Roma will spark interethnic violence. Before Bulgaria's local \nelections last October, the extremist Ataka party parlayed an incident \ninvolving a Romani mafia boss into anti-Romani rioting in some 14 towns \nand cities. In the Czech Republic, the government has had to mount \nmassive shows of law enforcement to keep anti-Roma mobs from \ndegenerating into all-out pogroms; its worked so far, but at a huge \ncost.\n  Significantly, Roma are not always standing by while the likes of the \nHungarian Guard mass on their doorsteps; they have sometimes gathered \nsticks, shovels, scythes, and anything else handy in an old-school \ndefense.\n  Even without the prospect of violence, there is a longer term threat \nto many countries with larger Romani populations: if they fail to \nundertake meaningful integration of Roma, they will find their \neconomies hollowed out from within. More than a decade ago, then-\nHungarian Minister of Education Zolton Pokorni said that one out of \nevery three children starting school that year would be Romani. Some \neconomic forecasts now suggest that by 2040, 40 percent of the labor \nforce in Hungary will be Romani. A number of other countries face \nsimilar trajectories.\n  A desperately impoverished, uneducated, and marginalized population \nwill not serve as the backbone of a modern and thriving economy. But \nseveral studies have shown that the cost of investing in the \nintegration of Roma--housing, education, and job training and the \nlike--will be more than offset by gains in GNP and tax revenue. In \norder to undertake those integration policies, somebody has to build \npopular support for them. And that is where Mr. Chmel comes in.\n  Until now, most popular discourse about Roma seems predicated on the \nostrich-like belief that perhaps they can be made to go away. Few \npoliticians have shown the courage and foresight to reframe public \ndiscourse in any way that acknowledges Europe's future will definitely \ninclude Roma. Mr. Chmel has taken an important step in that direction. \nI hope he will inspire others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S562-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S562-S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING STEVE APPLETON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in honoring the life of Steve Appleton. We are deeply saddened \nby Steve's passing, and we join his wife, Dalynn, their children, \nfamily, Micron employees and his many friends in honoring his \nremarkable life.\n  For more than three decades, our State was a fortunate beneficiary of \nSteve's determination and hard work. A year after his 1982 graduation \nfrom Boise State University, he joined Micron Technology, Inc., and \nquickly ascended from working on Micron's high-tech assembly line to \nleading the company as CEO, president and chairman. His talent and \nenergy helped overcome significant challenges and shaped Micron into a \nmultinational world leader\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\nin semiconductors. As Kurt Marko, a coworker at Micron, poignantly \ndescribed him, ``Appleton personified Micron's can-do spirit. He, and \nit, defied the odds.''\n  Steve leaves behind a legacy of hard work, focus, integrity and \ngenerosity. He was driven to reach remarkable achievements and was \ngenerous in sharing the rewards of that hard work to better our State \nand future generations of Idahoans. For example, he gave his time and \nfinancial resources to help Boise State University develop its College \nof Engineering; raised funds for scholarships, programs, buildings and \nprojects, including the Appleton Tennis Complex; and established the \nMicron Foundation. Due to his efforts, our State and Nation will be \nbetter equipped to compete globally.\n  We were honored to have many opportunities to work with Steve over \nthe years. His pragmatic approach was instrumental in achieving \nremedies needed to better ensure a level playing field for U.S. \nsemiconductor products and address unfair trading practices. No matter \nthe challenges, Steve faced them with optimism and sensibility.\n  Steve's adventurous spirit was widely known and well documented. His \npassion for sports and competition contributed to him excelling in \ntennis, including winning the doubles title at the Big Sky Tennis \nChampionship in 1982. Besides his love of aviation, he also was \ninvolved in a number of adventure sports including, off-road car \nracing, scuba diving, wakeboarding, motocross and more.\n  Steve Appleton's energy and commitment to Idaho will not be \nforgotten. He has set an extraordinary example of what hard work and \ninitiative in a free enterprise system can achieve. He helped create \nthousands of jobs and cemented Idaho's standing in the high-tech field. \nHis innovation, drive and forward-thinking approach, as well as his \nwonderful friendship, will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S563-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS HOSPITALS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to \nrecognize the work of five Arkansas hospitals that were honored by U.S. \nNews and World Report as among the Nation's best hospitals and \nclassified as ``high-performing'' in a variety of specialties for their \noutstanding care. These hospitals were judged against almost 5,000 \nnationwide hospitals and met rigorous standards of medical care, \nincluding patient survival and safety, hospital reputation, and care-\nrelated factors such as nursing and patient services. The ``high-\nperforming'' designation is reserved for hospitals that rank in the top \n25 percent of each category after further standards are applied. These \nfive hospitals are tremendous assets to my State, and I am pleased to \nbe able to praise their hard work and world-class medical care on the \nSenate floor.\n  The U.S. News 2011-2012 Best Hospitals rankings recognized three \nhospitals in the Little Rock metropolitan area, which includes Little \nRock, North Little Rock, and Conway. The University of Arkansas for \nMedical Sciences, UAMS, was recognized as a high-performing hospital in \nfour specialty areas: cancer; obstetrics/gynecology; ear/nose/throat, \nENT; and nephrology, kidney. Baptist Health Medical Center was named \nhigh-performing in the ENT and nephrology specialties, and St. Vincent \nInfirmary was recognized as high-performing in the ENT and orthopedics \nspecialties.\n  The 2011-2012 Best Hospitals list included two additional Arkansas \nfacilities providing outstanding care outside of major metro areas: \nSparks Regional Medical Center, in Fort Smith, and Washington Regional \nMedical Center, in Fayetteville.

WEBB\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I want to \nrecognize a friend and a great Coloradan the Honorable Wilma J. Webb. \nWilma is a transformative leader who has left her indelible mark on the \nState of Colorado and the character of our country.\n  On February 16, 2012, the Anti-Defamation League's Mountain States \nOffice will present Wilma with the prestigious 2012 Civil Rights Award. \nGiven all of her work on behalf of the African-American community, it \nis especially appropriate that Wilma will receive her award during \nBlack History Month. I congratulate her on being the recipient of such \nan esteemed honor and I applaud her for her remarkable achievements in \nthe struggle for civil rights. Wilma's award presents me with an \nopportunity to tell the U.S. Senate about her remarkable life and work.\n  Wilma is a native of the Centennial State, born in Denver and raised \nin the city's Five Points Neighborhood. She later attended the \nUniversity of Colorado at Denver, and is an alumna of Harvard \nUniversity's John F. Kennedy School of Government. As a testament to \nher dedication to public service in Colorado, Wilma also has received \nhonorary doctoral degrees from the University of Northern Colorado and \nthe Art Institute of Colorado.\n  By 1980, Wilma had become a state representative in the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly, where she served for 13 years, distinguishing herself \nas a trailblazing leader in the State Capitol. Among her achievements, \nWilma spearheaded legislation to prevent discrimination in its many \nforms. For example, Wilma successfully secured the ability of the \nColorado Civil Rights Commission and Division to use the power of \nsubpoena in cases of discrimination. The first woman to represent House \nDistrict 8, she was also a champion for the rights of women and led \nlegislation to make it unlawful to discriminate against women in the \nworkplace or in the pursuit of an education. Wilma fought to help women \nand minority professionals lead successful businesses in Colorado. \nAdditionally, Wilma served as an advocate to end discrimination on the \nbasis of a person's sexual orientation or physical disability.\n  In the 1980s, the United States was considering a policy of \ndivestment in South Africa because of its abhorrent system known as \napartheid. At this time, early in her career as a State Representative, \nWilma had the foresight and determination to lead the divestment effort \nin Colorado. To do so, she carried bills to discourage investment in \nSouth Africa until Nelson Mandela was freed from imprisonment on Robben \nIsland and justice was restored to the country's political system. It's \na stance that many of us think is common sense now, but we must \nremember that it took brave leaders like Wilma to be on the forefront \nof the fight several decades ago.\n  Wilma's leadership to expand civil rights is laudable, and includes \nmany successful initiatives that make Coloradans proud. She is perhaps \nmost widely known and celebrated for her effort to establish Martin \nLuther King, Jr. Day as a State holiday in Colorado. Founding the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Colorado Holiday Commission along with Mrs. \nCoretta Scott King and Governor Richard D. Lamm, Wilma committed 18 \nyears to serving as its President and Chairman. The commission, helmed \nby Wilma, was responsible for organizing the annual ``Marade'' in the \nheart of Denver and has served to unite and educate communities across \nColorado on the spirit and contributions of Dr. King. The Marade, \nuniquely named for being both a march and a parade, is one of the \nlargest celebrations of its kind across the country. I have had the \ndistinct privilege of participating in it over the years. In fact, just \nlast month I was in Denver to mark the occasion, and it is among the \nmost important ways we have to celebrate our diverse communities and \nhonor the values to which Dr. King devoted his life. To me, Wilma's \nvisionary leadership in honoring Dr. King's legacy symbolizes our \nnation's inexorable march toward greater equality and justice for all \nAmericans.\n  There are many other notable achievements of Wilma Webb. I would like \nto discuss a few more.\n  She has been a pioneer on education issues, fighting for a level \nplaying field\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\nand full-day kindergarten so that Colorado's children are able to get a \nquality education. I will note that in President Obama's most recent \nState of the Union address, he called for a nationwide effort to \nestablish a mechanism to keep students in school until they are 18 \nyears old or graduate high school. It did not surprise me to learn that \nWilma, in her days as a state legislator, carried measures to do the \nsame for Colorado's youth over 20 years ago.\n  Wilma served as a voice for the community's poor by carrying \nlegislation that supported Colorado's most vulnerable populations, and \nshe successfully advanced provisions that improved the living \nconditions of both the elderly and troubled youth.\n  Wilma also developed a prowess tackling thorny budgetary issues. As \nshe rose to become an influential member of the State legislature, she \nwas the first minority woman to earn a prestigious spot on the Joint \nBudget Committee responsible for guiding Colorado's budget priorities.\n  Yet Wilma's achievements go beyond what I have mentioned here and are \nnot limited to her time in the General Assembly. Those of us who know \nWilma know that her life extends far beyond that.\n  Wilma was the first African-American woman to be the First Lady of \nDenver. She stood by her husband, former Mayor Wellington Webb, as an \nactive leader in the affairs of the city and a respected figure within \nits diverse communities. I know how proud my friend Wellington is of \nhis wife, and vice versa. They are the epitome of a ``power couple,'' \nbut more importantly, a couple devoted to public service.\n  As First Lady, Wilma was unyielding in her efforts to end drug abuse \nand consequently devoted much of her time and energy to strengthening \nColorado's comprehensive anti-drug abuse programs. These programs, the \nfirst of their kind, were enacted as a result of a bill she carried \nduring her days in the Colorado State House.\n  Wilma was also devoted to resolving the unique issues facing families \nand youth throughout Denver. As if that did not keep her busy enough, \nWilma took on the responsibility of hosting local, national and foreign \ndignitaries in Denver, and also traveling abroad to over 23 countries \nto represent Denver and build relationships with worldwide partners. \nShe was instrumental in creating and implementing the Mayor's vision \nfor the arts and played a key role in revitalizing the cultural and \nartistic vitality of Denver. In one notable example, Wilma founded the \nDenver Art, Culture and Film Foundation to raise money for public art \nprojects.\n  And she certainly did not stop after her First Lady of Denver duties \nwere done. Colorado and the Mountain West were fortunate to have \nWilma's leadership extend to a new position: she became the U.S. \nSecretary of Labor's Representative for the Department of Labor's \nRegion VIII. To no one's surprise, Wilma yet again blazed a new trail \nas the first woman to fill this role, where she had significant \nbudgetary oversight and directed special projects to resolve labor and \nworkforce issues in the West. Her commitment to public service on the \nFederal level was just as productive as her time working at the State \nlevel.\n  It is clear Wilma has had an extraordinary career. She is warm, she \nis a visionary leader, she is exceptionally skilled, and she is driven \nby the desire to do what is right for Coloradans. Yet throughout her \nyears as a leader, she has maintained a strong sense of the importance \nof family. As a daughter, a wife, a mother and a grandmother, she has \nbeen a cornerstone for all those around her. As someone who values the \nimportance of balancing work life with family life, I respect the \nexample that Wilma sets in that regard.\n  As I conclude, let me say to my colleagues that I am proud--and \nColoradans are proud to count Wilma among our numbers. She has earned \nthe 2012 Civil Rights Award through her years of dedication, innovation \nand persistence in making Colorado a better place. She is a pioneer for \ncivil rights and a forward-thinking public servant who has etched her \nmark on the lives of Colorado's families, youth and marginalized \ncommunities. I commend Wilma for advancing the rights of every \nColoradan and for a lifetime of service to others. On behalf of all \nColoradans, I extend hearty congratulations on Wilma's well-earned \nhonor, with full confidence that she will continue her groundbreaking \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S564-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S564-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S564-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S564-S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013--PM 40\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  America was built on the idea that anyone who is willing to work hard \nand play by the rules, can make it if they try--no matter where they \nstarted out. By giving every American a fair shot, asking everyone to \ndo their fair share, and ensuring that everyone played by the same \nrules, we built the great American middle class and made our country a \nmodel for the world.\n  Today, America is still home to the world's best universities, most \nproductive workers, and most innovative companies. But for many \nAmericans, the basic bargain at the heart of the American Dream has \neroded.\n  Long before this recession hit, there was a widespread feeling that \nhard work had stopped paying off; that fewer and fewer of those who \ncontributed to the success of our economy actually benefited from that \nsuccess. Those at the very top grew wealthier while everyone else \nstruggled with paychecks that did not keep up with the rising cost of \neverything from college tuition to groceries. And as a result, too many \nfamilies found themselves taking on more and more debt just to keep \nup--often papered over by mounting credit card bills and home equity \nloans.\n  Then, in the middle of 2008, the house of cards collapsed. Too many \nmortgages had been sold to people who could not afford--or even \nunderstand--them. Banks had packaged too many risky loans into \nsecurities and then sold them to investors who were misled or \nmisinformed about the risks involved. Huge bets had been made and huge \nbonuses had been paid out with other people's money. And the regulators \nwho were supposed to prevent this crisis either looked the other way or \ndid not have the authority to act.\n  In the end, this growing debt and irresponsibility helped trigger the \nworst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Combined with new tax \ncuts and new mandatory programs that had never been paid for, it threw \nour country into a deep fiscal hole. And millions of hardworking \nAmericans lost their jobs, their homes, and their basic economic \nsecurity.\n  Today, we are seeing signs that our economy is on the mend. But we \nare not out of the woods yet. Instead, we are facing a make-or-break \nmoment for the middle class, and for all those who are fighting to get \nthere. What is at stake is whether or not this will be a country where \nworking people can earn enough to raise a family, build modest savings, \nown a home, and secure their retirement. This is the defining issue of \nour time.\n  This Budget reflects my deep belief that we must rise to meet this \nmoment--both for our economy and for the millions of Americans who have \nworked so hard to get ahead.\n  We built this Budget around the idea that our country has always done \nbest when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, \nand everyone plays by the same rules. It rejects the ``you're on your \nown'' economics that have led to a widening gap between the\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nrichest and poorest Americans that undermines both our belief in equal \nopportunity and the engine of our economic growth. When the middle \nclass is shrinking, and families can no longer afford to buy the goods \nand services that businesses are selling, it drags down our entire \neconomy. And countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and \nsteadier economic growth over the long run.\n\n  The way to rebuild our economy and strengthen the middle class is to \nmake sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success. Instead \nof lowering our standards and our sights, we need to win a race to the \ntop for good jobs that pay well and offer security for the middle \nclass. To succeed and thrive in the global, high-tech economy, we need \nAmerica to be a place with the highest-skilled, highest-educated \nworkers; the most advanced transportation and communication networks; \nand the strongest commitment to research and technology in the world. \nThis Budget makes investments that can help America win this race, \ncreate good jobs, and lead in the world economy.\n  And it does so with the understanding that we need an economy that is \nno longer burdened by years of debt and in which everyone shoulders \ntheir fair share to put our fiscal house in order. When I took office 3 \nyears ago, my Administration was left an annual deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion, or 9.2 percent of GDP, and a projected 10-year deficit of \nmore than $8 trillion. These deficits were the result of a previous 8 \nyears of undertaking initiatives, but not paying for them--especially \ntwo large tax cuts and a new Medicare prescription drug benefit--as \nwell as the financial crisis and recession that made the fiscal \nsituation worse as revenue decreased and automatic Government outlays \nincreased to counter the downturn.\n  We have taken many steps to re-establish fiscal responsibility, from \ninstituting a statutory pay-as-you-go rule for spending to going \nthrough the budget line by line looking for outdated, ineffective, or \nduplicative programs to cut or reform. Importantly, we enacted the \nAffordable Care Act, which will not only provide Americans with more \naffordable choices and freedom from insurance company abuses, but will \nalso reduce our budget deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next \ntwo decades.\n  As economic growth was beginning to take hold last year, I took \nfurther steps to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable path that \nwould strengthen the foundation of the economy for years to come. In \nApril of 2011, I put forward my Framework for Shared Prosperity and \nShared Fiscal Responsibility that built on the 2012 Budget to identify \n$4 trillion in deficit reduction. During negotiations over extending \nthe debt ceiling in the summer, I presented to congressional \nRepublicans another balanced plan to achieve $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction. Finally, in September, I sent my Plan for Economic Growth \nand Deficit Reduction to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction, which detailed a way to achieve $3 trillion in deficit \nreduction on top of the $1 trillion already achieved in the Budget \nControl Act of 2011 that I signed into law the previous month.\n  I also made sure that this plan covered the cost of the American Jobs \nAct--a set of bipartisan, commonsense proposals designed to put more \npeople back to work, put more money in the pockets of the middle class, \nand do so without adding a dime to the deficit at a time when it was \nclear that global events were slowing the economic recovery and our \nability to create more jobs. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress \nblocked both our deficit reduction measures and almost every part of \nthe American Jobs Act for the simple reason that they were unwilling to \nask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.\n  In the year ahead, I will continue to pursue policies that will shore \nup our economy and our fiscal situation. Together with the deficit \nreduction I signed into law this past year, this Budget will cut the \ndeficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. This will put the country \non a course to a level of deficits below 3 percent of GDP by the end of \nthe decade, and will also allow us to stabilize the Federal debt \nrelative to the size of the economy. To get there, this Budget contains \na number of steps to put us on a fiscally sustainable path.\n  First, this Budget implements the tight discretionary spending caps \nthat I signed into law in the Budget Control Act of 2011. These caps \nwill generate approximately $1 trillion in deficit reduction over the \nnext decade. Building on reductions we already have made, this will \nresult in a cut in discretionary spending of $42 billion since 2010 \nwhen higher levels of Federal spending were essential to provide a \njumpstart to the economy. Meeting the spending targets in this Budget \nmeant some very difficult choices: reforming, consolidating, or \nfreezing programs where we could; cutting programs that were not \neffective or essential and even some that were, but are now \nunaffordable; and precisely targeting our investments. Every department \nwill feel the impact of these reductions as they cut programs or \ntighten their belts to free up more resources for areas critical to \neconomic growth. And throughout the entire Government, we will continue \nour efforts to make programs and services work better and cost less: \nusing competition and high standards to get the most from the grants we \naward; getting rid of excess Federal real estate; and saving billions \nof dollars by cutting overhead and administrative costs.\n  Second, this Budget begins the process of implementing my new defense \nstrategy that reconfigures our force to meet the challenges of the \ncoming decade. Over the past 3 years, we have made historic investments \nin our troops and their capabilities, military families, and veterans. \nAfter a decade of war, we are at an inflection point: American troops \nhave left Iraq; we are undergoing a transition in Afghanistan so \nAfghans can assume more responsibility; and we have debilitated al \nQaeda's leadership, putting that terrorist network on the path to \ndefeat. At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here \nat home, which is the foundation of our strength in the world, and that \nincludes putting our fiscal house in order. To ensure that our defense \nbudget is driven by a clear strategy that reflects our national \ninterests, I directed the Secretary of Defense and military leadership \nto undertake a comprehensive strategic review.\n  I presented the results of the review, reflecting my guidance and the \nfull support of our Nation's military leadership, at the Pentagon on \nJanuary 5. There are several key elements to this new strategy. To \nsustain a global reach, we will strengthen our presence in the Asia \nPacific region and continue vigilance in the Middle East. We will \ninvest in critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which \nhas demonstrated time and again--most recently in Libya--that it is a \nforce multiplier. Looking past Iraq and Afghanistan to future threats, \nthe military no longer will be sized for large-scale, prolonged \nstability operations. The Department of Defense will focus \nmodernization on emerging threats and sustaining efforts to get rid of \noutdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities \nwe need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and \nreconnaissance capabilities. My Administration will continue to enhance \ncapabilities related to counterterrorism and countering weapons of mass \ndestruction, and we will also maintain the ability to operate in \nenvironments where adversaries try to deny us access. And, we will keep \nfaith with those who serve by giving priority to our wounded warriors, \nservicemembers' mental health, and the well-being of military families.\n  Adapting our forces to this new strategy will entail investing in \nhigh-priority programs, such as unmanned surveillance aircraft and \nupgraded tactical vehicles. It will mean terminating unnecessary and \nlower-priority programs such as the C-27 airlift aircraft and a new \nweather satellite and maintaining programs such as the Joint Strike \nFighter at a reduced level. All told, reductions in the growth of \ndefense spending will save $487 billion over the next 10 years. In \naddition, the end of our military activities in Iraq and the wind-down \nof operations in Afghanistan will mean that the country will spend 24 \npercent less on overseas contingency operations (OCO) this year than it \ndid last year, saving $30 billion. I also am proposing a multi-year cap \non OCO spending so that we fully realize the dividends of this change \nin policy.\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\n  Third, I believe that in our country, everyone must shoulder their \nfair share--especially those who have benefited the most from our \neconomy. In the United States of America, a teacher, a nurse, or a \nconstruction worker who earns $50,000 a year should not pay taxes at a \nhigher rate than somebody making $50 million. That is wrong. It is \nwrong for Warren Buffett's secretary to pay a higher tax rate than \nWarren Buffett. This is not about class warfare; this is about the \nNation's welfare. This is about making fair choices that benefit not \njust the people who have done fantastically well over the last few \ndecades, but that also benefit the middle class, those fighting to get \ninto the middle class, and the economy as a whole.\n  In the Budget, I reiterate my opposition to permanently extending the \nBush tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 a year and my \nopposition to a more generous estate tax than we had in 2009 benefiting \nonly the very largest estates. These policies were unfair and \nunaffordable when they were passed, and they remain so today. I will \npush for their expiration in the coming year. I also propose to \neliminate special tax breaks for oil and gas companies; preferred \ntreatment for the purchase of corporate jets; tax rules that give a \nlarger percentage deduction to the wealthiest two percent than to \nmiddle-class families for itemized deductions; and a loophole that \nallows some of the wealthiest money managers in the country to pay only \n15 percent tax on the millions of dollars they earn. And I support tax \nreform that observes the ``Buffett Rule'' that no household making more \nthan $1 million annually should pay a smaller share of its income taxes \nthan middle-class families pay.\n  Fourth, to build on the work we have done to reduce health care costs \nthrough the Affordable Care Act, I am proposing more than $360 billion \nin reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs over 10 \nyears. The goal of these reforms is to make these critical programs \nmore effective and efficient, and help make sure our health care system \nrewards high-quality medicine. What it does not do--and what I will not \nsupport--are efforts to turn Medicare into a voucher or Medicaid into a \nblock grant. Doing so would weaken both programs and break the promise \nthat we have made to American seniors, people with disabilities, and \nlow-income families--a promise I am committed to keeping.\n  Finally, to address other looming, long-term challenges to our fiscal \nhealth, I have put forward a wide range of mandatory savings. These \ninclude reductions in agricultural subsidies, changes in Federal \nemployee retirement and health benefits, reforms to the unemployment \ninsurance system and the Postal Service, and new efforts to provide a \nbetter return to taxpayers from mineral development. Drawn from the \nplan I presented to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, \nthese mandatory proposals would save $217 billion over the next decade.\n  Reining in our deficits is not an end in and of itself. It is a \nnecessary step to rebuilding a strong foundation so our economy can \ngrow and create good jobs. That is our ultimate goal. And as we tighten \nour belts by cutting, consolidating, and reforming programs, we also \nmust invest in the areas that will be critical to giving every American \na fair shot at success and creating an economy that is built to last.\n  That starts with taking action now to strengthen our economy and \nboost job creation. We need to finish the work we started last year by \nextending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for the rest of \nthis year. We also need to take additional measures to put more people \nback to work. That is why I introduced the American Jobs Act last year \nand why I will continue to put forward many of the ideas it contained, \nas well as additional measures, to put people back to work by \nrebuilding our infrastructure, providing businesses tax incentives to \ninvest and hire, and giving States aid to rehire teachers and first \nresponders.\n  We also know that education and lifelong learning will be critical \nfor anyone trying to compete for the jobs of the future. That is why I \nwill continue to make education a national mission. What one learns \nwill have a big impact on what he or she earns: the unemployment rate \nfor Americans with a college degree or more is only about half the \nnational average, and the incomes of college graduates are twice as \nhigh as those without a high school diploma.\n  When I took office, I set the goal for America to have the highest \nproportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. To reach that \ngoal, we increased the maximum annual Pell Grant by more than $900 to \nhelp nearly 10 million needy students afford a college education. The \n2013 Budget continues that commitment and provides the necessary \nresources to sustain the maximum award of $5,635. In this Budget, I \nalso propose a series of new proposals to help families with the costs \nof college including making permanent the American Opportunity Tax \nCredit, a partially refundable tax credit worth up to $10,000 per \nstudent over 4 years of college, and rewarding colleges and \nuniversities that act responsibly in setting tuition, providing the \nbest value, and serving needy students well.\n  To help our students graduate with the skills they will need for the \njobs of the future, we are continuing our effort to prepare 100,000 \nscience and math teachers over the next decade. To improve our \nelementary and secondary schools, we are continuing our commitment to \nthe Race to the Top initiative that rewards the most innovative and \neffective ways to raise standards, recruit and retain good teachers, \nand raise student achievement. My Budget invests $850 million in this \neffort, which already has been expanded to cover early learning and \nindividual school districts.\n  And to prepare our workers for the jobs of tomorrow, we need to turn \nour unemployment system into a re-employment system. That includes \ngiving more community colleges the resources they need to become \ncommunity career centers--places that teach skills that businesses are \nlooking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.\n  Once our students and workers gain the skills they need for the jobs \nof the future, we also need to make sure those jobs end up in America. \nIn today's high-tech, global economy, that means the United States must \nbe the best place in the world to take an idea from the drawing board \nto the factory floor to the store shelves. In this Budget, we are \nsustaining our level of investment in non-defense research and \ndevelopment (R) even as overall spending declines, thereby keeping us \non track to double R funding in the key R agencies. We are \nsupporting research at the National Institutes of Health that will \naccelerate the translation of new discoveries in biomedical science \ninto new therapies and cures, along with initiatives at the Food and \nDrug Administration that will speed the approval of new medicines. We \nmake important investments in the science and research needed to tackle \nthe most important environmental challenges of our time, and we are \ninvesting in fields as varied as cyber-security, nano-technology, and \nadvanced manufacturing. This Budget also puts an emphasis on the basic \nresearch that leads to the breakthroughs of tomorrow, which \nincreasingly is no longer being conducted by the private sector, as \nwell as helping inventors bring their innovations from laboratory to \nmarket.\n  This Budget reflects the importance of safeguarding our environment \nwhile strengthening our economy. We do not have to choose between \nhaving clean air and clean water and growing the economy. By conserving \niconic American landscapes, restoring significant ecosystems from the \nEverglades to the Great Lakes, and achieving measurable improvements in \nwater and air quality, we are working with communities to protect the \nnatural resources that serve as the engines of their local economies.\n\n  Moreover, this Budget continues my Administration's commitment to \ndeveloping America's diverse, clean sources of energy. The Budget \neliminates unwarranted tax breaks for oil companies, while extending \nkey tax incentives to spur investment in clean energy manufacturing and \nrenewable energy production. The Budget also invests in R to catalyze \nthe next generation of clean energy technologies. These investments \nwill help us achieve our goal of doubling the share of electricity from \nclean energy sources by 2035. By promoting American leadership in \nadvanced vehicle manufacturing, including funding to encourage\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\ngreater use of natural gas in the transportation sector, the Budget \nwill help us reach our goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by \n2025 and position the United States to become the first country to have \none million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. We also are working \nto decrease the amount of energy used by commercial and industrial \nbuildings by 20 percent to complement our ongoing efforts to improving \nthe efficiency of the residential sector. And we will work with the \nprivate sector, utilities, and States to increase the energy \nproductivity of American industries while investing in the innovative \nprocesses and materials that can dramatically reduce energy use.\n  It is also time for government to do its part to help make it easier \nfor entrepreneurs, inventors, and workers to grow their businesses and \nthrive in the global economy. I am calling on Congress to immediately \nbegin work on corporate tax reform that will close loopholes, lower the \noverall rate, encourage investment here at home, simplify taxes for \nAmerica's small businesses, and not add a dime to the deficit. \nMoreover, to further assist these companies, we need a comprehensive \nreorganization of the parts of the Federal Government that help \nbusinesses grow and sell their products abroad. If given consolidation \nauthority--which Presidents had for most of the 20th century--I will \npropose to consolidate six agencies into one Department, saving money, \nand making it easier for all companies--especially small businesses--\nget the help they need to thrive in the world economy.\n  Finally, this Budget advances the national security interests of the \nUnited States, including the security of the American people, the \nprosperity and trade that creates American jobs, and support for \nuniversal values around the world. It increases funding for the \ndiplomatic efforts that strengthen the alliances and partnerships that \nimprove international cooperation in meeting shared challenges, open \nnew markets to American exports, and promote development. It invests in \nthe intelligence and homeland security capabilities to detect, prevent, \nand defend against terrorist attacks against our country.\n  As we implement our new defense strategy, my Administration will \ninvest in the systems and capabilities we need so that our Armed Forces \nare configured to meet the challenges of the coming decade. We will \ncontinue to invest in improving global health and food security so that \nwe address the root causes of conflict and security threats. And we \nwill keep faith with our men and women in uniform, their families, and \nveterans who have served their Nation.\n  These proposals will take us a long way towards strengthening the \nmiddle class and giving families the sense of security they have been \nmissing for too long. But in the end, building an economy that works \nfor everyone will require all of us to take responsibility. Parents \nwill need to take greater responsibility for their children's \neducation. Homeowners will have to take more responsibility when it \ncomes to buying a house or taking out a loan. Businesses will have to \ntake responsibility for doing right by their workers and our country. \nAnd those of us in public service will need to keep finding ways to \nmake government more efficient and more effective.\n  Understanding and honoring the obligations we have to ourselves and \neach other is what has made this country great. We look out for each \nother, pull together, and do our part. But Americans also deserve to \nknow that their hard work will be rewarded.\n  This Budget is a step in the right direction. And I hope it will help \nserve as a roadmap for how we can grow the economy, create jobs, and \ngive Americans everywhere the security they deserve.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 13, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S567-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Hoeven, and Mr. Lugar):\n       S. 2100.

A bill to provide the authority to monitor and defend \nagainst cyber threats, to improve the sharing of cybersecurity \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act of 2012, which will improve the sharing of \ncyber threat and cybersecurity information in the private sector and \nwith the federal government.\n  We all know that the cyber threat is perhaps the number one threat to \nour Nation at this time. It is significant that just last month, at the \nSenate Intelligence Committee's hearing on\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\nWorldwide Threats, the U.S. Intelligence Community's official statement \nequated cyber threats to terrorism and proliferation as the highest \npriority threats to our security.\n  An unclassified report by the Intelligence Community made public in \nNovember 2011 said cyber intrusions against U.S. companies cost untold \nbillions of dollars annually and named China and Russia as aggressive \nand persistent cyber thieves.\n  One of the main obstacles to better U.S. cybersecurity is that a \ncombination of existing law, the threat of litigation, and standard \nbusiness practices prevent or deter the private sector from sharing \ninformation about the cyber threats they face and the losses of \ninformation and money they suffer.\n  We know there have been multi-million dollar cyber thefts from the \nRoyal Bank of Scotland, Citibank, and other financial institutions. But \ncompanies like these are reticent about making public these cyber \nattacks because that could further damage their bottom line.\n  Even cyber security companies like RSA and national security agencies \nlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation fall victim to malicious cyber \nactivity, but the lessons learned from those attacks are generally not \nshared with others that face the same threat.\n  Finally, cyber criminals violate our privacy by hacking into the \ncomputers in our homes. They steal passwords for our bank accounts, \naccess our private information, and turn our computers into launching \npoints for further attacks.\n  These cyber intrusions affect Americans in substantial and real ways, \nand the threat is only growing. After reviewing the intelligence for \nmany years on the cyber threat, it is clear to me that foreign nations \nand non-state actors are already causing major damage to our economy. I \nam also convinced that these bad actors are capable of causing \npotentially catastrophic loss of life and economic damage by opening a \ndam, crashing our financial system, or bringing down the electric grid.\n  For these reasons, I am very pleased that Majority Leader Reid is \nbringing comprehensive cybersecurity legislation to the Senate Floor \nafter the President's Day Recess.\n  For 2 years, Leader Reid has worked with the Chairmen and Ranking \nMembers of all the committees of jurisdiction on cybersecurity to \nproduce this legislation, and Senators Rockefeller, Collins, Lieberman \nand Snowe in particular are to be commended for their extensive efforts \nin this area.\n  As the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I am particularly \ninterested in legislation to address the need for better information \nsharing.\n  The intelligence committees in the Senate and House have been working \nto improve information sharing on counterterrorism since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. The urgency in the cyber arena is just as \nimportant, but is, if anything, more difficult, as we must coordinate \nand protect the sharing of information that will go to a far greater \nnumber of entities, both public and private.\n  Unfortunately, the private sector entities that operate the critical \nnetworks that control financial markets, power plants, dams, and \ncommunications are prevented in very real ways from sharing information \nto warn each other of cyber threats. Barriers to such sharing include \nperceived financial and reputational risks; legal barriers in \nelectronic surveillance laws; liability concerns that arise from \npotential lawsuits; and lack of one Federal agency in charge of cyber \ninformation sharing.\n  The bill I am introducing today will allow for more information \nsharing by providing clear authority to share cyber threat information \nand by reducing legal barriers to private entities' ability to work \nwith each other and with the federal government to share cybersecurity \ninformation, in a manner that upholds privacy and civil liberties.\n  Participation in information sharing in this bill would be voluntary \nfor companies, but any company that does share threat information will \nbe protected for doing so, and the information would be subject to \nstrict privacy controls.\n  I also want to be very clear that this bill does not give law \nenforcement or the Intelligence Community any new authorities for \nconducting surveillance.\n  In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on January 27, 2012, \nformer Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, former \nSecretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, and former Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Bill Lynn said that the Intelligence Community \nneeds to make cyber threat information available to other parts of the \ngovernment and to commercial entities to maximize our cyber defenses.\n  The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2012 would do just that.\n  Specifically, this legislation requires the Federal government to \ndesignate a single focal point for cybersecurity information sharing. \nThe bill refers to this focal point as a ``Cybersecurity Exchange'' \nbecause with cybersecurity, it's not enough for entities to operate as \n``centers'' or ``task forces'' that only receive information; they must \nalso serve as a hub for appropriately distributing and exchanging cyber \nthreat information. The bill also requires the government to reduce \nbureaucratic obstacles to sharing so that the government can be a more \neffective partner for the private sector.\n  The bill establishes procedures for the government to share \nclassified cybersecurity threat information with certified private \nsector entities. Generally, only government contractors can receive a \nsecurity clearance, but other companies, such as Internet Service \nProviders, need to receive classified threat information in order to \nprotect against attacks. This bill makes them eligible to receive \nsecurity clearances for that purpose. Those companies would be under \nthe same restrictions to protect classified information as the \ngovernment.\n  The bill removes legal and policy barriers to information sharing by \naffirmatively authorizing private sector entities to monitor and defend \ntheir own networks and to share cyber information.\n  By creating a robust privacy compliance regime to ensure that \ninformation in the Federal government's hands is protected. Just as the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Privacy Act, and many other \nstatutes place conditions on the government's ability to use \ninformation it receives, this bill would limit the government's ability \nto use private sector cyber information for approved cybersecurity \npurposes only.\n  And also by providing appropriate liability protections for companies \nthat share cyber information under the terms of the bill. A company \nthat shares threat information with a cybersecurity exchange or with \nother private sector entities is protected under this bill from \nlitigation for having done so. Many companies have told us that the \nthreat of litigation deters them from sharing details about cyber \nattacks they have faced. In order to assist other companies and the \ngovernment to protect against those attacks in the future, that \ninformation needs to be shared and acted upon.\n  I look forward to the consideration of this bill and the rest of the \ncyber legislative package that will be taken up by the Senate soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S569-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S569-S570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1534.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1162, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1162) to provide the Quileute Indian Tribe \n     Tsunami and Flood Protection, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1162) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, for decades the Quileute Tribe in the \nPacific Northwest has waited for a chance to move out of the tsunami \nzone they are in and to safety.\n  Every day 80 students go to a school in a schoolhouse that is just 1 \nfoot above sea level, and every day they look directly out the window \nat the roaring waves of the powerful ocean and wonder when they can \nmove to safer, higher ground.\n  When the tragic tsunami hit Japan last March and when a recent \nearthquake in just the last few weeks hit off Vancouver Island, it sent \nanother urgent message, a wake-up call to hurry to get this legislation \npassed through Congress. The Department of the Interior, which endorsed \nthis legislation, said the tsunami ``clearly demonstrates the risk for \nthe tribe and its citizens, and the need to move housing and \ninfrastructure inland.''\n  Now, with the 1-year anniversary of this tragedy less than 1 month \naway, we have finally done our job. With the passage of this bill \ntonight, the Quileute Tribe can finally begin to move out of the flood \nzone. I thank Congressman Norm Dicks for his help in making this a \nreality.\n  The Quileute Tribe has been struggling with the natural perils of \nthis land since their reservation was created in 1889. The river that \nruns through the reservation has been moving constantly over the last \ncentury, causing more erosion and flooding problems. The one road that \nconnects the lower village to the higher ground is often flooded, \nmaking it even more challenging to deal with this particular area in \ncase of a tsunami.\n  The Quileute struggle to move out of the flood zone has gone on for \nmany years, but tonight, with the passage of this legislation, the \nQuileute Tribe can now move to higher grounds and a safer means to \nprovide for their members. This is an important victory to give the \nQuileute Tribe and those on the reservation peace of mind.\n  I thank Senator Barrasso and Senator Akaka for helping this \nlegislation move out of the Indian Affairs Committee and Senator \nBingaman and Senator Murkowski for helping it move out of the ENR \nCommittee. To the tribal chairs--Bonita Cleveland and now Tony Foster--\nthank you for coming to Washington, DC, and explaining how important \nthis legislation is. I also thank the National Park Service and the \nNational Park Service Director. Thank you for your help in getting this \nlegislation passed. I also thank Senator Murray for her cosponsorship \nof this important legislation.\n  It is important in times such as these that Congress does act, that \nwe break gridlock and move forward. For the Quileute Tribe--a tribe \nthat gained much national notoriety in a recent movie series--what is \nreally important is not that notoriety but the fact that today people \nhave come together to help them move to safer grounds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/13/senate-section/article/S582-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2012\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.
