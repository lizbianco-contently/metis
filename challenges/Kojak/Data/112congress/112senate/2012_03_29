Mr. President, over the past decade, the five major oil \ncompanies have made more than $1 trillion--that is not billions; it is \n``T,'' trillions. They have also taken home billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer subsidies--our money they have also taken--to add to those \ngrossly exaggerated profits. They get these subsidies they do not need.\n  You do not need to take my word for it. Even oil executives admit an \nindustry making hundreds of billions of dollars in profits every year \ndoes not need a handout from the American taxpayer.\n  Former Shell CEO John Hofmeister said a decade of high gas prices is \nincentive enough for oil companies to drill for more oil:\n\n       My point of view is that with high oil prices, such \n     subsidies are [totally] unnecessary.\n\n  We agree. So do almost 80 percent of the American people. There is no \nreason for these companies--five companies last year made $137 \nbillion--to need subsidies from the American taxpayer.\n  So today Senate Republicans are going to have a chance--another \nchance, another opportunity--to show Americans where they stand on this \nissue. I hope they will allow us to invoke cloture on this and to \ncomplete this legislation today. They appear poised, however--what I \nhave heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle--to pick the \npockets of American taxpayers in order to line the pockets of these oil \nexecutives.\n  But unless we vote to repeal these wasteful giveaways, the country \nwill spend another $25 billion over the next decade making these rich \noil companies that much richer.\n  The oil executives who benefit from this bad policy--and the \nRepublicans who go to bat for them--want you to believe repealing \ntaxpayer subsidies will increase gas prices. It is not true. The only \neffective way to bring down prices at the pump is to reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil.\n  We have made progress toward that during the Obama years. For almost\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nthe 4 years he has been in office, domestic oil production has \nincreased every year, and America's dependence on foreign oil has \ndecreased every year.\n  Everyone should hear again what I said: During the Obama years, \ndomestic oil production has increased, dependence on foreign oil has \ndecreased.\n  Last year, America used a lower percentage of foreign oil than at any \ntime in almost two decades, thanks to President Obama's smart energy \npolicies. We have heard speeches in the last couple days here in effect \nsaying: Drill, baby, drill. We are doing a good job. We cannot produce \nour way out of this mess we are in. America controls less than 2 \npercent of the oil in the world. We use more than 20 percent of it. And \neven though we are doing better--and that is good--we must lessen our \ndependence. We must become energy independent. And we can do that.\n  There are huge discoveries of natural gas that the Republicans voted \nagainst using. Can you imagine that? A bipartisan bill, Menendez-Burr, \nto use the natural gas. We have more natural gas reserves than any \nother country in the world. So we wanted to start a program here: Why \ndon't we use some of it? Boone Pickens--by the way, who is not a \nDemocrat--it is his idea, joined by others: to move the big fleets we \nhave. Millions of these 18-wheelers every day use all this fuel \nunnecessarily. We could convert these to natural gas--less polluting, \neasier on the engines. But the Republicans voted against that. I guess \nthe oil companies would rather we use their oil.\n  The prices at the pump continue to rise. That is because chanting, as \nI said, ``drill, baby, drill'' is not a comprehensive solution to this \nNation's energy problems, including high gas prices. We know what is \ngoing on in the Middle East. We know there are complicated issues. We \nneed to continue responsible domestic oil exploration. But we cannot \ndrill our way to energy independence, as I have said. America must also \ninvest in clean energy technologies that will free us from our \naddiction to oil over the long term.\n  President Obama was in Nevada last week. Between a place called \nRailroad Pass and my home in Searchlight, there is a huge what we used \nto call a dry lake. On that--Boulder City now owns that real estate--\nthey have allowed huge construction projects of solar. You drive by \nthat--it used to be, when I was a little boy, we would drive by that \ndry lake, and if you looked out there, it looked as though there was \nwater. It was a mirage. Now it is not a mirage. It looks like a lake \nbecause there are all those solar panels--more than a million of them \nthere producing huge amounts of energy, nonpolluting. That is the way \nit should be. We should do lots more of that.\n  Repealing $24 billion in lavish subsidies to oil companies would pay \nfor those clean energy investments, with money to spare. With the \nsavings, we can help move forward proven technologies such as solar, \nwind, advanced batteries, and even next-generation vehicles. We can \ngive innovators the tools they need to bring the next electric car or \nadvanced solar panel from the drawing board to the boardroom.\n  As most everyone knows, my wife has not been well, so I have not been \ngoing to Nevada as much as I had over the 30 years I have been here. \nBut I am going out this coming week because she is doing much better. \nOne of the people I am going to visit next week is a man by the name of \nByron Georgiou, who has developed a company for electric cars. I am \nlooking forward to that. They are a manufacturer there in Nevada. It is \nprograms like this that we need. We need to give innovators the tools \nthey need to bring the next electric car, as we have in Nevada, or \nadvanced solar panel from the drawing board to the boardroom, and we \ncan pay down the deficit with the money that is left over. But we \ncannot do any of that if we continue to give taxpayer dollars to the \nmost profitable corporations in the world--corporations that made, as I \nindicated, a record $137 billion in profits last year. It is easy to \nkeep track of because there are only five of them, these multinational \ncorporations.\n  This morning, when the Republicans consider whether to put oil \ncompany coffers ahead of taxpayers' wallets, I hope they consider this \nfact: The five major oil companies raked in last year $260,000--it is \nactually more--more than $260,000 in profits every minute of every day \nfor 1 year. They did not take Christmas off. It was still made during \nChristmas: $265,000 a minute. During Thanksgiving, New Year's, they got \nthe money; more than $260,000 a minute. That is a huge amount: $260,000 \nin profits every minute--every minute--24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nIt takes a typical family 5 years to earn what those oil companies took \nhome in profits in a single minute last year.\n  American families are struggling. Big oil companies are not. Before \nmy Republican colleagues vote to send another taxpayer dollar to Big \nOil, I hope they will consider the $260,000 a minute, and I hope they \nwill make the right decision as we vote at 11:30 today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2188-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first 30 \nminutes and the Republicans controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Big Oil Subsidies\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today in a moment when \nAmerica is in crisis, and I don't think we are paying appropriate \nattention to the problems that befall our society. There are still too \nmany people out of work, too many people who can't afford health care \npresently, and too many people who can't educate their children because \nthey don't have the means. They are struggling. Millions of homes are \nstill on the edge of foreclosure. And here we see a situation that is \nunacceptable under any stretch of the imagination.\n  I rise today to talk to the American people who are struggling every \nweek to provide the necessities for family life. At the same time, I \nask my Republican colleagues why they would insist on continuing tax \nsubsidies--gifts, really--to multibillion-dollar oil companies at the \nexpense of ordinary, hard-working, middle-income families. Right now, \nthese families are forced to come up with $4 per gallon--$60 to $80 \ndollars, typically--to fill the tank every time they have to go to the \ngas station. That is a huge burden. The big five oil companies have \nmade almost $1 trillion in profits in the last decade. Look at how much \nmoney these companies made in the last year alone. It was a record $137 \nbillion between the big five oil companies.\n\n  Look at them: ExxonMobil--these poor guys need a subsidy. They only \nmade $41 billion--$41 billion--in a single year. Look down the list. \nThe last of the five must believe that trying to catch up is pretty \ntough. They only made $12 billion. That is Conoco, the last. In 1 year, \nthey made $12 billion.\n  Given how well these companies are doing, why are we giving them \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks? The legislation we are voting on \ntoday presents a better idea. It says we should end these tax breaks \nand instead invest in clean energy solutions that can break our \ndangerous dependence on oil.\n  Investing in renewable energy has helped launch industries that \ncreate jobs and clean up our air and provide homemade -- homemade -- \nAmerican power. Clean energy is also our best chance to break through \nspiraling gas\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nprices and our reliance on foreign oil. One would think our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle would want to put a stop to the \npunishing effects of higher and higher gas prices on middle-income \nworking people. Why wouldn't they want to end America's dependence on \nfossil fuels and eliminate needless tax breaks for oil companies? Two \nwords: Big Oil.\n  Big Oil is doing all it can to protect their tax breaks. Even a \nretired chairman and CEO of Exxon said it is not necessary; they do not \nneed it. But they are taking it. Big Oil is doing all it can to protect \ntheir tax breaks, and the Republicans are lining up to help Big Oil.\n  It is time to tell the truth. Making oil companies pay their fair \nshare in taxes is not going to raise the price of gas, contrary to what \nthey publish. It just means Big Oil executives might have to trim their \nsail a little bit and share in the problems we have. A long time ago \nwhen I was a soldier, we had an excess profits tax for companies that \nmade, in a way, unconscionable amounts of money based on the situation \nour country was facing. So it is just a matter of sharing some of the \nresponsibility our country has in order to keep everybody feeling as \nthough they are participating in the American dream, not a nightmare.\n  While millions of Americans are struggling every week to pay their \nbills, everybody should take a look at how much oil companies are \npaying their executives. Here is a fellow who personally runs \nExxonMobil, the CEO, and he was paid $29 million last year. That is \nwhat I said, $29 million. Conoco Phillips' CEO received $18 million, \nand Chevron's exec made $16 million in income in 1 single year.\n  By the way, that is from money earned for an essential product. When \nwe look at gasoline, it almost compares to having medicines available \nbecause when we look at the cost of gasoline, we might ask: What would \nit take to educate all the children who can learn? Way less than we see \ndemonstrated on these charts and their balance sheets. Working men and \nwomen in this country on average make just over $27,000 a year--$27,000 \na year.\n  I don't begrudge high profits. I really don't. I ran a big company, a \ncompany I helped start, which has 45,000 employees. It is a huge \ncompany. It is a company that calculates the employment records every \nmonth. The company is called ADT. So I don't mind big profits.\n  The question is, Who are you taking them from and how critical is the \nproduct they are being forced to buy? Right now, people are paying an \naverage of $3.91 per gallon of gas.\n  What about the people who live in other places? We picked at random a \ncounty in Mississippi. The county is called Issaquena County. Last \nyear, the entire income for all the people in that county who were \nworking was just over $16 million. All the people in a single county \nmade $16 million. This poor guy at Chevron made $16 million by himself, \nand the others would leave all of those in that county way behind. A \nsingle oil company CEO made more in 1 year than all the people in that \ncounty put together. These hard-working people are already contributing \nto the income of oil executives whenever they fill up their gas tanks. \nIs it fair to ask them to chip in with their tax dollars to pay even \nmore toward these record-setting salaries?\n  Over the last 10 years, CEO pay at Exxon and Chevron has more than \ntripled. Over the same period, gas prices have nearly tripled. The \npicture is clear: Working people are struggling to fill up their tanks \nwhile oil executives are struggling to carry their big fat paychecks to \nthe bank. It is almost beyond belief that Senators are lining up to \nprotect tax breaks for oil companies--some Senators, I say--beyond \nbelief.\n  I say to them: Mind your responsibilities. You were elected not just \nby oil company executives or even oil company employees. Let's focus on \nthe hard-working Americans who are paying more and more at the gas \npump, the clean energy workers who might lose their jobs, and our men \nand women in uniform who put their lives on the line to protect oil \nsupplies.\n  The American people know these subsidies are unnecessary, that they \nare ineffective, and they are immoral considering the conditions that \nexist in our society. Continuing to subsidize oil companies only \nincreases our dependence on dirty fuels. It keeps us on a dead-end road \nto sky-high energy bills, more oilspills, and dangerous pollution \nlevels.\n  So I call on my colleagues to kick Big Oil off of the welfare rolls \nand invest in clean energy jobs. Let's end the industry's tax breaks \nand break our country's addiction to oil and other dirty fuels. Let's \ninvest in clean energy and smart transportation, not windfalls for oil \nindustry executives and lobbyists. Let's make certain our children and \nour grandchildren inherit a country that is fiscally sound, morally \nresponsible, and free from its dependence on oil.\n  Let's not worry about the oil companies. They can take care of \nthemselves. Let's stop this drain on our society, this drain on \nworking-class citizens. Let's pay attention to the millions and \nmillions of people in America who say: Just give us a chance, give us a \nchance to make a decent living; give us a chance to educate our \nchildren; give us a chance to keep our jobs; give us a chance to \nmaintain our homes; get us off the possible foreclosure line. That is \nwhat we are looking for.\n  That is the purpose of this legislation--to say to the American \npeople: Look in this Chamber, Mr. and Mrs. America. Look in this \nChamber and see the people who are supporting Big Oil profit fattening. \nLook at those who are supporting these profits.\n  Again, I don't mind companies making profits, but when the profits \ncome in almost blood money, when you think of the effect gasoline has \non family life, it is unfair, it is indecent, and it is improper.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Our friends on the other side, the Senate Democrats, \nhave put on a clinic this week on how not to run a serious legislative \nbody. If they have achieved anything at all, it is to make Americans \neven more frustrated with Congress, as if that were possible.\n  Faced with skyrocketing gas prices, Senate Democrats turned to a bill \nthat even they admit doesn't lower them. Then, to make matters worse, \nthey blocked Republicans from offering anything that might. That was \ntheir brilliant plan on how to deal with gas prices: raise taxes on \nenergy companies, when gas is already hovering around $4 a gallon, then \nblock consideration of anything else just to make sure gas prices don't \ngo anywhere but up.\n  Somehow they thought doing this would set up some kind of political \nwin for them, which, frankly, I don't understand. I mean, I can't \nimagine anybody giving them any high-fives for not lowering gas prices. \nBut, anyway, that was obviously the plan. It appears to have fallen \nshort because now they want to move off this issue and on to another \npolitical vote to yet another debate where the goal isn't to make a \ndifference but, rather, to make a point--to increase taxes not lower \nprices at the pump.\n  Well, I don't expect this next vote will have the political punch \nthey expect either. But that is the Democratic plan anyway. It is \ngetting quite tedious. Day after day after day, Senate Democrats all \nchoose to come out here not so we can make an actual difference in the \nlives of working Americans and families struggling to fill the gas \ntank, but so we can watch them stage votes for show. For some reason \nthey thought they would put some political points on the board this \nweek if the American people saw them voting for a tax hike we all knew \nahead of time didn't have the votes to pass.\n  That didn't work. If anyone has any doubt about that, just ask \nyourself why they were moving to actually get off of it. Now they think \nthey will score political points by staging another vote on a tax hike \nwe know doesn't have the votes to pass.\n  None of this makes sense to me. But that is how the Democrats have \nchosen to run this place. If they want to keep trying to distract the \nAmerican people from the fact they do not have any solutions to the \nproblems we face, that is their prerogative. But that is not going to \nkeep Republicans from talking about ours. That is not going to keep us \nfrom trying to actually make a difference around here.\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\n  Surveys show two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the way the \nPresident is handling high gas prices.\n  We know high gas prices are having a negative impact on Americans' \ndaily lives. So we think the American people are entitled to this \ndebate. They sent us to do something other than put on a show, and that \nis why we will continue to insist on a serious debate.\n  The majority leader frequently complains there isn't any time to \nfocus on priorities such as cybersecurity, postal reform, and the \nExport-Import Bank, not to mention maybe passing a budget for the first \ntime in 3 years. Yet he seems to find the time to hold not one but two \npolitical show votes on tax hikes.\n  The way I see it, the American people didn't send us to score \npolitical points. As I said, they sent us to make a difference. So I \nwill be voting against this tax hike on American energy manufacturers, \nand I would urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I hope that when the Senate returns in April, Democrats will have \nheard from their constituents and will focus on jobs and prices at the \npump--rather than the latest political vote.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if my friend would yield. I have a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on S. 2204, which is currently set for 11:30, be moved to start at \n11:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Members should not be worried about this because we will \nkeep the vote open until at least noon. So everybody who was scheduling \nto vote at 11:30 can still do that.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we have all been following what has \nbeen going on across the street this week with great interest. While we \nall have our preferences, none of us knows at this point how the \nSupreme Court will rule. But one thing we should all be able to agree \non is that the President's health care bill is a mess, an absolute \nmess.\n  The American people clearly don't like it. Polls show the majority \nwant the law repealed. More than two-thirds of the public, including \nmost Democrats, believe the core of this bill is unconstitutional. It \nis loaded, literally loaded with broken promises.\n  The President said it would lower costs. It is, in fact, raising \ncosts. Proponents said it would create jobs. Now we know it means fewer \njobs. The President said families would save on their premiums. They \nare, in fact, going up. He said people would be able to keep the \ninsurance they have and like. They will not. CBO's most likely \nprediction finds 3 to 5 million Americans will lose their current plan \nevery single year. The President said he would protect Medicare, but, \ninstead, the law raids Medicare for over $500 billion, cutting billions \nfrom hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and Medicare Advantage.\n  The President promised the American people their taxes wouldn't go up \none penny. Two years later, the American people found out their taxes \nwill be going up by more than $550 billion. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation found no fewer than 11 separate taxes and penalties that fall \nsquarely on the middle class.\n  Remember the CLASS Act? The administration said it would be fiscally \nstable and would reduce the deficit. A couple months ago, it was \ndetermined to be unsustainable and was shut down before it even began.\n  The President told the American people, ``Federal conscience laws \nwill remain in place.'' Two years later, he turned around and gave his \napproval to HHS to mandate that religious-affiliated schools, \nuniversities, hospitals, and charities would have to violate their \nreligious tenets or pay a hefty fine.\n  Finally, the health care law will increase Medicaid rolls by nearly \n25 million people, costing already cash-strapped States another $118 \nbillion--money many Governors, including Kentucky's, don't know where \nto get.\n  This law is bad for Kentucky, it is bad for the country, and it is \nbad for health care. Americans don't want it. Regardless of what the \ncourt decides this summer, it should be repealed and it should be \nreplaced. It should be replaced with commonsense reforms that lower \ncosts and that Americans actually want--reforms that protect jobs and \nState budgets, reduce the deficit, reform entitlements, and strengthen \nMedicare.\n  One broken promise is one too many. This law is full of broken \npromises from top to bottom.\n  Two years ago, then-Speaker Pelosi said we would have to pass this \nbill to find out what was in it. Now we know. The American people have \nhad a chance to decide for themselves. They don't like it. They want it \nrepealed, and that is what we plan to do.\n\n\n                             Tornado Relief\n\n  Madam President, I once again share with my colleagues stories of the \nheartbreaking events in my home State of Kentucky in the aftermath of \nthe horrific wave of storms and tornadoes that ravaged my State, along \nwith several others in the Midwest, earlier this month.\n  As I have already stated on the floor, these were very severe \ntornadoes, with at least 11 funnel clouds confirmed by the National \nWeather Service to have touched down in my State, blowing at wind \nspeeds up to 125 miles an hour.\n  We know 24 Kentuckians lost their lives and more than 300 were \ninjured. Many homes, churches, schools, and places of business were \ndestroyed. Scenes of destruction still exist across the State in places \nsuch as Magoffin County, Menifee County, Kenton, Morgan, Laurel, \nLawrence, Martin, Pulaski, Johnson, and Trimble, all those counties in \nmy State which were among the hardest hit.\n  Kentuckians are working hard to rebuild. I am pleased to say that \ndespite the tragedy of lives lost, families grieving, and memories \ndestroyed forever, there is some good news to report; that is, how \ninspiring it is to see so many good-hearted Kentuckians come together \nto provide for their neighbors in the wake of these tornadoes.\n  Take, for example, the congregation of Arthur Ridge Baptist Church in \nthe town of East Bernstadt, located in Laurel County. Thanks to the \nleadership of Pastor Steve Smith, Arthur Ridge Baptist Church opened \nits doors within hours of the storm's end to provide food and shelter \nfor those who needed it.\n\n  Pastor Smith kept the church doors open for 24 hours a day and served \nup to 700 meals a day to local residents who had no food, no kitchen, \nand no home to call their own. According to Pastor Smith, people from \nall over the area pitched in. Folks from different churches worked to \nprepare meals, and many residents donated items such as dishes, \nsilverware, toiletries, pillows, and blankets for care packages to \ndistribute to the victims of the storm. Local businesses did their part \ntoo. The nearby Little Caesar's pizza in London gave away 120 pizzas in \n1 day, soon after the tornadoes. Many other local restaurants donated \nfood as well.\n  Thanks in part to the efforts of Pastor Smith and the congregation of \nArthur Ridge Baptist Church, life is just a little bit better for many \nin East Bernstadt. At first, the church had to tend to people's most \nimmediate and ``simple needs--water, a hot meal, an air mattress to \nsleep on,'' says Pastor Smith, who is a Laurel County native and has \nbeen the pastor at Arthur Ridge now for 6 years. He says, however, \n``People are over the shock and awe.''\n  Weeks after the tornadoes passed, the church was still open 14 hours \na day, distributing 125 to 150 meals a day and running a clothing \ndistribution center. Pastor Smith's latest focus was on finding a place \nto set up donated washing and drying machines so local storm victims \nwithout homes can actually clean their clothes.\n  Over 3,500 people have registered to volunteer in the region, and as \nof last week over 25,000 meals had been served to displaced families.\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n  This is just one story of how many Kentuckians have joined together \nto help the least fortunate in my State. Hawk Creek Baptist Church in \nLaurel County, First Baptist Church of East Bernstadt, and Trinity \nFreewill Baptist Church of Martin County also opened their doors to \nprovide shelter and relief to displaced Kentuckians and the volunteers \nworking to help them in the days after the disaster struck.\n  Jim Paul, director of the organization called Ken-Tenn Relief Team, \nwas in East Bernstadt the morning after the storms with food supplies. \nHe trucked in a tractor-trailer load of donated food and other items \nand personally volunteered dozens of hours in at least three counties \nto aid storm victims.\n  In Morgan County, the local Appalachian Regional Healthcare hospital \nsuffered serious damage. Every second-floor window of the hospital was \nliterally blown out, doors were torn off their hinges, and part of the \nroof was ripped off. Dozens of people were injured and the patients had \nto be evacuated to nearby hospitals.\n  Luckily, Martie and Teresa Johnson, owners of a nearby Wendy's \nrestaurant, stepped in to help. They served 450 hot meals to the \ncleanup crew who came in to repair the Morgan County ARH hospital and \nalso traveled to Salyersville and gave away food there.\n  One television station in Hazard, WYMT, held a telethon to raise \nmoney for victims across the State. I was pleased to play a small part \nin that effort myself, as the television station asked me to record a \ngreeting describing the devastating effects of the tornados. The people \nof the region raised over $180,000 in the telethon for disaster relief.\n  The local J.C. Penney of Corbin donated clothing and shoes to area \nelementary school students, and the employees of the store took up a \ncollection to donate winter, spring, and summer clothing for the \nchildren.\n  ``Some of [the employees] don't have a lot to give, but when this \ncame up, they all wanted to know what else we needed,'' says Tiffany \nFlint, the Corbin J.C. Penney store manager.\n\n       We hope it will help the children to look good and feel \n     good. We just wanted to do this to help them get back on \n     their feet.\n\n  The men's soccer team from Kentucky's University of the Cumberlands \ndonated some of their time to help the less fortunate. Head soccer \ncoach Brenton Benware, his staff, and nearly 30 student athletes drove \nto East Bernstadt to help clean up debris in the area.\n  ``Going . . . was just another reminder of how blessed we really \nare,'' said Coach Benware. ``I think we were all deeply affected by \nwhat we saw and reminded how important it is to serve and help our \nneighbors in times of need.''\n  While there, the University of the Cumberlands soccer team may have \nrun into the soccer team from Union College, which also traveled to \nLaurel County to help. The team stacked wood from downed trees, cleared \ndebris from backyards, and helped a man move a displaced steel roof \nthat the tornado had deposited in his yard.\n  Union College dean of students Debbie D'Anna was responsible for \nsponsoring the trip, while the school's campus food services donated \nsnacks and bottled water, and James Jimerson of the school's physical \nplant loaned out tools. Local businesses, such as Knox Hardware and \nPope's Lumber, donated work and cleaning supplies. Many faculty, staff \nand students of Union College donated items such as food, clothing, and \nother essentials.\n  In Salyersville, a town in Magoffin County, the block known as \n``Restaurant Row'' was hit by a tornado and nearly every restaurant on \nit destroyed. One of the few left was a Dairy Queen owned by Doug and \nSue Mortimer.\n  On the night of the storms, they opened their restaurant, running on \ngenerator power, and served free meals to the volunteers working to \nclean up the wreckage.\n  Several Home Depot stores in Kentucky and Indiana contributed to the \nrelief efforts as well. In the West Liberty area, district manager \nBecky Young and store manager Jim Householder coordinated donations of \napproximately $2,600, and Jim's store employees were out immediately \nafter the storm handing out paper towels, trash bags, and gloves to \nrelief volunteers.\n  Other Home Depot stores in Kentucky and Indiana, led by district \nmanager Tim Choate and district human resource manager Lee Ann Bruce, \ndonated thousands of dollars' worth of products such as chainsaws, \ngloves, respirators, tarps, water, and trash bags to organizations such \nas the Henryville Fire Department and local United Way chapters. And \nstore employees volunteered to assist those organizations in the \nrecovery.\n  Lowe's stores in Kentucky have also pitched in, providing gloves, \ntarps, shovels, bleach, and other supplies to communities all across \nthe State. In addition to over $300,000 donated by the company to \nrelief efforts after the storms, the Lowe's district manager for \nKentucky, Stephen West, dispatched ``Lowe's Heroes,'' store employees \nwho are volunteering their time and construction know-how.\n  Local Walmart stores in Kentucky as well as the company's foundation \nhave provided tens of thousands of dollars' worth of water, cleaning \nsupplies, baby food, diapers, and more to help the community. Bob \nGound, the market human resources manager for Walmart locations in \neastern Kentucky, has taken the lead in coordinating these efforts. And \nlocal store employees are making bag lunches and handing them out in \nthe hardest-hit Kentucky communities.\n  I have seen firsthand in my recent visits to the Bluegrass State both \nhow severe the destruction is, and how hard the people of Kentucky are \nworking to rebuild and lift their neighbors out of the dire \ncircumstances that the cruel forces of nature have put so many of them \nin.\n  It is thanks to altruistic and generous Kentuckians like Pastor Steve \nSmith, among many others, that I am confident that the Kentuckians hurt \nby these storms will recover. I and my staff throughout the State have \nheard so many heart-warming stories like the few I have just shared \nthat it would not be possible for me to recite them all on this Senate \nfloor.\n  But I hope that the few stories I have shared are more than enough to \nreassure my colleagues, the people of Kentucky, and the world that we \nKentuckians are stout of heart and firm in our resolve. We will prevail \nover this tragedy. We will rebuild towns like East Bernstadt to be \nbetter than they were before. And the families of Kentucky will \nhopefully one day heal the wounds in their hearts and continue on.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Laura Dove\n\n  Madam President, I know I have inconvenienced the Senator from \nGeorgia, but I have one more rather brief comment. I would like to say \na few words about Laura Dove, who is leaving us this week, sitting \nright here at the table on the Republican side of the Chamber in the \nwell.\n  For C SPAN2 watchers out there, Laura is the assistant secretary for \nthe minority. We wish she were the assistant secretary for the \nmajority, but she is assistant secretary for the minority, which means \nshe is one of the people who make this place run every day but whose \nnames you don't hear on the rollcall.\n  She has put in her time, starting out as a page in high school and \nlater moving to the Republican cloakroom. She did a stint at the Senate \nRepublican Conference and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \nAnd then Dave Schiappa, the Secretary for the Minority, hired her back \ninto his shop about 10 years ago.\n  And she's done a fabulous job. Senate work is in Laura's DNA. Her \ndad's a past Senate parliamentarian. And she's been an invaluable \nmember of the floor team for as long as I can remember--counseling \nmembers on the floor, working with committees to clear legislation, and \ndoing countless other essential tasks, big and small, that nobody \nwatching from home would even notice.\n  She always has a smile, always handles the pressure down in the well \nwith a cool-head, and I know she's been an anchor for Dave over the \nyears. So we will miss having her around.\n  And we wish her all the best as she moves onto other things.\n  I know she wants to travel with her husband Dan, and her two children \nJakey and Abby. I don't think any of us would be surprised if Laura \ncame back. But for now, I thank her for her service to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would note that it is never an inconvenience to be \ndeferred by a beautiful lady, and again I take all the remarks made by \nthe leader about Ms. Dove, and I would add one thing about the best and \ngreatest institution in America, the U.S. Senate, and that is that a \nyoung mother of two has become an institution to herself. Laura, we \nappreciate all you have done.\n\n\n                            Missile Defense\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise to talk about two specific \nsubjects, one of them a very troubling comment picked up by a \nmicrophone that was not believed to be live, made by President Obama to \nPresident Medvedev of Russia. It is a troubling comment to me because I \nspent most of the previous year in the Senate as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee working on the New START treaty, which the \nSenate adopted with 71 favorable votes a year ago, a treaty that is a \ntreaty on offensive missiles, not defensive missiles nor strategic \nmissiles.\n  It is a treaty that began under Ronald Reagan, was ratified by George \nH.W. Bush shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was extended under \nGeorge W. Bush and terminated a couple of years ago and needed to be \nrenewed. It is a treaty that did three things. First of all, it reduced \noffensive weapons held by the Russians and the Americans; second, gave \nus unilateral access to Russia and the Russians unilateral access to us \nto trust but verify the warheads that existed; and third, new \nidentification systems and holographs that made it almost impossible to \nhide or mimic nuclear warheads. It is a comprehensive treaty that is \nimportant to America, important to the free world, and, quite frankly, \nimportant to Russia.\n  I would like to quote from the Washington Post exactly what the \nPresident was picked up as having said when he was talking to Mr. \nMedvedev after their official conversation.\n  I quote from the Washington Post:\n\n       On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, \n     this, this can be solved--\n\n  I underline, nobody knows what ``this'' means--\n\n     but it's important for him to give me space.\n\n  President Medvedev said back:\n\n       Yeah, I understand.\n\n  Then the President said the following:\n\n       This is my last election. After my election, I [will] have \n     more flexibility.\n\n  That flexibility obviously refers back to ``this,'' which was in the \nfirst comment.\n  So as a continuing member of the Foreign Relations Committee, one who \nis proud of the work we did on the START treaty but one who understands \nparticularly the commitments of the country, I think it important that \nthe President clarify what ``this'' meant and how flexibility would be \napplied if he were reelected as President of the United States for this \nreason: In the President's letter to the Senate to endorse the New \nSTART treaty and ask for its ratification, he said the following: that \nhe pledged in his message to the Senate on the New START treaty ``to \ncontinue development and deployment of all stages of the Phased \nAdaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe, including qualitative \nand quantitative improvements to such system.'' That is a unilateral \nstatement.\n  I met with Vice President Joe Biden in his office outside this \nChamber during the debate. Vice President Biden committed the \nadministration in terms of continuing on missile defense. I met with \nSecretary of State Clinton. I met with Ellen Tauscher, who was one of \nthe chief negotiators and chief operatives, a former Member of the \nHouse working for the State Department. There was never any wiggle room \nnor need for flexibility. The United States was committed to missile \ndefense in Europe, we remain committed to this day, and it is important \nthat the President reaffirm that and it not be in any way confused or \nblurred by the comments picked up by that microphone. It is too \nimportant to the country, it is too important to this body, and it is \ntoo important to me for us to be able to trust the words of each other, \nnot to find out sometime later that they want flexibility to possibly \nmove from those words. Nuclear defense clearly is very sensitive with \nthe Russians, and I understand that. If there are negotiations on that, \nthat ought to be in the open, not after we have time for flexibility. \nIt ought to be forthright.\n  I also would like to add that there is another missile defense issue \nthat looms out there that we have to pay attention to. Israel is \nsurrounded by missiles with warheads to injure the people of that \ncountry and take the country down. A missile defense system for Israel \nwould be equally as important as missile defense deployment would be \nfor the Eastern European countries.\n  So missile defense was a vision of Ronald Reagan's, continued under \nevery President of the United States since Ronald Reagan, and it is \nimportant that we remain committed to it. I believe it is particularly \nimportant to understand what the President said, particularly on \nmissile defense, what ``this'' meant when he asked for flexibility, \nbecause there should be no wiggle room in our desire to protect and \ndefend democracy not only in the United States but around the world.\n  Madam President real quickly, we talked all week about gas prices, \nand there has been a lot of demonization from both sides. I am a pretty \nsimple guy. I was a businessman for 33 years, went and got a degree in \ncollege in business, studied economics in high school, and learned one \nprinciple of free enterprise and competition: prices are determined by \nsupply and demand. If your supply goes down and your demand goes up, \nyour prices go up. On the contrary, if the supply is plentiful and \ndemand goes down, your prices go down. You can blame gas companies, \npresidents' salaries, anything you want to blame; the fact is, we are \ntalking out of the side of our mouth--and particularly in the \nadministration--when it comes to exploration for natural resources in \nthe United States of America, and only can we become energy independent \nwhen we develop all of our resources. I support that. I drive a hybrid \ncar. I am not just somebody who talks about it, I believe it is \nimportant. It reduces my consumption, it extends my miles per gallon, \nand it is better for the environment.\n  But we have proven through the Solyndra and other cases that some of \nthe alternative energy sources were either not perfected or frankly \njust don't work. So while we are developing ones that do, we should be \nrobustly exploring in the gulf, in Alaska, in the Midwest, in the \nNorthwest, and offshore, such as my State of Georgia, the resources we \nknow exist to raise the supply of petroleum in the United States and \nlower the price to the American taxpayer.\n  All four sources of energy that are safe and reliable should be \npromoted. That includes nuclear energy. I am very proud and I am \nthankful to the President that he issued the loan guarantee on the \nfirst reactors licensed in this country since 1978. They are in Plant \nVogtle in Augusta or Burke County, GA. But his Chairman of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission voted no on that final approval. He was \noutvoted 4 to 1, but he voted no. That sends a signal that we may talk \non one hand about having robust development of all resources, but when \nit comes to playing our hand on the actual vote, we really don't do it. \nThe same thing is true with the Keystone Pipeline. You can't just \napprove the pipeline to the south without connecting it to the north \nbecause if you do, you don't get the petroleum.\n\n  We can blame whomever we want to blame, but the fact is facts are \nstubborn, and supply and demand is what dictates price. We should \nrobustly be exploring the natural resources of the United States for \nAmerica to have less dependence on foreign oil and more dependence on \nour own oil where we know we have resources. We should pay attention to \nour environment and recognize that no country in the world has done a \nbetter job in the modern era since the industrial revolution of \ncleaning up its environment than the United States of America. No one \nlooks after their environment harder than the United States of America. \nWe owe it to our people to look equally hard at the cost of gasoline, \nthe price of petroleum, and the robust exploration of our own natural \nresources here at home for less dependency overseas.\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n  I yield the floor and defer to the Senator from Louisiana, who has a \nlot of offshore resources of his own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about one of the most \npressing challenges Louisiana families--indeed, most American \nfamilies--face, and that is the price at the pump and the enormous hit \nthat is to their family budgets, their pocketbooks, their wallets. It \nis really making life very difficult in the midst of a very weak \neconomy.\n  A few years ago the price was $1.84. That was on the day Barack Obama \nwas sworn in as President of the United States. Now it has more than \ndoubled; it is $3.80-plus. It seems to be rising every day, and that is \na real crisis to a lot of American families. We should be committed \nhere in the Senate, here in Washington, to connecting with the real \nworld and focusing on real problems and real crises. For millions of \nLouisiana and American families, that is absolutely it. Unfortunately, \nI don't see real solutions and a real policy to address that coming out \nof the President or some of my colleagues on the Senate floor. Right \nnow, to the minute, as we speak on the Senate floor, the President is \nspeaking at the White House, and he is laying out his proposal to raise \ntaxes on domestic energy companies and domestic oil and gas production. \nThat is not a policy that is going to help Louisiana and American \nfamilies with the price at the pump. In fact, it is a policy that is \ngoing to make it worse and not better.\n\n  Folks get it in the real world. They certainly do in Louisiana. When \nwe increase taxes on something, those are costs that almost every \nbusiness, if they possibly can, is going to pass on to consumers. That \nis pushing prices up, not down.\n  It is also the first rule of economics, as my colleague from Georgia \nsaid, supply and demand. If we tax something more, we get less of it. \nIf we increase taxes on domestic energy producers, on domestic oil and \ngas, we will get less of it. Less supply means the price goes up. So \nthose are two compelling reasons this proposal is not going to help \nLouisiana families and American families with their struggles with the \nprice at the pump. It is going to make it even worse, when it has been \ngetting worse on its own for a lot of related reasons, very \ndramatically. So that is not a policy. That is not a commonsense or a \nreal-world solution.\n  Likewise, one of the few other things I have heard from the President \nin terms of this matter is essentially begging other countries to \nincrease their production. I don't think that is a policy worthy of \nAmerica either. I think the perfect symbol for that approach is the \nPresident bowing to the princes of Saudi Arabia. It is a symbol of his \napproach of trying to deal with the price at the pump, and it is not \ngood enough and it is not worthy of the American people.\n  Other folks have also adopted this approach. Senator Schumer, our \ncolleague in this Chamber, recently wrote Secretary of State Clinton on \nFebruary 28, 2012, just a few weeks ago:\n\n       To address this situation--\n\n  Meaning the price at the pump--\n\n       I urge the State Department to work with the government of \n     Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production, as they are \n     currently producing well under their capacity.\n\n  Begging Saudi Arabia is not an adequate solution, and it is not a \npolicy worthy of America.\n  President Obama's own Energy Secretary Secretary Chu said even more \nrecently, on March 20 of this year:\n\n       We're very grateful that Saudi Arabia has extra capacity \n     and it feels confident that it can fulfill any potential \n     deficits, at least the way the current markets are now, the \n     current demand I should say, are now.\n\n  Again, begging Saudi Arabia, begging the Middle East, begging other \ncountries, that is not an adequate policy and it is not a policy worthy \nof America.\n  President Obama has done a world tour doing some of this in other \ncountries. Notably, on March 20, 2011, when my part of the country was \nstill struggling with the de facto moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, a \npermit logjam blocking us from producing good, reliable American \nenergy, putting Americans, Louisianans to work, the President went to \nBrazil to beg them to produce their resources and to promise them that \nthe United States would be a great customer. Quote:\n\n       We want to help you with the technology and support to \n     develop these oil reserves safely. And when you're ready to \n     start selling, we want to be one of your best customers. At a \n     time when we've been reminded how easily instability in other \n     parts of the world can affect the price of oil, the United \n     States could not be happier with the potential for a new, \n     stable source of energy.\n\n  He means drilling in Brazil. I have to say this was like rubbing salt \nin the wound to most Louisianans. As I said, this was March 2011, a \nyear ago, and we were still suffering from a continuing de facto \nmoratorium that the President had imposed following the BP incident. So \nhe was going to Brazil and urging them to drill, urging them to \nexplore, committing America to that, and refusing to do it in America \nin the Gulf of Mexico. That is not a commonsense solution. That is not \na real-world policy. That is not a policy worthy of America. None of \nthis begging is.\n  Other countries do have an energy policy, and it is not begging; it \nis developing. It is controlling their own future. Very recently in the \npress there have been reports that PetroChina has now become the \nleading company publicly traded in terms of production of oil, far \nsurpassing Big Oil and all the other companies that have been demonized \nby my colleagues on the left on the Senate floor.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the press report \nprinted for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 29, 2012]\n\n  PetroChina Produced More Oil Than Industry Giant Exxon Mobil in 2011\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n       New York.--A big shift is happening in Big Oil: an American \n     giant now ranks behind a Chinese upstart.\n       Exxon Mobil is no longer the world's biggest publicly \n     traded producer of oil. For the first time, that distinction \n     belongs to a 13-year-old Chinese company called PetroChina. \n     The Beijing company was created by the Chinese government to \n     secure more oil for that nation's booming economy.\n       PetroChina announced Thursday that it pumped 2.4 million \n     barrels a day last year, surpassing Exxon by 100,000. The \n     company has grown rapidly over the last decade by squeezing \n     more from China's aging oil fields and outspending Western \n     companies to acquire more petroleum reserves in places like \n     Canada, Iraq and Qatar. It's motivated by a need to lock up \n     as much oil as possible.\n       The company's output increased 3.3 percent in 2011 while \n     Exxon's fell 5 percent. Exxon's oil production also fell \n     behind Rosneft, the Russian energy company.\n       PetroChina's rise highlights a fundamental difference in \n     how the largest petroleum companies plan to supply the world \n     as new deposits become tougher to find and more expensive to \n     produce.\n       Every major oil company has aggressively pursued new finds \n     to replace their current wells. But analysts say Western oil \n     firms like Exxon Mobil have been more conservative than the \n     Chinese, mindful of their bottom line and investor returns. \n     With oil prices up 19 percent in 2011, they still made money \n     without increasing production.\n       PetroChina Co. Ltd. has a different mission. The Chinese \n     government owns 86 percent of its stock and the nation uses \n     nearly every drop of oil PetroChina pumps. Its appetite for \n     gasoline and other petroleum products is projected to double \n     between 2010 and 2035.\n       ``There's a lot of anxiety in China about the energy \n     question,'' says energy historian Dan Yergin. ``It's just \n     growing so fast.''\n       While PetroChina sits atop other publicly traded companies \n     in oil production, it falls well short of national oil \n     companies like Saudi Aramco, which produces nearly 8 million \n     barrels a day. And Exxon is still the biggest publicly traded \n     energy company when counting combined output of oil and \n     natural gas. PetroChina ranks third behind Exxon and BP in \n     total output of oil and natural gas.\n       PetroChina is looking to build on its momentum in 2012.\n       ``We must push ahead,'' PetroChina chairman Jiang Jiemin \n     said in January.\n       PetroChina has grown by pumping everything it can from \n     reserves in China, estimated to contain more than 6.5 billion \n     barrels. It drilled thousands of oil wells across vast \n     stretches of the nation's northern grasslands. Some of those \n     fields are ancient by industry standards, dating close to the \n     beginning of China's communist government in the 1950s.\n       The commitment to aging fields distinguishes PetroChina \n     from its biggest Western rivals. Exxon and other major oil \n     companies typically sell their aging, low-performing fields, \n     or they put them out of commission.\n       PetroChina also has been on a buying spree, acquiring new \n     reserves in Iraq, Australia, Africa, Qatar and Canada. Since \n     2010, its acquisitions have totaled $7 billion, about\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n     twice as much as Exxon, according to data provider Dealogic.\n       Several other Chinese companies have become deal makers \n     around the globe as well. Total acquisitions by Chinese \n     energy firms jumped from less than $2 billion between 2002 \n     and 2003 to nearly $48 billion in 2009 and 2010, according to \n     the International Energy Agency. More times than not, the \n     companies are paying above the industry average to get those \n     deals done.\n       It's making some in the West nervous.\n       In 2005, for example, CNOOC Ltd., a company mostly owned by \n     the Chinese government tried to buy American oil producer \n     Unocal. U.S. lawmakers worked to block the deal, asking \n     President Bush to investigate the role the Chinese central \n     government played in the process. Chevron Corp. eventually \n     bought Unocal for $17.3 billion.\n       ``There's a resistance to Chinese investment in (U.S.) oil \n     and gas,'' Morningstar analyst Robert Bellinski says. ``It's \n     like how Japan was to us in the 1980s. People think they're \n     going to take us over. They're going to buy all of our \n     resources.''\n       That's unlikely to happen. It doesn't make economic sense \n     to export oil away from the world's largest oil consumer.\n       But the Chinese could make it tougher for Big Oil to \n     generate returns for their shareholders. China's oil \n     companies have been willing to outspend everyone and that \n     drives up the price of fields and makes it more expensive for \n     everyone to expand.\n       ``You now have to outbid them,'' says Argus Research \n     analyst Phil Weiss. ``If you can't, you're going to have \n     access to fewer assets.''\n       Longer term, Chinese expansion globally will bring benefits \n     to the U.S. and other economies. By developing as many oil \n     wells as possible--especially in Africa, Iraq and other \n     politically unstable regions--China will help expand supply.\n       ``Frankly, the more risk-hungry producers there are, the \n     more oil will be on the market, and the cheaper prices are,'' \n     says Michael Levi, an energy policy expert at the Council on \n     Foreign Relations.\n       Despite its swift expansion, PetroChina and other Chinese \n     companies still have much to prove to investors, analysts \n     say.\n       PetroChina's parent, China National Petroleum Corp., for \n     example, has spent millions of dollars in Sudan to provide \n     highways, medical facilities and shuttle buses for the \n     elderly. Oil companies typically don't do that. All of that \n     increases the cost of business and minimizes the returns for \n     shareholders.\n       In 2009 and 2010, PetroChina's profit margins for its \n     exploration and production business were only about two-\n     thirds that of Exxon Mobil's. Its stock price has climbed \n     less than 1 percent, in the past year, compared with a 3.7 \n     percent rise in the stock of Exxon Mobil Corp.\n       ``You have to ask yourself: What is the purpose of \n     PetroChina?'' Bellinski says. ``It is to fuel China. That's \n     it. Although they're a public company, I'm very skeptical \n     that they have any interest in shareholder value creation.''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. The Chinese are not going around the world begging. The \nChinese are developing. The Chinese are trying to control their own \ndestiny, and PetroChina is now the leading company in terms of \nproducing oil.\n  Petrobras in Brazil is another example. Brazil is developing its \nresources very aggressively. That is what I referred to when the \nPresident went there a year ago and applauded them and encouraged them \nwith giving them U.S. resources to do it in terms of loan guarantees, \nand the President absolutely promised we would be a great customer.\n  The Brazilians are not traveling the world begging. The Brazilians \nare controlling their own destiny. The Brazilians are responsibly \ndeveloping their own resources, and our President even applauds that \nwhile refusing to do the same in this country.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the press report \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 19, 2012]\n\n China Gets Jump on U.S. for Brazil's Oil--Two Export Pacts a Coup for \n                                Beijing\n\n                            (By Kelly Hearn)\n\n       Buenos Aires.--Off the coast of Rio de Janeiro--below a \n     mile of water and two miles of shifting rock, sand and salt--\n     is an ultradeep sea of oil that could turn Brazil into the \n     world's fourth-largest oil producer, behind Russia, Saudi \n     Arabia and the United States.\n       The country's state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, \n     expects to pump 4.9 million barrels a day from the country's \n     oil fields by 2020, with 40 percent of that coming from the \n     seabed. One and a half million barrels will be bound for \n     export markets.\n       The United States wants it, but China is getting it.\n       Less than a month after President Obama visited Brazil in \n     March to make a pitch for oil, Brazilian President Dilma \n     Rousseff was off to Beijing to sign oil contracts with two \n     huge state-owned Chinese companies.\n       The deals are part of a growing oil relationship between \n     the two countries that, thanks to a series of billion-dollar \n     agreements, is giving China greater influence over Brazil's \n     oil frontier.\n       Chinese oil companies are pushing to meet mandatory \n     expansion targets by inking deals across Africa and Latin \n     America, but they are especially interested in Brazil.\n       ``With the Lula and Carioca discoveries alone, Brazil added \n     a possible 38 billion barrels of estimated recoverable oil,'' \n     said Luis Giusti, a former president of Venezuela's state oil \n     company, PDVSA, referring to the new Brazilian oil fields.\n       ``That immediately changed the picture,'' he said, adding \n     that Brazil is on track to become ``an oil giant.''\n       During Mrs. Rousseff's visit to China, Brazil's Petrobras \n     signed a technology cooperation deal with the China Petroleum \n     & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec.\n       Petrobras also signed a memorandum of understanding with \n     Sinochem, a massive state-owned company with interests in \n     energy, real estate and agrichemicals.\n       The Sinochem deal aims to identify and build ``business \n     opportunities in the fields of exploration and production, \n     oil commercialization and mature oil-field recovery,'' \n     according to Petrobras.\n       The relationship with China goes back to at least two years \n     before Mr. Obama came to Brazil to applaud the oil discovery \n     and tell Mrs. Rousseff:\n       ``We want to work with you. We want to help with technology \n     and support to develop these oil reserves safely, and, when \n     you're ready to start selling, we want to be one of your best \n     customers.''\n       China rescued Petrobras in 2009, when the oil company was \n     looking at tight credit markets to finance a record-setting \n     $224 billion investment plan. China's national development \n     bank offered a $10 billion loan on the condition that \n     Petrobras ship oil to China for 10 years.\n       A chunk of Brazil's oil real estate appeared on China's \n     portfolio in 2010, when Sinopec agreed to pay $7.1 billion \n     for 40 percent of Repsol-YPF of Brazil, which has stakes in \n     the now internationally famous Santos Basin, and the Sapinhoa \n     field, which has an estimated recoverable volume of 2.1 \n     billion barrels. Statoil of Norway also agreed that year to \n     sell 40 percent of the offshore Peregrino field to Sinochem.\n       Last year, Sinopec announced it would buy 30 percent of \n     GALP of Brazil, a Portuguese company, for $3.5 billion. GALP \n     has interests in the Santos Basin and a 10 percent stake in \n     the massive Lula field.\n       ``The $5.2 billion cash-in we will get from Sinopec is \n     paramount for our strategy in Brazil,'' GALP CEO Manuel \n     Ferreira de Oliveira told Bloomberg News.\n       ``It will give us a rock-solid capital base as we enter a \n     decisive investment period at the Santos Basin. This \n     operation values our existing Brazilian assets at $12.5 \n     billion and is really a landmark for the company and for our \n     shareholders.''\n       News reports in December said Sinopec is the current \n     favorite to buy stakes in Brazilian oil owned by Britain's BG \n     Group, which also has interests in the massive fields of \n     Carioca, Guara, Lula and Lara.\n       On Jan 8., the French company Perenco announced it was \n     selling Sinochem a 10 percent stake in five offshore blocks \n     located in the Espirito Santos Basin. Some of the \n     transactions still await approval by Brazil's government.\n       In December, Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez \n     publicly reiterated his government's commitment to an oil \n     refinery joint venture with Petrobras.\n       That project reportedly is set to be funded by China's \n     national development bank. Some news reports have quoted the \n     head of China's development bank saying that new deals with \n     Brazil are under consideration.\n       James Williams, an energy economist with the U.S. \n     consulting group WTRG Economics, said the Chinese are taking \n     on big risks with ultra-deep-water investments.\n       ``But for them, the benefits are greater, as they become \n     partners with companies that have better technology and \n     expertise,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. According to recent press reports, there is a budding and \nbuilding relationship between Brazil and China, and China is taking \nadvantage and forming contracts to take advantage of that resource. We \nshould learn a thing or two from other folks around the world, and we \nshould not just beg; we should build and develop. We should take our \nown future into our own hands, and we have an enormous opportunity to \ndo that.\n  The United States is actually the single most energy-rich country in \nthe world, bar none. When we look at total energy resources, we lead \nthe world. Russia is second, and other countries follow way behind. \nSaudi Arabia is third but cannot compare in terms of total resources. \nNo Middle Eastern country can compare, and China is below that. We have \nthe resources. We are the single most energy-rich country in the world, \nand this map shows it.\n  We have enormous reserves, particularly shale in the West, natural \ngas in\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nfinds on land, and offshore enormous potential of reserves of oil. \nLiterally, there are hundreds of years' worth. So what is the problem? \nThe problem is we are the only country in the world that puts well over \n90 percent of those resources off-limits and doesn't develop them, but \nwe can do better.\n  We can reasonably, responsibly, and safely open that access. We can \ndo what Brazil is doing; we can do what China is doing. We do not have \nto beg. We can have a policy worthy of America and Americans. We can \ntake control of our own destiny.\n  What will that mean? It will mean great U.S. jobs, which by \ndefinition cannot be outsourced. We cannot have a domestic energy job \nproducing good, reliable energy in the United States and outsource it \nto China or India. We will build more energy independence, not having \nto beg Saudi Arabia or go to Brazil as a customer or anything else. We \nwill even increase revenue to lower deficit and debt. After the Federal \nincome tax, the biggest source of revenue to the Federal Government is \nroyalty or revenue on domestic oil production. It is second only to \nFederal income tax. It would be enormous new revenue to reduce deficit \nand debt. And, of course, we can help lower the price at the pump. We \ncan increase supply, which lowers the price.\n  So I urge us to do what the American people want us to do: to adopt \ncommon sense, to adopt a real policy, and to take control of our own \ndestiny. Begging is not a policy, at least not one worthy of Americans. \nThis tax proposal to increase taxes on U.S. oil companies and domestic \noil production is not a policy that will do anything but increase the \nprice at the pump, decrease supply, and that is the opposite of what we \nneed. Let's do what will make a difference: increase supply, control \nour own destiny, and do more right here at home.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                         Rising to the Occasion\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, in a moment I am going to speak about \nenergy. But, first of all--as I was waiting to have the opportunity to \ndo this--I want to thank Senator McConnell for giving us an update on \nwhat is going on in Kentucky. We do a lot of very important things \nhere. One of the things I am going to talk about, energy, is one of the \nmost important, and yet it is good to hear the stories of ordinary \nAmericans doing extraordinary things. This truly is what our country is \nall about, and my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Kentucky. \nBut it is so refreshing--we talk a lot about our problems, but the \nstrength of America is people like the folks in Kentucky and all \nthroughout America who rise to the occasion as they need to.\n  The increasing price of gas is a costly reminder of how dependent our \ncountry is on foreign oil. This is one of the most pressing issues we \nface today because the price at the pump directly impacts our everyday \nlives, and Arkansans are telling me they are worried about what it is \ndoing to their bottom line.\n  Americans are frustrated with the increase in the cost of gas, and \nrightfully so. In my home State of Arkansas, the cost for a regular \ngallon of gas is up 22 cents from a month ago according to AAA. The \nletters, calls, e-mails and Facebook posts I receive from Arkansas are \nsaying the same thing. It is harder to fill their tanks while making \nends meet.\n  Arkansas families are faced with tough choices because the rising \nprices are dipping into their family's disposable income. The increase \nin the price of gas puts a strain on family budgets.\n  Earlier this week I hosted a townhall with Arkansans throughout the \nState. While I expected the major discussion to be about this issue, I \nwas surprised at how much it dominated the conversation. During the \nevent we took an informal poll asking participants if the increase of \ngas has forced significant changes in their daily habits. Seventy-eight \npercent of those who answered said the price had a significant impact.\n  Sarah, from Mountain Home, AK, said on her Facebook page that the \nincrease in gas prices has forced her family to allocate more money for \nfuel expenses, which leaves less money for food, making it frustrating. \nSarah and other Arkansans should not have to choose between getting gas \nto get to work and the necessities they need in the household.\n  Chris from Mena, AK, wrote that he notices an increase in the price \nof groceries. He said:\n\n       People should be aware of how fuel costs affect everything \n     we buy and do.\n\n  I agree with Chris because the increased price for gas adds to the \ntransportation costs that are passed along to consumers.\n  Donnie Smith, the CEO of the Springdale-based Tysons Food, told the \nArkansas Business Journal that with Springdale as a price point, there \nhas been an increase of more than 55 percent in the cost of diesel in \nthe past 5 years. This is significant because the company uses fuel to \ntransport feed to family farmers, chickens to and from the farms, and \nthe finished products to customers around the world.\n  American families and businesses deserve a plan that will help bring \ndown the prices at the pump. The legislation before this Chamber \nproposed to raise taxes on American energy producers. This will not \nchange supply and demand, as Senator Isakson talked about a few minutes \nago. These are basic truths. Supply and demand does control costs. This \nwill do nothing to that.\n  Again, hard-working Americans will be left with the bill as a result \nif this bill were passed. I believe the better way begins with adopting \nan energy strategy that increases production of American energy in a \nclean, efficient way through developing wind, solar, and hydrogen \ntechnologies as well as tapping into the vast majority of natural \nresources our country is blessed with.\n  The reality of our country's nonexistent energy policy is it forces \nus to rely on the Middle East for oil. We import about 9 million \nbarrels of oil every day, half of our supply. This is costly to our \neconomy, our citizens, and it threatens our national security. This is \nthe only developed country in the world that refuses to use its natural \nresources. Opening Alaska's Wildlife Refuge and increasing offshore \nexploration on the Outer Continental Shelf is a step in the right \ndirection that puts us on a path of energy independence. We can boost \nour domestic energy supply through the development of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. The proposed 1,700-mile pipeline would transport 700,000 \nbarrels of oil per day from Canada to U.S. refineries in the gulf coast \nand allow us to get reliable and secure oil from our largest trading \npartner and trusted ally. Unfortunately, while I support this project \nand voted in favor of it several times in this Chamber, the project was \nrejected by the majority after President Obama took the time to lobby \nhis Members to vote against it after vetoing the project earlier this \nyear.\n\n  There is no time like today to pass legislation to fully utilize the \nresources we have been blessed with in our country, but this should not \ncome at the cost of our energy producers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, Mr. President. If the Chair would \nplease let me know when I have used 5 minutes, I would appreciate that.\n  We have a very important vote in front of us that goes to the \nquestion of whether consumers are going to continue to be held hostage \nby basically having one energy source at the pump or whether we are \ngoing to give competition to the oil companies and if we are going to \ngive consumers choice.\n  I believe we need to do everything; there is no question about that \nin my mind, but that doesn't mean having a Tax Code that has embedded \nin it for almost 100 years special tax breaks and subsidies for the oil \ncompanies, and the other new clean energy alternatives that are growing \nand creating jobs in our country do not have the same treatment. In \nfact, they limp along with a tax cut that expires every year, not sure \nif it is going to continue, which is what is happening right now.\n  People are losing their jobs right now in the areas of wind \nproduction and other areas because they are not sure what is going to \nhappen. Yet we give preferential treatment to an industry right now \nwhose top five companies are making about $260,000 a minute--a minute. \nFor people in Michigan, the\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\naverage wage does not equal $260,000 a year, yet $260,000 a minute in \nprofits for the oil companies, and we as customers, as consumers, have \nthe great privilege of on the one hand paying whatever they want to \ncharge at the pump because there are no alternatives and not enough \nchoices, and at the same time out of the other pocket we get to \nsubsidize them.\n  One hundred years ago those subsidies probably made a lot of sense. I \nam sure I would have voted for them as we were starting the new \nindustrial economy and incentivizing the production of oil certainly \nmade sense. I still support the efforts for small businesses and local \nefforts, but the top five companies do not need taxpayer subsidies \nright now when they have the highest profits of any business in the \nworld.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about--in tough times \nand budget deficits and when we need to be focused on jobs and getting \nus off of foreign oil--making choices that make sense for the future \nand not the past. That means closing down these special subsidies for \nthe top five companies that, again, are earning profits of about \n$260,000 every single minute, and turning those dollars over to new \nclean energy alternatives such as biofuels, wind, solar, electric \nbatteries, and all of the things that need to happen--including natural \ngas, which my colleague from New Jersey has been a champion of--so that \nwe actually have real competition and we can actually go look at the \nprice at the pump and say, you know what, it is too much; I am going to \ndo something else.\n  We are beginning that process with new electric vehicles and I am \nproud that those are being made in Michigan. We have advanced biofuels \nright now. If we didn't have advanced biofuels at the pump in the few \nplaces we do, we would actually see prices a dollar higher on average \nthan they are right now. So there is a little bit of competition, but \nwe have a long way to go.\n  This bill takes dollars from subsidies that are no longer needed, \nthat don't make sense from the American taxpayers' standpoint or an \nenergy standpoint, and turns them over to continue 19 different tax \ncuts for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and those who are creating \nthe new clean energy alternatives in the future.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have said that taking away \ngovernment subsidies will increase prices. It is amazing to me that \nsomehow Friday seems to increase prices; Memorial Day seems to increase \nprices. I think whatever the market will bear increases prices. But \nwhen the CEOs of the big five companies came to the Finance Committee I \nactually asked them--because folks are saying taking away government \nsubsidies for them will increase prices. I said: How much do we have to \npay you to bring down the price? Give me a number. How much do we have \nto pay you to bring down the price?\n  Finally, one of the CEOs actually said: Well, I did not say we would \nbe raising gas prices at the pump. I did not hear anyone else say that, \neither.\n  So that is what they said. They were not willing to go on record as \nsaying they would raise the prices at the pump.\n  Instead of throwing huge government handouts at some of the most \nprofitable companies ever, we should be paying down the debt and we \nshould be providing tax cuts for the jobs and the new alternatives for \nthe future, and I urge my colleagues to support this very important \nbill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENZI. Today I wish to discuss high gasoline prices and to express \nmy concern that the legislator we are debating will only cause the \nprice at the pump to increase. We need to have a serious debate about \nenergy policy in the Senate. We have not passed substantial energy \nlegislation since 2007, and without a sound energy policy, we will \ncontinue to see price instability.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation we are debating is not that sound \nenergy policy. Instead, it is an effort at political theater, designed \nto force a vote on a proposal that the majority finds politically \npopular.\n  Republicans understand that the problem we face today will not be \nsolved by taxing the five largest oil companies. Unlike the majority, \nwe understand that you cannot expect to lower energy prices when you \nincrease taxes. Increasing taxes will lead to higher prices.\n  I want to see lower prices, and so I oppose S. 2204. Instead of \npassing this legislation, the Senate should take up any one of the \nideas my colleagues and I have proposed.\n  The Senate should pass legislation to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline so we can obtain more of our energy from Canada as opposed to \ncountries like Saudi Arabia. The Senate should pass legislation to \nprohibit the EPA from implementing its greenhouse gas policy--which \nwill make it more difficult to use our most abundant, domestic energy \nsource--coal--to power our homes, businesses, and daily lives.\n  The Senate should pass legislation to open up more areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf to exploration and production, and should require the \nadministration to grant permits for responsible energy development. We \nshould also pass legislation to open up a small area of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, to energy development.\n  Any one of those actions would have a much more positive impact on \nour Nation's energy situation than the legislation we are debating \ntoday. S. 2204 is an effort to punish the Nation's five largest energy \ncompanies because oil prices are high.\n  Republicans stand ready to have a serious debate on energy because we \nknow our policies are the best solution for achieving energy security. \nWe recognize that the problems we are facing are an undersupply of oil \nas well as an instability in some countries where a substantial amount \nof oil is produced.\n  To address these issues, I want to produce more American oil on \nAmerican soil. I want to see more oil produced in regions like the \nANWR. I want to determine what technology is needed to recover the \nnearly 800 billion barrels of oil shale that the Rand Corporation has \nsuggested are recoverable. I want to see permits granted in areas of \nWyoming so we can develop our State's coal bed methane. We also want to \nsee more wind turbines and solar energy panels in places where they \nmake sense.\n  Republicans truly support an ``all of the above'' approach. We \nsupport traditional sources like coal, oil, and natural gas. We support \nalternative sources like wind and solar. And our record shows that to \nbe the case.\n  President Obama claims to support an ``all of the above'' approach. \nHowever, his record shows something different. Earlier this week, his \nadministration released a rule that will make it exceedingly difficult \nto build a coal-fired power plant in the future. That action follows \nhis administration's decision in 2010 to put a moratorium on leasing in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and their decision to put in place policies that \nmake it more difficult to develop natural resources on our Federal \nlands. President Obama claims to support natural gas--at the same time \nhis administration seeks to stop hydraulic fracturing, the tool that \nhas allowed us to access our abundant natural gas reserves.\n  President Obama also claims that there isn't a silver bullet to bring \nprices down. That may be true, but if you add up all of his \nadministration's efforts to hold up American energy production, there \nare a number of measures we could undertake to make our situation \nbetter. Unfortunately, the legislation we are debating today is not one \nof those measures.\n  What's further unfortunate about S. 2204 is that it is an attempt to \npunish a sector of our economy that is doing well. The oil and gas \nsector has created jobs during the recession and employs more than 9 \nmillion American workers. It is a sector that employs a lot of people \nin my State. In 2010, more than 21,000 workers were employed in the oil \nand gas industry in Wyoming. Instead of punishing these companies for \ntheir success, we should be finding ways to work with them so they can \nput more Americans back to work.\n  It is valuable to have a discussion about energy like we have had \nthis week. It allows us to point out the differences between the vision \nwe offer of more production and more jobs versus the vision of our \ncolleagues on the other side, which is essentially higher taxes and \nhigher energy prices. When we have finished voting on S. 2204, which \neveryone acknowledges will fail, we should sit down and have a full \ndebate about our energy future. I am confident that our vision is the \nright one if\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nwe want an America that has a secure energy future.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 2204.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nRepeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act, which I have cosponsored.\n  This legislation would repeal five specific tax subsidies and a \nroyalty relief provision to the largest oil companies, which simply do \nnot need them and which our Federal Government definitely cannot \nafford. And this bill would invest the savings from repealing these \nsubsidies to extend vital clean energy incentives that have recently \nexpired. It would also save billions of dollars in order to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  This is a simple vote, really. If you are for subsidizing profitable \nand polluting industries and raising taxes on clean, innovative, and \nrenewable energy companies, you should not support this bill. But if \nyou are for fiscal responsibility, balancing the Federal budget, and \ninvesting in a cleaner energy industry that is less dependent on \ninternational oil markets and suppliers, you should vote yes.\n  If you are against increasing taxes on clean energy sources such as \nwind, solar, and energy efficiency, you should vote yes. And if you \nbelieve that we cannot afford to spend Federal dollars subsidizing an \nindustry that needs no help, you should vote yes.\n  Oil prices have risen to well above $100 per barrel, and according to \nAAA, California currently has the highest gasoline prices of any State \nin the continental United States, currently at $4.30 per gallon of \nregular unleaded.\n  But these higher prices are not the result of a change in the cost of \nproducing and refining oil.\n  According to a Finance Committee analysis of the SEC filings of the \nthree largest oil companies in the United States that filed, it costs \nthem an average of $11 to produce one barrel of oil. At today's prices \nthat is nearly $100 in pure profit for each barrel.\n  The result is massive oil company profits on the backs of American \nconsumers. Last year, the top five oil companies made more than $135 \nbillion in profit. That is an increase of 80% over what they made in \n2010.\n  Yet the largest oil companies are not using these profits to produce \nmore oil. Oil production for the biggest five oil companies was down 4 \npercent last year.\n  Instead of using their enormous revenues to invest in drilling, the \nbig five oil companies are buying back stock, issuing dividends, and \nlobbying governments.\n  For example, Shell Oil's profits increased by 54 percent between 2010 \nand 2011. But its production decreased by 3 percent.\n  And the American taxpayer is providing oil subsidies that increase \nprofits, stock prices, and dividends--and don't produce more oil or \nlower gasoline prices.\n  U.S. taxpayers subsidize these hugely profitable oil companies to the \ntune of over $2 billion dollars per year, year after year.\n  Some Members of Congress still believe these subsidies lead to lower \ngas prices, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n  As Severin Borenstein, the codirector of University of California \nCenter for the Study of Energy Markets, recently said:\n\n       The incremental change in production that might result from \n     changing oil subsidies will have no impact on world oil \n     prices, and therefore no impact on gasoline prices.\n\n  According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, \nrepealing tax subsidies for Big Oil would not result in higher gasoline \nprices.\n  CRS concludes that because the current $100-per-barrel price of oil \nfar exceeds the cost of production, it is unlikely that a small \nincrease in taxes would reduce output in a manner that decreases supply \nresulting in higher gasoline prices.\n  Yet these subsidies continue.\n  This bill eliminates five tax subsidies that lower the tax burden for \noil companies without producing a public benefit.\n  These changes will prevent oil companies from deducting things like \npayments to foreign governments and also prohibit oil companies from \nclaiming that oil production is ``domestic manufacturing'' deserving of \nincentives designed to help manufacturers compete with Chinese \nfactories.\n  This legislation also includes the key provisions of the Deepwater \nDrilling Royalty Relief Prohibition Act, a bill Senator Bill Nelson and \nI introduced to eliminate royalty relief that rewards dangerous oil \ndrilling methods.\n  By eliminating sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \nthat provided mandatory royalty relief for deepwater gas and oil \nproduction on the Outer Continental Shelf, this bill will ensure that \nAmericans receive fair value for federally owned mineral resources.\n  In 2005, Congress created this royalty-relief program to encourage \nexploration and production in the ocean's very deepest waters.\n  But the BP Deepwater Horizon catastrophe showed that safety and \nresponse technologies are not sufficient in deep waters to justify this \nincentive.\n  When the Deepwater Horizon well blew out, 11 people died and 17 \nothers were injured. Oil and gas rushed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 \ndays.\n  Oil slicks spread across the Gulf of Mexico, tar balls spoiled the \npristine white sand beaches of Florida, wetlands were coated with toxic \nsludge, and more than one-third of Federal waters in the gulf were \nclosed to fishing.\n  This week, the National Academy of Sciences found that plumes of \nsubsurface oil substantially damaged a community of deep-sea gulf \ncorals.\n  Drilling in deep water presents substantially more challenges and \ntechnical difficulties than drilling in shallow water or on shore.\n  The ocean currents on the surface and in the water column exert \ntorque pressure on the pipes and cables, which are longer and heavier.\n  The ocean pressure increases dramatically at depth, and the pressure \nin a well can exceed 10,000 pounds per square inch.\n  The volume of drilling mud and fluids is greater, and many technical \nprocedures can only be accomplished with the use of remotely controlled \nrobots thousands of feet below the surface.\n  Methane hydrate crystals form when methane gas mixes with pressurized \ncold ocean waters, and the likelihood of these crystals forming \nincreases dramatically at a depth of about 400 meters.\n  This crystallization repeatedly impeded efforts to stop the gushing \noil and was a primary reason it took so long to stop BP's Deepwater \nHorizon spill.\n  Bottom line: the risks of drilling for oil in thousands of feet of \nwater are far higher than other oil exploration methods, and spills are \nboth ecologically devastating and hard to stop.\n  American taxpayers should not forego revenue in order to incentivize \nthis most dangerous form of offshore drilling. It is not good \nenvironmental policy, and it is not good energy policy either.\n  I believe that global warming is the biggest environmental crisis we \nface, and the biggest culprit of global warming is manmade emissions \nproduced by the combustion of fossil fuels like oil and coal.\n  That is why I believe it is unconscionable that Congress allowed the \ntaxes on renewable sources of energy to go up on December 31, while \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies continue to finance production of fossil \nfuels.\n  I have worked with my colleagues on a number of legislative \ninitiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase \nenergy efficiency, and incentivize the use of renewable energy.\n  One of our biggest victories has been an aggressive fuel economy law, \ncalled the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, which was enacted in 2007.\n  In order to implement this law, the Obama administration has raised \nfleetwide fuel economy standards to 35.5 mpg in 2016--a 40-percent \nincrease above today's standard. The fleetwide average will rise to \n54.5 mpg by 2025.\n  This is important because these standards will dramatically reduce \nthe economic burden of massive swings in the price of oil and gasoline \non American families.\n  By 2025, the average new car will reduce what an American family \nspends on gasoline by $5,200 to $6,600 during the life of vehicle, and \nthat is assuming relatively affordable gas prices in the $3 per gallon \nrange.\n  If prices were to stay at today's levels, this law will save American \nfamilies even more money.\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\n  The other positive development is that the domestic renewable energy \nindustry has grown dramatically over the last few years due to the \nFederal incentives that are expiring and which this legislation would \nextend.\n  The Treasury Grants Program, which expired in December, has helped \nfund the installation of more than 22,000 renewable energy projects \nwith a generating capacity of more than 14,000 megawatts.\n  The production tax credit has allowed wind power capacity to more \nthan triple since 2005. If the production tax credit is not extended by \nthe end of this year, Navigant Consulting estimates that annual \ninstallations of wind will drop by more than 75 percent, wind-supported \njobs will decline from 78,000 in 2012 to 41,000 in 2013, and total wind \ninvestment will drop by nearly two-thirds, from $15.6 billion in 2012 \nto $5.5 billion in 2013.\n  We simply cannot afford as a nation to abandon the renewable energy \nindustry just as it is emerging as a major force in our economy.\n  These are private sector jobs in a growing industry that is competing \nglobally.\n  Just 2 years ago, the United States added more new capacity to \nproduce renewable electricity than it did to produce electricity from \nnatural gas, oil, and coal combined, for the first time. A great deal \nof this growth can be attributed to government renewable energy \nincentives. That is where public investment in energy development \nshould go.\n  The Obama administration has offered up millions of acres of Federal \nland for oil extraction by oil companies. As a result, production on \nthese Federal lands has increased.\n  In fact, of the over 12,000 permits that the Obama administration has \nissued since 2009, 7,000 sit idle.\n  But the fact is that whether or not the Federal government has opened \nenough land to oil drilling has almost nothing to do with gas prices, \neven though many politicians argue it does.\n  According to a statistical analysis of 36 years of monthly, \ninflation-adjusted gasoline prices and U.S. domestic oil production by \nthe Associated Press released this month, ``there is no statistical \ncorrelation between how much oil comes out of U.S. wells and the price \nat the pump.''\n  The AP writes:\n\n       If more domestic oil drilling worked as politicians say, \n     you'd now be paying about $2 a gallon for gasoline. . . . \n     More oil production in the United States does not mean \n     consistently lower prices at the pump.\n\n  Since February 2009, U.S. oil production has increased 15 percent \nwhen seasonally adjusted. Prices in those 3 years went from $2.07 per \ngallon to $3.58. It was a case of drilling more and paying much more.\n  U.S. oil production is back to the same level it was in March 2003, \nwhen gas cost $2.10 per gallon when adjusted for inflation. But that is \nnot what prices are now.\n  I don't believe oil companies need taxpayer dollars to help them out. \nThey are already reaping record profits.\n  Over the last decade, the five largest oil companies have enjoyed \nnearly $1 trillion in profits and tens of billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer subsidies. Yet we continue to use taxpayer dollars to add to \ntheir bottom line. This is unacceptable.\n  Oil reserves are a public resource. When a private company profits \nfrom those public resources, American taxpayers should receive a \nroyalty as compensation. And when oil companies profit by charging $4 \nper gallon of gas, they should pay income taxes like the rest of us do \ninstead of relying on billions of dollars of tax subsidies to avoid \ntheir obligations.\n  In these critical economic times, every cent of the people's money \nshould be spent wisely.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have been monitoring the debate on my \nRepeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act and I keep hearing over and over from \nour friends on the other side of the aisle that if we keep giving the \noil companies taxpayer money, they will do the right thing. The problem \nis we already know that is not true.\n  First of all, the United States has only 2 percent of the world's oil \nreserves, so we cannot drill our way out of this problem even if we \nwanted to. But, more importantly, we cannot trust the big five oil \ncompanies to simply do the right thing.\n  Let's look at the record. Last year, the big five oil companies took \n$2 billion of your money and saw their profits shoot up to $137 \nbillion--an impressive 75-percent increase in profits. Did they use \nthat extra money we gave them in our subsidies to produce more oil? No, \nthey didn't. They took your money and they didn't produce a drop more \nof oil. Despite the fact that overall U.S. oil production is higher now \nthan it has been in the last 8 years, last year these five companies \nactually produced 4 percent less oil.\n  So here is another way to look at it. As each of these companies \npocketed our subsidies to pad those profits, they did not use this \nwindfall to produce more oil. If we take the word of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, we have a contract, in essence, with these \nfive companies. We pay them $2 billion and they give us more oil. Last \nyear, they broke that contract and produced less. So it appears that \nthese poor oil companies took the taxpayers' $2 billion and instead of \nhaving to suffer with only $135 billion in profits, they made $137 \nbillion in profits last year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to at the end of my remarks.\n  What a heartwarming story of Robin Hood in reverse--taking from the \nAmerican taxpayer to give to the rich. So congratulations, Big Oil, you \ngot $2 billion extra in profits and we got 4 percent less oil.\n  But, of course, we are not just seeing less oil, we are also seeing \nthe American driver gouged with higher gasoline prices. What happens \nwhen taxpayers are forking over $2 billion in subsidies a year to \nhighly profitable oil companies that, in turn, produce less? We get a \ndouble whammy with $4-a-gallon gas at the pump and a bigger burden on \ntaxpayers. How is that a fair return on our taxpayer dollars? It is \npretty generous to Big Oil, which stands to profit $1 trillion over the \nnext decade while getting $24 billion in subsidies, but it is a bad \ndeal for consumers struggling to make ends meet.\n  First, the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act takes back $24 billion in \ntaxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and stops that insanity. The next step \nthe bill takes is investing in alternatives to oil--biofuels, natural \ngas, propane, and a refueling infrastructure for these fuels as well. \nBy investing in these alternatives we finally give Big Oil some \ncompetition in the marketplace that will give consumers the choice to \nuse cheaper fuels as well as drive down gas prices.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in getting back to \nreality and stop subsidizing industries that need it the least and \nstart investing in the 21st century industries that will help us \ncompete with China, that will create jobs, that will improve our \nenvironment and make us more energy secure. It is time we stopped \ntrusting Big Oil to do the right thing with our money and use it on \nthings that actually make sense.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have one question before this \nmorning's vote--one simple question: Is this the best we can do? Is \nthis the best we have to offer folks who are staring at $4-a-gallon \ngasoline, a bill that even Democrats admit won't do anything at all to \nlower the price of gas, and a process that blocks any other idea from \neven coming to the floor for a vote? Is this the best we can do? No \nother idea has been allowed other than a proposal that will inevitably \nraise the price of gasoline at the pump. Does anybody think the Senate \nhas done its job on this issue?\n  Well, if you don't, if you think we should do more for the American \npeople at a time when they are paying $4 a gallon for gas than raise \ntaxes on energy manufacturers and block a pipeline from Canada, then \nyou ought to vote against cloture. You should stand with Republicans \nand insist we do more to lower gas prices in this country.\n  I see the President made a statement a little while ago in support of \nthis proposed tax hike. My question is: Where\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nwas the White House when the Democrats voted to actually get off of \nthis proposal? Maybe they were too busy lining up votes against the \nKeystone Pipeline. Maybe the President was too busy telling the \nRussians about how he is hoping for more flexibility.\n  My point is Democrats don't have to take orders from the White House. \nThey don't need to serve the President's political strategy. They can \ndo what their constituents want them to do on this issue. They can vote \nto stay on this bill and fight for real solutions to the problems of \nhigh gas prices and any other number of issues the Democrats refuse to \nface, for that matter. We can use this institution to actually make a \ndifference. I hope at some point that is what my colleagues on the \nother side decide to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, we just had a vote. Imagine for a \nminute we had a government that was spending too much money, and \nimagine for a minute that we needed to spend less money; that we needed \nto change our Tax Code to a Tax Code that was fair, simpler, and didn't \npick winners and losers. Imagine for a minute this was a crisis, and \nimagine for a minute this crisis was being wielded like a political 2 \nby 4 by the majority of the Republicans who serve in the Senate--the \ndebt crisis.\n  Then imagine for a minute that we had the most profitable \ncorporations in the history of the planet and they were booking $30 \nbillion in profit every quarter; over $130 billion in profits year \nafter year, didn't matter whether the economy was bad, good or \nindifferent--amazing profits.\n  Then imagine for a minute this government--that doesn't have enough \nmoney, where the debt is the political talking point of my friends \nacross the aisle--tries to do something simple by saying maybe we \nshouldn't be spending money on the most profitable corporations in the \nworld. That is what this vote just was.\n  How seriously can we take anybody who talks about debt reduction if \nthey are not willing to pluck the low-hanging fruit of subsidies to a \ngroup of folks who, frankly, in Missouri, I guarantee you most people I \nrepresent would say are the least deserving of extra help from the \nFederal Government right now.\n  If we think about it, what we are doing is we are borrowing money to \nprop up, to the tune of billions of dollars a year, already wildly \nprofitable corporations that don't have to pay us royalties because \nthey get to deduct the royalties they pay other countries.\n  Seriously, if this was a fairytale I was reading to my grandsons--if \nI was reading this fairytale to Ian or Levy or Isaac--they would say: \nWell, this obviously is fiction because this couldn't be true. But it \nis, and that is what I call the definition of a special interest--that \noil is so special around here, wields so much power and so much money \nthat it turns all the talk about debt reduction into empty rhetoric.\n  Last year, the five companies spent $38 billion boosting their share \nprices just through stock buybacks--$38 billion in stock buybacks last \nyear. In other words, the five largest oil companies spent in a single \nyear on stock buybacks alone what they are claiming they need in \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies over the next 10 years.\n  According to ExxonMobil's quarterly filings, every time the price of \noil goes up by $1, they bring in $350 million in annual profit. These \ncompanies don't need these subsidies.\n  I hear people say, Well, if you don't give them the subsidies--which, \nby the way, is chickenfeed to them. What, $6 billion, $8 billion a year \nis nothing if you are banking $30 billion in profits a quarter. I have \nheard people say, If we don't give them this extra help, then they are \ngoing to quit exploring for oil and the price of gas will go up. That \nis so dumb. They have had these subsidies for 30, 40, 50 years. I think \nmost of Americans realize the price of oil has gone up just fine during \nthat time. We are paying plenty at the gas pump right now, and they \nhave got those subsidies. How is that working out for us? Those \nsubsidies are really keeping down the price of gasoline, aren't they?\n  The former Shell CEO, John Hofmeister, is on record as saying:\n\n       In the face of sustained high oil prices it is not an \n     issue--for large companies--of needing the subsidies to \n     entice us into looking for and producing more oil . . . my \n     point of view is that with high oil prices such subsidies are \n     unnecessary.\n\n  This is the CEO of Shell. He is admitting on the record that these \nsubsidies\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nare unnecessary. At the time the Shell CEO said that, the price of oil \nwas trading between $95 and $98 a barrel. Currently, it is at $105 a \nbarrel. Contrary to the claims that some are making, eliminating these \nsubsidies will not raise gas prices.\n  Last year, the companies spent $70 million to lobby to keep their \nsubsidies. They get about $30 in tax breaks for every $1 they spend in \nlobbying. No wonder they spent that much on lobbying.\n  I want to take people at their word, and I want to take people \nseriously about debt reduction. I have cosponsored spending caps with \nmy Republican colleagues. I have worked hard on reforming the way we \nspend money around here, whether it is contracting or earmarks. But \nwith all due respect, I don't know how the American people can take \nanyone seriously about debt reduction if they are not willing to cut \noff from the spigot the most wealthy, profitable corporations in the \nhistory of the world.\n  How will we ever be able to look our grandchildren in the eye and \nsay, You know, we took care of your future by making sure that our \ngovernment was fiscally balanced. How can we ever do that if we can't \ndo this as an easy first step? Can you imagine how paralyzed this place \nwill be when we start talking about the kinds of cuts that hurt people \nwho need them? And by the way, they are willing to make those. Talk \nabout fairness. Think about this for a minute, economic fairness.\n  The Ryan budget would want to hold onto more tax breaks for \nmultimillionaires--in fact, do more tax breaks for multimillionaires--\nwhile they say to seniors, You know, we think it is time for you to \nwrestle with insurance companies for your health care. I know what it \nis like to wrestle with insurance companies for health care. Every \nAmerican does. My mom doesn't have to. She is on Medicare. It gives her \npeace of mind.\n  If you look at what our friends are proposing in terms of fairness \nand you look at the vote we just had, in Missouri we would say that dog \ndon't hunt. It doesn't work.\n  I hope in good faith that my Republican colleagues will quit thinking \nwe need to continue to write checks to the wealthiest corporations in \nthe history of the planet. I think Missourians--when I fill up my gas \ntank over the next 2 weeks as I travel around Missouri, I am going to \nstop people at the gas station and say, Do you think the royalties \nExxonMobil pays to another country should be deducted from what they \nowe us? Think about that. It is ludicrous in this financial environment \nthat we are in, in the U.S. Government. There are real people hurting \nout there, and we need to treat them fairly. We can start by pushing \nBig Oil away from the taxpayer trough, and I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will reconsider and that we will get a chance \nto vote on this again and that they can show the American people we all \nget it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the \nchanges the affordable care act is making to the way care is delivered \nin our health care system. This is a topic that has not received much \npublic attention. Instead, the public debate has largely focused on \ncontentious flashpoints such as the individual mandate or preposterous \nfalse claims about death panels or rationing or socialized medicine.\n  While these contentious debates have raged on, there has been a \nquiet, steady, and important effort made by the health care industry, \nby State and local leaders, and by the Obama administration to improve \nour model of health care delivery. Progress made on these efforts is \nsteadily transforming the care that is delivered under our health care \nsystem, from care that is disorganized and fragmented and often riddled \nwith error, to care that is coordinated, efficient, and the high \nquality Americans deserve. By improving the quality of care and our \nhealth outcomes, these delivery system reforms promise to significantly \nreduce health care costs. Care gets better, costs go down, a true win-\nwin.\n  I came to the floor today to release a report on health care delivery \nsystem reform and on the administration's progress implementing these \nprovisions of the affordable care act. I undertook this project with \nthe support and assistance of Chairman Harkin and Senator Mikulski, \nboth strong advocates and experienced legislators on the types \nof reforms that are highlighted in the report.\n\n  The report makes the case for the reforms our country urgently needs \nin order to tackle our health care cost problem. My report defines five \npriority areas of health care delivery system reform: payment reform, \nquality improvement, primary and preventive care, administrative costs, \nand health information infrastructure. It outlines the potential cost \nsavings in each area.\n  It also highlights successes across the country from leading private \nhealth providers such as Geisinger Health Systems in Pennsylvania, \nIntermountain Healthcare in Utah, and the Marshfield Clinic in \nWisconsin, to the State of Vermont's Blueprint for Health, to several \nexamples in my home State of Rhode Island, which has shown great \nleadership. We have much to learn from these efforts, and the \naffordable care act gives us the tools to support this type of reform \nacross the country.\n  The problem is our health care delivery system remains clumsy and \nwasteful. We spend more than 18 percent of America's gross domestic \nproduct on our health care system every year. To put that into context, \nthe highest any other industrialized country spends is approximately 12 \npercent of gross domestic product on health care. Eighteen percent \nUnited States of America; least efficient other industrialized country \nin the world, 12 percent. Huge room for improvement. In a nutshell, we \noverspend and underachieve.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that over $700 \nbillion a year can be saved without compromising health outcomes. The \nInstitutes of Medicine put the savings from these kinds of reforms at \n$765 billion a year. The New England Health Care Institute projected \n$850 billion in savings annually, and the Lewin Group and former Bush \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have estimated the savings at $1 \ntrillion a year. Whichever is accurate, this is clearly an enormous \nopportunity and it is right before us. We can achieve better results \nfor American patients and families, and spend less to do it.\n  As I said, the solutions fall into five priority areas: payment \nreform, primary and preventive care, measuring and reporting quality, \nadministrative simplification, and health information infrastructure. \nThese solutions do not cut benefits; they do not increase premiums. \nInstead, they realign incentives to reduce or get rid of overpriced or \nunnecessary services, inefficiently delivered care, excessive \nadministrative costs, and missed prevention opportunities.\n  In this report, we outline actual savings and care improvements that \ncan be found in each priority area. For example, payment reform refers \nto the new payment reform models that pay doctors more for getting \nbetter results, as opposed to ordering more procedures.\n  In 2010, Blue Shield of California collaborated with Hill Physicians \nMedical Group and Catholic Healthcare West, California's largest \nhospital chain, on a pilot program for the California Public Employees \nRetirement System. The pilot program focused on improved coordination \nof care by sharing clinical and case management information across \nmedical facilities and among physicians.\n  In its first year, the Blue Shield pilot program reported impressive \nresults: Readmissions were reduced by 15 percent; hospital days were \nreduced by 15 percent; inpatient stays of 20 or more days were reduced \nby 50 percent, cut in half--all saving millions of dollars.\n  In primary and preventive care--as a country, we don't devote nearly \nenough resources to primary care and prevention. Only 6 percent to 8 \npercent of health care spending goes to primary care, to your regular \ndoctor appointments. That is less than the percentage that goes in \nprivate insurance to insurance company overhead.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to give \nan example: When colorectal cancer is found early and treated, the 5-\nyear survival\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nrate is 90 percent. But screening rates for colorectal cancer are low. \nThe National Health Interview Survey found that in 2005, only half the \npopulation aged 50 and older received recommended screening for colon \ncancer. The American Cancer Society has found that increased colorectal \nscreening in the pre-Medicare population could save lives and reduce \nsubsequent Medicare treatment costs by $15 billion over 11 years.\n  On measuring and reporting quality, we don't do this anywhere near \nwell enough. Nearly 1 in every 20 hospitalized patients in the United \nStates gets a hospital-acquired infection. This is very expensive and \nit is preventable. A hospital-acquired infection should be a never \nevent. Yet it costs our health care system approximately $2.5 billion a \nyear in harmful costs we could avoid.\n  Administrative simplification. The proportion of the U.S. health care \ndollar that is lost to administration has always been high relative to \nour peer countries. The cost of administration by insurance companies \nis not only high itself, but it creates a shadow cost imposed on \nproviders who have to fight back against the insurance company claims \ndenial apparatus, and that cost is probably even higher.\n  A study published in Health Affairs documented that physicians spent \non average 142 hours annually interacting with health plans, totaling \nnearly 7 percent of total health care costs. That is just the \nphysician's time. That doesn't count all the nonphysician office staff \ndedicated to administration and chasing the insurance companies.\n\n  Last, health and information technology. Health information \ntechnology is the essential underlying framework for health care \ndelivery system reform. It is the foundation on which other delivery \nsystem reforms can be built. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine \nestimated the number of deaths resulting from medical error as high as \n98,000 American deaths annually. The most common cause of those \npreventable injuries and deaths in hospitals was medication errors, \nwhich can be reduced dramatically through the adoption of computerized \nphysician order entry systems--health information technology.\n  The reform areas my report discusses synchronize with one another, \nand there is a growing national movement of providers and payers and \nStates that recognize their critical importance. Focusing on quality \nrather than quantity and focusing on efficiency rather than volume will \nbetter serve not only their patients but their bottom line.\n  The report I am releasing today looks at 45 provisions in the \naffordable care act that promote these delivery system reforms. From \nthe discussion one would not know that virtually one-third of the \naffordable care act was about these delivery system reforms because \nthey have been noncontroversial, but they are in there and they are \nimportant.\n  The report also assesses the administration's progress in \nimplementing them. We found that the administration has already \nimplemented 25 provisions fully and made significant progress on two \nothers. The complexity and sheer number of reforms included in the law \nmake this accomplishment in a relatively short period of time \nnoteworthy.\n  In addition to the hurdles presented by our fragmented health care \nsystem, there has been resistance in Congress to the administration's \nimplementation efforts that has also created barriers. For the 20 \ndelivery system provisions that have not yet been implemented, lack of \ncongressional funding is a significant factor in delaying their forward \nprogress.\n  In these reform provisions, the affordable care act is supporting and \nbuilding upon the efforts undertaken by the private sector by \nrealigning incentives in the health care system to support private \nsector efforts. A broad array of pilot and demonstration programs has \nbeen launched, from which best practices will be deployed nationwide. \nThe process to get to a more sustainable path will be one of, as CBO \nDirector Elmendorf said, ``experimentation and learning. It will be a \nprocess of innovation.''\n  The affordable care act improves the conditions that allow that \ninnovation to take place, and it has the mechanisms needed to propagate \nthose reforms widely throughout the system as quickly as possible once \nthey are proven effective.\n  American ingenuity can overcome our toughest challenges, not through \ncommand and control but through dynamic, flexible, and persistent \nexperimentation, learning, and innovation. We are at a fork in the road \non our health care future. One path we could travel is to protect the \ndysfunctional status quo and cut benefits to pay for the waste. That is \nthe way a lot of my colleagues want to go.\n  The other way is to shift incentives so that we innovate toward \nbetter, safer health care--which costs less. We as Americans need to \ntrust that the path of innovation and experimentation is the right one \nand not give up on these efforts.\n  Last year, George Halvorson, who is the CEO of Kaiser Permanente and \nknows a little something about health care, said it this way:\n\n       There are people right now who want to cut benefits and \n     ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in \n     this country and that is wrong. It's so wrong it's almost \n     criminal.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       It's an inept way of thinking about health care.\n\n  The affordable care act has the tools that enable providers to focus \non quality rather than quantity, efficiency rather than volume, and \npatients rather than their bottom line, to avoid the inept way of \nthinking about health care.\n  As I close, let me say that throughout the process of writing this \nreport I found one thing to be glaringly absent; that is, a cost \nsavings goal set by the administration for us to reach toward on these \ndelivery system reform provisions.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy declared that within 10 years the United \nStates would put a man on the Moon and return him safely. This message \nwas clear, it was direct, and it created accountability. As a result, a \nvast mobilization of private and public resources occurred to \ncollaborate in innovative ways to achieve the President's purpose.\n  While the issue facing our country in health care is different, the \nurgency and the need to mobilize the public and private sectors toward \nimproving quality and reducing cost is the same. So I challenge the \nadministration to set a cost-savings target for delivery system reform. \nA cost-savings target will focus, guide, and spur the administration's \nefforts in a manner that vague intentions to bend the health care cost \ncurve will never do. It also will provide a measurable goal by which we \ncan evaluate our progress.\n  A clear and public goal will help make this vision of our health care \nsystem a reality. It will drive forward progress, and it will generate \nmomentum to achieve that goal.\n  I urge the administration: Set a goal you are prepared to be \naccountable to meet.\n  When President Kennedy announced in September of 1962 that America \nwould strive to put a man on the Moon, he said:\n\n       We choose to go to the moon in this decade . . . not \n     because [it is] easy, but because [it is] hard, because that \n     goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our \n     energies and skills, because that challenge is one we are \n     willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one \n     which we intend to win.\n\n  We need to face the challenge posed by the rising health care costs \nin our system. We need to recognize we cannot postpone finding a \nsolution. We can win this challenge, we can drive our system toward a \nsustainable path of higher quality care and improved outcomes, and we \ncan do so by setting clear goals and supporting the measures in the \naffordable care act that propel us in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to speak for a moment to the \nissue that was raised by my colleague from Missouri. Senator Claire \nMcCaskill came to the Senate floor to take note of the vote that had \njust been issued, the rollcall that was just finished on a measure \noffered by Senator Menendez from New Jersey. It was pretty \nstraightforward.\n  Here is what it said: The Federal tax subsidies of $2 billion a year \nto the biggest oil companies in America should end right now. The money \nin those subsidies should be used to develop other\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nforms of energy--good for our future, clean for our environment, \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil--and the balance should be put \ninto reduction of our deficit. Two billion dollars a year is going to \nthe four biggest oil companies in America.\n  How are they doing? We all know how they are doing. Last year, again, \nthey broke all records in the history of American business, reporting \nprofits of $137 billion. The notion that we would take away $2 billion \nfrom these oil companies and put it into deficit reduction and energy \nresearch that could be good for our future seems like a given. In fact, \nit seems so easy that when we had a vote earlier this week to bring up \nthis measure, over 90 Senators voted yes; let's go to it.\n  What happened on this vote today? We needed 60 votes, which sadly has \nbecome the norm in this Chamber. We needed 60 out of 100 Senators to \nsay stop the fat-cat subsidies to the oil companies. We couldn't get \nit. We got exactly two Republican Senators to vote with us--two. It is \na sad reality that many of the same Senators who wax eloquent on the \nSenate floor about our deficit and what to do about it, when it comes \nto a simple, straightforward vote to stop this wasteful, unwarranted \nsubsidy to the most profitable companies on Earth, could not bring \nthemselves to say no to Big Oil.\n  Meanwhile, families and businesses all across Chicago, IL, and \nAmerica are paying more and more at the pump. Last Sunday I saw my \nfirst one--hang on, America; you are going to see one too--$5.03 a \ngallon. It was downtown Chicago at a BP station. Hang on tight, there \nis more to come from these oil companies that will then turn around and \nreport the biggest profits ever in American business history.\n  We pay at the pump and we pay with our taxes. What is left? Here was \nour chance to stand up and do something. We know $4 billion is not \ngoing to change the oil industry, and it is not going to change \nWashington. But at least it was a statement about where we stand when \ncomes to age-old indefensible tax subsidies to the biggest and most \nprofitable companies in America. We couldn't bring ourselves to do it.\n  I agree with Senator McCaskill. These folks who get up and wail and \ncry about the deficit--call up this rollcall and ask them where in the \nheck they were when we had one chance to do something positive.\n  It is not the biggest disappointment of the week. There are two \nothers that trump it. I have to tell you, it is hard for me to believe \nthat again we were unable to get a bipartisan group together to start \nthe conversation about post office reform in America. It is the most \nhonored Federal agency.\n  When people are asked across America, what agency of government do \nthey have a positive feeling about, it is the post office. They make \njokes about it--we all do--but we know in our heart of hearts it is the \nbest Postal Service in the world. We can still take an envelope and for \nless than 50 cents put it in a box and be confident that in a matter of \na couple of days or three it is going to be delivered in the lower 48.\n  There are not many countries on Earth that even get close to making \nthat claim for less than 50 cents. It is so good that the so-called \npackage express folks who were trying to make this a private sector \nundertaking use the post office. They use the post office because of \nthe efficiency of their delivery for the last mile of delivery.\n  So we have a problem. Fewer people are using first-class mail. They \nare using e-mail, bill payer. Revenues are down. Postal employees are \ndown to around 600,000. Those who are retired are around 450,000. We \nneed to bank money for retirees in the future. We are facing the need \nto make some hard choices about the Postal Service.\n  The Postmaster General came to my office about 5 months ago now. We \nsat down with Mr. Donahoe and said: Before you make harsh decisions \nabout the Postal Service, closing post offices, reducing the mail \ndeliveries and the like--before people's jobs are on the chopping block \nor at least in question, give Congress a chance to at least come up \nwith a better approach.\n  Historically, that was a challenge Congress always accepted because \nwe knew when it is something that big and important as the Postal \nService, which is enshrined in our Constitution, it is our job. We are \nsupposed to do that work.\n  So I asked him to postpone, if he would, until May 15, any closures \nof facilities so the House and the Senate could have a chance to act. I \nhave been waiting. It has been hard to get into the Senate calendar. \nThis week was our chance. Senator Harry Reid said we are going to bring \nit up because it is an important debate. We need to get together.\n  We called the bill on the Senate floor to move to this debate on the \npost office. To their credit, the independent Democratic chairman of \nthe jurisdictional committee, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, and \nthe Republican ranking member, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, both \nvoted to move to this measure.\n  I felt good about the fact that they were working together, along \nwith Tom Carper of Delaware and others, in a bipartisan effort to make \nthis post office what we need it to be. I have confidence in Senators \nLieberman and Collins because they have done historic work in the past \nwhen it came to reforming our intelligence agencies after 9/11; the two \nof them did it. I credit them, many times publicly, for their \nbipartisan cooperation. Here we had another chance: We are going to \nbring postal reform to the floor, and we failed to get 60 votes.\n  Unfortunately, we could not get more than five from the other side of \nthe aisle to even engage in the debate on Postal Service reform. Now we \nwill be gone for 2 weeks. When we return, it will be a lot closer to \nApril 15 and a lot more challenging for us to get anything done. Those \ntwo disappointments--that we could not seize $4 billion in savings for \nthe deficit in oil company subsidies and that we wouldn't accept our \nresponsibility to deal with postal service reform--I am afraid that has \nbeen matched and trumped by what is going on in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  Think about this: Two weeks ago we passed a bipartisan bill on the \nfloor of the Senate for the Federal Transportation bill. When it comes \nto our economy and its future, it is hard to think of anything more \nimportant than investing in highways, mass transit, airports and ports, \nand rail lines to make sure that we have an economy ready to compete in \nthe 21st century, that businesses can locate in America with confidence \nthat their products can move to the markets as quickly as possible.\n  This bill comes up every 5 years, and it is a political piece of \ncake. Democrats and Republicans agree. We all have needs in our States \nand districts, and we always come together with a bipartisan bill. We \ndid in the Senate.\n  Two Senators couldn't be further apart on the political spectrum than \nBarbara Boxer of California and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma. But you know \nwhat. They accepted their political responsibility and came up with a \nbipartisan Federal transportation bill that passed the Senate 74 to 22.\n  Meanwhile, what was happening in the House? The House was just one \ncrash after another. Their first highway bill went nowhere--rejected. \nTheir second highway bill they would not even call for a vote. Time \npassed, and more and more of these measures were falling apart. They \nwithdrew the chairman of the committee in the House in charge of it and \nsaid: We are going to put somebody else in. They brought in another \nname. I couldn't keep up with it.\n  The Speaker of the House and the House Republican caucus made a dog's \nbreakfast out of this Federal Transportation bill. Today, to add insult \nto injury, they not only would not call our bipartisan bill, which is \nall we have asked for--I see Senator Boxer on the floor. All we said \nis, bring the Boxer-Inhofe bill to a vote in the House. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It is good for this country. For goodness' sakes, vote \non it.\n  No, we are not going to do it. If it isn't the House Republican bill, \nwe are not going to consider it.\n  What do they do instead? Senator Boxer can explain what they did \ninstead. They said: We will kick the can down the road. We will extend \nthe highway taxes for 90 days and get back to you later.\n  A person might think, no harm, no foul. Just extending it 90 days, \nthere is no harm. Wrong. State after State, county after county will \ntell you that\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nthis 90-day extension freezes efforts to build projects across America \nand will cost us at least 100,000 jobs. The number may be much larger, \nbut it will cost us at least 100,000 jobs. Do we need jobs at this \nmoment in time in America? I should say so. In the midst of a recovery \nfrom a recession, one of the areas hit the hardest is the construction \nindustry. And it is not just a matter of the workers out there on the \njob, it is all of their suppliers. The truckdrivers, the material men, \nand all of them are now going to be put on hold because the Speaker of \nthe House refuses to call a bipartisan Senate transportation bill for a \nvote.\n  That is all we asked--up or down, call it for a vote. Why wouldn't he \ncall it for a vote? Because it would pass. To his embarrassment, it \nwould pass. Well, he got his way, I guess. He is going to send us a 90-\nday extension. The alternative of letting the highway trust fund lapse \nis not a reasonable one, not one any of us would embrace. But what a \nwasted opportunity.\n  My colleague and good friend, who is sitting right here and has been \nin this business, the House and the Senate, for a long time, poured her \nheart and soul into that Federal Transportation bill. She accomplished \nwhat nobody thought she could. When she said she was going to sit down \nwith Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and work it out, we said: Bet that \nworks; the two of them are so different. But when it comes to this \nmeasure, they see eye to eye. They worked it out. I am proud of what \nthey did. I didn't like everything in the bill, but nobody does. But I \nvoted for it, saying it is bipartisan, it moves our country forward, \nand it creates almost 3 million jobs. The Boxer-Inhofe bill creates and \nsaves almost 3 million jobs. Is that important at this moment in our \nhistory? You bet it is. If you are not in favor of creating good-paying \njobs right here in America for American families, what the heck are you \ndoing in this business? And instead, the House said: No, we will not \neven let you vote on this measure. House Democrats tried the entire \nweek to get this measure up. Even a few--just a few--House Republicans \nspoke up and said: Bring it up for a vote. It wasn't good enough.\n  I know the Senator from California is here, and I want to give her a \nchance to say a word about the impact of the measure that just passed \nthe House of Representatives. She has gone in it, in many cases State \nby State, to measure what it means to just extend the highway trust \nfund and not pass a bill that can create and save up to 3 million jobs. \nShe told me that in my State, it was something like 4,000.\n  Mrs. BOXER. More than that--about 4,500.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are 4,500 jobs lost if we let the federal \ntransportation program expire this summer because Speaker Boehner \nrefuses to call up this bill. That is the reality. Is it any wonder \nthat the approval rating of Congress is in single digits when you take \na hard look at what this does to our Nation? At a time when we need \nCongress to work together, the Speaker will not call the bipartisan \nbill from the Senate. The Senate will not take up postal reform. The \nSenate refuses to even cut the $4 billion subsidy to the biggest oil \ncompanies in America.\n  It is a disappointment to me because many of us worked hard to come \nhere. I feel honored to have this job and feel a responsibility to the \npeople we represent. I think the Senate, on those two votes I \nmentioned, and the House with their action today have let down the \npeople of this country.\n  I would like to yield to the Senator from California. I have another \nstatement to make, but I want to give her a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes and then \nreturn the floor to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was going to wait until the House actually sent over \nthis extension before saying anything, but I was so impressed with \nSenator Durbin's explanation that I felt I should come to the floor and \nthank him so much. His leadership on this and also, Madam President, \nyour deep concern for your State, which actually has the largest job \nloss numbers because they are being very conservative about what they \ndo on the ground--not everybody understands the way the transportation \nprograms work in our States. The Federal Government pays for about 75 \npercent of many projects and the State pays 25 percent. But the States \ngo out and they front the money and then they bill the Federal \nGovernment. Well, the signal that has been sent from the House today is \na disastrous signal because it is a signal to all of our States that \nthey better beware because there is no guarantee they will ever get \nthose funds back from the Federal Government.\n  You know, I love it when we make history here, but I love it when we \nmake good history here. Today, by the House's action, I believe they \nhave become the first House of Representatives ever to allow this \nhighway trust fund to go bankrupt because right now the fund is not \nsufficient and has to be filled. That is why part of the wonderful \nresult of the Senate bill--and Senator Inhofe and I appreciate getting \na lot of credit, but we actually had four committees that did their \nwork: Senators Johnson and Shelby over in Banking, and we had Senators \nRockefeller and Hutchison over in Commerce. But a very tough job was \ngiven to Senator Baucus, and he worked hand-in-glove with the \nRepublicans, particularly with Senators such as Senator Thune, to come \nup with a pay-for.\n  Well, here we have an extension with no revenues in it, Madam \nPresident, so naturally your State is very worried, as are all of our \nStates, and I am going to quickly go through what we know so far. We \nknow that Illinois is having big trouble because their contract-letting \ncannot go forward in 12 particular jobs, and that is going to result in \na scaleback of 4,500 jobs. They are scaling back right now, as Senator \nDurbin said, at a time when we need jobs. North Carolina has 41,000 \njobs that cannot be filled. Nevada has 4,000 jobs, Maryland has 4,000, \nand Michigan has 3,500. I see the great Senator from Rhode Island here. \nWe got word from his director, Mike Lewis, from the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Transportation, that there are job delays, and it looks \nas if 1,000 jobs will not be filled. In West Virginia, 1,200 jobs will \nnot be filled.\n  We are in trouble. You know what, it is like taking a hammer and \nhitting your head: Why do they do it? They don't have to. They don't \nhave to do this. They are wreaking havoc on the Nation with this \nextension. And Chairman Mica said today: This must be the last \nextension. Fine. It should not even be an extension. They should take \nup and pass the Senate bill. How many bills do we have that have 74 \nvotes in favor? And if Senator Lautenberg had not been at a funeral, it \nwould have been 75. Three-quarters of this Senate came together around \nthis bill. So the House is wreaking havoc on the Nation. Right now, you \ncould fill 14 Super Bowl stadiums with unemployed construction \nworkers--1.4 million. And why are they doing it? Because they don't \nwant to deal in any way with the Democrats.\n  Senator Inhofe and I were so thrilled to work together. I see the \nsenior Senator from Alaska who helped us draft our bill with Senator \nBegich. They crossed party lines. We have a great bill. Is it perfect? \nOf course not. Is it strong? Yes. Is it paid for? Yes. Will it protect \n1.9 million jobs and create an additional million? Yes. That is great \nnews. But the House has decided--the only people in America not to get \nthis is the House of Representatives over there, the Republicans.\n  I see my colleague here, and I am glad to yield for him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Setting aside the questions that this raises about \nthe House's ability to govern, which I think are raised by this issue \nbut focusing on this highway question, it is now the end of March. If \nwe go 90 days, 30 days takes us through the end of April, 30 more days \ntakes us through the end of May, and 30 more days takes us through the \nend of June. There is a seasonal component to getting this work done, \nis there not? What is the effect of our entire highway, road, and \nbridge industry having no certainty about what their funding is going \nto be until practically the Fourth of July\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nwith the construction season then underway?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the question is very important. This is the worst \npossible time because now, if you can't enter into new contracts, you \nlose the building season. And it is particularly brutal right now on \nthe businesses and on the workers.\n  Let me be clear. This is a 90-day extension without any hopes of them \nfinishing their work. They didn't say that in the 90 days, they would \nget the job done, get to conference, and get the bill to the President; \nthey are just saying 90 days with no commitment to go to conference.\n  I will come back and we will attempt to attach the Senate bill to the \nextension. Madam President, I hope you will have the opportunity to \nwork on that with me because our States are counting on us, and we have \nto be strong and we have to keep fighting for one simple premise: that \nthe House should have the right to vote on the Senate-passed bill.\n  I am very proud to be here. I will be here this afternoon as long as \nit takes. I say to my friend from Rhode Island, I hope he can be there, \nas well as my friend from Illinois. As soon as we get their extension, \nwhich makes no commitment to go to conference, we are going to try to \nattach the Senate bill to the extension and send it into conference, \nand I hope my friends will be here to help me with that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see my friend from Alaska is on the \nfloor, and I would like to yield to her and ask unanimous consent that \nI be recognized after her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the courtesy \nof my colleague from Illinois, and I also will follow on Senator \nBoxer's comments on the importance of this highway transportation bill.\n  I think we recognize that, while far from being perfect--I am not \nconvinced we develop any perfect legislation around here--it is an \nextraordinarily good-faith effort, a very strong bipartisan \ndemonstration in this body, and deserves to have this support. I \napplaud Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for their work on that.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Madam President, just very briefly, I wanted to take a few minutes \nthis morning to speak about an event that just happened outside on the \nlawn of the Capitol. About maybe 50 or 60 Alaskans and some wannabe \nAlaskans gathered in a rally, a march that we have entitled ``Choose \nRespect.'' This is an effort that has stemmed from the actions of our \nGovernor in Alaska to shine the spotlight on domestic violence and \nsexual assault and to come together as communities, as a State, to \nspeak up and to turn around the statistics that are so devastating in \nour State when it comes to domestic violence and sexual assault.\n\n  Over the past few years, the Governor has led the charge in \norganizing rallies in the State of Alaska during the last week of \nMarch. This morning in our State there will be 120 different rallies \ngoing on in communities such as Anchorage and Fairbanks, our larger \ncommunities, but also in smaller villages such as Kooskia and Tanana, \ncommunities where the numbers are small but the passions on the issues \nI think are very strong and robust. The Governor has commissioners in \nBarrow, in Tanana, in Cordova, in Nome, and in Galena, all leading the \nmarch to stand up and speak out about domestic violence. I wish to \nacknowledge what the Governor has done in his effort to spotlight this \nand to work to reduce the rates of domestic violence, sexual assault, \nand child abuse through this ``Choose Respect'' initiative. We have \ngreat Alaskans standing together and, again, a real commitment to make \na difference.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues have heard me say this before, that in a \nState such as Alaska where I think we have unparalleled beauty, we also \nhave an ugly side to our State that is manifested in statistics we see \nwith violence against women and particularly violence against Native \nwomen. Violence against Native women has reached epidemic proportions. \nWe are at a point where Native women experience domestic violence and \nsexual assault at rates 2\\1/2\\ times higher than other races. In the \nlower 48, women on reservations are 10 times more likely to be \nmurdered. Systematic legal barriers and ineffectual or deficient law \nenforcement mechanisms result in women, children, and families living \nin fear. In Alaska, nearly one in two women has experienced partner \nviolence and close to one in three has experienced sexual violence. \nOverall, nearly 6 in 10 Alaska women have been victims of sexual \nassault or domestic violence. This is absolutely unacceptable. That is \nthe reality we are living with as a State now, and it is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  Alaska's rate of forcible rape between 2003 and 2009 was 2.6 times \nhigher than the national rate. Tragically, about 9 percent of Alaska \nmothers reported physical abuse by their husband or their partner \nduring pregnancy or in the 12 months prior to pregnancy. These are \nhorrifying statistics.\n  These statistics bring me to the issue of violence against women and \nthe Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, the bill we have been talking \nabout and hopefully will be bringing to the floor soon. A measure such \nas this I think is incredibly important as a vehicle for us to stand \nbehind women and men. It doesn't make any difference if one is from a \nrural part of the country or an urban part of the country; it is an \nissue that I think we know rips at the heart of who we are.\n  In so many of the Alaskan villages, victims of domestic violence and \nsexual assault face some pretty unique challenges and therefore \nhorrific challenges. It may be that there is no full-time law \nenforcement presence, there is no local justice infrastructure. In many \nsituations villages are landlocked. There are no roads in. The only way \nin and out is by airplane. So we have a situation where we can have an \nindividual who has been victimized, with no law enforcement presence in \nthe community whatsoever. It may take State troopers days--days--to be \nable to respond to an incident, depending on weather conditions. \nImagine yourself in that situation. You have been a victim of domestic \nviolence. You seek help. There is none in the village and no way away \nfrom your perpetrator.\n  I think we recognize that one thing we can and must do is make sure \nthere is a safety net available to address the immediate survival needs \nof the victim and the survival needs of their children in the short \nterm. Only with this level of confidence can one gather the courage to \nleave an abusive situation.\n  One final comment on VAWA, and then I will yield to my colleague who \nhas given me the courtesy of the floor right now. I think we recognize \nin Alaska that the Violence Against Women Act does offer a ray of hope, \nif you will, for those who are not only the victims but for those who \nhelp assist the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in our \nvillages. It will provide for some increased resources to our rural and \nto our very isolated communities. It will help to establish a framework \nfor the Alaskan Rural Justice Commission which has been a great venue \nto make sure we are all understanding what the tools are and how we \nadapt to those tools. It also recognizes Alaska's Village Public Safety \nOfficer Program as law enforcement so that VAWA funds can be directed \nto providing a full-time law enforcement presence in places that have \nnone.\n  We have a lot of issues we need to work through. We believe the \nreauthorization of VAWA will help us with that. So as we join with \nother Alaskans in the State and those here in Washington, DC, to choose \nrespect for all women, for all in our communities, I think it is \nimportant that there are some tools we can put in place to help not \nonly the people of my State but victims of domestic violence wherever \nthey may be.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senate is not a place for sprinters, \nonly long-distance runners, because sometimes we need patience beyond \nhuman endurance to see an idea that one believes is meritorious finally \nmake it--to get passed by the Senate and maybe\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\neven the House or maybe even signed into law. Sometimes it happens \nquickly; more often it takes a long time.\n  My personal story that kind of leads when it comes to examples is the \nDREAM Act, which I introduced 11 years ago. This was legislation that \naddressed a problem I learned about from my Chicago office. We got a \nphone call. The phone call was from a mother. She was Korean American \nand she ran a drycleaners. In Chicago, 75 percent or more of the \ndrycleaning establishments are owned by Korean families. She came to \nthis country years before, brought her little girl with her, and then \nraised a family, and she became an American citizen.\n  Fast forward to her little girl who became a musical prodigy. In \nfact, she was in demand at some of the best music institutions in \nAmerica, including the Julliard School of Music and the Manhattan \nConservatory of Music, offering her admission to come and develop her \nskills as a concert pianist. As her daughter filled out the form to \napply to these schools, she turned to her mother and said: Where it \nsays ``nationality'' what should I write? Her mother said: I don't \nknow. We never filed any papers for you after you came to America. The \ndaughter said: What can we do? The mother said: We can call Durbin.\n\n  So they called my office and we checked with the Immigration Service. \nThey came back and said, the law is very clear that when a child is \nbrought to this country and through no fault of their own is \nundocumented, the law is clear they have to leave for at least 10 \nyears. They have to go back to wherever they were before or anywhere \nthey want to go, but they can't be here. I thought to myself: This girl \ndid nothing wrong. Mom and dad didn't file the papers and here she is \nin this predicament.\n  So I introduced the DREAM Act. It has five simple provisions. Here is \nwhat it says: If you came to the United States as a child, if you have \nbeen a long-term U.S. resident, if you have good moral character, if \nyou graduate from high school and you either complete 2 years of \ncollege or serve in the U.S. military, we will put you on a path to \nbecome a citizen of the United States. You have to earn it. We are not \ngoing to give it to you, but we are going to give you that chance. Just \nbecause mom and dad may have done an illegal act, we will not hold you \nas a child responsible for it.\n  The net result of this bill, when it becomes law, will strengthen our \nmilitary--and we have the support from military leaders all across the \nUnited States; they want these young men and women to enlist. They will \nbring diversity and talent to the military. It will also mean they will \nbe contributing to America with their higher education. They are going \nto be tomorrow's doctors and engineers, soldiers and teachers. We don't \nwant to lose their talents. We don't want them educated in America for \n13 years and then cast aside. We want them to stand and be part of our \nfuture and make us a stronger Nation.\n  Keep in mind that for most of these students it comes as a shock when \nthey finally ask the questions and get the answers and realize the flag \nthey have been pledging allegiance to every single day is not the flag \nof their country. They are people without a country. That is what the \nDREAM Act is about--to give them a chance.\n  We have asked the Obama administration on a bipartisan basis to not \ndeport these eligible young people, for they have done nothing wrong. \nIf they do something wrong, it is another story. But if they have done \nnothing wrong, don't focus on deporting them. What we are trying to do \nis to give them a chance--just a chance--to earn their way to the \nAmerican dream. I think the administration's new deportation policy is \nsensible and I think these young people deserve a chance.\n  I can give these speeches for a long time and they don't mean much \nuntil we meet the DREAM Act students. Let me show my colleagues two \nhandsome young men from Illinois: Carlos and Rafael Robles. I met them \nboth. Carlos and Rafael were brought to the United States by their \nparents when they were children. Today, Carlos is 22, Rafael is 21. \nThey grew up in suburban Chicago in my home State of Illinois. They \ngraduated from Palatine High School where they were both honor \nstudents. In high school, Carlos was the captain of the tennis team and \na member of the varsity swim team. He volunteered with Palatine's \nphysically challenged program where every day he helped to feed lunch \nto special needs students. Carlos graduated from Harper Community \nCollege and is now attending Loyola University in Chicago majoring in \neducation. His dream is to become a teacher. Do we need more good \nteachers in America? You bet we do.\n  Listen to what one of Carlos's high school teachers said about him:\n\n       Carlos is the kind of person we want among us because he \n     makes the community better. This is the kind of person you \n     want as a student, the kind of kid you want as a neighbor and \n     friend to your child, and most germane to his present \n     circumstance, the kind of person you want as an American.\n\n  One of Carlos's college professors wrote and said:\n\n       He is, very simply, the finest student I have ever had the \n     opportunity to mentor.\n\n  Rafael, his younger brother, has a lot in common with Carlos. In high \nschool, Rafael was captain of the tennis team and a member of the \nvarsity swim team and soccer team. He graduated again from Harper \nCommunity College--understand these young men would attend college in \nAmerica with no Federal assistance--none. They have to pay for it out \nof their pocket. So he graduated from Harper Community College. Now he \nis at the University of Illinois in Chicago where he is majoring in \narchitecture.\n  Here is what one of Rafael's teachers in high school said about him:\n\n       Rafael is the kind of person I have taught about in my \n     Social Studies classes--the American who comes to this \n     country and commits to his community and makes it better for \n     others. Raffi Robles is a young man who makes us better. \n     During my 28 year career as a high school teacher, coach, and \n     administrator, I would place Raffi in the top 5 percent of \n     all the kids with whom I have ever had contact.\n\n  Here is the unfortunate part of the story about these two amazing \nyoung men. They were both placed in deportation proceedings. I asked \nthe administration to consider their request to suspend their \ndeportations and they agreed to do it, for the time being. I think it \nwas the right thing to do. Carlos and Rafael are represented by \nvolunteer lawyers in Chicago.\n  After I met Carlos and Rafael, they sent me a letter asking Members \nof Congress to support the DREAM Act, and here is what they said:\n\n       We ask you today to see it in your heart to do the right \n     thing, to listen, and to reward the values of hard work and \n     diligence, values that made America the most beautiful and \n     prosperous country in the world and that we're sure got you, \n     as members of Congress, to where you are today in life. These \n     are values we have come to admire and respect in the American \n     people. We will continue to uphold these values until the \n     last of our days--we hope eventually as citizens of the \n     United States, a country we now see as home.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues who are critical of the administration's \ndeportation policy or have difficulties with the DREAM Act, Would \nAmerica be a better place if Carlos and Rafael are deported? Of course \nnot. These two young men grew up here, they were educated here, they \nhave done well here, they have earned their way here. They want to be \npart of our future.\n  They are not isolated examples. There are literally thousands of them \njust like Carlos and Rafael across this country.\n  When I introduced this bill 11 years ago, and I would give a speech \nlike this and leave a hall, I could count on, if it were nighttime, \nsomeone standing by my car quietly as I approached and started to \nleave. They would ask me: Senator, can I speak to you for a minute.\n  Sure.\n  Senator, I am one of those students.\n  They were afraid of being deported if they raised their hand and \nidentified themselves at the meeting. That has all changed now, and it \nhas changed for the better. These young men and women are courageously \nstepping forward to identify themselves. It is no longer a mystery of \nwho they are or what they want to be. They are real flesh and blood. \nThey are children. They are the people you sit next to in church. They \nare the folks who are working hard next to your son or daughter in the \nlibrary at school. You are cheering them on on the football field. You \nare watching them lead the USC Marching Trojan Band. You are watching \nas they are aspiring to become tomorrow's scientists, engineers,\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\ndoctors, lawyers, and teachers. They deserve a chance, and we should \ngive them that chance by passing the DREAM Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider doing that as quickly as possible. \nThey want peace of mind, they want a future, and we need them in \nAmerica's future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Tribute To Senator Barbara Mikulski\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I come here today to pay tribute to \nSenator Barbara Mikulski on becoming the longest serving woman in the \nhistory of Congress.\n  First and foremost, I feel deeply privileged to be able to serve \nalongside Senator Mikulski. She blazed a path that allowed the rest of \nus, and people like me, to be here today. Along the way, she \ndistinguished herself as not only a leader and tenacious advocate for \nthe people of Maryland but for all Americans.\n  Senator Mikulski's path to the U.S. Senate prepared her well to be an \neffective fighter for her constituents. Ever the dedicated public \nservant, Senator Mikulski worked as a Baltimore social worker, \ncommunity activist, and as a city council member. She brought an \nurgency and an unrelenting commitment to service to her work and the \npeople she represented. It can be seen in the legislation she has \nfought for and the causes she has championed during her 25 years in the \nSenate.\n  I am proud to say the first bill I cosponsored when I came to the \nSenate 3 years ago was one of Senator Mikulski's--the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act. This bill--which ensures that no matter your gender, \nrace, national origin, religion, age or disability, you will receive \nequal pay for equal work--the fight to get it signed into law is a \nperfect example of the tenacity and sense of fairness that drives \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  I am particularly grateful to her for her mentorship. On the day I \nwas sworn in to the Senate, I was standing in the back of the Chamber \nwaiting to walk down to the well. My colleague from North Carolina, \nSenator Burr, was with me. Senator Mikulski came up to me and asked who \nwas going to escort me to the well to be sworn in. I, obviously, said: \nMy colleague from North Carolina. She said: Well, you need a woman too. \nAnd with that, I was both humbled and honored to have her escort me \ndown the Chamber aisle to be sworn in as a U.S. Senator.\n  Her generosity in sharing her experience and her expertise did not \nstop on that day. She is always encouraging, supportive, and eager to \nfoster a spirit of teamwork. I especially appreciate that Senator \nMikulski embraces the need for bipartisanship, which no doubt is why \nshe is and has been so effective, accomplished, and widely respected.\n  Everyone knows well and respects Senator Mikulski for her advocacy on \nbehalf of women and families. In this regard, she is truly a role \nmodel. During the debate on health care reform, her tireless fight to \nensure that women's preventive services, including screenings for \nbreast cancer and cervical cancer, would be covered with no out-of-\npocket expenses is legendary.\n  Her ability to see and understand people's needs is clearly reflected \nin her Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act, which protects seniors across \nthe country from going bankrupt while paying for a spouse's nursing \nhome care. It is no wonder she is beloved, not only in the Third \nDistrict, which she represented for 10 years in the House, but by all \nthe people of Maryland whose interests she fights for every single day.\n  As one of the 17 women now serving in the Senate, it is hard to \nimagine what it must have been like when she arrived here 25 years ago \nas one of two women. I am grateful she and the other female Senators \nhave paved the way.\n  Barbara Mikulski is the dean of the women Senators, and her \nbipartisan women's dinners are among my favorite Senate traditions. I \nthank Senator Mikulski for her leadership and strong belief in the \nempowerment of women in our communities and in public office. For those \nof us who came to Washington to make a difference, Barbara Mikulski has \nset a very high bar.\n  I congratulate Senator Mikulski for this extraordinary and historic \naccomplishment. I look forward to many more years of serving alongside \nher.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I will speak for a couple minutes on the \nTransportation bill.\n  I have come to the floor to express my support for passing the Senate \nbill before the current Transportation authorization expires this \nSaturday. This would create and sustain nearly 41,000 jobs in North \nCarolina and across the country close to 3 million jobs.\n  Earlier today, the House passed a short-term 90-day extension. \nUnfortunately, passing another stopgap extension is not the solution \nthat businesses, States, and the entire country needs.\n  Short-term extensions create instability and uncertainty in funding, \nand without that certainty, States such as mine, North Carolina, cannot \nplan or move forward with projects, which jeopardizes tens of thousands \nof projects and millions of jobs in America. Once again, that is 41,000 \njobs in North Carolina.\n  Upgrading our infrastructure is not a Democratic or a Republican \npriority; it is truly an American priority.\n  The Senate Transportation funding bill makes critical investments in \ntransportation and infrastructure in North Carolina and across our \nNation.\n  The return on investment, when it comes to infrastructure, is high. \nMoody's estimates that for every $1 spent on infrastructure, our GDP is \nraised about $1.59.\n  Additionally, for every $1 billion spent on infrastructure, 11,000 to \n30,000 jobs are created--jobs that North Carolina desperately needs.\n  Failure to pass the Senate Transportation bill could put these \nmillions of jobs and $1.2 billion worth of North Carolina construction \nprojects in jeopardy.\n  This Transportation bill we are talking about is truly an economic \nengine. My State currently receives only about 92 cents for every $1 we \npay into the highway trust fund. This new legislation would ensure that \nat least 95 percent of North Carolina's payments to the highway trust \nfund will come back to our State--nearly 3 percent more than we \ncurrently receive.\n  Maintaining and upgrading our infrastructure is not just about \ncreating jobs in the construction sector; it is the lifeblood of our \ncommunities. We need to make sure businesses have roads to access their \nplants and factories, rail, ports, and airport runways to export goods \nacross the globe and to keep pace with the 24/7 global economy.\n  To put this in a global perspective, China currently spends four \ntimes as much on infrastructure as we do in the United States. We \ncannot allow this to continue. This is about staying competitive and \nleveraging commonsense investments that will enable our economy to \ngrow.\n  This Transportation funding bill will be used to improve our roads, \nbridges, and mass transit systems--projects that will put North \nCarolinians back to work and help American businesses compete in our \nglobal economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up and pass the Senate Transportation \nfunding bill without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven pertaining to the introduction of S. 2264 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, with that, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Justice Ginsburg on Constitutions\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg, on a recent trip to \nEgypt, made comments that garnered public notice. She said:\n\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n\n       I would not look to the U.S. Constitution if I were \n     drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the \n     constitution of South Africa.\n\n  She also spoke favorably of the Canadian Charter of Rights and \nFreedoms and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n  Although some people have criticized Justice Ginsburg for speaking \nnegatively about the U.S. Constitution while abroad, I think she has a \nright to say what legal documents countries should consider that are \nnow writing constitutions. But I do not agree with her those other \nconstitutions are better examples of constitutions today than the U.S. \nConstitution is.\n  Some people who have criticized Justice Ginsburg's preference for the \nother constitutions she named have focused on the positive rights \ncontained in those documents. Some of those constitutions, such as \nSouth Africa's, protect the right to ``make decisions concerning \nreproduction,'' to ``inherent dignity,'' and the right to have an \nenvironment protected ``through reasonable legislative and other \nmeasures that prevent pollution and environmental degradation.'' The \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights guarantees a right to education. Of \ncourse, none of these constitutions contain anything like a second \namendment right for the citizens to defend themselves.\n  Our Constitution is all about limiting the power of government. \nAmericans do not fully trust the power of government, and Americans \ninsist on rights that are protected against government action. In other \nwords, our Constitution was intended to last for centuries, with the \nsame meaning, even as those principles were applied to new situations. \nOur judges should reflect that philosophy, which is at the heart of our \nConstitution. If other countries feel differently, that is their right.\n  I think praise for those foreign constitutions rather than our own \nraises a much more serious issue--the role of the judiciary. Our \nConstitution made a judiciary that was the least dangerous branch, as \nHamilton said. Policy is to be made by elected officials who answer to \nthe voters and can be replaced; whereas, judges, under our \nConstitution, cannot be replaced. They have a lifetime position, short \nof impeachment.\n  The foreign constitutions that were named create a much different \njudiciary. The Canadian Supreme Court has stated their charter of \nrights and freedoms ``must be capable of growth and development over \ntime to meet new social, political and historical realities often \nunimagined by its framers. The judiciary is the guardian of the \nConstitution and must, in interpreting its provisions, bear these \nconsiderations in mind.''\n  The European Convention has been interpreted by the European Court of \nHuman Rights to be a ``living instrument.''\n  Madam President, these are explicit statements--that Justice \nGinsburg's preferred constitutions are ``living constitutions.'' A \nliving constitution is one in which the meaning changes over time. \nJudges decide that new circumstances require a living constitution to \nmean something it did not mean sometime before. They say the \nconstitution must keep up with the times. A living constitution can \nmean whatever judges want it to mean, completely contrary to what our \nforefathers had in mind when they wrote our Constitution.\n  Our Constitution is not a living constitution. Judges are not to make \nup its meaning as they go along over time. Even President Obama's \nSupreme Court nominees told us the role of a judge under our \nConstitution is not to interpret words however they believe new \ncircumstances might warrant. ``It's the law all the way down,'' Justice \nKagan said. We should be skeptical of a living constitution that opens \nthe door for judges to impose their values, not those of the Framers of \nthe Constitution, on the citizenry of this country.\n  The Canadian Charter says it ``guarantees the rights and freedoms set \nout in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as \ncan be demonstrably justified in a free and Democratic society.'' The \nCanadian Supreme Court interprets that provision in light of a highly \ngeneralized four-part test that invites judges to insert their own \npolicy preferences.\n  Similarly, the South African Constitution provides that its rights \ncan be limited if they ``are reasonable and justifiable in an open and \ndemocratic society based on human dignity, equality, and freedom.'' It \ntells courts explicitly to apply a six-part subjective balancing test \nthat allows judges to interpret this provision however they want.\n  How would you like to live under a constitution such as that?\n  These constitutions Justice Ginsburg endorses invite judges to rule \nhowever they want on any question of rights. That is not consistent \nwith traditional American notions of the rule of law, of a government \nof laws and not a government of people. Some judges may prefer \nconstitutions in which judges are free to displace democratic \ndecisionmaking on policy questions that are to be decided by elected \nrepresentatives of the people under our Constitution. I do not. Our \nConstitution does not. We do not live in a government of, by, and for \nthe judiciary.\n  But no one should think that the Canadian or the South African \nConstitutions fully protect rights that Americans think are precious, \nsuch as freedom of speech. Under the Canadian Charter, reasonable \nlimits on free speech include prohibiting so-called hate speech against \na group.\n  Finally, it is important to recognize why some of us on the Judiciary \nCommittee continue to press judicial nominees on their adherence to the \nConstitution without reference to foreign law. For instance, Justice \nBreyer has stated that foreign judges also interpret ``texts that more \nand more protect basic human rights.'' He has stated that he looks to \nthe decisions of the European Human Rights Court and to Canadian cases \nas well, because they are ``relevant'' even if they do not control. He \nsays, ``[W]e can learn something about our law and our documents from \nwhat happens elsewhere.''\n  What Justice Ginsburg did was to make very clear that which had only \nbeen implied in the past, making very clear that there are some in this \ncountry who feel that our venerable Constitution is outdated. If they \ntreat that document as it was written and understood by the Framers, \nthen their decisions will often lead to results they do not like as a \npolicy matter. But if they can cite decisions from foreign courts and \ninterpret constitutions that contain all kinds of different rights and \nthat give judges unbridled power to make policy decisions at the \nexpense of the elected representatives of the people, then they can \nreach decisions that our Constitution otherwise would not allow.\n  It is not simply a disinterested survey of what other courts around \nthe world are doing. It opens the door to a search for preferred \nliberal activist outcomes. These are the very high stakes at issue when \nwe discuss whether it is appropriate for judges to cite or rely on \nforeign law in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.\n  We need to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We need to preserve, protect, and defend the rights of \nAmerican citizens. Justice Ginsburg and others who have a judicial \nlonging for other constitutions that protect different rights and give \nunelected judges power that, under our Constitution, self-governing \npeople exercise themselves--I tell those judges, including Justice \nGinsburg, that is the wrong approach.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Oil Subsidies\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, just a few minutes ago, I was \npresiding over the Senate and I heard remarks from my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, who sits next to me. I \nwas intrigued by her response to the vote that had just taken place for \nmy colleagues who\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\npreach every day about deficit reduction. As Senator McCaskill said, \nthey had an opportunity to pick the lowest hanging fruit there is, take \naway the tax breaks and the tax dollar subsidies that go to the oil \ninterests in this country.\n  Think about that. We are giving incentives. Taxpayers are spending \nhard-earned dollars coming from workers in Dayton and Springfield and \nAkron and Canton that go directly to the most profitable industry in \nthe history of the world, perhaps, particularly the big five oil \ncompanies, making billions and billions of dollars. Yet we are simply \nsaying it is OK to give them those kinds of tax breaks and tax \nsubsidies.\n  That is even putting aside the fact that every time there is a \npipeline outage or every time there is a fire in a refinery or every \ntime there is turmoil in the Middle East, the oil companies and the \nspeculators use it as a chance to spike up oil prices. They do it over \nand over like clockwork. A problem in Iran? Prices go up. A fire in a \nrefinery? Prices go up. An outage in a pipeline? Prices go up.\n  The Presiding Officer from Vermont, with his bill, has led this \neffort to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice to put the government on the side of the \nmotorist, of small businesses, of the consumer. Just as Senator \nMcCaskill said earlier, to save tax dollars is really obvious and, on \nthe other side, to make sure we go after the speculators when they rip \nus off.\n  According to a recent study, 56 cents of the price of every gallon of \ngas you buy when you go to the pump in gas stations all over America \ngoes to the hedge fund operators and speculators. That is about $10 to \n$12 to $15 a tank depending on how big a car you drive.\n  On the one hand, we are not saying no more tax breaks. On the other \nhand, we are not saying to the speculators: Stop this. You are not \ngoing to get away with this anymore. The government has to be on the \nside of the middle class here and fight back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am going to speak for about 10 \nminutes. If someone else comes to the floor, I will be happy to shorten \nthat, but I had to come to the floor to support the leadership of \nSenator Barbara Boxer and Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who have worked \nfor over a year to bring a very balanced and fundamentally important \nand essential infrastructure bill to the floor of the House.\n  We have many arguments on this floor. We have been arguing about \njudges. I heard Senator Grassley give a pretty tough speech voicing his \nopinion of some of our Supreme Court Justices. I do not agree with much \nof what he said, but he is entitled to his opinion. We have those \ndebates. There are good people on both sides. We are debating oil taxes \nand whether the oil industry is paying too much or too little. You \ncould have arguments about that.\n  But even our children in kindergarten and even our citizens who do \nnot pay attention to some more difficult arguments understand roads, \nbridges, and mass transit. They understand hardhat jobs. They see \npeople every day laying bricks, pouring concrete, going to work at \nsteel mills and factories that produce the materials that build our \ninfrastructure. They drive over potholes all day long. They ride down \nthe interstates with 18-wheelers whizzing by them in smaller cars \nbecause they are trying to be more fuel efficient, with their heart in \ntheir chest, with their children in the backseat, and they look up to \nCongress, to the House of Representatives, and say: Where is our \nTransportation bill?\n  This Transportation bill was not written by one Senator and voted on \nby a slim majority. This Transportation bill that the House refuses to \neven consider was built by one of the more progressive and one of the \nmost conservative Members of this body. It was voted on almost \nunanimously out of committee, brought to the floor of the Senate just a \ncouple of weeks ago, and received over 75 votes in a body that cannot \ndecide about our judges, really, we can't decide about the post office, \nwe can't decide about oil and gas taxes. But 75 of us said that we are \ntired of running our highways and our transit on 90-day, 30-day, 60-day \nextensions. I think this is the 26th short-term extension since 2009. \nWhat way is this to run a government?\n  For the other side of this building that talks about putting business \npractices to work, let's be more efficient in the way we operate, and \nlet's operate more like a business, do you know, Mr. President, any \nbusiness in America, large or small, that operates with a 30-day \nvision? Do you know one? I don't know one. I understand businesses have \n6-month plans, a year, but they always have that 5-year long range. \nThey might have 6-month goals. I don't know one business in America \nthat operates on a 30-day plan.\n\n  Here we are at the ninth hour again. We have a bill. We produced a \nbill. If the House had a bill--I am a centrist--if the House had a \nbill, I would be working with the middle of the road over there, trying \nto say: This is what your bill does. This is what our bill does. We \ncan't have our way completely here in the Senate, although I would like \nto have our way more of the time, but I understand.\n  They do not have a bill. They do not have a bill to negotiate because \nthey cannot even get a bill together among the three committees of \njurisdiction over there.\n  Again, if they had a bill, I know Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe \nwould be happy to negotiate. Maybe they want a 4-year bill, we want a \n2, maybe we negotiate a 3. They don't like the mass-transit portion; we \nlike the mass-transit portion; we could come to some terms. They don't \nlike the way the formula works; we like the general way the formula \nworks; we could come to terms. I understand that.\n  But what I do not understand, what no one in the country \nunderstands--what the mayors are having a hard time understanding, what \nthe Governors are having a hard time understanding and the businesses \nthat operate in my State, represented by the chamber of commerce, the \nNFIB, and the Main Street Alliance of small businesses from the left to \nthe center to the right--what they do not understand is how you do not \nhave a bill at all and you have not been able to put one together. We \nhave now been in this Congress for a year and a half. You have had 1\\1/\n2\\ years to put a bill together, and you have not come up with one.\n  We put one together that looks pretty good. No one that I know of \nfrom any group has said anything really bad about our bill. It is \npretty plain in one sense. It is not changing the course of Western \ncivilization; it is just trying to fund roads, bridges, and transit, \nwhich is fundamental to the operations not only of our government but \nour economy and, frankly, the economy of the world because without \nhighways it is hard to import or export products. This bill has impacts \nway beyond America.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how the House of \nRepresentatives is going to leave and go on vacation and think they \nhave done their job by giving us another 90-day extension.\n  I do not know what the leadership is going to do, but I want my vote \nrecorded as no. I am not going to hold up everybody here over the \nholidays, but I want to say that I want my vote recorded as no. I am \nnot going to continue to support 30-day, 60-day, 90-day extensions to a \ntransportation bill that really, in the scheme of things, should not be \nthat complicated to pass. There are other much more controversial \nthings about which we could be having very serious debates. Building \nhighways and roads and transit should not be one of them.\n  We are hurting jobs. We heard the Republicans--I cannot blame the \nRepublicans in the Senate. I think they have been for the most part \nreally terrific, actually, working with Senator Boxer. They have even \ngiven a majority of the votes. So I guess my focus is really on the \nRepublicans in the House. I don't think they have taken the time to \nreally look at the Senate bill to see how balanced it is, and one part \nI wish they would read, which is the part I want to talk about for the \nnext 5 minutes--and I know other Senators are here to speak--I hope the \ngulf coast Members from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and \nFlorida--and together that is a pretty big coalition; I don't know the \ntotal number, but I think there have to be over 75 Members from Texas, \nLouisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida--I hope they read the \nsection of the Transportation bill that talks about the RESTORE Act.\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\n  I have spent a great deal of time over here with my good friend and \nwonderful leader, Senator Shelby, with Senator Boxer, with over 300 \norganizations, for over a year, to build a bill that is now part of the \nTransportation bill that, in addition to building highways in Florida \nand transit and roads in Alabama and Mississippi, will also for the \nfirst time in the history of our country--the first time--direct a \nsignificant portion of penalty money paid by a polluter, BP, that \npolluted the gulf coast--a good company in some ways but really messed \nup that well, though, and they just spilled gallons and gallons and \nmillions of barrels of oil. We have shrimp that are coming in our nets \nwith no eyes. We have turtles that are washing up on our shores dead. \nWe have research needs in the gulf coast that--there has been no time \nin our history where we have needed that money more.\n  My question is to the gulf coast Republican Members and Democratic \nMembers. What is it about this bill that is driving you so crazy that \nyou can't accept $10 billion that the Federal Government is trying to \ngive you? Because that is what the RESTORE Act could potentially send \nto the gulf coast, a portion of the fine. We don't know whether that \nfine is going to be $5 billion or $10 billion or $20 billion, but we do \nknow it is going to be substantial because under current law they have \nto pay $1,000 for every barrel spilled or $4,200 if it was gross \nnegligence.\n\n  In the Senate Transportation bill, this body showed rare bipartisan \nsupport and concern for the gulf coast, America's energy coast. We \nshowed an understanding of the great erosion that is taking place in \nthe delta of Louisiana, which drains 40 percent of the continent. We \nshowed understanding that so much of our shipping and seafood industry \nrelies on this coast--not that the other coasts are not vitally \nimportant--and we showed we understand the underinvestment that has \nbeen made. So 75 percent of the Senate basically stood and said: OK. \nLet's redirect this penalty money to where the injury is. That is the \nRESTORE Act, and that is in the Senate bill we sent over to the House, \nwhich they have absolutely just rejected.\n  I don't know what magic there is about the next 90 days, but I know \nwhat I am going to do. I am going to register my vote as no, and I am \ngoing to go home and work harder in Louisiana and along the gulf coast \nto explain to the people of our region how much is at stake by getting \na longer term Transportation bill. Maybe 2 years is not as long as we \nwould like to have, but it is better than 30 days, it is better than 60 \ndays, and it is better than 90 days.\n  I will ask and explain that not only is the Transportation bill vital \nfor Louisiana's projects but for approving the RESTORE Act, which I \nknow the House has indicated their support for. They have indicated a \nsupport for the concept of the RESTORE Act, but the act itself is in \nthe Transportation bill.\n  So I am going to wrap-up. There are other Members on the floor who \nwill speak. I thank the leader, Barbara Boxer, who is here.\n  But for 90 days let's get back to work and go for a long-term \nTransportation bill that is a real jobs bill that will help the whole \ncountry but particularly the gulf coast with the RESTORE Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I see the Republican leader is on the \nfloor, and I understand there may be a unanimous consent that is \npropounded, and I can offer some remarks in the context of an objection \nand a counterproposal, if the minority leader would like to proceed \nnow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Rhode Island, I am not \nthe one who will be asking consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nI get a signal from the majority leader that he will seek recognition, \nat which point I will yield the floor.\n  I wished to follow in the footsteps of Senator Landrieu of Louisiana \nand reflect my own dismay and dissatisfaction with the situation we are \nin right now. The House extension on the highway bill, which we are \ngoing to be asked to proceed with, is going to cost--as far as the \nestimates I can see so far--around 100,000 jobs, and that is damage to \nour economy. That is a self-inflicted wound. More specifically, it is a \nHouse-inflicted wound, and I would very much like to see the Senate \nfight to force action on the Senate highway bill. It is a bipartisan \nbill with amendments and is fully paid for. This is a serious bill, as \nopposed to inflicting this kind of damage on our economy with a short-\nterm extension.\n  Does the majority leader seek recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2209-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2209-S2212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto H.R. 4281, the Surface Transportation Extension Act, which was \nreceived from the House and is now at the desk; that the bill be read \nthree times and the Senate proceed to vote on that matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There are several of us who reserve our right to object. \nWhat the House has done is guaranteed job losses for this country. They \nare already dithering on the Senate bill. Their not taking it up for a \nvote has cost us about 100,000 jobs. Thousands of businesses are at \nstake, and eventually we are talking about 3 million jobs at stake. The \nfact that they would do this without any commitment to get to \nconference, without any commitment to finish their job and run off on \nvacation is the reason I am reserving the right to object.\n  I ask that the unanimous consent request be modified so an amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, the text of S. 1813, the surface transportation \nbill, passed by the Senate on March 14, 2012, by a large bipartisan \nmajority vote of 74 to 22, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read \na third time and passed; and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for \nmodification?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The problem with accepting the Boxer amendment is that \nit would shut down the Federal-Aid Highway Program, which means States \nwanting reimbursement for projects will not get paid. It will cause \nalready nervous State Department of Transportation directors to cut \nback further on the work because there will be no reimbursements on \nFederal projects, and it would cost the highway trust fund $100 million \nper day for any day the gas tax is not collected, thereby adding to the \ndeficit.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to object, and I was listening to the \ndistinguished Republican leader, let me challenge some of the \nassumptions so maybe we can get to a consent. In talking to Members of \nthe House of Representatives, I am very confident there is ample \nsupport to pass not only the bipartisan surface transportation bill \nthat passed this body by an overwhelming vote but a consensus bill that \ncame out of our committees by unanimous vote in both the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and the Banking Committee. There is general \nagreement that this bill should be enacted into law.\n\n  I am confident that if the Speaker of the House brings this bill to \nthe floor of the House of Representatives, it will be passed. There are \nadequate votes for it.\n  To my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, here is the \nproblem: If we pass another short-term extension, we are going to lose \njobs. In my own\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nState of Maryland, we cannot let the contracts on major maintenance \nprojects with a 90-day extension. We cannot move forward with the \nplanning of our highways, our bridges, our transit systems with another \nshort-term extension. This takes us to the middle of the summer. We \nlose the construction season on getting transportation work done.\n  I urge the distinguished leader that we do have the opportunity to \npass the bill right now, and if we stand firm and tell the House of \nRepresentatives we want to do what is right for the American people, \nthat in the Senate we had a bipartisan bill, a consensus bill--what's \nhappening in the House is extremely partisan. Let's get together on the \nmost important jobs bill we can pass. It is thousands of jobs in \nMaryland, and it is millions of jobs in this Nation that are affected \nby passing a surface transportation bill.\n  With that, I am hoping I convinced the distinguished Republican \nleader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified so that an \namendment, which is at the desk, the text of S. 1813, the surface \ntransportation bill, passed by the Senate on March 14, 2012, by a large \nbipartisan majority vote of 74 to 22, be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will spare the Senate the repetitious repeating of \nmy remarks with regard to the initial Boxer modification, but the \nprinciples remain the same.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \ntrying to find a way to attach the Senate bill which passed this body \nbetter than 3 to 1, with a huge bipartisan majority, which is a good \nbill. It was paid for and had weeks of collegial work, back and forth, \nwith bipartisan amendments, which is a serious bill that every major \nbusiness group in the country, every major labor group in the country, \nand even environmental groups are supporting.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has said, it would certainly virtually \nbe passed by the House if the Speaker would only bring it up, but for \npartisan reasons the House has refused to even bring it up for a vote. \nInstead, they sent us this extension which will cost 100,000 jobs.\n  It is my view that if we can send it back in this form, we will not \nexperience the parade of horribles that the distinguished Republican \nleader has suggested because it will not come to that point. They will, \nin fact, pass the Senate bill and we will have a real highway bill and \nnot a partisan extension that kills 100,000 jobs.\n  It is 1,000 jobs in my home State of Rhode Island. We have over 10 \npercent unemployment. This is a self-inflicted wound that hits Rhode \nIsland, that hurts my home State. It makes no sense. Therefore, I ask, \nagain--and I apologize for coming back to this, but I think it is \nimportant that we try to defend this body, which has worked well \ntogether, which has made a sensible, serious bill and is being infected \nby the dysfunction that is presently taking place in the House. This \nextension is a representation of that dysfunction.\n  So I again ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's request \nbe modified so the amendment at the desk, the text of our highway bill, \nS. 1813, be added to the bill, that the text be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  I thank both the majority leader and minority leader for their \npatience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am not going to object, but I wish to \nreiterate the comments of my colleagues from California, Maryland, and \nRhode Island. I know my colleague from Louisiana will do the same. We \nhave a broad bipartisan bill. Transportation and highways are a \nlinchpin of our economic recovery, not only in the jobs they create \nnow, rebuilding and building highways, but in making our economy more \nefficient.\n  China is building four times the infrastructure we are. India is \nbuilding more infrastructure than we are, and in the Senate--to the \ncredit of both sides--we have a broad bipartisan bill that moves us \nforward. It is not everything I would want or any of us would want. It \nwas put together masterfully by Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, who \nare political opposites.\n  The House, in its paralysis--because there is a small group who, \nfrankly, don't believe the government should be an infrastructure at \nall--ties it in a knot and forces us with the awful choice of either \nshutting things down because they are not going to budge or just \nrenewing an old bill which needs updating, which throws people out of \nwork. They are creating paralysis in this country in the case of \ninfrastructure and in many other cases.\n  If the public wants to know why the country is not growing at a \ngreater rate, wants to know why there is such high unemployment in the \nconstruction industries, look at the ideologues over there and their \nrefusal to face reality, to deal with their colleagues, and to put this \ncountry--not us--in a take-it-or-leave-it position. This 90-day \nextension is not the way to go. The way to go is to pass the Senate \nbill, and I hope those on the other side of the aisle, pushed by \noutside folks from business management and others all across the \ncountry, will see the error of their ways and change their ways over \nthe next few months.\n\n  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And I might object, because I think this is a very \nserious matter. I am reserving the right to object because, as the \nmajority leader well knows, if we would follow Senator Boxer's \nleadership, sending the Senate bill back to the House, we would not \nonly not lose any jobs, we would create 1.9 million jobs, and for the \nRestore Act, which is very important to the gulf coast, it would create \nanother 300,000 jobs.\n  The only action that is going to cause job loss is the action we are \nbasically being forced to accept right now, sent over by a partisan \nHouse of Representatives, to go to another short-term extension. This \ncountry doesn't need short-term extensions, it needs long-term answers, \nand it needs jobs they can count on.\n  Every business in America relies on this Transportation bill. We have \nnow been going to short-term extensions for 3 years. It is time to \nstop.\n  I want my leader, who is on the Senate floor, to know I may object in \nthe next few minutes, but I absolutely will object to any other short-\nterm resolution on this bill for as long as this Congress is in \nsession. This is enough.\n  Now, had this bill gotten out of here with just Democrats on it, I \nwould say we don't have a leg to stand on because we don't have a \nbalanced bill, and we can't jam this through on the other side. But \nthis bill got out of here with 75 or 76 votes. Now, 2 years is not 5 \nyears, but it is better than 3 months. It is a bill we could pass and \nbuild on. It is a bill that assures people can go to sleep tonight \nknowing they have a job tomorrow.\n  So I object to the minority leader's comments about this bill, that \nour action is going to lose jobs. No, we have been here working hard to \nsave jobs. I hope when the Republicans go home they will hear from the \nbusiness community, from the right, the middle, and the left; I hope \nthey will hear from environmental groups: What are you guys doing?\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\n  The final comment I want to make as I am objecting is, if the House \nhad a bill, then this would be a negotiation between two bills. The \nproblem is they don't even have a bill. How do we negotiate with a \ngroup that doesn't have a bill? They have ideas, they have \nphilosophies, they have platforms, and they have speeches, but they \ndon't have a bill. We couldn't negotiate with them if we wanted to. \nThere is no bill.\n  This is why we are telling the country: Look, we don't know what \ntheir problem is--they have many--but we have a bill. So if they can't \nget their bill together, take the one we put together. But, no, that is \ntoo simple for them.\n  So I am reserving the right to object. I am going to listen to what \nmy leader has to say, and I might object. I know everybody wants to go \nhome. I know we want to have this unanimous consent agreement. But my \nState not only has its transportation money wrapped up in this, it has \nits hope for the future wrapped up because the Restore Act is in that \nbill.\n  For the first time, this Senate stood up since I have been here and \nsaid: You are right, gulf coast. You do a lot. You have been injured a \nlot, and we are going to help you. So that bill is in there too, which \nis why I am hard-pressed to say I will vote for a 90-day extension.\n  So reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent the request \nbe modified so an amendment, which is at the desk, the text of S. 1813, \nthe surface transportation bill, passed by the Senate on March 14, \n2012, by a large bipartisan majority of 74 to 22 be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request of the majority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4281) to provide an extension of Federal aid \n     highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and \n     other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending \n     enactment of a multiyear law reauthorizing such programs.\n\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill, having been read the third time, the \nquestion is on the passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 4281) was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been a difficult time for everyone, \nand we have what none of us wanted. Our bill was passed in the Senate \nby a very nice bipartisan margin. I hope during the Easter recess, the \nHouse will be able to come back with something they can--as Senator \nLandrieu mentioned, at least have some piece of legislation they can \ngive to us and try to work toward a conclusion or accept our bill, \nwhich is our preference.\n  So I appreciate very much the comments of my colleagues, and I \nappreciate their patience and understanding of the situation we find \nourselves in, which is not a good one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know my colleague Senator Collins is \nwaiting to speak. I will be very brief.\n  Let's be clear what just happened. What just happened is the House \nsent us a 90-day extension of our transportation programs with not one \ndime of revenue in there to fund those, and the highway trust fund is \non the road to bankruptcy. So they are the first in my memory--the \nfirst legislative body in the Capitol--to ever extend for this period \nof time without a dollar, which means an acceleration of bankruptcy of \nthe trust fund.\n  What else did they do? They just guaranteed 100,000 people are not \ngoing to get their jobs, and they guaranteed hundreds of businesses are \nnot going to get jobs. They sent out a signal that America should be \nready for hardship because they didn't even have the decency to put in \nthat extension a written commitment to produce a bill, to get to \nconference with us, and to get a bill to the President. No, they run \noff on their vacation and leave people twisting in the wind.\n  Well, I want it to be known I am one of the chairs who worked on the \nbill. There are many other people who were fantastic on this bill from \nboth sides of the aisle. I know--I spoke to Senator Inhofe today about \nthis--we want this bill done. I am going to use every tool at my \ndisposal as one Senator to keep the pressure on the Republican House.\n  Speaker Boehner: You are not Speaker of the Republicans, you are \nSpeaker of the House. Reach your hand across the aisle, as Senator \nInhofe reached across the aisle to me and I reached across to him; and \nJay Rockefeller reached across to Senator Hutchison and she reached \nacross; and Tim Johnson reached across to Shelby and he reached across; \nand Max Baucus had an array of Republicans work with him in the Finance \nCommittee. We know we can do this.\n  But what the House has done is send a very clear message of job loss \nand hardship. It is unacceptable. I look forward to working on this \nevery single day. Now we have 90 days. Tomorrow it will be 89, and then \n88. We are going to count down, and we are going to keep the pressure \non, and we are not going to let this transportation program go up in \nsmoke because it has been in place since Dwight Eisenhower was \nPresident.\n  It is a sad day for America today, a very sad day. But we will never \ngive up over here, and James Inhofe isn't going to give up, and we are \ngoing to fight hard to get a bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the revenue title to the \nhighway bill that the Senate passed earlier this month.\n  Gandhi said: ``Truth quenches untruth.''\n  I rise to quench untruth. I understand some of our colleagues in the \nHouse have mischaracterized the Senate's highway bill by saying that it \nwasn't paid for.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Senate highway bill is fully paid for and supports more than 1.6 \nmillion jobs across the country. It will also ensure there is still \nmoney in the Highway Trust Fund at the end of the bill's 2-year \nauthorization.\n  I want to explain exactly how we fund this bill so everyone is clear.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Finance, I worked very hard with \nmembers of both parties to put together a funding package that would:\n  First, pay for a reauthorization bill through September of 2013;\n  Second, not add a single dime to the deficit or the debt; and,\n  Third, not leave the Highway Trust Fund bankrupt at the end of the \nproposed reauthorization.\n  According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and the \nU.S. Department of Transportation, the Highway Trust Fund needs $5.6 \nbillion to pay for the Senate's proposed reauthorization.\n  In addition, the U.S. Department of Transportation said we need a so-\ncalled ``cushion'' of extra money in the Highway Trust Fund at the time \nof the bill's proposed September 30, 2013 expiration.\n  I am pleased to report that Senate Republicans and Democrats \nultimately came together to put $9.2 billion into the Highway Trust \nFund within the next two years, paying for the bill and leaving a \nsizable $3.6 billion cushion at the end of the authorization period.\n  Actually, in total, we put $14 billion into the Highway Trust Fund \nwithin the budget window of the next 10 years.\n  Focusing on the nexus to transportation and energy, we were able to \ntransfer an immediate $3 billion surplus in the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank trust fund--the so-called ``LUST Fund''--into the Highway \nTrust Fund. This was an idea offered by a number of Finance Committee \nRepublicans. Like the Highway Trust Fund, the LUST Fund relies on the \nfuel tax for funding.\n  In addition, Finance Committee Republicans also proposed routing a \nthird of the future fuel tax revenues intended for this storage tank \nfund into the Highway Trust Fund. This raises nearly another $700 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  Next, we transferred into the Highway Trust Fund revenues that the \ngeneral fund would receive from fees on cars that don't comply with \nfuel efficiency standards and the tariff on foreign automobile imports.\n  Together, these provisions provide nearly $5 billion for the Highway \nTrust\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nFund, with about $1.6 billion coming in the first 2 years.\n  Then, we replenished the general fund for the amounts we moved into \nthe Highway Trust Fund. We did this by clamping down on tax cheats and \nunscrupulous Medicare providers, as examples.\n  Finally, after accommodating Republican Senators' concerns at markup \nto rework some elements of our proposal, we accepted a widely supported \nidea to stabilize required contributions into pension plans.\n  The pension plan beneficiaries will still be able to rely on the \nplans getting funded, but employers will have a more predictable and \nrealistic schedule for how much to contribute.\n  This provision raised sufficient revenue to enable us to then \ntransfer another $4.5 billion into the Highway Trust Fund in the first \n2 years, bringing the 2-year total to about $9.2 billion, well more \nthan the $5.6 billion needed to just pay for the bill.\n  This pension stabilization provision raised more than $9 billion in \ntotal, which also enabled us to accept a Republican amendment to put \nadditional money into the Highway Trust Fund in future years. This \nbrought the 10-year total to approximately $14 billion, as I stated \nearlier.\n  My understanding is that this increase in general fund revenue to \nplus up the Highway Trust Fund would be considered acceptable under the \nHouse Republicans' proposed budget with its ``Reserve Fund.''\n  It is also my understanding that the House's proposed 5-year bill \nwill leave the Highway Trust Fund at the brink of insolvency by the \nbill's proposed conclusion, unlike the Senate's carefully crafted \ncompromise that I have just described.\n  The House leadership should not make inaccurate claims about the \nSenate's bill to camouflage their own inability to pass a long-term \nbill and unwillingness to work out compromises.\n  We just passed yet another short-term extension to provide funding \nfor only 90 days. We can't keep kicking the can down the road. Pretty \nsoon there will be no road left to kick the can down.\n  The easiest way to work together and forge a solution to create jobs \nand fund our Nation's highway system is for the House to take up the \nSenate's bill. It's a good bill. It provides certainty so businesses \nand communities can plan construction projects and create jobs.\n  It is fully paid for. In fact, it ensures the Highway Trust Fund will \nremain solvent even after the end of the bill. It gives us time to \naddress the longer-term needs of our national program, and how we are \ngoing to pay for it.\n  The House Republican leadership should set partisanship aside. They \nshould realize there are no Republican or Democratic roads or bridges. \nThere are only American ones. It is time to work together and not leave \nthe Highway Trust Fund insolvent.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2212-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2212-S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, during the past week, the Supreme Court \nheard arguments on the constitutionality of President Obama's health \ncare law. This week also marks the 2-year anniversary of the \nPresident's signing that law.\n  There is no question that our health care system required and still \nrequires significant reform. In passing this law, however, Congress \nfailed to follow the Hippocratic oath of ``first, do no harm.'' The new \nlaw increases health care costs, hurts our seniors and health care \nproviders, and imposes billions of dollars in new taxes, fees, and \npenalties. This, in turn, will lead to fewer choices and higher \ninsurance costs for many middle-income American families and most small \nbusinesses--the opposite of what real health care reform should do.\n  I find it particularly disturbing that President Obama's health care \nlaw does not do enough to rein in the cost of health care and to \nprovide consumers with more affordable choices. In fact, Medicare's \nChief Actuary estimates the law will increase health care spending \nacross the economy by more than $300 billion. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says the law will actually increase \npremiums for the average family plan by $2,100. Moreover, a recent \nreport issued by the CBO found that the new law will cost $1.76 \ntrillion between now and the year 2022. That is twice as much as the \nbill's original 10-year pricetag of $940 million.\n  The new law will also mean fewer choices for many middle-income \nAmericans and small businesses. All individual and small group policies \nsold in our country will soon have to fit into one of four categories. \nOne size does not fit all.\n  In Maine, almost 90 percent of those purchasing coverage in the \nindividual market have a policy that is different from the standards in \nthe new law.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact of the law on Maine's small \nbusinesses, which are our State's job creation engine. The new law \ndiscourages small companies from hiring new employees and from paying \nthem more. It could also lead to onerous financial penalties even for \nthose small businesses that are struggling to provide health insurance \nfor their employees.\n  According to a Gallup survey taken earlier this year, 48 percent of \nsmall businesses are not hiring because of the potential cost of health \ninsurance under the new law. The Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice has testified that the new health care law will mean 800,000 \nfewer American jobs over the next decade.\n  Even when the law tries to help small businesses, it misses the mark. \nFor example, I have long been a proponent of tax credits to help small \nbusinesses afford health insurance for their employees. The new credits \nfor small businesses in the health care law, however, are so poorly \nstructured and phased out in such a way that businesses will actually \nbe penalized when they hire new workers or pay their employees \nmore. Moreover, they are temporary. The tax credits are temporary and \ncan only be claimed for 2 years in an insurance exchange.\n\n  I am also very concerned that the new law is paid for, in part, \nthrough more than a $500 billion cut in Medicare--a program which is \nalready facing serious long-term financing problems. It simply does not \nmake sense to rely on deep cuts in Medicare to finance a new \nentitlement program at a time when the number of seniors in this \ncountry is on the rise. We need to fix and save Medicare, not add to \nits financial strains.\n  Moreover, according to the administration's own Chief Actuary, those \ndeep Medicare cuts could push one in five hospitals, nursing homes, and \nhome health providers into the red. I am particularly concerned about \nthe impact on rural States like Maine. Many of those providers could \nsimply stop taking Medicare patients. That would jeopardize access to \ncare for millions of our seniors.\n  It did not have to be that way. The bitter rhetoric and the partisan \ngridlock over the past few years have obscured the very important fact \nthat there are many health care reforms that have overwhelming support \nin both parties.\n  For example, we should have been able to agree on generous tax \ncredits for self-employed individuals and small businesses to help them \nafford health insurance. That would have reduced the number of \nuninsured Americans. We should have been able to agree on insurance \nmarket reforms that would prevent insurance companies from denying \ncoverage to children who have preexisting conditions, that would permit \nchildren to remain on their parents' insurance policies until age 26, \nthat would require standardized claim forms to reduce administrative \ncosts, and that would allow consumers to purchase insurance across \nState lines. Those are just some examples of health care reforms that \nwould enjoy and do enjoy widespread bipartisan support.\n  We also should be able to agree on delivery system reforms that \nreward value over volume and quality instead of quantity. We should be \nable to agree on reforms that increase transparency throughout the \nhealth care system so consumers can compare prices and quality more \neasily.\n  I know the Presiding Officer's State, and Dartmouth College in \nparticular, has done a great deal of work in this\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\narea, as have many health care providers and many hospitals in the \nState of Maine. They are experimenting with new delivery models that \nwill help them better control chronic disease treatments, which, in \nturn, will not only improve the quality of health care but also help to \nlower costs.\n  We should be able to agree on ways to address the serious health care \nworkforce shortages that plague rural and small-town America. Simply \nhaving an insurance card will do you little or no good if there is no \none available to provide the health care.\n  In short, I believe we made--Congress made--a real error in passing \nObamaCare. We should repeal the law so we can start over, to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to draft a health care bill that achieves \nthe consensus goals of providing more choice, containing health care \ncosts, improving quality and access, and making health care coverage \nmore affordable for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am here today to share a new and \nstunning revelation unearthed by my staff on the Senate Budget \nCommittee. One of my responsibilities as the ranking member is to look \nat the long-term cost of legislation, so we wanted to ascertain the \nlong-term cost of the President's health care bill--I mean the kind of \nlong-term cost analysis that has been going on for a number of years \nwith regard to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, over a 75-year \nperiod. I was floored by what we discovered.\n  First, let's put in a little context. President Obama told the \nAmerican people repeatedly that his health care bill would cost $900 \nbillion over 10 years and that it would not add one dime to the public \ndebt. But we have shown that the cost score for the first 10 years of \nimplementation, when the bill is fully implemented, is actually $2.6 \ntrillion--almost three times as much.\n  In addition, the offsets used to reduce the law's official cost were \nenormous and phony, as I have discussed before and will detail at \nanother time. These are unacceptable offsets. You have heard the story \nof Mr. Mistoffelees, the Napoleon of Crime. I say that this bill is the \nNapoleon of criminal offsets. The more we learn about the bill, the \nmore we discover it is even more unaffordable than was suspected.\n  Over a period of about 3 months, our staff worked diligently to \nestimate the new unfunded liability that would be imposed by the \npassage of this legislation. This is not the total cost of the bill but \nthe unfunded mandatory coverage obligations incurred by the U.S. \nGovernment on behalf of the people of the United States over a period \nof time.\n  An unfunded obligation is basically the amount of money we will have \nto spend on a mandatory expense that the bill does not have a funding \nsource to meet--money we don't have but money we are committed to \nspend. It is this kind of long-term unfunded obligation that will place \nthis Nation's financial situation at such great risk. It is the thing \nthat has called witness after witness before the Budget Committee, on \nwhich I am ranking member, who tell us we are on an unsustainable path. \nThat means money we will either have to print, borrow, or tax to meet \nthe obligations we would incur as a people as a result of the passage \nof this bill.\n  For instance, it is widely agreed that Social Security has an \nunfunded liability of $7 trillion over 75 years. That is an enormous \nsum. It is double the entire amount of the U.S. budget today. My staff \nused the models that are used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices. They talked with the individual experts about these numbers \nand worked diligently to come up with a figure using appropriate \nmethods. That figure, using the administration's own optimistic \nassumptions and claims about the cost of the law, is an incredible $17 \ntrillion that would be added to the unfunded liabilities of the United \nStates over the next 75 years. That is more than twice the unfunded \nliability of Social Security.\n  I wish to emphasize that this $17 trillion figure is not an estimate \nbased on what we think the bill will really cost if all the \nadministration's claims and promises were to be proven false--and \ncertainly there have been matters proven false already. We used the \nadministration's own figures. So the unfunded liability is almost \ncertainly not going to be less than $17 trillion, but if any more of \nthe administration's claims unravel--as so many already have--the cost \nof the program's unpaid-for obligation will rise radically higher than \n$17 trillion. For instance, former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an \nexpert in these matters, says that millions more individuals may lose \ntheir current employer coverage and be placed into the government-\nsupported exchanges than currently projected--than what the \nadministration has projected. But we didn't follow Mr. Holtz-Eakin's \narguments or concerns; we took the administration's assumptions.\n  Let me briefly explain some of what now comprises this additional $17 \ntrillion in unfunded obligations.\n  Madam President, $12 trillion is for the health care law's premium \nsubsidy program. You see, the law created new regulations that drive up \nthe price of insurance for millions of Americans. The writers of the \nlaw knew it would inflate the cost of insurance premiums, so to cover \nthat cost, they had to include new government subsidies so people could \npay for their more expensive insurance.\n  On Medicaid, this new health care law has added another $5 trillion \nto its unfunded liabilities. This is on top of the substantial unfunded \nobligations the Federal and State governments have already had to take \non in order to support Medicaid. They have protested vigorously to us, \nwarning of these additional deep expenditure requirements that are \nfalling on the States.\n  These figures don't even account for the dozens of new bureaucracies \nthat will be created to implement the President's health care law or \nthe expansion of the bureaucracies. Those costs are not included in the \n$17 trillion or the cost estimates the administration used for the \nbill. For instance, the IRS has requested 4,000 new IRS agents and $300 \nmillion in additional funds for their part in implementing the new law.\n  At a time when we should be trying--we have to--to shore up programs \nthat are threatened by default--Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid--\nthis health care law adds an entirely new obligation--one we cannot pay \nfor--and puts the entire financing of the U.S. Government in jeopardy. \nWe don't have the money. We don't have another $17 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities that we can add to our account. We have to reduce the ones \nwe have. This has been obvious for several decades. People have talked \nabout it repeatedly.\n  Instead of doing something about those programs that are headed to \nbankruptcy, we add--under this President's determined insistence and a \nstraight party-line vote--one of the largest unfunded mandates in \nhistory on top of what we already have. How can we possibly justify \nthis? It cannot be justified.\n  This bill has to be removed from the books because we don't have the \nmoney. There are a lot of other reasons, but that is one of them. It is \ninescapable. It would be absolutely irresponsible for this Congress to \nmaintain a law that would run up this kind of debt--2\\1/2\\ times the \nunfunded obligations of Social Security--and we are worried about our \nchildren being able to have their Social Security checks on time.\n\n  This is not a little bitty matter, it is important. So I will be \nsending a letter to the GAO, the Government Accountability Office. They \ndo these kinds of scorings over 75 years. We will ask them to construct \ntheir independent estimate of the unfunded health care law obligations. \nI believe they will be similar to the ones my staff has produced. I \nhope they are better, but I am afraid they are not. And even if they \ncome close to what we have calculated, it is pretty clear that the \nmoney that\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nwill be coming in could be far less and the obligations could be far \nmore than what are being projected, as Mr. Holtz-Eakin and others have \nsaid. It is an urgent matter.\n  I plan to come to the floor in the coming days to continue to explain \nthe true fiscal cost facts about this legislation. There are many other \nserious problems with it. It is unpopular, unaffordable, \nunconstitutional, and it has to be repealed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I \nask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I feel compelled to say a word on the \nheels of our colleague from Alabama, whom I salute as he heads off into \nthe setting Sun. I wish him well and to have a good break.\n  When I was in the Navy during the Vietnam war, when we weren't flying \na lot of missions off the coast of Cambodia and Vietnam, we flew into a \nlot of other countries, including Japan. I have always had an interest \nin Japan in terms of the way they provide health care. One thing that \nintrigues me about that is that they spend half as much money for \nhealth care as we do. They spend 8 percent of gross domestic product. \nWe spend 16 percent of gross domestic product. They get better \noutcomes--everything from longer life expectancy to lower rates of \ninfant mortality--and they cover everybody. They cover everybody. It is \nnot socialized medicine. They have a private health care delivery \nsystem and private health insurance companies as well as we do, but \nthey get a better result for about half the money we do, and we have to \ncompete with them.\n\n  It is not a fair competition. We have our businesses that are \ncompeting directly with the Japanese and, frankly, with other countries \nas well. But when they are spending half as much money for health care, \nand we are trying to compete our businesses against theirs, it is not a \nfair fight. It is like having one arm tied behind our back.\n  For years, Presidents, Members of Congress--Democrat and Republican--\nhave talked about this challenge--the fact we spend so much more money \nfor health care than the rest of the world, and we don't get better \nresults and, in a lot of cases, we get worse results and we don't cover \neverybody. We have a lot of people uncovered. That is not smart.\n  For years, for decades, nobody took it on. They tried during the \nClinton administration but gave up during that course. They didn't have \nthe kind of bipartisan support that is needed. Frankly, we didn't have \nthe bipartisan support I would like to have had on health care reform \nwhen we took it up during the earlier part of this current \nadministration.\n  A lot of people have focused on the individual mandate as being \nconstitutional or unconstitutional. I am not a lawyer. I don't pretend \nto be an expert on that stuff. I studied a little economics when I was \na Navy ROTC midshipman at Ohio State. When I got out of the Navy and \nmoved to Delaware to get an MBA under the GI bill, I studied some more \neconomics and all, but I don't pretend to be a lawyer. But I do know \nthis: Health insurance companies have said to all of us--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Presidents, now and in the past--look, if you expect us to \nprovide health insurance for folks with preexisting conditions, you \nhave to make sure the pool of people we have to cover includes not just \npeople who have preexisting conditions--not just people who are sick or \nhave illnesses or conditions that are expensive to treat--you have to \nmake sure we have a pool of people to insure that includes some healthy \npeople.\n  The way some countries deal with this is they mandate for everybody \nto have coverage. We didn't want to do that. We didn't want to mandate \nthat everybody have coverage, but we wanted to incentivize people, \nincluding healthier people--including healthier young people the ages \nof my sons who are in their early twenties--to make sure at least some \nof those young men and women end up in that pool, so healthy people end \nup in that pool.\n  So part of the request from the health insurance industry, in return \nfor doing away with preexisting conditions and basically screening out \nsick people, saying they are not going to provide coverage for them, \nwas to make sure a lot of healthier people ended up being in that \nhealth insurance pool.\n  The way we decided to do it in the health care bill, in the law \nrather than just mandate people get coverage, was to incentivize them. \nIf they choose not to, that is their business. If they happen to be \npoor, we will help them pay down their cost for health care. But if \nthey are not poor, and they have the financial means, we would like for \nthem to get coverage. We are not going to mandate it, but the first \nyear we have the means to be able to have coverage and they choose not \nto, there will be a fine or a penalty of some kind--maybe a couple \nhundred bucks, and that will increase not to $1,000 or $2,000, but it \nwill go up several hundred dollars in order to encourage people to get \nthe coverage.\n  At the end of the day, some people will say: I am paying $600--\nwhatever it ends up being. Maybe instead of paying this fee I should \njust go ahead and get some health insurance coverage. The idea is to \nprovide some plans that are reasonably affordable so folks can take \nadvantage of them.\n  So that is the issue of the mandate. The Supreme Court will decide \nwhether under the commerce clause of the Constitution that just as we \ncompel people to pay into Social Security, it can be a similar kind of \ncompunction to say we would like people to get covered for health care, \nbut in this case not to mandate it, as we do with Social Security. So \nwe will see how it works out in the Supreme Court.\n  They heard arguments this week, and I am sure the arguments will \ncontinue on the air waves, at townhall meetings, and on television for \nmonths to come and maybe beyond that. Who knows. But the heart and soul \nof the health care reform legislation has less to do with mandates for \nme than it does with how to get better health care outcomes for less \nmoney. For me, that is it--better health care outcomes for less money.\n  We don't have to look at Japan and other countries to figure that \nout. All we have to do is look at places such as Minnesota's Mayo \nClinic, in Ohio the Cleveland Clinic, Pennsylvania's health care \ndelivery system, which is called Geisinger, Utah's Intermountain \nHealthcare, and California's Kaiser Permanente. What do they have in \ncommon? They get better health care outcomes for tens of millions of \npeople for less money than most other health care delivery systems in \nthis country. Better results for less money.\n  How do they do it? Well, they have figured out what works, and they \ndo more of that. They figured out what doesn't work to get better \nhealth care outcomes for less money, and they do less of that. They \nhave moved away from what we call a fee-for-service approach to health \ncare.\n  People get sick, they go see a doctor, they go see a nurse. They have \nvisits and get shots or they get lab tests done or get x-rays or MRIs. \nWe treat people when they get sick. For years, that is the way we have \ndone health care in this country, including Medicare and Medicaid. Much \nsmarter ideas have come out of Cleveland's clinic, and they have a huge \nhealth care clinic in northern Ohio, the Mayo Clinic, Geisinger in \nPennsylvania, Intermountain in Utah, and Kaiser Permanente mostly in \nCalifornia.\n  Here is what they do. They do not just incentivize health care \nproviders--doctors, nurses, and hospitals--to work on people when they \nare sick. Their incentive works entirely different. What they do in \nthose places is focus on how to keep people healthy, not just how to \nincentivize the doctors, hospitals, and nurses to keep people healthy, \nbut how do we incentivize the patient, the person whose health is at \nstake, how do we incentivize them to take personal responsibility for \ntheir own health care.\n\n  In my mind that is the heart and soul of the health care reform right \nthere. Among the smart things that work are large purchasing pools. We \nhave an 8-million-person pool for us that we are part of. Members of \nCongress, our staffs, all Federal employees, Federal retirees, and our \ndependents are part of a huge purchasing pool called the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan. It is approximately 8 million people.\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nWe don't have 8 million Federal employees, but we have 8 million people \nwhen we add in retirees and dependents and so forth. We are part of \nthis big health care purchasing pool. We get lower prices.\n  It is not free. We pay about 28 percent of the cost of our premiums \nas Federal employees and servants, if you will, to people in our \nrespective States, and our employers, the taxpayers, pay the other 72 \npercent or so.\n  But what we are going to do is provide the opportunity for \nindividuals, for families, for businesses--small and midsize \nbusinesses--all over the country, in less than 24 months, to be able to \njoin a similar kind of purchasing pool. We are going to start them, and \nevery State--New Hampshire, Delaware, Alabama, and every other State--\nwill have the opportunity to have their own large purchasing pool to be \nable to take advantage of lower administrative costs.\n  The administrative costs for our Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan is $3 out of every $100 of the cost of the premium. So $3 out of \nevery $100 of premium costs goes for administration. In most plans for \nindividuals, for families and small businesses, it is more like 20 or \n30 percent. So 3 percent for our large purchasing pool, and we will \nhave those available, in fact, in every State.\n  The other thing we have going for us in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan is we use private health insurance plans. We are not \nusing socialized medicine or stuff like that. The private health \ninsurance plans in the country can sign up and say they want to be able \nto offer their plans to the folks who are Federal employees with \ndependents, to Federal retirees, and so we can choose among them. So \nthere is a lot of competition between those health insurance companies, \nand we get the benefit from that competition. It drives down cost. \nCompetition helps drive down cost and improves the range of \nopportunities.\n  The other thing I like about the law is that, for the most part, \ninsurance can't be sold across State lines. But we make an exception. I \nwill use Delaware as an example. We are boundaried on the west by \nMaryland, to the north by Pennsylvania, and to the east by New Jersey. \nWhen we establish our own health insurance pool in 2014, we will have \nabout 900,000 people. So we will have a huge health insurance pool, but \nwe are sure not going to have 8 million people.\n  But what we will have under the law is the opportunity to create an \ninterstate compact between Maryland or Delaware or Delaware and \nPennsylvania or Delaware and New Jersey or maybe all of the above and \nhave a multistate purchasing pool or exchange. The great thing about \nthis approach is we, No. 1, will have a bigger pool, which will drive \ndown administrative costs and increase the competition.\n  The health care that would be available in Delaware plans could be \noffered in Maryland, could be offered in Pennsylvania or offered in New \nJersey. So we would have a larger purchasing pool, more competition, \nand a better deal for the consumer. I think that is another part of the \nheart and soul.\n  So two things, and I will close on this and then turn to what I came \nto the floor to talk about. But I was inspired by my friend from \nAlabama. In terms of the key reforms in the health care legislation, \nNo. 1, move away from fee-for-service--just paying for treating people \nwhen they are sick. Migrate away from that. We still need to treat \npeople when they are sick, but migrate to a system like we have at \nMayo, Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger, Intermountain Health, and Kaiser \nPermanente where they focus on how we keep people well. Focus on \nprevention and wellness and focus on treating people in a coordinated \nfashion as a team, not as individual providers. Very smart.\n  The other key element is this idea of creating these large purchasing \npools and trying to incentivize people to be part of the health care \ndelivery system by taking better care of themselves. So those are the \ntwo keys.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2215-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2215-S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I want to switch gears and talk a little \nabout gas prices. Madam President, I don't know what kind of vehicle \nyou drive most of your miles in while in New Hampshire. The vehicle I \ndrive most of my miles in, and have been driving in Delaware for 11 \nyears now, is a Town and Country Chrysler minivan. When I stepped down \nas Governor in 2001, my old Chevrolet Corsica was about 12 or 13 years \nold, and my wife said: Don't you think it is about time to get \nsomething new? So I took my oldest son Christopher, who was about 12 at \nthe time, and I said: Let's go out and shop for a new car. I thought it \nwould be a man thing, a dad and son thing.\n  So we went out and drove Porsches, we drove Ferraris, and we bought a \n2001 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, which he laments to this day. \nAnyway, fast-forward 11 years, and we had a meeting yesterday morning, \nas you know, with the CEO of Chrysler-Fiat, and I mentioned at the \nmeeting that we bought this vehicle when I stepped down as Governor, \nand 11 years later--later this week--the odometer will reflect the \nnumbers 300,000 and counting. It will have over 300,000 miles. We are \ngoing to go over 300,000 miles. So it was built to last. What a great \ncar, built in this country, a terrific vehicle. But when I stopped and \ngot gas last weekend, we paid about $3.81, and the prices continue to \ngo up--mostly up, sometimes down, and then back up again.\n  What I would like to do is talk a little about high gas prices and \nhow it puts pressure on all budgets, including the budget of my own \nfamily. We drive that vehicle a whole lot and, hopefully, will drive it \na few more miles before it is ready do sit more in the driveway and \ntake a rest.\n  I want to begin by acknowledging that I go home just about every \nnight and talk to people literally almost every day, morning or \nevening, in Delaware. I will cover the State this weekend and for the \nnext week or two during our recess, so I hear a lot directly from the \nfolks I am privileged to represent about their concerns about gas \nprices at the pump and the kind of pressure it puts on the budgets \nwithin their own families.\n  I understand gas prices are at their peak. Actually, they have been \nhigher than this. I think they were a little over 4 bucks during part \nof the Bush administration, but this is as high as they have been for \nsome time. It puts a strain on American families and American \nbusinesses, and it threatens to impede or slow down our economic \nrecovery, which is actually moving at a pretty good pace. \nUnfortunately, the solution is not as simple as some would suggest. If \nit were, we would not be having this discussion every year or two \naround the same time.\n  I am asked sometimes: Why don't we just drill more in this country? \nSome assume high gas prices at the pump must mean we have slowed down \nor stopped drilling at home.\n  Many are surprised by the answer, and the answer is we are drilling \nmore in America. In fact, I believe--correct me if I am wrong--but we \nare drilling more in this country than we have for at least the last 8 \nyears. Because we are drilling more, the United States is now a net oil \nexporter, not a net oil importer. This country, which for years we said \nwe are the Saudi Arabia of coal, is now on its way to becoming the \nSaudi Arabia of natural gas. As we have opened for drilling additional \nacres onshore, offshore, off Alaska, and the gulf, we are in a position \nto become a net oil exporter.\n  The Obama administration has made available millions of acres for oil \nand gas exploration in the last year or two, approving more than 400 \ndrilling permits since the new safety standards were put in place. \nThese safety standards, we may recall, were implemented to make sure we \ndidn't have a repeat oilspill disaster such as the BP oilspill that \noccurred almost 2 years ago today.\n  We have been joined on the floor by Senator Nelson of Florida, who \nremembers all too well the oil that washed up in places such as \nPensacola, where I did basic training on my way to becoming a naval \nflight officer. But since we got that straightened out and put in place \ntighter restrictions for drilling safeguards, 400 or so new drilling \npermits just since then have been put in place with stronger safety \nstandards.\n  As a result, we have a record number of oil rigs operating right now, \nmore working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. Let \nme say that\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nagain. With the changes that have been made, the increases in \npermitting in a year or two, we now have a record number of oil rigs \noperating right now, more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the \nworld combined--combined. Yet of the millions of acres our government \nhas allowed for oil and gas development, only 25 percent of those acres \nare being used for production.\n  We have a chart that demonstrates that rather graphically. If you \nwill, think of all this as the millions of acres that are available for \noil and gas development in this country. Of all these in the orange, we \nhave the percentage that are producing acres, that actually have \npermits and the oil and gas companies could be drilling; 25 percent of \nthese are producing acres and 75 percent of these are nonproducing \nacres. It is not because people are drilling and coming up with dry \nholes; it is because, in many cases, they are not drilling.\n  Keep that picture in mind. You know the old saying, a picture is \nworth a thousand words. This is worth at least 500, maybe even more \nthan that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator yield for that point?\n  Mr. CARPER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator believe that in the Gulf of \nMexico, of all the production there, the percentage is even worse in \nall those acres that are under lease, which is 32 million acres.\n  Mr. CARPER. Just in the gulf?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Just in the gulf, 32 million acres. Guess how \nmany acres are actually drilled and producing?\n  Mr. CARPER. Eight million.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Six million.\n  Mr. CARPER. Really.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Six. So 26 million acres are under lease in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and are not being produced.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Wouldn't it suggest that they ought to use it \nor lose it?\n  Mr. CARPER. It certainly would. I thank the Senator for sharing that \npoint with us.\n  So here we are, more drilling in America, onshore and offshore. We \nare no longer a net oil importer. We have 75 million acres that are \nleased and have yet to be tapped, and a lot of those are down in the \ngulf, as Senator Nelson suggests. Yet American consumers are still \npaying more at the pump.\n  All the while, the five largest oil companies, BP, Chevron, \nConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell Group did pretty well. \nThey made about $137 billion last year. To top it off, these companies \nreceived billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to drill for oil and \ngas, even as they are making very healthy--I think recordbreaking--\nprofits.\n  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but let me stop. I wish \nto be clear on this point. I don't think any of us should begrudge the \noil and gas companies their success. They have a fair amount at risk \nwhen they drill for oil or gas, and it is not a business without risk. \nBut this is also a business with enormous payoffs and enormous rewards \nfor assuming those risks.\n  But I do question giving away billions of taxpayer dollars in \ndrilling subsidies at a time when we are running record Federal \ndeficits to established and successful industries that I don't think \nneed a whole lot of financial incentive to drill more in this country. \nIf they can make 100 or 110 bucks a barrel or so, that is pretty good \nincentive, at least in my mind.\n  Why? Because at the end of this day, it is not the solution. We can't \ndrill our way out of the situation we are in.\n  I am told that, today, America consumes some 19.5 million barrels \nevery day. The primary reason that amount is so high is because \nAmericans have very little choice at the pump; and until recently, we \nhad very little choice in the automotive showrooms. That has changed \nrather dramatically in 5 years, and it is going to change a whole lot \nmore. But we can choose between oil and oil most of the time when we \npull into a gas station to fill up. Basically, every American driver's \ndollars are a foregone conclusion to the oil industry.\n  What do we need to do about this? How about some choice. Maybe we can \ngive Americans a choice. In the chart we have, we have solar. Some of \nthe new vehicles that are being made actually have solar panels on \ntheir roofs.\n  Here we have wind. We are harnessing a lot of wind around the \ncountry. Hopefully, before long we will harness it off the east coast, \nmaybe from North Carolina up to Maine, to provide electricity. It will \nhelp provide the juice they need for these hybrid electric vehicles \nthat are being made more and more. We have nuclear. We have a lot of \nnuclear in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast that can provide \nelectricity, if you will, the juice, for these hybrid electric \nvehicles.\n\n  Here, we have companies such as DuPont in our State working with BP \nto actually create--not corn ethanol but ethanol, cellulosic ethanol \nout of corn stovers. What is a corn stover? That is the cornstalk, that \nis the corncob, that is the leaf of the corn--and create a fuel called \nbiobutanol that we will hear more about in the years to come that has \nbetter energy density than corn ethanol. It mixes better with gasoline \nthan corn ethanol. It actually travels through pipelines. Corn ethanol \ndoesn't do that. It is like all the things corn ethanol is not.\n  That is the kind of stuff we ought to be doing. We need to be \nincentivizing--not only being involved in the R of that stuff but \nalso encouraging its being used, and I think market forces will take it \nfrom there, whether the choice is natural gas, converting large diesel \nvehicles into using natural gas, electricity from clean energy or \nbiofuels or nuclear.\n  For the first time in 30 years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has \njust approved the construction of two nuclear powerplants. We went 30 \nyears without building a new nuclear powerplant. Two are underway right \nnow down in Georgia. They use a new design called the AP 1000, also \njust approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The new design is \none that literally shuts down a nuclear plant. If we have a hurricane \nor if we have an earthquake or if we have a tsunami, basically it shuts \nitself down. We don't have to worry about the problems they had in \nFukushima, where they lost communication, where they lost the pumping \nsystem, where all this and that happened, everything that could go \nwrong went wrong. These systems under the AP 1000 basically shut down \nby themselves. It is a much smarter approach, and it is the way the two \nnew powerplants in Georgia are going to be built. That is part of the \nsolution as well.\n  But we need investments in new fuels and investments in new vehicles \nand new infrastructure to use these new American-made alternative \nfuels. We already have vehicles that can run on biofuels and natural \ngas and electricity. We had the folks from the U.S. Navy in the other \nday, including some people from down in Florida, and they are flying \nNavy airplanes, Air Force airplanes, using a 50 50 mixture of jet fuel \nand biofuel and with no degradation in performance. We need to make \nthose vehicles--whether they are aircraft or cars, trucks, and vans--\nmake those vehicles and the fuels for those vehicles more available to \nthe American people, in this case our Armed Forces. We need a choice. \nWe need a greater choice than what we have had, and the bill offered by \nSenator Menendez actually starts to give us that choice.\n  I am getting close to the end, so let me just say that instead of \ngiving billions of dollars to oil companies to continue what they are \nalready doing, why don't we put some Federal dollars in to work to \nallow real choices at the pump? It turns out that some of the folks who \nare doing some cutting-edge work in this turn out to be some of these \noil companies. Some of the best biofuels work is being done by, I \nthink, outfits like BP and Shell. Rather than incentivize them just to \ndrill more, why don't we incentivize them to come up with alternative \nand biofuels and other kinds of renewable forms of energy? They \nshouldn't be cut out of that. They are energy companies. They are not \njust oil and gas companies. Let's incentivize them to create energy.\n  I wish to go back a couple years. I wish to go back to 2002. I am \ntold that from 2002 to 2010, Chevron spent something like roughly $4.5 \nbillion globally;\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nfrom 2002 to 2010 they did it on research and development for \nrenewables and alternatives including geothermal, biofuels, advanced \nbatteries, wind and solar, as well as on energy-efficient measures. \nThat is about $4.4 billion.\n  In 2010 alone, ExxonMobil invested about $67 million in research and \ndevelopment in oil alternatives, mainly in algae research. That same \nyear, BP spent $284 million. ConocoPhillips spent something like $34 \nmillion on research and development and demonstrations in alternative \nfuels.\n  Again, the idea is these oil companies are doing R Why don't we \nincentivize them to do R for renewable fuel, not oil and gas. Oil and \ngas, at $100 a barrel, $90 a barrel, they don't need a whole lot in \nterms of incentives to drill. Let's incentivize them to do the \nrenewable fuels.\n  I wish to be mindful of our time and be mindful of my colleague \nwaiting. Let's close by saying let's put Federal dollars into choices \nat the pump that are developed in America. I will say that again.\n  We are taking money from the Treasury. We are using that money to \nincentivize the creation of more energy--in some cases more fuel. \nRather than just incentivizing creation of traditional fuel that comes \nout of the ground, the oil, why don't we incentivize some of those same \noil companies and a bunch of folks that aren't oil companies to create \nrenewable fuels, the kind I just mentioned, that will be produced in \nAmerica, that will help us lower our costs and create jobs while they \nare doing it?\n  If we want an apple today, when is the best time to plant a tree? The \nbest time to plant a tree is probably 10 years ago, perhaps 6 years \nago, if we nurture and care for that tree. That is what we are dealing \nwith today. We need to start investing today for the choices in lower \nutility costs at the pump tomorrow.\n  As to building of the Keystone Pipeline, which is supported by some, \nopposed by others--the southern part of that is actually underway. The \nrest is going to be going through an approval process and should be \nworked out within the next year--is not going to solve the price at the \npump today. What we need is what we call an all-of-the-above approach--\nan all-of-the-above approach--which includes nuclear, includes offshore \nwind, onshore wind, includes biofuels, solar, natural gas in big diesel \nvehicles that we transform to take natural gas--all of the above.\n  That is what we need to do. We need to nurture new investments for \nalternative fuels so we can see the economic gains sooner rather than \nlater. I think Senator Menendez's legislation does that. That is why I \nam calling on my colleagues to support that kind of approach, whether \nit is this particular approach or something similar to that.\n  That pretty much wraps up what I want to say. I want to thank my \nfriend from Florida for being a voice of reason on this subject. This \nis a guy who is good on just using some common sense.\n  My dad was a naval chief petty officer for 30-some years. He used to \nsay to my sister and me: Just use some common sense. We must not have \nhad much as kids because he sure said it a lot. But I think the \ncommonsense approach is an all-of-the-above approach. We need to do all \nof the above, and we need to incentivize the oil companies and a lot of \nother folks not just to drill for oil but actually to make sure there \nare good alternatives to that.\n  With that I yield to my friend and colleague and bid you adieu.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I came to the floor to talk \nabout an outstanding citizen in our State. But before I do, while my \ncolleague is here, I just want to thank him for a very well-reasoned \nstatement.\n  What we need is overall income tax code reform. My colleague from \nDelaware and I have the privilege of sitting on the Finance Committee. \nEven though the prospects for Tax Code reform are very slim between now \nand the election, perhaps shortly thereafter we can get about the \nseriousness of the Tax Code, making it more fair, more simple, taking \nrevenue that otherwise escapes the Treasury because it goes into all \nthese tax preferences called tax expenditures, tax loopholes, and use \nthat revenue to lower everybody's rates, including the individual rates \nand the corporate rates.\n  That is eminently common sense. The reason I want to point this out \nis because our friend from Delaware has just pointed out one of those \nloopholes in an industry that is certainly not hurting because the five \ntop oil companies in the last quarter--that is 90 days--had profits, \nnot revenue--the five top--north of $25 billion for five companies for \n90 days--not revenue, profit.\n  We do not begrudge them the profit. But should there be these tax \npreferences that have been etched into the Tax Code over a century \nthat, in fact, allow this industry to have tax preferences--in other \nwords, deductions--of $4 billion a year?\n  I think that would be a place we could start on tax preferences. You \nare obviously not going to get it in the context of the politics of an \nelection. And you are not going to get it in isolation. We are going to \nhave to look at the overall Tax Code and start making it more fair for \nthe American taxpayer. I daresay there are not very many American \ntaxpayers who think that the IRS Tax Code is a fair code.\n  Mr. CARPER. Or simple.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Or simple. And as a result I thank him for his \nelucidation of what is a place that we could start. It is not right or \nleft; it is not R or D; it is common sense.\n  One other thing I would add to the excellent presentation of the \nSenator, and that is that as the cost of gas creeps higher and higher--\nand in parts of Florida it is now $4 a gallon, and oil is being sold on \nthe international marketplace at something like $120 a barrel--how much \nof that is from speculation of people who buy and sell oil contracts \nfor future delivery? How much is from people who are not users of the \noil, such as an airline that would clearly have reason to want to lock \nin a fixed price for oil in the future as a hedge against that price of \noil going up because they are going to use that oil as fuel in their \nairline? No, these are the ones who are merely flipping like hamburgers \nthe contracts, over and over, which has a tendency to raise the price \nof oil.\n  The price of a barrel of oil as it rises then clearly is going to \naffect the price we pay when we go into the gas station and put gas in \nour gas tank.\n  If we would start using some common sense in our approach to these \nthings and do it in a fair way, I think we could get along so much \nbetter and the American people would feel so much better about their \nTax Code.\n  I thank the Senator for his presentation.\n  Mr. CARPER. If my friend would yield to me for one more minute, a lot \nof people go out this time of year and they buy new cars, trucks, and \nvans. Traditionally the spring is when people shop for vehicles. Go \nback a couple of years, to 2007. In 2007 we sold 16 million cars, \ntrucks, and vans in this country. In 2009, as we had fallen into the \ngreat recession, car sales and truck sales fell to 9 million units; \nfrom 16 million to 9 million in less than 24 months.\n  That has changed now. We are on our way. The CEO of Chrysler was here \nyesterday and said they are on their way to record profits. They paid \nback the rest of the money we invested in them as taxpayers. But people \nare starting to buy vehicles again. The average life of vehicles people \nown in this country is 11 years, like my Chrysler Town and Country \nminivan. But this is the time people will start to trade in vehicles or \nbuy something more energy efficient.\n  Unlike 5 years ago, people can go into a Ford, Chrysler, GM \ndealership, and foreign labels as well, and buy vehicles that get 30, \n35, 40 miles per gallon and more. And finally, the availability of \ncredit has come back. I say to people who have that ability, thinking \nabout trading and trading up, this is a great time to do it--great \nvehicles, great quality and much better efficiency, and that is part of \nthe solution as well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for pulling up the chart \nthat showed the amount of acres that are under lease and the minuscule \nportion of those acres--this is domestic production. We all know that \ndomestic production has shot up in the last 3 years, considerably. Yet, \nof that domestic production, there still is so much capacity that is \nalready leased out there.\n  I use the example of the Gulf of Mexico. In the central and the \nwestern\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\ngulf, there are 32 million acres under lease and only 6 million acres \nof that 32 million are actually drilled and produced.\n  There is ample opportunity for additional domestic energy production \non top of the substantial increase of production that has occurred over \nthe course of the last several years if we would stop fighting about \nthis, if we would stop beating each other over the head politically \nwith this and get serious.\n  Senator Carper remembers when he and I were young Congressmen, we had \na good example of leadership. We had Tip O'Neill, the Speaker in the \nHouse, and we had Bob Michel, the Republican leader. The two of them \nwould get into their fights but they were personal friends, so at the \nend of the day when it was time to stop talking and get together and \nbuild consensus to get a workable solution, they could do it. We need \nthat kind of model operating in Washington, DC, and State capitals \naround the country.\n  Mr. CARPER. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2218-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROSEMARY ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I came to the floor today \nbecause I want to congratulate a Floridian, Rosemary Armstrong, along \nwith her husband Sandy Weinberg. I want to congratulate Rosemary \nbecause she has been such a long-time advocate of pro bono legal work \nin our State.\n  She is a marvelous lawyer, a graduate of Columbia, and why she is to \nbe congratulated at this point is that she has received the 2012 Tobias \nSimon Pro Bono Service Award. It is the highest honor in the State of \nFlorida bar for pro bono legal work in our State.\n  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Tobias Simon award, and \nit was named after the well-known civil rights attorney in Florida. The \naward honors the work of private lawyers for 30 years now, who provide \nfree voluntary legal services to the poor.\n  Over the past 25 years, Rosemary has used her time and she has used \nher talent to provide those pro bono legal services. She has \nvolunteered with the Tampa Bay Area Legal Services Volunteer Lawyers \nProgram since 1986. She has donated 1,200 pro bono hours directly to \nserve those in need. She was elected to the Bay Area Legal Services \nBoard and she served as a board member for 22 years. She has served as \npresident of that board for 3 years.\n  Rosemary has handled so many cases in so many areas of the law, \nincluding elder law, housing, and juvenile dependency cases. Of \nparticular note is the significance of her work with victims of \ndomestic violence. Rosemary was recognized last year for her work with \nthe Florida Bar President's Pro Bono Service Award.\n  This award is further recognition of her commitment and dedication to \nmaking sure everyone is well represented when they have to go through \nthe legal process. She is supported by her family. She is supported by \nher husband, a fellow lawyer, Sandy Weinberg.\n  Again, congratulations, Rosemary Armstrong, for receiving the Tobias \nSimon Pro Bono Service Award.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about a \ntruly remarkable American--a truly remarkable visionary, a dreamer, an \nadventurer, a doer, and, most important, a young man who has devoted \nhimself to the service to others far and above the normal call of duty. \nThis young man's name is Matt Rutherford. I will tell my colleagues \nabout him and his remarkable adventure and his feat that has been \nunparalleled.\n  He is a 30-year-old Ohioan, and here is what he has been doing since \nJune 13 of last year. On June 13 of last year, he set sail in his 36-\nyear-old, 27-foot Albin Vega boat named St. Brendan. He left Annapolis, \nMD, on June 13, 2011, and is attempting to sail nearly 25,000 miles \nfrom Annapolis, MD, up the east coast, all the way around Newfoundland, \nup by Greenland, through the Northwest Passage, all the way over to \nAlaska, then from Alaska all the way down to Cape Horn, around Cape \nHorn, up South America, and back into Annapolis. Now, what is so \nremarkable about that? Well, it has never been done before. He is doing \nthis solo, and he is doing it nonstop. Think about that. He has never \ntouched land and has not stopped since he left here 289 days ago.\n  The trip has taken Matt through some of the Earth's most treacherous \noceans, including the Arctic Ocean, the oceans up around Alaska, \nAleutian Straits, of course all the way down through the Pacific, \naround treacherous Cape Horn, and all this in a 27-foot boat, the kind \nof boat most sailors would maybe be comfortable on off the Eastern \nShore in the Chesapeake Bay but not on a journey such as this. As I \nsaid, he has not set foot on dry land for the entire journey--a \nremarkable adventure.\n  If my colleagues wish to learn more about him, they can go to his Web \nsite, which is called www.solotheamericas.org, and they can read all \nabout his amazing journey. He updates his trip. The last update was \nyesterday. He is right now east of Cuba and the Dominican Republic, \nright down here, and his last posting was what he called ``Home \nStretch.'' He hopes to enter the Chesapeake Bay by April 12, making his \nfirst landfall in nearly a year in Annapolis on April 13.\n  The Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, England, has recognized Matt \nas the first person in history to make it through the fabled Northwest \nPassage alone, nonstop, and on such a small sailboat. It has never been \ndone before. One would think that would be enough. No. He has continued \non his incredible, remarkable journey.\n  Now, one might say: Why is he doing that? He is just doing it to set \na record.\n  He has set a lot of records already. Why is he doing it? He is doing \nit to raise money for Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating. It is an \nAnnapolis-based organization to provide sailing opportunities for \nphysically or developmentally disabled people--for kids and young \npeople who are disabled but who like to sail. And this organization, \nChesapeake Region Accessible Boating, does just that--provides them \nthat opportunity.\n  I had the privilege of talking to Matt Rutherford last week. He \ncalled me on his satellite phone. It was an exciting phone call for me \nbecause I have watched--I don't know Matt Rutherford personally, but I \nhave watched his journey, and, of course, I am very enthused about the \nChesapeake Region Accessible Boating organization. So in talking with \nhim by phone I was really impressed by his courage, his character, his \naudacity. Above all, I am impressed by the fact that he is doing this \nfor a cause larger than himself to make it possible for more people \nwith disabilities to share in his passion for sailing.\n  Helen Keller once said, ``It is a terrible thing to see and yet have \nno vision.'' Well, Matt Rutherford has the gift of sight. He also has \nthe gift of vision and indomitable courage. He is one of those \nremarkable human beings who dream big, who are driven by big \nchallenges, who refuse to accept the limits and the boundaries that so-\ncalled reasonable people want to place on us. What is more, he has \nplaced himself in the service of others less fortunate than himself.\n  As the lead sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act, I am \nparticularly impressed that Matt is using his voyage to raise money to \nhelp people with disabilities to partake in this wonderful pastime of \nsailing--something which I have enjoyed all my adult life since I was \nin the Navy. He is doing this so that children and adults can have the \nsame opportunity. The reason I am so enthused about this is that one of \nthe fundamental aspects of the ADA--the Americans With Disabilities \nAct--is that people with disabilities should be able to participate \nfully in all aspects of society, and that includes access to \nrecreational opportunities such as sailing, which can be exhilarating \nand empowering for children and adults with a wide range of \ndisabilities.\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n  I salute Matt Rutherford for his courage, for his love of sailing, \nand being willing to share that with the disabled community, and for \nusing this adventure, this almost death-defying trip. For anyone who \nknows what it is like to be on a 27-foot boat, to go from here all the \nway down to Cape Horn, that is incredible. Any one of numerous storms \nor anything could have sunk his little boat. He has had a lot of \ndifferent adventures. He sprung a leak. He has been working on that \nleak ever since. Someplace around here, South America, he lost his \nengine, so he no longer has an engine, and he keeps patching his leak \nall the time. Every day he has to patch his leak. So he is fighting a \nleak every day in his boat. Just going around Cape Horn with the \ntremendous waves and cross currents around Cape Horn--to take a small \nboat through there singlehandedly is, as I said, death-defying.\n  Right up in here, right off the coast of Brazil someplace, he almost \ngot run over by a freighter. At night, he had gone to sleep for a \nlittle bit. He has a light in his boat so people can see him at night. \nHe woke up and he looked out and saw this red light and a green light \nwith nothing in between it coming at him. Well, it was a huge \nfreighter, and as the Presiding Officer knows, red on one side, green \non the other, bearing down on him. He turned, and it missed him just by \na few feet and almost sunk him in the bow wave of the freighter that \nwent by. So those are the kinds of things Matt has lived with almost \nevery day for 289 days.\n  Matt has great skill, great courage. He is making a difference. He is \ngoing to make a difference for a lot of people. I especially think of \nyoung people with disabilities who would like to sail, and because of \nthis organization, Chesapeake Bay Accessible Boating, they will have \nthe opportunity to do so.\n\n  So, again, this is one of the nice things we see happening in \nAmerica. We think there are no individuals with that individual kind of \ncourage to take on the elements, to risk their lives. Well, we still \nhave them, and Matt Rutherford stands in a line of great adventurers in \nour history. I applaud him for his brave spirit, and I wish him safe \npassage on his home stretch and on the final leg of his epic journey.\n  He joins the ranks of Joshua Slocum who, on Spray, was the first \nperson to circumnavigate the globe solo. He wrote a wonderful book: \n``Sailing Alone Around the World.'' He did it before the turn of the \nlast century. He did it in the 1890s. He also joins the ranks of the \nnext great person who sailed alone, Sir Francis Chichester, on the \nGypsy Moth IV not too many years ago, who circumnavigated the globe. So \nto Joshua Slocum and Sir Francis Chichester we can now add Matt \nRutherford, on St. Brendan, for an incredible journey around both of \nthe Americas, solo and nonstop. It has never been done before, and it \nmay never be done again. And he is doing it for the best of all \nreasons.\n  A courageous young man, Matt Rutherford. He is going to be back, as I \nsaid, hopefully by April 12. I hope to meet him. I have never met the \nyoung man, but I have followed his journey and his courage. He is the \nkind of person who just gives heart and spirit to all of us, to know \nthere is nothing we can't do if we set our minds and our hearts to it \nand if we have the willpower and the courage to take it on. So I hope \nto meet him when he comes back--again, this young man of great courage. \nI hope the home stretch is one with fair winds and following seas.\n  Before I yield the floor, I mentioned that Matt Rutherford was doing \nthis for the Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating organization that \nprovides boating for people with disabilities. I would urge anyone who \nis interested in this and who wants to see what a great organization it \nis, they can go to their Web site--it is very simple--\nwww.crabsailing.org. It is a great organization that helps people with \ndisabilities to take up sailing and learn the art and the craft of \nsailing.\n  So, again, hats off to a remarkable young man on a remarkable \njourney. I wish him fair winds and a following sea in his home stretch.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nRhode Island, to pay tribute to SGT Dennis Weichel, a Rhode Islander \nwho served in the Rhode Island National Guard.\n  On March 22, Sergeant Weichel was in a convoy with his unit in \nLaghman Province, Afghanistan. Some children were in the road and \nSergeant Weichel and other troops got out to move the children to \nsafety. Most of the children moved out of the way, but one little girl \nwent back to the road. As an MRAP approached, Sergeant Weichel pulled \nher out of the vehicle's path, but in doing so he was hit by the \nvehicle. He was medically evacuated to Jalalabad Medical Treatment \nFacility, where a surgical team worked to stabilize him. But, \ntragically, he died from his injuries. Because of his heroic actions, \nthe little girl he saved was unharmed in the accident. He will be laid \nto rest this Monday in Rhode Island, a hero--someone who exemplifies \nthe qualities of the American soldier: selfless sacrifice for others.\n  Sergeant Weichel joined the National Guard in 2001. He was \nposthumously promoted to sergeant. He previously deployed to Iraq as a \nmember of Detachment 2, Headquarters, Headquarters Company, 3rd \nBattalion, of the 172nd Infantry, Mountain. In November 2011, he \nmobilized for deployment to Afghanistan with the 1st Battalion, 143rd \nInfantry Regiment.\n  Each generation of Americans is called upon to protect and sustain \nour democracy, and there are no greater heroes than the men and women \nwho have worn the uniform of our Nation and who have sacrificed for our \ncountry to keep it safe and to keep it free.\n  It is our duty to protect the freedom they sacrificed their lives for \nthrough our service, our citizenship. We must continue to keep their \nmemories alive and honor their heroism, not simply by words but by our \ndeeds as citizens of this country.\n  Today our thoughts are with Sergeant Weichel's mother Linda, his \nfather Dennis, brother Craig, his sisters Christine and Charlene, his \nchildren Nicholas and Hope and their mother Amanda, and his fiancee \nAshley and their daughter Madison, and all his family and friends and \nhis comrades-in-arms. We join them in commemorating his sacrifice and \nhonoring his example of selfless service, of love, of courage, and of \ndevotion to the soldiers with whom he served and the people of \nAfghanistan he was trying to help.\n  Sergeant Weichel is one among many Rhode Islanders who have proven \ntheir loyalty, their integrity, and their personal courage by giving \nthe last full measure of their lives in service to our country in \nAfghanistan, in Iraq, and elsewhere around the globe and throughout the \nyears. Today we honor his memory and all those who have served and \nsacrificed as he did.\n  Sergeant Weichel joins a roll of honor that includes the following \nRhode Islanders killed since September 11, 2001:\n  SPC Dennis Poulin, Army National Guard; SGT Michael Paranzino, Army; \nPFC Kyle Coutu, Marine Corps; LTJG Francis L. Toner, IV, Navy; PO3 \nRonald A. Gill, Jr., Coast Guard; SGT Michael R. Weidemann, Army; SGT \nMoises Jazmin, Army; SSG Dale James Kelly, Jr., Army National Guard; \nSGT Brian R. St. Germain, Marine Corps; SGT Dennis J. Flanagan, Army; \n2LT Matthew S. Coutu, Army; LCPL Holly A. Charette, Marine Corps; SSG \nChristopher S. Potts, Army National Guard; LCPL John J. Van Gyzen, IV, \nMarine\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\nCorps; CPT Christopher S. Cash, Army; LCPL Matthew K. Serio, Marine \nCorps; MSG Richard L. Ferguson, Army; SFC Curtis Mancini, Army Reserve; \nCPT Matthew J. August, Army; CW5 Sharon T. Swartworth, Army; SPC \nMichael Andrade, Army National Guard; SGT Charles T. Caldwell, Army \nNational Guard; SSG Joseph Camara, Army National Guard; and SGT Gregory \nA. Belanger, Army Reserve.\n  All of these men and women have given their lives in the last decade \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a roll of honor. It is a roll that \nSergeant Weichel joins. It should be, for us, a roll not just to \nrecognize and remember but to recommit to trying in some small way to \nmatch their great sacrifice for this great Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is with great sadness but also \nconsiderable pride that I join Senator Reed today to honor the service \nof SGT Dennis P. Weichel, Jr., of the Rhode Island National Guard, who \ndied 1 week ago today while serving our country in Afghanistan.\n  Dennis' actions in defense of the lives of vulnerable civilians \nembody the most noble spirit of service, sacrifice, and loyalty found \nin the hearts of the men and women serving our Nation in uniform in the \nmost dangerous corners of the globe. In particular, they reflect the \nspirit of service of the Rhode Island National Guard, which is the \nsecond most heavily deployed State guard in the country.\n  Dennis, who was 29 years old, lived in Providence. He had joined the \nRhode Island National Guard in 2001, and he deployed to Iraq in 2005 in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom as a member of Company D, 3rd \nBattalion, 172nd Infantry, Mountain, Regiment. In November 2011, Dennis \nmobilized with Company C, 1st Battalion, 143rd Infantry Regiment, 56th \nTroop Command, to Camp Atterbury, IN. His unit deployed forward to \nAfghanistan just this month.\n  He had only been in Afghanistan a few weeks when his unit encountered \na group of children on its way out of the Black Hills Firing Range in \nLaghman Province. The children were scavenging in the road for brass \nshell casings, which are recyclable for money in Afghanistan.\n  Dennis, a father of three, hopped down from his vehicle to help move \nthe children safely out of the path of the convoy of trucks and armored \nvehicles. As the heavy trucks rumbled past, it appears a young Afghan \ngirl darted back into the road to grab one last brass shell casing. \nSeeing one of his unit's Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles \nbearing down on the girl, Dennis reacted swiftly and selflessly, \nlifting the girl to safety and placing himself in the path of the 16-\nton MRAP.\n  I am sure this was a parent's instinct and that Dennis had in mind \nhis own children: Nicholas, age 8; Hope, age 6; and baby Madison. \nDennis was evacuated to the Jalalabad Medical Treatment Facility, and \nthere he succumbed to his injuries.\n  Dennis leaves behind his fiancee Ashley, the mother of their 8-month-\nold baby girl Madison. He leaves behind his former wife Amanda, who is \nmother to his son Nicholas and his daughter Hope. He leaves behind his \nmother and father Linda Reynolds and Dennis Weichel, Sr.\n  My deepest and heartfelt sorrows and prayers go out to all of \nDennis's family and to his friends. Senator Reed and I will join them \nthis weekend to pay our respects when Dennis comes home for the last \ntime to Rhode Island.\n  Dennis acted with instinctive bravery on that road in Laghman \nProvince. His action reflected the selfless dedication of an American \nsoldier and the heart of a father toward a child. Dennis has been \nposthumously promoted from the rank of specialist to sergeant, and his \nfamily will receive the Bronze Star he has been awarded for heroism.\n  The writer Joseph Campbell once described a hero as someone who has \ngiven his or her life to something bigger than one's self. In giving \nhis life to save one small child, SGT Dennis Weichel has reflected \ngreat honor upon our military and its best traditions and this great \nNation and the values for which it stands. He will justly be remembered \na hero.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2220-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2220-S2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  EPA\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to take some time this evening \nto congratulate our Environmental Protection Agency and to thank them \nfor the rule they proposed this week regarding new coal-fired \npowerplants.\n  They have taken a certain amount of heat over this rule and have been \ncriticized. But I come from Rhode Island, and Rhode Island is a \ndownwind State from the coal-fired powerplants of the Midwest. We pay \nthe price for the coal power those Midwestern States burn. We pay the \nprice in children coming in to our hospitals with asthma attacks. We \npay the price in ozone levels that are outside our control. We are a \nState that contributes very little in pollution to other States, but we \nare on the receiving end. We are down the gun barrel of the big array \nof coal-fired powerplants in the Midwest.\n  They have not only continued to burn dirty coal, they have built \nparticularly high stacks so the emissions from that coal plant get \npushed into the high atmosphere and they move east toward Rhode Island \nin the prevailing winds and we experience that as smog, as ozone, as \nair pollution. So there is an element of deliberateness to this.\n  There are places in this country that are in compliance with air \nquality standards because they have put their emissions up high enough \nthat it lands somewhere else. Rhode Island is often out of compliance \nwith air quality standards, and it is not from emissions in our home \nState. So we hear a lot from the coal-burning polluters about all the \nterrible things the EPA rule is going to cause. It is going to cause \nnothing but good in Rhode Island.\n  It is outrageous that on a bright, clear summer day one can be \ndriving in to work in Rhode Island and hear over the car radio the \nannouncer letting us know that today is going to be a bad air day in \nRhode Island. We look out the window and it looks absolutely beautiful, \nbut it is going to be a bad air day, they tell us. Infants should be \nkept indoors in air-conditioning, seniors should not go outside, people \nwith breathing difficulties should stay indoors, and everyone should \navoid vigorous physical activity because the air quality is too poor. \nThat is not a price a carbon polluter in one State should get to \nrequire the seniors, the children, the families in another State to \nhave to pay.\n  I am delighted EPA has begun to apply this rule. Unfortunately, it \nonly applies to new powerplants. So the existing coal-burning \npowerplants that create so much of this pollution in our State, we are \ngoing to need to continue to work to crack down on until these States \nare sufficiently responsible in their use of power and in how they burn \nfuel to generate their power that they are not exporting bad air and \npollution to other States.\n  As important as this is to Rhode Island as a downwind State, as \nimportant it is to protect the lungs of our kids and our families, this \nis also an important step for EPA to have taken because of the global \nproblem we have from carbon pollution. The carbon pollution we are \nunleashing as a country--frankly, as a species across the globe--is \nhaving a dire effect in our atmosphere. It is having a dire effect in \nour oceans. It is truly causing our climate to change and the changes \nare going to be very difficult and very dangerous for our country in \nthe future. That is not just my opinion. That is the opinion of our \nmilitary leaders. That is the opinion of our national defense \nintelligence establishment. It is treated as a fact in those \nresponsible quarters of our government.\n  Unfortunately, here and down there in the House of Representatives, \nthere is a campaign of denial that is being propagated that is clearly \nsupported by the polluting industries and has the purpose of protecting \ntheir financial\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\ninterests and enabling them to continue to profit from the harm they \nare imposing on our oceans and on our atmosphere.\n  It would be nice if the laws of government could supersede the laws \nof nature. It would be nice if we could repeal the laws of physics, the \nlaws of chemistry, the laws of biology, but we can't. It is arrogance \nto presume we could. The fact of what the carbon pollution is doing to \nour world can be denied in this Chamber, it can be denied down the hall \nin the House of Representatives all day long and all night long, and it \nis not going to change the result. It is actually only recently that \nthere was a denial industry attacking the problem of climate change and \ntrying to minimize it, trying to mock it, trying to distract people \nfrom it.\n  In the past, the denial industry was pointed elsewhere. In the past, \nthe denial industry was supporting the tobacco companies in convincing \npeople it wasn't that bad for them. The science isn't complete yet. \nDon't worry. There is still doubt.\n  It deployed itself against lead. When the dangers of lead paint \nbecame known, the denial industry went to bat for the lead industry. It \ndenied that lead was very poisonous, said it only happened to very poor \npeople, went through all their rigmarole. The same process: create \ndoubt about a scientific concern in order to prevent action being taken \nto protect people. Now they have turned on carbon pollution.\n  But before they turned from tobacco and lead to carbon pollution, it \nwas pretty well accepted how basic this science is. The first scientist \nto determine that carbon dioxide would have the effect of warming the \natmosphere if its concentration increased was a scientist named \nTyndall. I think he was Irish and wrote in England in 1865. Around the \ntime of the Civil War, this was discovered.\n  By the year I was born, in 1955, there are basic texts that describe \nthat the more carbon pollution we put into the air, the more it traps \nheat, the warmer the climate gets.\n  It is virtually indisputable what is happening to the oceans. We are \nnot talking projections. We are not talking estimates. We are talking \nmeasurements, and the measurements show the acidity of our oceans and \nthe increase in acidification is happening faster than it has in 3 \nmillion years. The extent of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere now, \nmeasured, is outside of a bound that has been maintained on the surface \nof our planet for 800,000 years--8,000 centuries. That is a long time. \nWe have only been farming as a species for about 10,000 years. So \n800,000 takes us way back to a very primitive species. Through all that \ntime, we have been in this bandwidth of carbon in our atmosphere and \nnow we are out of it. We are flying out of it, and it is getting worse \nall the time.\n  Instead of taking it seriously in this building, we are listening to \nthe siren song of the big-money polluters, as if the laws of \ngovernment, the laws of Congress could repeal the laws of nature that \nwe know--the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of \nbiology that are causing this to happen.\n  I appreciate very much the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from \nMinnesota, having been so energetic and helpful in continuing to bring \nthis thought to the Senate floor. I think we had an effective and \nimportant colloquy on the floor several weeks ago discussing this very \npoint. I think it is important that from time to time we stand and \nremind our colleagues that there is a truth to this matter. The truth \nis that we are releasing unprecedented, massive amounts of carbon \npollution into our atmosphere that, as a matter of science, the laws of \nphysics, warm the atmosphere, and that warming atmosphere creates \ndramatic changes in our weather, in our coasts, in our sea levels. Our \ncoasts are probably going to be hit the hardest of anyplace, and Rhode \nIsland is a coastal State.\n  The ocean absorbs the pollution, so the harm is not just in the \natmosphere and to the climate, it is to the ocean itself as its pH \nlevel changes from the absorption of carbon. Nobody doubts that the \nocean absorbs carbon. There is no credible debate on that. You can \nmeasure the ocean's pH.\n  It is important that every once in a while we tell the truth on this \nbecause the time is coming very close when it will be past the tipping \npoint of taking the action we need to take to protect ourselves, \nprotect our coasts, our economy, our national security.\n  I wanted to take this moment as the week ended to come and share my \nthoughts again on this subject. I will continue to do it from time to \ntime because I think it is important that America be a country that \ntells the truth about problems, and I think it is important that Rhode \nIsland, as an ocean State, be as protected as we can from the changes \nwe see coming.\n  The IPCC just reported on the weather effects of climate change and \nsaid that you cannot assign a particular storm to the effects of \nclimate change, but in various areas you can connect the threat to \nclimate change with varying degrees of certainty. With respect to the \nthreat from sea-level rise and from worsened storms driving that raised \nsea ashore and causing flooding and damage, the certainty range was 90 \nto 100 percent. If we are not going to listen to warnings that the \nscientists now tell us are 90 to 100 percent certain, we are really \nmaking a grievous mistake.\n  I will conclude by thanking the Presiding Officer again for his \nsupport and help. I hope the time comes when this body can actually \ntreat this problem in a serious and sober way and the dark hand of the \npolluting industry tapping on our shoulders and whispering in our ears \nand telling us what we can and cannot say is pushed back and instead we \nstand in the light of day, in the light of science and fact, and behave \nresponsibly about the changes that are coming and our role in causing \nthese changes.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Georgia in the Chamber, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, next week the annual Masters Tournament \nwill begin in Augusta, GA. It is a beautiful time of the year in our \npart of the world, and certainly Augusta is a little piece of Heaven, \nparticularly this time of year.\n  As that tournament begins next week, there is going to be a sad note \nin the air because of the fact that Furman Bisher, a giant in the world \nof journalism, a man who has covered the Masters for the last 50 or so \nyears, died last week at his home in Atlanta. He died at the age of 93 \nand passed away peacefully in his home after a storied career as one of \nthe Nation's foremost sports writers. It was a career that lasted an \nastonishing 60 years.\n  After nearly six decades of elegant observations of the sports world \nfor the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Furman pecked out his final \ncolumn before his October 2009 retirement on the thinning keys of his \ntrusty Royal typewriter. His choice of instrument to convey his \nthoughts in this age of instantaneous, inane chatter says a lot about \nwhy newspaper readers after so many years continued to seek out \nFurman's Bisher's column in the AJC's sports pages.\n  It all came down to this: Furman's graceful prose, courtly voice and \nsharp observations were unfailingly backed up by old-fashioned shoe-\nleather reporting. He gloried in doing his homework, making that extra \ncall, interviewing one more player or assistant coach or trainer, in \norder to breathe even more life into the game or the race or the fight \nfor his readers.\n  It's also why Furman became a Georgia--and an American--institution. \nSimply put, Furman loved sports. And he loved journalism. At age 90, he \nwas still driving out on summer nights to cover minor-league ballgames.\n  In his career, Furman scored many journalistic knockouts, including a \n1949 interview with Shoeless Joe Jackson--the only one Jackson ever \ngave--regarding his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.\n  He got stock tips from Ty Cobb and watched Jack Nicklaus' 1986 \nMasters\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nvictory. He sat in the press box at countless Falcons games at Atlanta-\nFulton County Stadium and covered the Olympics, both winter and summer. \nHe even had a hand in bringing professional sports teams to Atlanta.\n  He wrote 11 books, including co-authoring two editions of a Hank \nAaron autobiography. And at The Masters Tournament in Augusta every \nApril, Furman reigned among the azaleas and oaks as the dean of the \nsports press corps.\n  In a testament to his longevity in a tough business, until his \nretirement, Furman covered every Kentucky Derby since 1950, and every \nSuper Bowl but the first one.\n  He even branched out into TV. Although I did not grow up in Atlanta, \nI have heard from many people that preachers across the city would cut \nsermons short so that their congregations could be home for Furman's \nkickoff on ``Football Review.''\n  Along the way, he earned the respect of his colleagues and the \nloyalty of his readers, garnering writing awards too numerous to \nmention. He served as president of the National Sportscasters and \nSportswriters Association from 1974 1976, and of the Football Writers \nAssociation of America from 1959 1960. His features appeared in The \nSaturday Evening Post, Golf Digest and Sports Illustrated, to name but \na few.\n  In 1961, Time magazine named him one of the five best columnists in \nthe Nation. I would argue that that honor fit until the very end.\n  No less than the great Jack Nicklaus said of Furman's retirement: He \nmight be turning in his last column for the newspaper, but Furman will \nnever stop writing or giving his opinion. I guess you could say that \nwhen it comes to the last writings of Furman Bisher, I will believe it \nwhen I don't see it.\n  Furman would close every column with a single valediction--the word \n``selah''--a Hebrew word that ends many Psalms and that exhorts the \nreader to reflect.\n   It is appropriate, then, to reflect on Furman's long, fruitful life \nand career, one that began in Atlanta as the Korean War was starting, \nwhen Joe Louis was still boxing, when the Minneapolis Lakers were the \nNBA champs, before Willie Mays had joined the major leagues and before \nSports Illustrated magazine even existed.\n  In all the ensuing years, Furman chronicled the triumphs and the \ntravails of the sports world and its often-all-too-human heroes. As \nFurman would say, ``Selah.''\n  I am thankful for Furman Bisher. I am pleased to have been the \nrecipient of reading many of his articles through the years and also \nvery proud to have called him a very good friend over the years. He was \na gentleman who will be missed for his professional career as well as \njust being a great person and a great individual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2222-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2222-S2223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The political world this week has been focused on the \nU.S. Supreme Court and the arguments that have taken place over there \nwith respect to what has been referred to as ObamaCare.\n  I rise today to discuss how the 2-year-old health care law is forcing \nmore government intrusion into the lives of Americans.\n  After all, what could be more intrusive than the Federal Government \ntelling you the type of health care coverage you must purchase? \n``Purchase this product or face a penalty.''\n  With this law, I believe the American people have recognized that \nCongress has exceeded its constitutional authority. Just this week, a \npoll conducted by The Hill found that 49 percent of likely voters \nbelieve that the Supreme Court will rule against the constitutionality \nof the health care law, while only 29 percent believe it will be \nupheld. The American people have to ask themselves whether we should be \nable to punish citizens based whether they purchase a product from the \nprivate sector.\n  The Commerce Clause only allows the Federal Government to regulate \n``existing activity'' that affects interstate commerce. I hope this \ndistinction will be recognized by our justices on the Supreme Court. \nWith no end in sight to escalating health care costs, Republicans want \nto see innovation within the private sector to bring about changes to \nour health care system. Today, Medicare and Medicaid are running up our \nnational debt and bankrupting our states. One would think less \ngovernment involvement, not more, would help bring health care costs \nunder control. Instead, the health care law builds on this \nadministration's desire to have the Federal Government control \nAmericans' health care decisions. To this end, the Obama administration \nhas created 159 new boards, bureaucracies and programs under ObamaCare.\n  As of this month, the administration has released more than 12,000 \npages of regulations related to the law. The secretary of Health and \nHuman Services will have the power to make more than 1,700 rulings \naffecting Americans and the health care they seek. Time and time again, \nmy colleagues and I have warned that adding more red tape and \nbureaucratic oversight that will affect the relationship between you \nand your doctor is not the prescription Americans are looking for.\n  We want to protect the relationship between the patient and \nphysician. Consultation between the patient and the physician should be \nthe determining factor in what procedures that patient chooses, not \nsomeone who sits on a panel in Washington, DC.\n\n  However, this may well be the case as the health care law \nconcentrates power in the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This is \nthe same task force that in November 2009 recommended that women \nbetween the ages of 40 and 49 no longer obtain annual mammograms. These \nare the types of recommendations that Washington bureaucrats could make \nin the future. I especially understand the importance of early \ndetection of cancer, having been there myself, and will fight to see \nthat individuals, through the recommendations of their doctors, are in \ncharge of determining their own health care procedures.\n  Throughout the debate 2 years ago we constantly heard from folks on \nthe other side of the aisle that if you liked your health care \ncoverage, you could keep it. Well, guess what. According to the latest \nCBO estimates, you can ask 5 million people who will see their \nemployer-sponsored health care end in 2016 whether they had the \nopportunity to keep what they like.\n  Further, the incentives for employers to drop their coverage and move \nemployees onto a taxpayer-subsidized plan means we could see up to 35 \nmillion Americans lose their current coverage over the first 10 years \nof implementation of this law.\n  Washington is now in the business of reducing the flexibility of \nconsumer-driven health care policies such as health savings accounts \nand flexible spending arrangements. Congress created health savings \naccounts to allow health care consumers who wish to participate in the \nprogram more control over their own money and how they choose to spend \nthat money for health care services. Now contributions to these \narrangements will be limited to $2,500 per year, and over-the-counter \nmedications will require a prescription if they are purchased within \nthese tax-free dollars. This is already leading to doctors having to \nfill out more paperwork so an individual can walk into a drugstore to \npurchase aspirin or cold medicine. Yet again this is another glaring \nexample of bureaucratic meddling in the lives of American consumers.\n  Small businesses are also feeling the intrusive effects of ObamaCare. \nIn the most recent survey of small businesses by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, an astounding 74 percent of small business owners surveyed \nsaid the health care law makes it harder for businesses to hire more \nemployees. Think about that for a moment. Three out of four small \nbusiness owners are having difficulty hiring because of the uncertainty \nof health care costs.\n  Finally, our States are also feeling the heavy hand of more \ngovernment control. The Medicaid expansion that begins in 2014 will \nmake it increasingly difficult for State leaders to balance their \nbudgets due to strict maintenance of effort requirements. These \nrequirements prevent States from designing health care programs \nspecifically tailored for their own citizens.\n  Medicaid currently consumes about one-quarter of State budgets and \nObamaCare creates the largest expansion of the program since its \ninception.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\nThrough 2023, the cost to States is now estimated to be an additional \n$118 billion. In my home State of Georgia, the expansion will cost the \nState about $2.5 billion through 2020. Money in the budget to pay for \nthis expansion will come at the expense of higher education, \ntransportation, and law enforcement services. Nationally 24.7 million \npeople who will be added to the Medicaid rolls will be entering a \nbroken system where patients are denied access to about 40 percent of \nthe physicians because reimbursement rates do not keep up with medical \ncosts.\n  Two years ago the legislative process that unfolded before us was not \nsomething any Senator should be proud of today. Backroom deal making \nand forcing legislation through under a subversive process left the \nAmerican people angry and upset with Congress. If we don't understand \nthat, just look at the approval rating of Congress today, and this \nplayed a major role in that approval rating.\n  I hope in the future we will have an opportunity to revisit the \nsystem. Our system does need reforming, but it needs to be done in the \nright way and it needs to be done in a very transparent way. I hope we \ncan come up with a solution that is actually supported by the American \npublic, not solutions that make the American public angry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2223-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OBAMA/MEDVEDEV EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today greatly \ndisturbed and upset, as are many Americans, by the comments President \nObama made on Monday to outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at \nthe nuclear security summit in Seoul, Korea. The exchange, which was \naccidentally recorded by a Russian journalist, suggests that President \nObama's stance on missile defense will change after the November \nelection. It implies that the President is willing to make more \nconcessions to an authoritarian government that has caused Americans \nconcern time and time again. It raises questions about what else might \nbe hidden on the President's agenda if he secures a second term in the \nWhite House.\n  Americans can view the recording themselves as President Obama tells \nMr. Medvedev:\n\n       On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this \n     can be solved but it's important for him [Putin] to give me \n     space.\n\n  ``Him'' meaning former and future President Vladimir Putin. Mr. \nMedvedev responds by saying:\n\n       Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space. \n     Space for you.\n\n  President Obama then goes on to say:\n\n       This is my last election. After my election, I have more \n     flexibility.\n\n  It is unbelievable and chilling that President Obama would make his \nelection a factor in how he deals with an important national security \nissue that could have dangerous implications for America and its \nallies. Even the hint of compromising on our missile defense capability \nis reckless when the prospect of nuclear-armed missiles is a real \nand growing threat.\n\n  Equally alarming is the looming question lingering over what the \nPresident actually means when he says ``more flexibility.'' The \nadministration continues to press for resetting bilateral relations but \nfails to follow through on an approach that takes into consideration \nhow Russia has not made good on its promises in the past. Simply put, \nwe cannot trust the Russian Government to keep its word. We have no \nreason to believe that greater cooperation will come from giving the \nRussians what they want.\n  The question now arises: How can we trust our own President not to \nsay one thing before the election and yet do something entirely \ndifferent afterwards? Let us not forget the Russian Ambassador vetoed \ntwo United Nations Security Council resolutions supporting the Syrian \npeople, a move that prompted the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, \nSusan Rice, to say that Russia decided to stand with a dictator. \nIndeed, Russia seems comfortable standing beside a dictator.\n  In addition, Russian officials rejected the idea of tougher sanctions \nagainst Iran despite a report from the International Atomic Energy \nAgency reinforcing concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Russia also \nvoted against the United Nation's General Assembly resolution \nexpressing concern over the ``violations of civil, political, economic, \nsocial and cultural rights'' in North Korea.\n  Many of my colleagues and I have come to the floor on multiple \noccasions to express our concern with Russia's deteriorating rule of \nlaw and respect for human rights. This is not the kind of relationship \nPresident Obama promised when he pressed for passage of the new START \ntreaty in late 2010 over strong objections from many of my colleagues. \nIt sends the wrong signal to our allies throughout Europe who are \nworried about undue pressure from Russia. At the end of the day, better \nU.S.-Russian relations are not a foregone conclusion, and President \nObama would be wise to remember that one-sided promises are not the \nmeans to get there. He should also not forget that the Constitution \nrequires the advice and consent of the Senate on foreign policy \ndecisions.\n  Over the coming months the Senate will likely take up several issues \nrelated to Russia, and I look forward to having a frank discussion \nabout the President's ideas and the President's intentions. Mr. Obama's \ncomments in Seoul are only one instance of the President pledging to \nhave more flexibility after election day, but they rightly cause us to \nspeculate about what else he expects to do. Americans are right to \nwonder what other promises are being made that we do not know about.\n  At the end of the exchange in Seoul, President Obama and President \nMedvedev clasped hands and Mr. Medvedev promised, ``I will transmit \nthis information to Vladimir.'' In other words, but for the accident of \nan open microphone, the President's intentions would have been known by \nMr. Putin, but not known by the American people. Mr. Medvedev's reply \nis a grim reminder of what happens when one person is able to seize \nunrestrained power, as Mr. Putin has demonstrated, and should be a \nlesson for all of us. It also should give all Americans pause as we \napproach this fall's election.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in the last few years, we have seen \ndictator after dictator tumble across the world: Qadhafi in Libya, Ben \nAli in Tunisia, Mubarak in Egypt, Saleh in Yemen, and eventually Bashar \nal-Assad in Syria.\n  Yet there is one dictator who hangs on. He is the last dictator in \nEurope. You may not be familiar with his name, but they certainly know \nhim in neighboring countries. He is the strong-man President of \nBelarus, Alexander Lukashenko.\n  For more than 20 years, he has ruled Belarus with an iron fist--using \na barbaric combination of repression, intimidation, and torture to \nmaintain power. He is so bold as to continue to call his security \nservices the KGB. Can you imagine in today's world calling your \nsecurity service the same name as the dread security service of the \nSoviet Union, the KGB?\n  Under Lukashenko's reign, elections have been consistently rigged, \narrests have been made for political purposes, and the public's basic \nfreedoms of speech, assembly, association, even religion--which we take \nfor granted--are severely restricted.\n  As shown in this photograph I have in the Chamber, this is Alexander \nLukashenko, the last dictator in Europe, the President of Belarus.\n  On December 19, 2010, Lukashenko was given an opportunity to ease the \niron grip of his police state and move closer to democracy by holding a \nlegitimate Presidential election. He could not bring himself to do it. \nHe orchestrated a fraudulent election, and then he turned around on the \nday of the election and arrested all of his opponents who had the \naudacity to run against him and threw them in prison. How about that?\n  I was in Belarus shortly afterwards and met with their families. \nThese people were distraught, beside themselves about what had \nhappened.\n  One of these detainees who was eventually released came and saw me in \nNovember, Ales Mikhalevich, one of the Presidential candidates who had \nbeen arrested, tortured, and denied basic legal rights for months. \nRecently he had been given political asylum in the Czech Republic, \nwhere he continues to fight for human rights in Belarus. His wife and \ndaughters, whom I met in Minsk, in Belarus, are still being harassed by \nthe KGB as of today.\n  Ales Mikhalevich and others from the hundreds who were imprisoned \nhave been released, but others were not so lucky.\n  Mikalai Statkevich, a Presidential candidate, was sentenced to 6 \nyears and can barely receive the medical assistance he needs.\n  Andrei Sannikau, another Presidential candidate, was sentenced to 5 \nyears in prison for having the boldness to run against this dictator.\n  A number of other political activists who have engaged in political \nactivity which we take for granted in the United States have been \nlanguishing in prison. I thought about it this week, as the \ndemonstrators gathered in front of the Supreme Court, marching back and \nforth with signs, how we take that for granted. You try to do that in a \ncountry like Belarus, you will end up in prison. Thank God the United \nStates has a much better standard when it comes to basic rights.\n  Here are the names of some of the other activists Lukashenko has \nthrown in prison: Zmitser Dashkevich, Eduard Lobau, Paval Sevyarynets, \nZmister Bandarenka, Ales Byalyatski, Mikalai Autukhovich.\n  Authoritarians frequently torture these activists, trying to pressure \nthem to sign letters admitting a guilt that does not exist. But I want \nto speak about something that is going to come up where Belarus and \nLukashenko are going to become international celebrities.\n  On February 16, Mikhalevich, whom I mentioned earlier, was one of the \n13 who picketed the headquarters of Praugue-based automobile company \nSkoda, a subsidaiary of Volkswagen.\n  Why did they picket Skoda?\n  Skoda is one of the major sponsors of the International Ice Hockey \nFederation's World Championship, and has been for the last 19 years. In \nfact, Skoda's this automobile company's--relationship with the Hockey \nFederation is one of the longest lasting sponsorships. And much to the \ndisbelief of the rest of the world, the International Ice Hockey \nFederation has chosen to host its championship in Belarus. Why? Because \nLukashenko, the dictator, is such a big fan of hockey. All the while, \npolitical prisoners, including Presidential candidates, will be \nlanguishing in prison because of this dictator.\n  Companies such as Skoda, Nike, and Reebok are among the major \ncorporate sponsors of this federation that is holding its championship \nin Belarus.\n  Last year, I joined Congressman Mike Quigley of Chicago and National \nHockey League Hall of Famer turned European Parliamentarian Peter \nStastny and wrote to the International Ice Hockey Federation President \nRene Fasel, urging that the 2014 games in Belarus be suspended until \nthe political prisoners are released. How can anyone celebrate the \nexcitement of a world-class sports championship when people are \nlanguishing in prison for their political beliefs? They ignored our \nrequest.\n  I spoke to USA Hockey, which represents the United States in this \nfederation. They paid no attention.\n  It turns out the International Ice Hockey Federation will be meeting \nnext month in Finland. Belarus is likely to be on the agenda. It should \nbe. It should be at the top of the agenda.\n  The honor of hosting this prestigious international sporting event in \na country where the President is regarded as Europe's last dictator is \nhardly a reflection of the quality of the sport that is involved.\n  An ardent fan of ice hockey and the head of the Belarus national \nOlympic committee, rewarding Lukashenko with the 2014 World Ice Hockey \nChampionship ignores his regime's atrocities.\n  I have tried to reach out to Skoda, owned by Volkswagen, Nike, \nReebok, and other sponsors to let them know their image is at stake too \nif they validate this dictator's policies and give honor to a country \nwhich does not recognize the basic freedoms.\n  This photograph I have in the Chamber shows Skoda's CEO, Winfried \nVahland, in the center, along with Hockey Federation President Fasel on \nthe right, as they celebrate Skoda's commitment to sponsor the world \nchampionship through 2017.\n  Skoda contends its sponsorship of the event does not indicate \napproval of what is going on in Belarus--simply their dedication to \nhockey. That does not show much courage.\n  Lukashenko's preparations for this ice hockey tournament indicate \nthat Belarus is expecting a lot of visitors and a big economic boost.\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\n  I am once again calling on the International Ice Hockey Federation in \ntheir meeting in Finland to consider this matter at the top of their \nagenda and to suspend their plans to hold the Federation Championship \nin Belarus in 2014.\n  There are many other countries around the world more than anxious to \njoin them and make this a championship well deserving with a host \ncountry that is one we can be proud of.\n  My feelings about this are not alone. The European Union recently \nwidened sanctions against Lukashenko and his cronies. Lukashenko \npromptly recalled his Belarusian representative to the EU, after which \nEU Ambassadors were withdrawn from Belarus.\n  After a summit in Brussels earlier this month, Lukashenko--never at a \nloss for words--criticized the European Union politicians and railed on \nthe German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, the first openly gay \nminister in Germany. President Lukashenko said:\n\n       It is better to be a dictator than gay.\n\n  That is a quote. He went on to say:\n\n       Belarusians deserve to host the World Championship in 2014 \n     in Belarus.\n\n  That is incredible. What sports organization wants to validate those \ncomments?\n  I want to close by saying, I hope the International Ice Hockey \nFederation's Annual Congress will make the right decision in May. I \nhope its corporate sponsors will feel a little uneasy being associated \nwith Dictator Lukashenko and his policies in Belarus. I hope they will \nsuspend the 2014 Championship unless the political prisoners are at \nleast released and that other international sporting groups, such as \nthe International Cycling Union, follow their example.\n  I want the United States, in partnership with the European Union, to \ncontinue to place pressure on Lukashenko to open his political system \nand to stand by the Belarusian people in their efforts to bring justice \nto their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2225-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUDGE WILLIAM HIBBLER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to pay tribute to a great man and a great judge \nwho passed away unexpectedly earlier this month. Judge William Hibbler \nhad served with distinction as a Federal district court judge in the \nNorthern District of Illinois since 1999. Bill Hibbler cared so deeply \nabout Chicago that it sometimes surprised people to learn that he \nactually started life in a small town in Alabama.\n  His family moved to Chicago when he was a child. He graduated from \nSt. Mel High School on the West Side and later from the University of \nIllinois at Chicago. He worked as a substitute teacher in the Chicago \npublic school system to help pay his tuition at DePaul University \nSchool of Law. He started his legal career in private practice but soon \nfelt the call of public service so he went to work as an assistant \nState's attorney in Cook County.\n  In 1986, he became an associate judge of the Cook County Circuit \nCourt, and he served in that capacity for 13 years, until he joined the \nFederal bench. Judge Hibbler was active in community service throughout \nhis career. He was a mentor to many young people.\n  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I noted that some judges have an unfortunate tendency to \nlook down on the people who come before them once they put on the \njudges' black robes, and I asked Judge Hibbler what type of temperament \nhe would bring to the Federal bench. His answer said so much about the \nkind of man Bill Hibbler was and about his values. He said, ``The \nopportunity to serve is a wonderful opportunity, and we should never \nforget that.''\n  Judge Hibbbler died on March 19. He was 65 years old. The esteem in \nwhich he was held is evident in comments by other judges and by lawyers \nwho appeared before him.\n  Chief Judge Jim Holderman of the Northern District praised Judge \nHibbler as ``an outstanding jurist who cared deeply about our system of \njustice and displayed an unparalleled sense of fairness.'' Thomas \nBruton, clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois, said: ``Judge Hibbler was a friend to everyone who met him. \nHe was gracious, kind and a mentor to many in this court.''\n  U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said, ``He was a wonderful judge and \nwonderful person, who treated everyone who appeared before him with \ngreat respect.'' His friend, 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Anne \nClaire Williams, said that Judge Hibbler ``wasn't what you would call a \nman of many words, but each day, in his own quiet way, he made a \ndifference in the world.''\n  I am proud to have joined then-Senator Carol Moseley-Braun in urging \nPresident Clinton to nominate Judge Hibbler to the Federal bench 13 \nyears ago. His many years of distinguished service on the Federal bench \nonly deepened my respect for him. William Hibbler loved the law, and he \nloved justice. He also loved his family very deeply, and I wish to \noffer my sincere condolences to his wife Regina, his son William, and \nhis daughter Aviv. We are grateful for the service that their husband \nand father provided to the Chicago community, and we will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2225-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2225-S2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. LEONARD GILLIAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a true \nAmerican hero who honorably answered the call to serve his country in \nits dire time of need, Mr. Leonard Gilliam of Laurel County, KY.\n  Mr. Gilliam was born in McWhorter, KY, in 1919. The 92-year-old has \nhad an incredible life on this Earth thus far. Leonard was a country \nboy who had lived on his family farm his entire life. He was the first \nboy from McWhorter to get the call from the U.S. Army in 1941; he was \n21 years old.\n  The newly enlisted men, along with Gilliam, headed to basic training \nin Fort Thomas, KY. Gilliam was trained in artillery; during training \nhe learned how to man a tank gun. After training ended he was \ntransferred to Fort Benning, GA, where he would reside until December \nof 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor led to the declaration of war, \nwhich for Gilliam would mean being deployed to the front.\n  The young Leonard Gilliam knew that going to war would be difficult, \nand his bringing up had prepared him to face the difficult road ahead. \nHe had spent his childhood working on the farm and walking through \nfields and creeks, to and from the Twin Branch School, every day. But \nwhat the eager Gilliam did not foresee was the opportunities he would \nbe presented with during his time in the service. A chance to see the \nworld and forge a lifelong friendship were not in the then 21-year-\nold's plans back then.\n  His much needed experience with tanks landed him a spot on the front \nlines, and Gilliam entered the war in Casablanca, North Africa. He \ntraveled through Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia before heading towards \nEurope. Gilliam was called to invade the island of Sicily on July 10, \n1942. He was later awarded the Bronze Arrowhead for his courageous \nactions during the invasion.\n  Gilliam spent time in Sicily guarding POWs. He remembers eating with \nthem, talking with them, and even giving them cigarettes. Looking back, \nhe says that the prisoners were some of the finest people he has ever \nmet. He stayed at the prison in Sicily until he was called to go to \nNormandy. He arrived in France a mere 4 days after the invasion of the \nbeach on June 6, 1944.\n  The hardships experienced by Gilliam in France were some of the \ntoughest times of the war for him. But in the midst of a dark shadow \ncast by war, Gilliam met Vayne McCoy, a fellow tank gunner who would \nsoon become his best friend. The two friends helped each other see the \nend of the war, and then they lost track of each other once they had \nreturned back to the States. It wasn't until 1997--53 years later--when \nthe two would reunite. The two war buddies shared a deep bond, one that \nthey continue to share to this day.\n  The veteran now recalls the warm welcome he received when he finally \nmade his return trip home in 1945 after 3 years overseas. Mr. Gilliam \nis a modest man. He feels like he is undeserving of the hero's welcome \nhe received after World War II. He believes that the real heroes were \nthe ones that ``stayed over there,'' the ones who made the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country and never got the chance to come home.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  The former soldier now enjoys life as a full-time family man. He is a \nhusband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Leonard is a \nremarkable man who has been on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Even \nafter all that he has been through, both the good and the bad, he is \nstill grateful he had opportunity. Although he says he wouldn't go on a \ntrip around the world again for $1 million, he doesn't regret getting \nto see the world for free the first time.\n  In November 2011, there was an article about Mr. Leonard Gilliam \npublished in the Sentinel Echo Silver Edition, a magazine based in \nLaurel County, KY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                 World War II: A Trip Around the World\n\n                          (By Carrie Dillard)\n\n       Leonard Gilliam remembers the days when he and his family \n     ``didn't have a cable bill, water bill or electric bill.'' \n     The 92-year-old Laurel County native has lived on his family \n     farm his whole life.\n       He was born in 1919 in McWhorter. It was a time when, he \n     said, ``everybody used a mule pair, everybody had a milk cow \n     and some beef cattle, and everybody had their own hogs.''\n       You worked hard, he said. Kept your house warm buying coal \n     for $1 a ton at the mines or a jug of kerosene for 10 cents a \n     gallon. You cooked on a wood stove, and there were always \n     chores to do.\n       He had to ``go through the field and cross the creek \n     twice'' on his walk to Twin Branch School each day, so when \n     he joined the U.S. Army in 1941, he was used to walking.\n       During the course of his military career, Gilliam would \n     spend approximately three years overseas, engage in six major \n     battles and one invasion. He would end his days in World War \n     II in Berlin, Germany, during the Army occupation in July \n     1945.\n       Gilliam was drafted. ``They didn't draft until (age) 21 in \n     those days,'' he said. He was the first one in the McWhorter \n     community who got the call.\n       ``There was a busload of us left London early one \n     morning,'' he said, on their way to Fort Thomas, Kentucky. In \n     less than two days, a contingent from all across the state \n     filled a train headed to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for \n     basic training.\n       Gilliam was trained in artillery. He would later man the \n     tank gun, causing him to lose nearly all of his hearing.\n       He served in the 2nd Armored Division (Hells on Wheels) \n     under division commander George S. Patton, who once said the \n     2nd Armored Division ``could do the impossible'' because he \n     trained them.\n       Gilliam was at Fort Benning, Georgia, when the Japanese \n     attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n       ``They put more guards out, more security,'' he said, ``as \n     war was declared.'' Gilliam and his division began more \n     practices and maneuvers, traveling back and forth from \n     Georgia and North Carolina, until his deployment overseas. In \n     total, Gilliam would serve six six-month tours overseas.\n       As a gunner, he said ``the tanks were needed on the front'' \n     as soon as they arrived in Casablanca, North Africa. They \n     traveled to Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and on July 10, \n     they invaded the island of Sicily, for which Gilliam was \n     awarded a Bronze Arrowhead.\n       ``Sicily was an interesting place,'' Gilliam said. It was \n     there he worked as a security officer at an old penitentiary, \n     guarding POWs.\n       ``I had a gun and they didn't, but they didn't give me any \n     trouble,'' he said.\n       In fact, he said, once they got acquainted, the POWs were \n     ``some of the finest people I met.''\n       He said he'd put his gun up and sit down to eat with the \n     prisoners. They ate the same rations--MREs (meal, ready to \n     eat) just as the soldiers did, and were even given \n     cigarettes.\n       Gilliam said he and his fellow soldiers were put on a boat \n     in Sicily and weren't told where they were headed.\n       ``It looked like we was going to the United States,'' he \n     said, ``but we was going toward England.''\n       They were on the water at Thanksgiving, and, shortly \n     thereafter, landed in Liverpool.\n       The invasion of Normandy took place on June 6, 1944. \n     Gilliam arrived just four days later.\n       Although he describes it as some of the roughest times in \n     the war, it is also where he met a good friend: Vayne McCoy.\n       McCoy was five years younger than Gilliam, and took to him \n     like a younger brother. Both Gilliam and McCoy were on tanks. \n     Gilliam's was called ``Crimson Tide,'' McCoy's ``Churchill.''\n       The two lost track of one another after the war, but \n     reunited in 1997, more than 50 years later. Today, they ``get \n     together pretty often,'' Gilliam said, their families \n     becoming like family to each other.\n       Gilliam said the Germans were smart, and without the \n     combined effort of the U.S. Army and Air Force, they would \n     not have succeeded in driving them back.\n       In September 1944, Gilliam crossed the Belgium border, but \n     it wasn't an easy trek. He said it rained the whole way there \n     and turned to snow; it was the coldest winter he'd ever felt.\n       The Battle of the Bulge was upon them. Standing in knee-\n     deep snow, Gilliam said he and his fellow soldiers would fire \n     their guns and huddle around the tank to keep warm. He was \n     nearly overcome by the exhaust fumes from the machine just \n     trying to get warm. Gilliam suffers from the effects of \n     frostbite to this day.\n       For a time, Gilliam and his company stayed in a local \n     farmer's barn. The owners, he said, knew of their presence, \n     and he said the owners were overjoyed to help.\n       Without the protection of that barn, they likely ``would \n     have frozen to death.'' Gilliam said the group held up in \n     that barn, sleeping in the hayloft, for three weeks until \n     temperatures got warmer.\n       Gilliam said he remembers the faces of young children as \n     they made the journey across France, Belgium, and Holland.\n       ``The children were standing and waving at us. If we halted \n     for some reason, they'd climb the tanks and hug everybody.\n       ``The look on those little children's faces, you was glad \n     to have done that for them,'' he said.\n       In April 1945, Gilliam said his outfit met the Russians on \n     the Elbe River.\n       ``For me, the war ended. I didn't fire another shot.''\n       Gilliam said soldiers returning from World War II got a \n     hero's welcome, but veterans of other wars, like the Korean \n     War or Vietnam, did not receive the same respect. ``Soldiers \n     of the Korean War didn't get that welcome when they came \n     home,'' he said. ``They could've used a welcome home, too.'' \n     But Gilliam has never considered himself a hero. Those are \n     the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice, he said. In 238 \n     days of battle, the 2nd Armored Division suffered 7,348 \n     casualties, including 1,160 killed in action.\n       ``The heroes didn't come back. They're still there.''\n       His older brother, Blane, was among them. Blane Gilliam, an \n     Army radio operator who was serving in the Pacific, was \n     killed in action/missing in action at age 30. Gilliam \n     received word of his death around the time he reached \n     Germany.\n       Following the war, Gilliam returned home and married Wilma \n     George, who was 11 years his junior.\n       ``Here I was a 25-year-old man, been around the world on a \n     killing spree,'' he said. They were married for 61 years and \n     had three children--Wanda, Coy and Linda. Today, Gilliam has \n     three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is a \n     member of Twin Branch Methodist Church.\n       ``I wouldn't make that trip (again) for one million \n     dollars,'' he said. ``But I got to see the world (for \n     free).''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2226-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2226-S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in light of last week's \ncelebration here in the Senate, to recognize the truly historic and \nremarkable accomplishment of my good friend and colleague, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  As we all know, Senator Mikulski just last week achieved another \nstunning milestone as she became the longest-serving woman in the \nhistory of the United States Congress, surpassing Congresswoman Edith \nNourse Rogers. Of course, it was at the outset of this 112th Congress \nthat Senator Mikulski overtook Maine's legendary Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith. To say it's been quite a Congress for the Gentle Lady from \nMaryland is the height of understatement indeed.\n  In the process of paying tribute to Senator Mikulski, I discovered \nsome interesting information, namely that three out of the four longest \nserving women in the Congress were actually born in Maine--\nCongresswoman Rogers, Senator Smith, and myself as third longest \nserving woman in both the Senate and the House.\n  Senator Smith of course served Maine and Congresswoman Rogers \nrepresented the 5th District of Massachusetts. Both were Republicans, \nand both were born in Maine. And so, let me just say, as one who is \nprivileged enough to fall into the same categories, on behalf of the \ngreat State of Maine which appears to produce women of tremendous \nendurance at both ends of the U.S. Capitol, we could not be more proud \nof the Senator from Maryland.\n  But the commonalities don't end there--far from it. In addition to \nthe overlapping biographical information I just referenced, it is a \npoint of tremendous pride that all three of us also placed the highest \nof premiums on serving those who have served our Nation by giving every \nfiber of their being to protect, defend, and secure our cherished \nfreedoms--our courageous men and women in uniform and our veterans.\n  Born in Saco, ME, Edith Nourse Rogers authored legislation that made \nher\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\none of the great champions of our men and women in the military as well \nas our Nation's veterans. As a Member of Congress, Edith Rogers \ndisplayed a work ethic worthy of her Maine roots and was known as ``the \nbusiest woman on Capitol Hill.''\n  During her storied 35-year career spanning from 1925 to 1960--still \nthe longest tenure of any woman in the history of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Congresswoman Rogers counts among her long-lasting \nachievements the securing of $15 million to develop a national network \nof veterans' hospitals in the Veterans' Administration Act, the \ncreation of both the Women's Army Corp and the landmark GI Bill of \nRights.\n  She also proposed the establishment of a Cabinet-level Department of \nVeterans Affairs immediately after World War II an achievement that \nwould finally take place in 1989. She was held in such high esteem by \nour veterans that the American Legion presented her with the \nDistinguished Service Cross--the first woman ever to receive that \nprestigious honor.\n  The incredible inroads and contributions that Edith Rogers made on \nbehalf of our military, Senator Smith mirrored in the Senate. And just \nas an aside, I think it is worth noting that both shared a floral \ntrademark, demonstrating that they could legislate in what was then \nvery much a man's world without sacrificing their femininity or grace. \nRepresentative Edith Rogers wore an orchid or gardenia, and Senator \nSmith would don her signature rose.\n  A lifelong native of Skowhegan, Maine, Senator Smith was also a \ntrailblazer and a woman of phenomenal firsts--the first woman to be \nelected in her own right to the United States Senate; the first woman \nto serve on the Armed Services Committee; the first woman to serve on \nthe Appropriations Committee; the first woman to have her name placed \nin nomination for the Presidency by either major political party, in \n1964; the first civilian woman to sail on a United States destroyer in \nwartime; the first woman to break the sound barrier in a U.S. Air Force \nF 100 Super Sabre Fighter--at 800 miles per hour, I might add.\n  In fact, that reminds me of the time in 1992 when Senator Nancy \nKassebaum came to visit me in Maine, and we traveled together to see \nSenator Smith at her home and library. Senator Smith gave us a \nwonderful tour--despite her failing health at the time, and I recall \nasking her about a bright orange suit I saw that was hanging on one of \nthe walls. And she replied that it was her flight suit from the time \nshe broke the sound barrier. She then told me about how she had \ninitially questioned the less than flattering color tone until she \nlearned that the bright orange would help them find her if she had to \neject! But for all of her courage, fearlessness, and monumental \nleadership, one of Senator Smith's indelible achievements was \nshepherding the historic Women's Armed Services Integration Act.\n  Mr. President, I am forever humbled by the shoulders I have been so \nproud to stand upon. As I recall the milestones of both Congresswoman \nRogers and Senator Smith, especially for our veterans and armed forces, \nI cannot help but think of how they paved the way for my service as the \nonly Republican woman Senator on the Personnel Subcommittee of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, battling as I was at the time in the \nlate 1990s for the fair and equitable treatment of women in the \nservices, including assurances that men and women would train as they \nfight--side-by-side!\n  For all of their joint accolades, neither Senator Smith nor \nCongresswoman Rogers set out to forge news paths for women in politics. \nIn fact, upon winning her first election to the House, Congresswoman \nRogers declared, ``I hope that everyone will forget that I am a woman \nas soon as possible.'' What we remember about these amazing women, born \nin Maine, is their great integrity, love of country, and a desire to \nserve. No wonder they have inspired legions of women, myself included.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor \nSenator Barbara Mikulski for recently becoming the longest serving \nwoman in the history of the United States Congress. However, in doing \nso, I am reminded that this milestone does not define her legacy. \nRather, her legacy as a coalition builder and a tenacious advocate of \nthe marginalized defines Senator Mikulski's tenure as a public servant \nfor the people of Maryland.\n  Throughout her career, Senator Mikulski pioneered the role women play \nin today's Congress. When she joined the Senate in 1987, Senator \nMikulski became one of two female Senators and the first Democratic \nwoman ever to join the upper chamber. These achievements were not due \nto a famous husband or father; Senator Mikulski was elected because of \nher integrity and her fiery and compassionate character. Her personal \nand professional experiences over the past 35 years make Senator \nMikulski an excellent mentor for first-term female members, leading to \nthe appropriate title: ``Dean of Women.'' I was recently reminded of \n``the Dean's'' ability to rally the support of female colleagues as \nSenator Mikulski and seven of 17 female senators lent their support for \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act on the floor of \nthe Senate. Her efforts are emblematic of a unique ability to \norchestrate voices in defense of the voiceless.\n  Just as the Violence Against Women Act provides support to both male \nand female victims of domestic abuse, Senator Mikulski's legacy as a \nchampion of the exploited transcends the concept of gender. From her \nroots as a social worker and community organizer, Senator Mikulski has \nconstantly stood for social justice. She was a driving force in the \nlandmark Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which furthered \nprotections for women and others faced with discrimination in the \nworkplace. Equal pay for equal work is a principle that Senator \nMikulski will continue to defend. From the young lady who delivered \ngroceries to seniors, to a passionate defender of the ethnic American, \nSenator Mikulski continues to stand in solidarity with those forced to \nlive in the margins.\n  I have been proud to serve in the Senate with Senator Mikulski for \nover two decades, and I have enjoyed working with her on many issues, \nin addition to our time serving together on the Subcommittee on the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations for many years. Perhaps most \nmemorable is a CODEL we took to sub-Saharan Africa in 1990.\n  While my colleagues and I applaud Senator Mikulski on the longevity \nof her career, we more importantly take this moment to celebrate the \nleadership and achievements that characterize her 35 years of service. \nHow long she has served bears witness to how well she has represented \nthe people of Maryland.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is now the longest serving \nwoman in the history of the Congress and congratulate her on reaching \nthis important milestone. Senator Mikulski is an inspiration to us all. \nShe had broken down not only multiple gender barriers, but legislative, \neconomic and societal barriers as well.\n  Throughout her career, Senator Mikulski has been a champion for those \nwho are often forgotten. Hubert Humphrey once said the moral test of \ngovernment is how it treats those in the dawn of life, the twilight of \nlife and the shadows of life. Senator Mikulski took this message to \nheart. Her life has been a life of service. She spent her career as a \ntireless advocate, first as a social worker in Baltimore on the city \ncouncil and then in the House of Representatives where she served 10 \nyears before coming to the Senate. For the past 25 years she has \ncontinued this advocacy and has been a strong voice on the Senate \nfloor, as well as on the HELP Committee. I have been fortunate to serve \non the HELP Committee with Senator Mikulski since 2009.\n  One of the things Senator Mikulski is best known for is providing \ngood constituent services. This is something all Senate offices do and \nit often gets overlooked by the national and international issues of \nthe day. But this speaks to one of the most important duties of a \nSenator. When your constituent's mother dies in a country halfway \naround the world and you suddenly need a passport or a visa, when a \nveteran is not getting the benefits he is entitled to or when an older \ncitizen\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\ncannot afford to heat their home, they can turn to their Senator's \nlocal office for help. Senator Mikulski makes sure she and she her \nstaff provide help to that family or veteran or older citizen.\n  Barbara Mikulski knows, and her work demonstrates, that the job of a \nSenator is not only about numbers and budgets, it is about helping \npeople, especially the vulnerable and those without a voice or a \nlobbyist.\n  Again, I congratulate Barbara on her accomplishment and I look \nforward to working with her and continuing to fight for our children, \nour workers and our families with her in the years ahead.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President. I come to the floor today to celebrate the \nservice of Senator Barbara Mikulski, one of the most tenacious and \neffective senators to serve in the U.S. Senate. This month, following \n41 years of public service, Senator Mikulski has reached a new \nmilestone in serving in the U.S. Congress longer than any woman in \nhistory. But as she has said, ``It's not how long you serve, but how \nwell you serve.'' Both the State of Maryland and the entire Nation have \nbenefited from Senator Mikulski's stamina as well her energy, \nintellect, and compassion. Today, we can see the difference she has \nmade in our schools, health care, paychecks, and workplaces.\n  Senator Mikulski follows in the footsteps of the legendary Hattie \nCaraway of Arkansas. As the wife of Thaddeus Caraway, a former \nCongressman and U.S. Senator for Arkansas, Hattie assumed her husband's \nplace in the Senate following his death in 1931. She once said, ``The \ntime has passed when a woman should be placed in a position and kept \nthere only while someone else is being groomed for the job.'' A year \nlater, she ran for reelection, becoming the first woman elected to a 6-\nyear term. She surpassed several milestones, including serving as the \nfirst female Senator to preside over the Senate and the first woman to \nserve as the chairwoman of a committee.\n  It would take 74 more years until a woman senator chaired a \nsubcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Mikulski, \nnow at the reins of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, \nhas shown great leadership and vision as chairwoman and it has been a \nprivilege to work with her. While we share many interests, we have \nworked most closely to advance the growth of science parks, strengthen \nlaw enforcement, and ensure U.S. companies can compete in the 21st \ncentury. I look forward to a continued partnership, congratulate \nSenator Mikulski on this historic achievement, and express my deep \nappreciation for all that she has done.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to honor and extend my warmest aloha \nto my longtime colleague, a fellow member of the House freshman class \nof 1977, and very dear friend, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, for setting \na new benchmark in her career and a significant milestone in this \ninstitution: becoming the longest serving woman in the history of the \nU.S. Congress. With each of her many accomplishments, she inspires the \nnext generation of young American women, and she makes their dreams \nthat much more attainable.\n  My colleague from Maryland has been a true trailblazer for women in \nCongress. In 1987, she earned the distinction of becoming the first-\never woman U.S. Senator from Maryland, as well as the first woman \nDemocrat to serve in both the House and the Senate. Last year, she also \nbecame the longest serving female in Senate history.\n  Barbara has not only witnessed the number of females climb from just \n21 when she first came to Congress in 1977 to the 92 female members \nserving today, her actions and spirit helped to make that feat \npossible. She continues to be a distinguished leader, mentor, and \nfriend to all of her colleagues in Congress, not just the women. \nAlthough we have more work to do to eliminate gender bias and \ndiscrimination, I am glad to see that Congress has become more \nrepresentative of the United States.\n  Throughout her over 35 years in Congress, Barbara has remained a \nfearless advocate for women, working-class Americans, and Federal \nworkers across the country, a steadfast protector of the environment, \nand a relentless champion of civil rights in this country.\n  Raised by Polish-American small business owners, she has been a \nlongtime defender of labor rights and a fierce proponent of \nestablishing fair and equal working conditions for all Americans \nregardless of race, sex, or disability. This cause led her to author \nthe landmark women's and worker's rights legislation, the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, which I cosponsored, to guarantee women equal \npay for equal work.\n  Being from a State that, like Maryland, has a large population of \nFederal workers, I have worked very closely with Barbara on many issues \nto support our government employees. From the time that we entered the \nHouse together, she has always been a strong partner and stalwart \nchampion for the rights of our Nation's Federal workforce, including \nfair pay and benefits for the dedicated men and women who make our \ngovernment more secure, effective, and efficient.\n  Barbara is an embodiment of the democratic spirit and continues to be \na leader. She uses her great wit, humor, and boundless energy to urge \nCongress to take up important issues and then works with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to resolve differences and come together to \nachieve real solutions that help real working Americans every day. This \nis a testament to the fact that as she became the longest serving woman \nin the history of Congress, she has never forgotten her purpose--to \nmake America better.\n  I again want to extend my aloha and my congratulations to Senator \nBarbara Mikulski for this amazing achievement. It is a pleasure to \nserve with you. Thank you for your many years of outstanding service \nand genuine friendship, and I wish you the best as you continue your \nimportant work here in Congress.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague and \nmentor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and to celebrate her legacy as the \nlongest serving woman in Congress. For over 35 years, Senator Mikulski \nhas proudly served the people of Maryland as a tireless advocate and a \nselfless public servant. It is my privilege to honor her today.\n  The great-granddaughter of Polish immigrants, Senator Mikulski grew \nup appreciating the value of hard work and service. On the weekends she \nworked in her parents' East Baltimore grocery store delivering \ngroceries to homebound elderly. It was then that Barbara developed her \ndeep passion for helping others.\n  After earning her master's degree in social work from the University \nof Maryland, Barbara started a career as a social worker with Catholic \nCharities and Baltimore's Department of Social Services. An outspoken \nadvocate for at-risk youth and the elderly, she quickly earned a \nreputation as a fighter and was elected to the Baltimore City Council \nin 1971. After 5 years on the city council, Barbara ran for Congress.\n  In 1976, Barbara began her first term representing Maryland's Third \nCongressional District. As one of only 18 women in the House of \nRepresentatives, Barbara was a member of a small but mighty group. \nDuring her 10 years in the House, she gained a reputation as a fighter, \nand in 1986 the people of Maryland again chose her to represent them \nbut this time in the Senate.\n  As one of only two female Senators, and the first woman elected to \nthe Senate in her own right, Senator Mikulski was met with much \nskepticism. While outnumbered, Barbara's determination and dedication \nto her constituents shined through. Barbara is a steadfast proponent of \ngreater access to higher education, a leader on the front of women's \nhealth, and an unwavering supporter of America's veterans. She is \ndetermined to stand up for those who are often forgotten.\n  A few weeks ago, Barbara shared a touching story that I think \nexemplifies her character.\n  When Barbara first ran for Senate in 1986, she had the opportunity to \nget to know Harriet Woods, who was campaigning as a Democrat for the \nMissouri Senate seat. Barbara saw the significance of having two female \ncandidates for Senate, and she was certain both of them would win. \nUnfortunately, it wasn't meant to be for Harriet Woods, who lost to \nRepublican John Danforth.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n  On Barbara's first day she was shown her desk on the Senate floor--\nshe opened it and saw Harry Truman's autograph. She had Harry Truman's \ndesk. While she was delighted to have that desk, she knew that it \nreally belonged to the Senator from Missouri and relinquished it. She \nsaid that for years she thought about that desk and hoped that it would \nsomeday be returned to a Democrat from Missouri.\n  Twenty years later, on election night in 2006, Barbara watched the \nelection results come in from around the country--and in Missouri, in \nparticular. She said she stayed up late in the night waiting for the \nfinal result. Once she learned of the results from Missouri, she knew \nthat the desk that had been accidentally given to her all of those \nyears ago would finally be returned, where it belonged. I am so pleased \nto know that the Truman desk was shared, if only briefly, with my \nfriend Barbara Mikulski.\n  Barbara Mikulski is a trailblazer, a role model, and an advisor to \nthe other women in the Senate. Today there are 17 women in the Senate, \nand much of that progress can be attributed to Senator Mikulski's \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating \nSenator Mikulski on this milestone and thank her for her 35 years of \nleadership, friendship, and service.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I would like to honor Senator Barbara \nMikulski's amazing life and career as she becomes the Senate's longest \nserving woman Senator. She has been a role model and inspiration to \nwomen across the country as she broke barriers in public life. When she \nfirst came to the Senate she was one of only a handful of women ever to \nserve in the U.S. Senate and now she is one of 17 women here on the \nSenate floor. Her service has made it easier for girls to dream about \none day being a Senator--or President.\n  Senator Mikulski and I shared a similar experience growing up: her \nparents, William and Christine, opened and operated Willy's Market, a \nsmall grocery store in their working class neighborhood in East \nBaltimore. My parents also opened a small grocery store in Milwaukee--\nthe first of what would become the Kohl's Food Stores and then Kohl's \nDepartment Stores.\n  As we have already heard here on the floor, her father would \nfrequently open the store early so local steel workers could buy their \nlunches before their shift began. He would also extend credit to help \ncustomers who were having a hard time making ends meet. William \nMikulski's neighbors didn't go hungry with him as their grocer. Barbara \nworked at the store, and helped deliver groceries to homebound seniors \nin their neighborhood. She got to know her neighbors well, and she \nunderstood the important issues facing her community.\n  Much of what we both experienced working in our family stores and \nwatching our parents work so hard to provide superior service to their \ncustomers, ensuring their children understood the value of hard work, \ntreating others fairly and with dignity, and giving back to the \ncommunity, influenced our views on customer service. Those views have \ntranslated into Senator Mikulski's constituent service here in the \nSenate.\n  Barbara's enthusiasm and commitment to serving the people of Maryland \nhas resulted in too many victories to mention here, but I do want to \npoint out a few of the projects we have worked on together on the \nAgriculture appropriations subcommittee.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have worked closely over the years to protect \nUSDA agriculture research in Beltsville, MD. Beltsville is a historic \nand crucial part of the USDA's research arm. In fact it is the largest \nagriculture research facility in the world and does valuable work \ndeveloping the next generation of crops and farming methods that will \nfeed a growing planet. We've also worked together on increasing funding \nfor the Food and Drug Administration, ensuring that the food we eat and \nmedicine we rely upon is safe.\n  In my work as the chairman of Agriculture Appropriations \nsubcommittee, I have been especially thankful for the times when \nBarbara has spoken passionately about the important programs we fund \nthrough the subcommittee. She has been a stalwart supporter of farmers \nthroughout Maryland and across the country, and a true friend here in \nthe Senate. It has been an honor to serve with her.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, my late friend Alex Haley, the author \nof ``Roots,'' lived his life by the motto ``Find the Good and Praise \nIt.'' That is an easy thing to do when talking about Barbara Mikulski, \na friend and colleague with whom I have worked closely since I joined \nthe Senate.\n  I would like to add my congratulations to those of my colleagues on \nSenator Mikulski reaching the milestone of becoming the longest serving \nwoman in Congress. This is a remarkable achievement for a remarkable \nwoman. For over 35 years, that is almost 13,000 days, Barbara Mikulski \nhas dedicated herself to serving the people of Maryland and \nrepresenting them here in Congress.\n  Although Senator Mikulski is a proud partisan, she is one of the best \nadvocates of bipartisanship. She understands the need to work together, \nto learn from one another's point of view, and to strike a deal so that \neach side can get something of value and move forward.\n  I have found that when you have Barbara Mikulski by your side in a \ndebate you always seem to win. She brings passion and dedication and \ntenacity to every issue she works on. Her love of the Senate, Congress \nin general, and the American people is infectious.\n  When Senator Mikulski and I have worked together it has always been a \ndelightful experience. Whether authorizing the Teach for America \nprogram to allow college graduates to become teachers in our Nation's \nworst schools; passing America COMPETES, where we improved our energy \nresearch programs and STEM education initiatives; or working on higher \neducation where we share a passion for eliminating costly and \nunnecessary Federal regulations, Barbara Mikulski is a tireless friend \nand ally.\n  Congratulations, Senator Mikulski. The Senate is proud of you, \nMaryland is proud of you, and the country is proud of you.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to offer \ncongratulations to my friend and colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \non becoming the longest serving woman Senator in American history.\n  As Senator Mikulski has said, ``It's not only how long I serve, but \nhow well I serve.'' And she has served very, very well. Not only does \nSenator Mikulski serve in the best interests of the people of her \nnative Maryland, but her service continues to improve the lives of \nAmericans from coast to coast.\n  This comes as no surprise for a person who began her career helping \nat-risk children and seniors as a social worker in Baltimore. Senator \nMikulski's nightly commute home from Washington ensures that she will \nnot forget who she works for or where she comes from. The truth is, she \nnever left.\n  Her commitment and connection to her constituents benefits us all. \nHer advocacy for access to better health care, improving the quality of \neducation, investing in innovation, and protecting human dignity are \nnot bound by the borders of Maryland. Her service benefits the people \nof Baltimore, MD, but also the people of Broken Bow, NE.\n  It is an honor to serve with Senator Mikulski. I enjoy her company, I \nrespect her strength, and I admire her commitment.\n  Congratulations to Senator Barbara Mikulski on her record-setting \nservice. We are all the better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2229-S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on H.R. 3606, the \nJumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act, which the Senate passed \non Thursday, March 22, 2012, by a vote of 73 to 26. I am particularly \npleased that H.R. 3606 included language from S. 1824, the Private \nCompany Flexibility and Growth Act, which I introduced on November 8, \n2011, with Senator Carper. We authored this important measure to update \nthe shareholder threshold after which entities must register their \nsecurities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This and other \nprovisions contained in H.R. 3606 will provide companies and small \nbanks with the flexibility to grow, which will in turn lead to economic \ngrowth and job creation.\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n  As the Commission amends its rules implementing title V of H.R. 3606, \nit is important that it be mindful of Congress's intent that the rules \nprovide clear guidance to issuers on how to comply with the new \nprovisions. For instance, section 503 of the JOBS Act requires that the \nSEC adopt safe harbor provisions that issuers can follow when \ndetermining whether holders of their securities received the securities \npursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions that were \nexempt from the registration requirements of section 5 of the \nSecurities Act of 1933.\n  The issues that we would expect the Commission to address when \nadopting the safe harbor provisions include the steps issuers can take \nto obtain comfort that securities are held by persons who received the \nsecurities pursuant to an employee compensation plan and whether the \nissuance of those securities were exempt from Securities Act \nregistration. To provide issuers appropriate comfort under the rules, \nthe Commission could adopt a safe harbor provision that allows issuers, \nabsent actual knowledge of information to the contrary, to rely on \ninformation it has about a person at the time the securities are \nissued. The Commission could also adopt a safe harbor provision that \nallows issuers to consider an issuance of securities exempt from the \nSecurities Act if it has a reasonable belief that the exemption existed \nat the time the securities were issued.\n  The definition of an ``employee compensation plan'' should be \ninterpreted broadly. For purposes of determining whether a person is an \nemployee who need not be counted when an issuer is calculating the \nnumber of holders of record under section 12(g)(1)(A) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934, the term ``employee'' would include persons who \nare current or former employees of the issuer. We would also include \nbut not limit this exemption to other persons such as surviving spouses \nor family members who inherit equity securities from the employee and \nwho need not be included in the calculation of the number of holders of \nrecord. ``Employee compensation plans'' would include but is not \nlimited to a written compensatory benefit plan or written contract as \ndefined in SEC rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933.\n  In revising rule 506 and rule 144A to remove the prohibitions on \ngeneral solicitation or general advertising, the Commission should \nconsider practice in the market for rule 144A securities and ensure \nthat offerings and sales of rule 144A securities can proceed on the \nsame basis as they do currently, including from a state blue sky \nperspective, regardless of whether there is general solicitation or \ngeneral advertising.\n  The Commission should also consider adopting similar safe harbor \nprovisions for how issuers can determine whether their investors are \naccredited for purposes of revised Exchange Act section 12(g)(1)(A) and \nwhether securities are held by persons who purchase such securities in \ncrowdfunding transactions described under new Securities Act section \n4(6), in accordance with new Exchange Act section 12(g)(5)(B). We \nbelieve these additional safe harbor protections would provide \nimportant guidance for issuers and should be strongly considered by the \nSEC.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I wish rise to speak about \njobs and the Massachusetts innovation economy.\n  In July 2010, the Kauffman Foundation noted that ``startups aren't \neverything when it comes to job growth. They're the only thing.'' In \nfact, the Kauffman Foundation found that ``without startups, there \nwould be no net job growth in the U.S. economy.'' In Massachusetts, \nwhere we have the second largest venture capital market in the country, \nventure capital helps drive our innovation technology. Massachusetts \npublic companies that were once venture-backed start-ups account for \n775,151 jobs and $190 billion in revenue in the United States.\n  However, in the current economic climate, institutional investors are \nwary of investing in ideas that carry significant entrepreneurial and \ntechnological risk. With a high risk of failure and often a lack of \ncollateral, small start-up companies cannot qualify for traditional \ncommercial loans. Alternative capital markets are therefore critical to \nthese engines of future economic prosperity. To give entrepreneurs and \nstart-ups the access to capital they need to get their businesses off \nthe ground, I introduced the Democratizing Access to Capital Act--S. \n1791--to legalize crowdfunding on November 2, 2011. Crowdfunding will \ncreate a new alternative market for capital formation by allowing every \nAmerican--regardless of income or wealth--to invest in a start-up or a \ngreat idea. And according to an economic model by Regional Economic \nModels, Inc.--REMI, crowdfunding has the potential to increase the \nnumber of start-ups by 10 percent, potentially creating hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs.\n  Recognizing that crowdfunding could provide a huge new growth engine \nfor the Massachusetts tech sector and the Internet, our brightest \neconomic frontier, I wrote to President Obama on February 3, 2012 to \nask for his help in urging the Senate to pass crowdfunding legislation. \nOn February 27, 2012, I hosted a roundtable with Massachusetts \nentrepreneurs and small businesses at Boston City Hall. And on February \n29, 2012, I called on my colleagues to work together and pass a \ncrowdfunding bill in a speech from the Senate floor.\n  At the same time, entrepreneurs from the Cambridge Innovation Center \ncreated a petition to show Congress their support for crowdfunding. \nThese entrepreneurs founded wefunder.com to rally support for \ncrowdfunding. On March 5, 2012, wefunder.com and MassChallenge, a not-\nfor-profit organization dedicated to supporting the work of \nentrepreneurs, hosted a roundtable on crowdfunding in Boston. As of \nMarch 26, 2012, 3 thousand investors pledged to invest $7.5 million \nwhen crowdfunding becomes legal.\n  On March 8, 2012, the House of Representatives passed the Jumpstart \nOur Business Startups (JOBS) Act by a vote of 390 23, which included \ncrowdfunding legislation. President Obama also issued a statement in \nsupport of the JOBS Act. Although my focus was on legalizing \ncrowdfunding, I felt that the JOBS Act bill lacked basic investor \nprotection standards that would give investors some confidence and help \nthe market grow. I worked with Senators Michael Bennet and Jeff Merkley \nto introduce a bipartisan compromise crowdfunding bill, the CROWDFUND \nAct--S. 2190, on March 13, 2012. On March 22, 2012, the Senate passed \nthe CROWDFUND Act as an amendment to the JOBS Act, which was approved \nby a vote of 73 26.\n  The CROWDFUND Act sets the framework for developing a new market in \nwhich entrepreneurs can raise capital and ordinary investors can invest \nin new ideas. To create a new marketplace for investment, the CROWDFUND \nAct creates investor protections that are designed to balance \nentrepreneurs' ease of access to capital with the need for \ntransparency.\n  In prescribing requirements for issuers, the CROWDFUND Act addresses \nthe importance of providing investors accurate information. While \nfinancial disclosures are necessary for investors to make wise \ninvestment decisions, the importance of disclosure should be balanced \nwith individuals' right to privacy. The SEC should therefore, under its \nrulemaking authority provided in Section 4A(b), clarify that \nentrepreneurs will not be asked to disclose individual personal tax \nreturns. In addition, while the bill clearly states that issuers should \nbe liable for material misrepresentations or omissions, issuers should \nnot be held liable for misstatements or omissions that were made by \nmistake. The standard of liability for issuers as described in Section \n4A(c) should be ``due diligence.'' In other words, issuers must do \ntheir ``due diligence'' to make sure that the information that they are \nproviding to potential investors is accurate. This is a widely accepted \nliability standard.\n  Although issuers may not advertise the specific terms of an offering, \nthe CROWDFUND Act ensures that issuers are allowed to generally \nadvertise their offerings through email and social media channels, as \nlong as the intermediary website remains the location for all \nofferings. Potential investors should be given enough information about \nofferings to spark their interest. To discourage fraudulent operators, \nprovide proper investor education and ``crowdvetting'' of opportunities \nby impartial third parties, issuers should not be allowed to encourage \ninvestment\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\noutside of the intermediary. In addition to facilitating communication \nbetween issuers and investors, intermediaries should allow fellow \ninvestors to endorse or provide feedback about issuers and offerings, \nprovided that these investors are not employees of the intermediary. \nInvestors' credentials should be included with their comments to aid \nthe collective wisdom of the crowd.\n  Regulated intermediaries are necessary for investor protection; \nhowever, intermediaries should not be over-regulated. Specifically, \nnone of the requirements placed on intermediaries should prevent an \nintermediary or funding portal from removing or preventing the public \ndisplay of an offering that it deems not credible. To guarantee the \nquality of offerings, intermediaries should be able to employ a \nKickstarter-like process, in which the staff of an intermediary \ndetermines which issuers are invited to present their offerings to site \nvisitors. Intermediaries should also be allowed to inform its users \nabout offerings that may interest them, provided that this is not \nexplicitly or implicitly recommending the offering to an investor. \nAlthough intermediaries must only provide offering proceeds to issuers \nonce the issuers' target offering amount is reached, intermediaries \nshould not be required to escrow proceeds.\n  To streamline the offering process, it makes sense to allow \nintermediaries to place a hold on investor credit cards until an offer \nis fully subscribed. At that time, investors' credit cards should be \ncharged and the proceeds immediately transferred to the issuer. \nIntermediaries should also be permitted to act as the holder of record \nfor offerings that they facilitate to reduce compliance complexity for \nissuers and to increase the likelihood of subsequent funding from \ninstitutional investors. Providing holder of record services will \nreduce compliance complexity for issuers and place the burden of \nmanaging crowdfunded investors on the intermediary. Without this \nmechanism, issuer capitalization tables may become unwieldy, \ndiscouraging subsequent funding from institutional investors. In \naddition, intermediaries should be allowed to take an equity stake in \nofferings. This however, does not mean that intermediaries should be \nable to choose which offerings to participate in but rather it should \nbe a standard process for any offering that the intermediary \nfacilitates. This will incentivize an intermediary to focus on issuer \nquality over quantity, providing more vetting for investors and greater \nalignment of interests. Of course, any equity stakes by the \nintermediary must be fully and meaningfully disclosed to investors. Of \ncourse, any equity stakes by the intermediary must be fully and \nmeaningfully disclosed to investors. The SEC should carefully monitor \nany developments in this area and adjust practices, including \nrestricting the ability for intermediaries to take equity positions, \nshould fraud or manipulative practices arise.\n  Although the CROWDFUND Act requires intermediaries to register with \nthe SEC and become members of a self-regulatory association, all rules, \nregulations and registration requirements should be developed with \nminimal burden and cost to the intermediaries. The SEC and any relevant \nself-regulatory association should bear in mind that these costs will \nultimately be passed through to issuers--costs should not undermine the \ngoals of crowdfunding to create low-burden alternative means of raising \ncapital. In addition, the crowdfunding community may develop its own \nself-regulatory association to specifically oversee crowdfunding \nintermediaries.\n  While preemption of State securities law is necessary for \ncrowdfunding to function, State securities regulators should play a \nrole in crowdfunding offerings. In addition to allowing limited State \nsecurities registration, State should retain its authority to take \nenforcement action with regard to any issuer or intermediary. Further, \nwhere state authority is not specifically preempted, the SEC will not \npresume preemption. State securities regulators are the first line of \ndefense against fraud and their ability to continue to combat fraud \nshould not be curtailed.\n  Finally, I urge the SEC to take seriously the statutory directive to \ncomplete within 270 days of enactment the rulemaking necessary to make \nthe law effective. Crowdfunding entrepreneurs and intermediaries are \neagerly awaiting the rules to take full advantage of crowdfunding's \npotential to unlock capital for start-ups and small businesses. Based \non my office's interactions with the SEC, I believe that the SEC is \ncommitted the success of this new market, and the rulemaking should be \neasily completed within 270 days.\n  Few entrepreneurs take a new start-up to a mature company on their \nown. New ideas need the support of investors to survive and thrive. \nInvestments power payrolls across our nation and every sector. It's the \ngrease that keeps the gears in the American economy turning. \nCrowdfunding will allow small businesses to bypass Wall Street and go \nstraight to Main Street for financing. We know that new businesses are \nthe source of all of the net job creation in the United States. This \nCROWDFUND Act provides an avenue for new growth for that crucial sector \nwith unlimited potential.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to discuss our bipartisan efforts \nto pass a crowdfunding amendment that provides needed flexibility but \nalso ensures that crowdfunding has sufficient oversight and investor \nprotections. I was proud to work with Senators Merkley and Brown in \ncrafting this bipartisan proposal. The Senate passed our amendment by a \n64 to 35 margin. The House of Representatives subsequently passed our \nlanguage when it considered the JOBS legislation earlier this week.\n  As the Securities and Exchange Commission works to implement this new \nlaw, it is my hope that it will recognize that the funding portal \nregistration process is meant to be more streamlined and less \nburdensome than traditional broker-dealer registration. Given the size \nof the investments that are likely to occur in crowdfunding, the SEC \nshould work to provide an appropriate level of oversight without making \nit cost-prohibitive to become a funding portal.\n  Funding portals should be allowed to organize and sort information \nbased on certain criteria. This will make it easier for individuals to \nfind the types of companies in which they can potentially invest. This \ntype of capability--commonly referred to as curation--should not \nconstitute investment advice or recommendations, which the law \notherwise prohibits.\n  Similarly, funding portals should be allowed to engage in due \ndiligence services. This would include providing templates and forms, \nwhich will enable issuers to comply with the underlying statute. In \ncrafting this law, it was our intent to allow funding portals to \nprovide such services.\n  We also sought to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission \nsufficient flexibility to promulgate rules to ensure individuals have \nthe necessary information and protections to make informed investment \ndecisions. It is my hope that the Commission will exercise such \ndiscretion judiciously and will not create a regulatory regime that is \ntoo cumbersome and expensive for funding portals to operate or for \nissuers to sell their securities. In preparing the law, we sought to \nfind the right balance, preserving basic investor protections while \nensuring enough entrepreneurial flexibility to help this promising \nmedium take off for the good of our economy. I am hopeful that the \nCommission will respect this balance as it moves forward to implement \nthis law.\n  Finally, we provided 270 days for the Commission to implement this \nnew law. I hope the SEC will make every effort possible to meet this \ndeadline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HOUSE BUDGET PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. President Kennedy said that ``to govern is to choose.''\n  When you put away the charts and graphs, budgets are about choices. \nThese choices impact our children's schools, business owners' bottom \nlines, and families' paychecks. And they affect how we care for our \nwounded veterans when they return home from fighting for us.\n  The House has chosen to pass the House Budget Committee chairman's \nbudget.\n  Just as it did last year, this budget makes a stark choice. It shows \nwhere the House's priorities are.\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\n  Under the House plan, millionaires would receive an average tax cut \nof at least $150,000. Meanwhile, seniors would eventually have to pay \nnearly $6,000 more for their health care. That is a big increase when \nthe average senior has a fixed income of only $25,000 a year.\n  Most Americans would agree that this doesn't pass the smell test.\n  We know we need to reduce our deficit.\n  But asking seniors to pay an additional quarter of their income for \ntheir health care while giving millionaires a six-figure tax break just \nisn't fair. It is certainly not balanced. And it is the wrong choice.\n  The House plan would also end the Medicare Program seniors know \ntoday. It would eliminate guaranteed benefits. It would charge seniors \nmore for their prescriptions. It would make them pay for the screenings \nand doctor visits they get free now.\n  The millions hurt by this plan include former members of our Armed \nForces who served for more than 20 years or were injured while on duty. \nThis budget leaves these military retirees-- and other seniors--high \nand dry.\n  It takes a lot of courage to serve a full career in the military. But \nthere is nothing courageous about cutting care for our military \nretirees. I will stand up for our military and our seniors and make \nsure they have the health care they need.\n  The House budget also increases the eligibility age for Medicare from \n65 to 67 years old. That means seniors would be forced to work later in \nlife, just to keep their health care.\n  And the House budget replaces Medicare with a voucher program.\n  Seniors would have to use these fixed-price vouchers to purchase \nprivate insurance or Medicare. But this voucher wouldn't cover seniors' \nhealth care needs.\n  Seniors would be forced to make up the difference by spending \nthousands of dollars out of their own pockets.\n  To make matters worse, under the House plan, seniors would be paying \nmore and getting less.\n  Private insurance companies would get to dictate what care seniors \ncan get--and what they can't. Private companies could say a senior \ncan't have hospice or nursing home care or they could limit hospital \nstays or prescription drug coverage.\n  The House plan would end the guaranteed benefits that Medicare \nprotects today.\n  I won't let this happen. I won't let others break our promise to \nAmerica's seniors. I won't let anyone dismantle Medicare.\n  Besides ending the Medicare seniors rely on today, the House budget \ndoes not solve our country's deficit problem. It just makes seniors and \nmiddle-class families pay more than their fair share.\n  Fortunately, this is not the only option we have to reduce our \ncountry's debt. We have another choice--the path we took with health \nreform.\n  We know our long-term deficits are in part due to health care costs. \nFor the past several decades, these costs have been growing faster than \ninflation. This makes Medicare more expensive for the government.\n  That is why health reform focused on lowering overall health care \ncosts.\n  This lowers premiums for seniors enrolled in Medicare today. And it \nhelps keep the program strong for generations to come.\n  If we hadn't passed health reform, the deficit would be more than $1 \ntrillion higher over the next two decades.\n  If we hadn't passed the affordable care act, health care spending \nwould have doubled. We passed health reform to bend the cost curve and \nslow this cost growth.\n  Last week marked the second anniversary of the health care reform \nlaw. We are already seeing results. According to CBO, over the next 10 \nyears, per-person Medicare costs will decrease by four percentage \npoints compared to the past thirty years.\n  How did we make this progress?\n  We know that when doctors and hospitals don't talk to each other, \npatients receive the same tests twice and other duplicative services. \nHealth reform improves coordination by giving providers incentives to \nwork together.\n  We know that expensive diseases can be better managed if they are \ncaught early. Health reform provides free preventive care to catch and \ntreat costly chronic conditions.\n  We know criminals try to rip off taxpayers. Health reform provides \nlaw enforcement new tools to protect Medicare and Medicaid from fraud \nand recoup taxpayer dollars.\n  We know that some of the best ideas to lower costs don't come out of \nWashington. They come from our communities. Health reform leverages \nthese good ideas by partnering with the private sector.\n  This is the path we need to continue down. We need to ensure these \ntools are successful and work to improve them. We need to build on \nthese reforms to keep saving consumers' and taxpayers' money.\n  As we look to solving our country's largest problems, we need to \nremember our priorities.\n  We need to focus on fairness. We need to remember that the choices we \nmake matter.\n  The choices we made in the affordable care act are making our health \ncare system more efficient. These choices are lowering costs for \neveryone.\n  The House plan chooses to ignore rising health care costs. It simply \nshifts risks and costs onto the backs of America's seniors.\n  That is a plan that is not right for seniors. It is not right for our \nhealth care system. And it is not right for our future. The American \npeople know which choice we should make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2232-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2232-S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this week marks the 2-year anniversary of \nthe signing into law of President Obama's health care bill. There was \nno question that our health care system required substantial reform. In \npassing this law, however, Congress failed to follow the Hippocratic \noath, ``first do no harm.'' The new law increases health care costs, \nhurts our seniors and health care providers, and imposes billions of \ndollars in new taxes, fees, and penalties. This will lead to fewer \nchoices and higher insurance costs for many middle-income Americans and \nmost small businesses--the opposite of what real health care reform \nshould do.\n  I find it particularly disturbing that President Obama's health care \nlaw does not do enough to rein in the cost of health care and provide \nconsumers with more affordable choices. In fact, Medicare's Chief \nActuary estimates that the law will increase health spending across the \neconomy by $311 billion, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice says the law will actually increase premiums for an average \nfamily plan by $2,100. Moreover, a recent report issued by the CBO \nfound that the new law will cost $1.76 trillion between now and 2022. \nThat is twice as much as the bill's original 10-year price tag of $940 \nbillion.\n  The new law also means fewer choices for many middle-income Americans \nand small businesses. All individual and small group policies sold in \nthe United States will soon have to fit into one of four categories. \nOne size simply does not fit all. In Maine, almost 90 percent of those \npurchasing coverage in the individual market have a policy that is \ndifferent from the standards in the new law.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact the law will have on \nMaine's small businesses, which are our State's job creation engine. \nThe new law discourages small businesses from hiring new employees and \npaying them more. It could also lead to onerous financial penalties, \neven for those small businesses that are struggling to provide health \ninsurance for their employees. According to a 2012 Gallup Survey, 48 \npercent of small businesses are not hiring because of the potential \ncost of health insurance under the health care law, and the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office has testified that the new law will \nmean 800,000 fewer American jobs over the next decade.\n  Even where the law tries to help small businesses, it misses the \nmark. For example, I have long been a proponent of tax credits to help \nsmall businesses cover employee health insurance costs. The new credits \nfor small businesses in the health care law, however, are poorly \nstructured. They are phased out in such a way that businesses will \nactually be penalized when they hire new workers or pay their employees \nmore. Moreover, they are temporary and can only be claimed for 2 years \nin the exchange.\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n  Finally, I am very concerned that the new law is paid for, in large \npart, through more than $500 billion cuts to Medicare, a program which \nalready is facing long-term financing problems. It simply does not make \nsense to rely on deep cuts in Medicare to finance a new entitlement \nprogram at a time when the number of Medicare beneficiaries is on the \nrise.\n  Moreover, according to the administration's own Chief Actuary, these \ndeep cuts could push one in five hospitals, nursing homes, and home \nhealth providers into the red. Many of these providers could simply \nstop taking Medicare patients, which would jeopardize access to care \nfor millions of seniors.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. The bitter rhetoric and partisan \ngridlock over the past few years have obscured the very important fact \nthat there are many health care reforms that have overwhelming support \nin both parties. For example, we should be able to agree on generous \ntax credits for self-employed individuals and small businesses to help \nthem afford health insurance, thus reducing the number of uninsured. We \nshould be able to agree on insurance market reforms that would prevent \ninsurance companies from denying coverage to children who have \npreexisting conditions, permit children to remain on their parents' \npolicies until age 26, require standardized claim forms to reduce \ncosts, and allow consumers to purchase insurance across State lines.\n  We should be able to agree on delivery system reforms that reward \nvalue rather than volume and quality over quantity and that increase \ntransparency throughout the health care system. And we should be able \nto agree on ways to address the serious health care workforce shortages \nthat plague rural and smalltown America. Simply having an insurance \ncard will do you no good if there is no one available to provide the \ncare.\n  In short, we should repeal ObamaCare so that we can start over to \nwork together to draft a health care bill that achieves the consensus \ngoals of providing more choice, containing health care costs, improving \nquality and access, and making health care coverage more affordable for \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2233-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BETTER HEALTH REWARDS PROGRAM ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to advocate for legislation my \ncolleague, Senator Portman, and I have coauthored that focuses on \ndriving better health outcomes for America's seniors through the use of \nreal, positive financial incentives.\n  I think we can all agree on a theory--the best health care is often \nthe least expensive, and it is often health care you can have real \ncontrol over--prevention.\n  According to the Hastings Center, 76 percent of Medicare spending is \non patients with five or more chronic diseases: stroke, heart disease, \ndiabetes and cancer lead the way. And with $2.7 trillion spent annually \non health care, one of the best ways to slow the growth of that \nspending is to keep Americans healthier, and to do that, we have to \nreduce the prevalence of chronic disease.\n  I think Medicare can help spark that transformation. It is a large \nFederal program, some of the smartest health policy links the Federal \nGovernment and the private sector, and, most important, the Federal \nGovernment already pays for seniors to have an annual physical.\n  At present, when seniors leave that physical, too often there is no \ngame plan or specific steps a senior can take to get healthier in the \nyear ahead. Seniors get a bunch of numbers about their tests, possibly \na prescription, and some medical lingo about their general health, but \nmostly everyone just hopes things will turn out OK at the next \nphysical. Maybe it was an OK year, and that extra dessert wasn't a \nproblem after all.\n  We believe that if the Federal Government is already paying for that \nphysical, it is only common sense to wring every possible advantage for \nseniors out of it, specifically by giving seniors the tools to make \nchanges that promote good health and reward them for staying motivated.\n  That is exactly what the bill I have written with Senator Portman \ndoes. Typically, the assumption has always been that preventive care \nmeans more services. But in this case, government already pays for the \nservice--the $3.8 billion on the annual wellness visit--and we are \nsaying, let's get more out of that visit.\n  Here is how our legislation--the Medicare Better Health Rewards \nProgram Act--would do that:\n  First, it is voluntary. Since we hear a little discussion about \nmandates these days, this is voluntary.\n  In year 1, a senior has their physical, has their tests run, and \ntheir health provider has a conversation with them about their health. \nThey come up with a plan to use the next year so that the senior can \nget healthier. The provider then lets Medicare know their patient is \nparticipating.\n  In year 2, the senior comes back for their next annual wellness \nvisit. Again, tests are run, and they discuss the changes that may have \noccurred over the last year. If they have gotten healthier and their \nprovider confirms it, they are eligible for a Healthy Reward. If they \nhaven't, they still had their physical at no out of pocket cost to \nthem. Their provider still gets paid. The same happens again in year 3.\n  Finally, the money to pay these rewards comes from the fact that as \nparticipating seniors get healthier, Medicare is spending less money on \nthem. They are saving the system money. If that occurs, those seniors \nwho are getting healthier will be able to share in the savings.\n  Bottom line: Innovation is rampant in American health care, and we \nare here with a new strategy to bring a fresh wave of innovation to \nMedicare.\n  I would like to thank Senator Portman for working with me on this new \napproach to Medicare reform, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring our legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2233-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2233-S2234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EMANCIPATION DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. When Congress returns to session on Monday, April 16, \n2012, we will recognize an important anniversary and holiday here in \nWashington. That day will be the 150th anniversary of District of \nColumbia Emancipation Day. Nine months before President Abraham Lincoln \nissued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1862, the President \nsigned the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act. The act \nordered the release of the 3,100 enslaved persons of African descent \nheld in the Nation's capital. District of Columbia residents were \ntherefore known as the ``First Freed'' slaves by the Federal government \nduring the Civil War.\n  In 1865 the Confederacy surrendered and the Civil War ended, and \nlater that year the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, \nwhich states that: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except \nas a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly \nconvicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject \nto their jurisdiction.''\n  Emancipation Day celebrations were held annually in the District of \nColumbia from 1866 through 1901, and resumed in 2002. In 2005 \nEmancipation Day was made an official public holiday in the District of \nColumbia.\n  On March 6, 2012, the District of Columbia City Council adopted \nceremonial resolution 19 207. The resolution finds this anniversary to \nbe ``an important, historic occasion for the District of Columbia and \nthe nation and serves as an appropriate time to reflect on how far the \nDistrict of Columbia and the United States have progressed since \ninstitutionalized enslavement of people of African descent. Most \nimportantly, the 150th anniversary reminds us to reaffirm our \ncommitment to forge a more just and united country that truly reflects \nthe ideas of its founders and instills in its people a broad sense of \nduty to be responsible and conscientious stewards of freedom and \ndemocracy.'' I ask unanimous consent to place a copy of this resolution \nin the Record at the end of my statement.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  In the recent past, we have been blessed to celebrate numerous \nhistoric achievements for African-Americans in Washington, DC and \nthroughout the Nation, including the election of the first African-\nAmerican President of the United States, the dedication of the Rev. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the groundbreaking for the\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\nNational Museum of African American History and Culture.

Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, and I have once again submitted a resolution to designate \nApril as ``Financial Literacy Month'' to raise public awareness of this \nimportant issue. I would like to first thank the cosponsors of the \nresolution, Senators Baucus, Blunt, Brown of Ohio, Cardin, Carper, \nCochran, Coons, Crapo, Durbin, Hagan, Inouye, Johnson of South Dakota, \nKohl, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Menendez, Murray, and Wicker. I appreciate \ntheir hard work and support in working to increase the level of \nfinancial literacy for people of all ages across America. I also thank \nthe Senate for taking up this resolution and passing it with unanimous \nconsent last night.\n  This is the tenth and final year that I have introduced this \nresolution, which highlights our Nation's need for investments in \nfinancial literacy, commends current efforts and initiatives to promote \nfinancial education, and encourages the administration and private \ninstitutions to continue to work toward creating a more financially \nliterate public.\n  Financial literacy empowers individuals to be able to appropriately \nevaluate credit opportunities, successfully\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nsave and invest for long-term financial goals in an increasingly \nintricate marketplace, and responsibly manage their personal, \nprofessional, and family finances. It is essential that we continue to \nmake strides toward improving education and consumer protection, while \ngiving individuals the necessary tools to build more financially stable \nfamilies, businesses, and communities. As we continue along the path to \neconomic recovery, it is imperative that the basics of economics, \ncredit, and personal finance become a fundamental fixture in the \nAmerican school system.\n  The Council for Economic Education recently released their 2011 \n``Survey of the States: Economic and Personal Finance Education in Our \nNation's Schools.'' According to this survey, there have been great \nimprovements in financial literacy since the first survey in 1998. \nHowever, troublingly, in the past 2 years, progress has slowed and in \nsome cases even reversed. Specifically, only 22 States require students \nto take an economics course as a high school graduation requirement, \nand only 16 States require the testing of student knowledge in \neconomics. In addition, only 12 States require students to take a \npersonal finance course either independently or as part of an economics \ncourse as a high school graduation requirement.\n  Also, alarmingly, according to the Gallup-Operation HOPE Financial \nLiteracy Index, while 69 percent of American students strongly believe \nthat the best time to save money is now, only 57 percent believe that \ntheir parents are saving money for the future. Despite clear progress \nin this area over the past 15 years, these most recent trends are \ndisturbing.\n  There is no better time than now to invest in a better-educated, more \nfinancially savvy public. With the increased complexity of and access \nto today's financial products, the unscrupulous nature of predatory \nlenders as they enticed millions of families into complicated loans \nthey could not afford nor understand, and people having to make \nimportant life decisions at a younger and younger age, it is critical \nthat we ensure that students are empowered by a sound financial \neducation by the time they graduate from high school. Our Nation cannot \nafford another housing crisis, and the best way to safeguard against \nthat risk is education and promotion spreading knowledge.\n  I would like to thank the various organizations and individuals who \nare doing their part to ensure the education of personal finance \nreaches as many Americans as possible. Teachers, parents, financial \ninstitutions, nonprofit organizations, Governors, legislators, and \nother decision makers must be leaders on this issue just as all of us \nowe it to ourselves and our country to have adequate knowledge of \npersonal finance.\n  As policymakers, we must champion these issues year round, not just \nin the month of April. However, focusing on Financial Literacy Month in \nApril allows us to have a designated month when we can focus our \nefforts, take stock of what has been working, and improve on our work \nfor the coming year. I thank my colleagues again for passing this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2235-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER L.

Smith, who is retiring this week after more than \n32 years of distinguished service to the Congress.\n  Ms. Smith began her congressional career in 1979, working in the \nSenate. While working, she attended law school at night and became one \nof the Senate's Assistant Parliamentarians. She has since served as an \nAssistant Counsel for the House Budget Committee, the General Counsel \nfor the Senate Budget Committee, and the Deputy General Counsel for \nCBO. In 2006, she returned to the Senate Parliamentarian's Office as \nthe Senate Precedents Editor and in 2010 returned to CBO as the \nAssociate General Counsel.\n  In each of her roles, Ms. Smith worked tirelessly to ensure that the \ndecisions of each office were carefully researched, well reasoned, and \nfully documented.\n  As an attorney for CBO, Ms. Smith ensured that CBO's estimates of \nlegislation were based on a solid understanding of the law. Her skills \nas an attorney have been highlighted in the diverse issues she has \nworked on while at CBO, ranging from immigration, to Social Security to \nlease-purchase issues. Her knowledge of appropriations law, copyright \nlaw, and the ethics rules of the House of Representatives rivals those \nof the most acknowledged experts in those fields.\n  Ms. Smith's excellent work has been recognized throughout her career. \nIn 2005, for instance, as CBO's Deputy General Counsel, she received a \nCBO Director's Award for outstanding performance, one of many such \nawards.\n  Ms. Smith has exemplified CBO's high standard of professionalism, \nobjectivity, and nonpartisanship. As chairman, I greatly appreciate the \nsacrifices that Ms. Smith--as well as her family--has made in assisting \nthe Budget Committee and Congress.\n  I would like to turn to my colleague, Senator Sessions, for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman and join him in commending Ms. \nSmith for her many years of dedicated, faithful, and outstanding \nservice to CBO, to the Senate through her work in the Parliamentarian's \nOffice and the Budget Committee, and to the Congress and American \npeople. We wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.\n  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Ms. Smith--and really \nall of the hard-working employees at the Congressional Budget Office--\nfor her and their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2235-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2235-S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE OAHU MATH LEAGUE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the math coaches \nand teachers of the Oahu Math League, OML, for their outstanding \nservice for the students of Hawaii. The Hawaii Council of Teachers of \nMathematics created the OML more than 40 years ago to supplement the \ntraditional math curriculum in Hawaii's schools and to provide students \nwith an outlet to represent their schools in academic competition. The \nleague is comprised two senior varsity divisions as well as one junior \nvarsity division. The various teams represent 28 of Oahu's schools, \nboth public and private, and over 35 coaches, each dedicated to the \npromotion of mathematics education in the State of Hawaii.\n  I wish to acknowledge the students who spend their free time after \nschool and on weekends to prepare and compete in the OML's seven \ngrueling meets each academic year. These students devote their \nextracurricular time to mastering difficult mathematic techniques and \ntheories in order to challenge themselves in the pursuit of academic \nexcellence. Their commitment to their education is exemplary and should \nbe commended.\n  However, these young men and women would not be able to participate \nin the OML competitions were it not for the support and knowledge of \nthe fundamentals of math given to them by their coaches and teachers. \nThese devoted men and women work many hours a week outside the school \nday in preparation for these competitions.\n  I would like to recognize both the foresight of OML's founders, as \nwell as the enduring passion and tireless diligence of the many \noutstanding teachers who volunteer their time and efforts each school \nyear to make the league a success. In particular, I would like to note \nthe extraordinary commitment of several of OML's most active \nsupporters: Thomas Yamachika, Carl Wheeler, Hank Koszewski, Phil Abe, \nClarence Kanja, Lance Suzuki, Clayton Akatsuka, Kathleen Goto, and Amy \nYonashiro.\n  I also want to thank the nine dedicated math teachers and OML \ncoaches, who spend a combined total of 68 hours a week preparing for \nmeets outside of the regular school day and represent more than 180 \nyears of math instruction and service. They are Calvin Fukuhara of \nKamehameha School, Michael Park of Iolani School, Tim Cantley and \nDeborah Kula of Sacred Hearts Academy, Michael Ida of Kalani High \nSchool, Carolyn Okunaga of Mililani High School, Chenfu Chiang of \nHanalani High School, Hal Parker of Punahou School, and Joyce Kanja of \nMid-Pacific Institute.\n  As an educator and former principal, I know firsthand about the \ncountless hours that go into student extracurricular activities when \nthe school\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\nday ends. It makes me proud to see these outstanding educators embody \nthe spirit of service. Their dedication to their field and to the \nstudents of Hawaii is undeniable.

Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Robert \nWalk who is retiring from the U.S. Army with the rank of colonel. \nRobert dedicated more than 30 years of his life to serving our Nation \nas both an Active and Reserve officer. New Hampshire has been very \nfortunate to have a man such as Robert serving in the Army, and I am \nprivileged to recognize his accomplishments today.\n  Robert comes from a patriotic family with a long history of honorable \nservice. He chose to follow in the footsteps of his father, the late \nCOL James Frederick Walk of Hanover, and his grandfathers, BG Arthur \nRichard Walk, U.S. Army, and LTC and Dartmouth College professor--Ralph \nArthur Burns, Army Air Force. His brothers, LTC William Arthur Walk and \nLTC James Bradford Walk, all answered the same call to service.\n  After receiving a degree in chemical engineering from the University \nof New Hampshire, he served for 11 years on active duty in the Army, \nwhere he met his wife, LTC M. Angela S. Walk. Following his active-duty \nservice, he continued his career in the Army Reserve, serving as a \ntraditional reserve officer while pursuing a master's degree in \nenvironmental engineering. As a traditional Reserve officer, Robert \nheld a variety of positions, working in the Army Reserve's Homeland \nSecurity Office, and in the congressionally directed Domestic \nPreparedness Program, before transitioning to active Guard Reserve \nstatus. His final position was serving as the chief of staff of the \nU.S. Strategic Command Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \nat Fort Belvoir.\n  Even in retirement, I am confident that Robert will continue to serve \nhis Nation. On behalf of all New Hampshire residents and all Americans, \nI am proud to thank Robert and his entire family for their service to \nour great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2236-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNITED FARM WORKERS OF AMERICA 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Farm Workers of America, \nthe Nation's largest farmworkers union.\n  In 1962, Cesar Chavez, the preeminent figure in the movement for farm \nlaborers' rights in the 20th century, founded the National Farm Works \nAssociation, which later became the United Farm Workers, UFW.\n  Mr. Chavez's steely determination and use of nonviolent protest \ntactics in the Delano grape strike of 1965 1970; the fasts of 1968, \n1972, and 1988; and numerous other strikes around the Nation became an \norganizing model and inspiration for the labor movement.\n  Driven by its core values of integrity, innovation, empowerment, \nnonviolence and ``Si Se Puede'' attitude, the UFW has worked valiantly \nand tirelessly over the past half century to achieve a number of \nhistoric gains for farmworkers. The vigorous advocacy of the UFW has \nenabled farmworkers to secure higher wages and safer working \nconditions, reduced exposure to the use of harmful and toxic \npesticides, and equality and opportunities for their families.\n  Today, the UFW remains an ardent protector and advocate for the \nrights and interests of farmworkers in 10 States. The union's proud \nlegacy of social justice and civil rights is alive and thriving.\n  The story of the first 50 years of the United Farm Workers is a \ntestament to the value of perseverance and social justice. I applaud \nthe indefatigable commitment of all UFW members, past and present, to \nbring justice and equality to farmworkers and to future generations.\n  As the members and friends of the United Farm Workers gather to \ncelebrate this auspicious occasion, I congratulate them on their 50th \nanniversary and wish everyone a memorable anniversary and continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2236-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \nsignificant contributions that the East Bay Municipal Utility District \nin Oakland, CA, is making with respect to renewable energy production. \nEast Bay Municipal Utility District is a regional water and wastewater \ntreatment agency serving the needs of the citizens of Alameda and \nContra Costa Counties in the San Francisco Bay area. I am proud to note \nthat with 1.3 million customers in the east bay region, this agency is \nleading the way in developing sustainable energy and water conservation \npractices that benefit the region.\n  On April 3, the East Bay Municipal Utility District's board of \ndirectors will formally dedicate a project that will create clean \nenergy for the region and help ensure that waste materials that would \notherwise be sent to landfills are reused. This new project is the \nPower Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion Project and it \nbuilds on the successful Resource Recovery Program that is already \nserving as a model for other wastewater treatment plants across the \nNation.\n  The Power Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion Project will \nutilize biogas, methane, produced from anaerobic digesters to power \nelectrical generators and a new 4.6-megawatt clean-burn turbine. The \nsource materials used by the anaerobic digesters will be waste that is \ncurrently being sent to garbage dumps. As a result of this new project, \nEBMUD's total production capacity at its wastewater treatment plant \nwill be 10.6 megawatts, enough capacity to meet the electrical power \ndemands of 13,000 homes.\n  The innovative Power Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion \nProject will allow the East Bay Municipal Utility District to be the \nfirst agency of its kind in the Nation to generate all its own energy \nentirely from the production of biogas generated from waste materials. \nExcess energy, above and beyond that needed to meet the electrical \npower demands of running the wastewater treatment plant, will be sold \nback to the electrical grid, thereby helping to keep customer rates low \nby reducing EBMUD's power bill and increasing revenues from the sale of \nelectricity. Increasing the generation of green energy supports \nCalifornia's goal of increasing clean energy while reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions. This project is particularly important because EBMUD is \ncurrently generating so much biogas from waste material that it is \nforced to flare the excess biogas.\n  At a time when all of us must find ways to reduce energy consumption \nand help generate renewable energy, I commend the board of directors \nand the employees of the East Bay Municipal Utility District for the \nforesight they have shown in developing and growing the Resource \nRecovery Program and in the construction of this important sustainable \nenergy project. This project serves as a reminder to each of us that we \ncan find ways to develop high-quality public services and reduce \noperating costs through innovative thinking and the use of technology. \nI congratulate East Bay Municipal Utility District for leading the way \non developing clean energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2236-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2236-S2237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RICHARD C.

This is a tremendous \nhonor, for which he should be especially proud.\n  A devoted patriot, Rich has dedicated the past 27 years to serving \nour Armed Forces and protecting our Nation. After graduating from the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point, he was commissioned in the U.S. \nArmy as a second lieutenant in the Infantry. Rich's first assignment \ntook him to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC, where he \nserved in numerous leadership positions. While there, he was accepted \ninto the Army's Funded Legal Education Program. In 1993, he graduated \nfrom the University of Virginia School of Law and entered the U.S. Army \nJudge Advocate General's, JAG,\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nCorps. He later earned a master's degree in strategic studies from the \nU.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, PA.\n  As a JAG, Rich served in numerous positions across the world. He \nbegan serving in the 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. After \nassignments at the U.S. Army Litigation Division in Arlington, VA, and \nthe 1st Special Operational Detachment--Delta, Fort Bragg, he was \nassigned to the V Corps, Heidelberg, Germany, as the deputy staff judge \nadvocate, SJA. Most recently, he served as the SJA for U.S. Central \nCommand, USCENTCOM, at MacDill AFB, Tampa, FL.\n  I had the opportunity to serve with Rich in Kabul, Afghanistan, and \nwas able to see firsthand his strong work ethic, good character, and \nintegrity. As the chief legal advisor for the International Security \nAssistance Force, ISAF, and SJA for U.S. Forces--Afghanistan, USFOR A, \nRich is an invaluable asset to our Armed Forces and, as a leader, has \nset an example for other service men to follow.\n  Rich has received numerous awards, including the Defense Superior \nService Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with two Oak Leaf \nClusters, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Meritorious \nService Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Non-Article 5 NATO Medal. \nHe is a recipient of the U.S. Army Ranger Tab, Master Parachutist \nBadge, Air Assault Badge, and Expert Infantryman Badge.\n  I ask the Senate join me in congratulating Richard C.

JOHN HITT\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \ngreat Floridian, Dr. John Hitt, who earlier this month celebrated his \n20th anniversary as the president of the University of Central Florida.\n  First and foremost, I would like to congratulate him on reaching this \nmilestone, and thank him and his wife Martha for everything they have \ndone for Central Florida over the past 20 years. When they arrived at \nUCF in 1992, Dr. Hitt outlined five goals for UCF that have held \nsteadfast for two decades.\n  He wanted the school to offer the best undergraduate education \navailable in Florida and achieve international prominence in key \nprograms of graduate study and research. He wanted the school to \nprovide international focus to UCF's curricula and research programs, \nbecome more inclusive and diverse, and to be America's leading \npartnership university.\n  This innovative vision and entrepreneurial spirit have led to UCF \nbecoming our nation's 2nd largest university and a place among \nAmerica's premier metropolitan research universities.\n  When Dr. Hitt arrived in Orlando, he knew that the key to making UCF \na world-class university and a vital force in Central Florida was going \nto be through the power of partnerships.\n  It would be through partnerships with our community and State \ncolleges where UCF accepts 29 percent of all Florida community and \nState college transfer students, making it the No. 1 destination for \ntransfer students in the State university system and among the top \nuniversities in the United States for community college transfer \nstudents.\n  It would be through partnerships with industry and government that \nled to the growth of the Central Florida Research Park--one of the top \nfive research parks in the country--and to the founding of the Florida \nHigh Tech Corridor Council, which links the resources and talent of \nUCF, the University of South Florida, and the University of Florida \nwith high-tech companies.\n  And, it would be through partnerships that are profoundly \ntransforming Central Florida, such as those that led to the creation of \nthe UCF College of Medicine which has become the cornerstone for a \ngrowing medical sciences cluster of facilities known as the ``Medical \nCity at Lake Nona.''\n  A few weeks ago, Dr. Hitt told the UCF community that if he had \nlearned anything in 20 years, it was that our greatest danger is not to \ndream too large, but to dream too small. In the years that he has led \nUCF--and in the 50 years that he has had Martha at his side--John Hitt \nhas stayed true to his ideals, his vision, and his heart.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Hitt is fond of saying that UCF ``stands for \nopportunity.'' That is in no small part because of his strength of \ncharacter, bold vision and steady leadership. As UCF celebrates its \n50th anniversary next year, Dr. Hitt's unique approach to tackling \nchallenges and creating opportunities has taken UCF from promise to \nprominence. On this special anniversary, I thank Dr. Hitt for not \nstraying from the five visionary goals that he outlined in his \ninaugural address two decades ago--and for showing us what is possible \nthrough passion and partnership.\n  Thank you, Dr. Hitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2237-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2237-S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN W. ROWE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to John \nRowe, an individual whose keen intellect and indefatigable work ethic \nhave transformed him into one of the country's most respected voices in \nthe energy industry--and one that I have relied on throughout my \ncongressional career as a source for honest analysis of public policy \nrelating to climate change and energy markets.\n  Earlier this month, John spent his first day of retirement teaching \nstudents at a charter school that he financed and founded in Chicago--\nan action which embodies a career that has prioritized responsibility, \ncompetition, and above all, a commitment to embracing challenges. \nIndeed, John not only leaves Exelon a stronger company, but he \nbequeaths a legacy of vision and innovation to the utility sector that \nwill truly reverberate for generations to come. It has often been noted \nthat John holds the distinction of being the longest serving utility \nexecutive in the United States, which is also a remarkable reflection \nof the degree to which he is considered a preeminent and trusted voice \non a range of issues from national climate policies to transmission and \nenvironmental regulations.\n  To think that it all began in Maine. In reflecting upon the origins \nof his career, John described to the New York Times last summer that he \nwas told he could either try to become a CEO through a long and arduous \nclimb up the corporate ladder, or he could ``go to some fairly small \ncompany that is in really big trouble and is willing to take a lot of \nrisk.'' And the rest, as they say, is history--to the everlasting \nbenefit of the energy industry.\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n  John, who had virtually no experience in the energy sector, moved to \nMaine and joined Central Maine Power, or CMP, as CEO in 1984--as the \ncompany was confronting unparalleled challenges. It was also after he \ncame to CMP that my husband, the former Governor of Maine Jock \nMcKernan, and I first met John.\n  In Maine, John quickly demonstrated exceptional business acumen and \nquickly altered the discussion in Maine from one of confrontation to \none of collaboration that involved regulators and the rest of the \nbusiness community. He carried that experience forward to New England \nElectric Systems where he became a forceful voice for deregulation of \nthe electricity markets in the 1990s. Always a strong proponent of \nincreasing competitiveness in the electricity market, John realized \nthat the electricity industry was on course toward a new paradigm when \nhe remarked to the Bangor Daily News in 1995, ``We're on a route to \nincreasing competition, and that is unlikely to be turned around.''\n  John steadfastly maintained that ideology throughout the rest of his \ncareer, and while he left Maine and New England for his work at Exelon \nand its predecessor, Unicom, he indisputably continued to influence \npublic policy throughout the country--garnering him numerous industry \naccolades, including Edison Electric Institute's Distinguished \nLeadership Award, the Keystone Center Leadership in Industry Award, \nChicagoland Chamber of Commerce Burnham Award for Business and Civic \nLeadership, as well as an induction to the Chicago Business Hall of \nFame. But most invaluable to the Nation has been his ever-steady and \nthoughtful commentary on the development of sensible policies that \nwould reduce greenhouse gas emissions while providing certainty for \nbusiness investments.\n  Rather than challenging regulations, John has led the effort to \nreplace antiquated Clean Air Act rules with market-based solutions that \nprovide environmental dividends at a reduced cost to industry and \nconsumers. Specifically, as cochair of the National Commission on \nEnergy Policy, he developed the report, ``Ending the Energy \nStalemate,'' which called for increasing and reforming fuel economy \nstandards, addressing climate change through a mandatory market-based \ntrading program, and increasing the development and distribution of \nenergy-efficient products.\n  Specifically, the report stated that, ``improving passenger vehicle \nfuel economy is by far the most significant oil demand reduction \nmeasure proposed by the Commission.'' As a coauthor of the ``Ten-in-\nTen'' Fuel Economy Title of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security \nAct, I took these recommendations to heart, and with Senator Feinstein, \nembarked on an initiative to achieve historic fuel economy standards \nbased upon this law--which, given the increasing prices for gasoline, \ncould not be more imperative.\n  However, John's true expertise, starting with his initial effort to \nstop the campaign to close a nuclear plant in Maine, focuses on \ndeveloping a regulatory environment that provides safe nuclear power to \nconsumers. As the operator of the largest nuclear fleet in the United \nStates, John has meticulously worked to address the current challenges \nconfronting additional nuclear power in the United States, while also \npreemptively positioning the industry for unanticipated impediments. \nThe American nuclear power fleet is the safest in the world in part \nbecause of his unparalleled contributions.\n  At a time when trust of institutions, companies, and public \npolicymakers has eroded, it is difficult to lose John's voice as a head \nof one of the most influential companies in the United States. John has \nalways demonstrated a trust with his colleagues as well as \npolicymakers, and I look forward to watching his continued \ncontributions following his retirement as chief executive officer of \nExelon.\n  I wish John and his wife, Jeanne, the very best in the next chapter \nof their lives, and I look forward to continuing to work with an \nindividual who believes in cost-effective development of clean energy \nin the United States, is champion of competition, and is committed to \nresponsibility throughout society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2238-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES McCORMICK\n\n    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last week, an extraordinary \nWest Virginian, James McCormick, received a national award, Citizen \nService Before Self Honors, from the Congressional Medal of Honor \nFoundation. This nonprofit is dedicated to education and awareness \nabout the Congressional Medal of Honor. James McCormick was recognized \nby this distinguished group for his extraordinary commitment to his \nfellow veterans. Mr. McCormick returned from service and rather than \nthinking of just himself, he realized that his fellow veterans needed \nto work and they needed housing.\n  His deep understanding of the needs of returning veterans led to the \ncreation of his nonprofit, Raising Cane Farms. The vision is simple but \nimportant. Raising Cane Farms is an organic, environmentally friendly \nfarm located in Mason County, WV, that grows and market bamboo for \nmultiple uses, including sales to manufacturers of bamboo products, \nproduce sellers, restaurants, and landscapers. But beyond that, the \nfarm will also serve as an educational facility and place to employ \nveterans and provide quality jobs in an outdoors, veteran-friendly \nenvironment using both the outdoors and fellowship with other veterans \nto help them recover from combat disabilities.\n  Raising Cane Farms has been helped by dedicated partners including \nthe Farmer Veteran's Coalition, FVC, that provided support to clear the \nland, build roads, establish a watering system, and build a greenhouse. \nOther partners include Work Vessels for Veterans, which helped with \nfunding for a trailer, marketing and Web development support, and \nimportant introductions to other veteran farmers including Veteran \nFarm's pioneer Adam Burke.\n  As the longest serving member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I am deeply moved by the courage of our veterans and their \nongoing service to our country and their colleagues. James McCormick is \nsuch an inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2238-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2238-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2238-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2238-S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:50 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the Congress of the United States to \n     enact legislation to ensure that amounts credited to the \n     Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are used solely for the \n     dredging, infrastructure, operation, and maintenance of \n     federally authorized ports, harbors, and waterways; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 97\n\n       Whereas, domestic shippers and importers using Great Lakes \n     and coastal ports pay more than a billion dollars per year in \n     federal harbor maintenance taxes. Congress established the \n     tax to fund harbor operation and maintenance, particularly \n     dredging, at these ports; and\n       Whereas, despite a nearly $6 billion balance in the Harbor \n     Maintenance Trust Fund, our nation's dredging needs are not \n     being met. Throughout our nation and particularly in the \n     Great Lakes region, the lack of dredging has forced shippers \n     to operate inefficiently and carry lighter loads, costing \n     them millions of dollars each year; and\n       Whereas, the Obama Administration has only budgeted about \n     half of the revenue collected through the harbor maintenance \n     tax for maintaining our nation's harbors. Last year, nearly \n     $1.5 billion were collected from shippers, but only $758 \n     million has been allocated for dredging harbors in Michigan \n     and other coastal states; and\n       Whereas, during the current turbulent economic conditions, \n     we must make every effort to support economic activity by \n     maintaining the infrastructure necessary for commerce. \n     Essentially by, using harbor maintenance taxes placed in the \n     Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to finance and balance other \n     portions of the federal budget, we are breaking our promise \n     to the shippers paying the tax and hurting our nation's \n     economic recovery; and\n       Whereas, current congressional legislation (H.R. 104 and S. \n     412) would ensure that harbor maintenance taxes are only used \n     for their intended purpose to maintain our nation's harbors; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to ensure that amounts \n     credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are used solely \n     for the dredging, infrastructure, operation, and maintenance \n     of federally-authorized ports, harbors, and waterways; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 69. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing a request for an \n     amendments convention to be called for the purpose of \n     proposing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which shall \n     provide that an increase in the federal debt requires \n     approval from a majority of the legislatures of the separate \n     states; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, Article V of the Constitution of the United States \n     provides authority for a convention to be called by the \n     Congress of the United States for the purpose of proposing \n     amendments to the constitution upon application of two-thirds \n     of the legislatures of the several states, an ``amendments \n     convention''; and\n       Whereas, the legislature of the state of Louisiana favors \n     the proposal and ratification of an amendment to said \n     constitution which shall provide that an increase in the \n     federal debt requires approval from a majority of the \n     legislatures of the separate states. therefore, be it\n       Resolved, Section 1. That, as provided for in Article V of \n     the Constitution of the United States, the legislature of the \n     state of Louisiana herewith respectfully applies for an \n     amendments convention to be called for the purpose of \n     proposing an amendment which shall provide that an increase \n     in the federal debt requires approval from a majority of the \n     legislatures of the separate states.\n       Section 2. That the amendments convention contemplated by \n     this application shall be entirely focused upon and \n     exclusively limited to the subject matter of proposing for \n     ratification an amendment to the constitution providing that \n     an increase in the federal debt requires approval from a \n     majority of the legislatures of the separate States.\n       Section 3. This application constitutes a continuing \n     application in accordance with Article V of the Constitution \n     of the United States until at least two-thirds of the \n     legislatures of the several states have made application for \n     an equivalently limited amendments convention.\n       Section 4. That a certified copy of this application be \n     dispatched by the secretary of state (or other responsible \n     constitutional officer) to the president of the United States \n     Senate, to the speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to each member of the applicant's delegation \n     to the United States Congress, and to the presiding officers \n     of each house of the several state legislatures, requesting \n     their cooperation in applying for the amendments convention \n     limited to the subject matter contemplated by this \n     application.\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2242-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       H.R. 2297.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n709 West 9th Street, Juneau, Alaska, as the Robert Boochever United \nStates Courthouse; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \npiece of legislation honoring a great Alaskan. Robert Boochever was a \ngiant of my state's judicial community for over 60 years--even longer \nthan Alaska has been a State. This legislation, naming the Juneau \nFederal courthouse facility in Judge Boochever's honor, is a fitting \ntribute to his legacy.\n  Robert Boochever first came to Alaska in the 1946, after having \nfought in World War II as a Captain in the U.S. Army. In territorial \nAlaska, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for two years, before joining \na private practice in Juneau for almost 25 years, and was before long, \none of the most respected lawyers in the state. He served as President \nof the Juneau Bar Association and the Alaska Bar Association.\n  In 1972, Governor Egan tapped Boochever to serve as an Associate \nJustice on the Alaska Supreme Court. He served on the court for eight \nyears, three of which he had the honor of being the fourth ever Chief \nJustice of the Alaska Supreme Court.\n  President Jimmy Carter nominated Judge Boochever to be a Judge of the \nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on May 22, \n1980. He was quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate and received his \ncommission to the Federal bench about a month later. This made Judge \nBoochever the first ever Alaskan to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit, a \ncourt he would serve on for the next thirty years.\n  Judge Boochever is well known for his commitment to the city and the \npeople of Juneau. He lived in Juneau and maintained an office there for \nmost of his life. Even when he moved to California in his later years \nto facilitate travel and communications, he still maintained his Juneau \noffice and returned to it every year with his clerks.\n  In addition to his impressive record of accomplishments and his years \nof public service, Judge Boochever was known for his love and \ncommitment for the law. He is well known as a tireless advocate for the \nrights of the disadvantaged and for his strong commitment to protecting \nindividual freedoms and First Amendment rights.\n  Naming the Juneau Federal courthouse facility in Judge Boochever's \nhonor is broadly supported by Alaskans and so appropriate because he \nkept his chambers there for many years. In fact, this effort has the \nsupport of the Juneau Bar Association, the Alaska Bar Association's \nHistorians Committee, the Mayor of Juneau, and many of its residents.\n  For all these reasons, today I am proud to introduce this legislation \nto designate the United States Courthouse in Juneau as the Robert \nBoochever United States Courthouse. He was a great man and this is a \nfine way to remember all he did for my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ROBERT BOOCHEVER UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at \n     709 West 9th Street, Juneau, Alaska, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Robert Boochever United States \n     Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``Robert Boochever United \n     States Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 2253. A bill to require individuals who file under the Ethics in \nGovernment Act of 1978 to disclose any financial accounts that are or \nhave been deposited in a country that is a tax haven; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the old adage that sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant is an old adage for one main reason: It is true.\n  That is why I am introducing the Financial Disclosure to Reduce Tax \nHaven Abuse Act of 2012, to require candidates for Federal office and \ncertain Federal employees to disclose any financial interest they or \ntheir spouse hold that is held in an offshore tax haven.\n  It might seem ridiculous that we don't already know whether \ncandidates and Members of Congress are using offshore tax havens. \nHowever, under current law, those individuals are not required to \naccount for where their financial interests are held.\n  A January 26, 2012, article in the Los Angeles Times reported that \nMitt Romney--a candidate for the Republican nomination for President--\nfailed to disclose a number of accounts in countries with very low tax \nburdens.\n  Specifically, according to a review of the candidate's tax returns \nand financial disclosure statements:\n\n       At least 23 funds and partnerships listed in the couple's \n     2010 tax returns did not show up or were not listed in the \n     same fashion on Romney's most recent financial disclosure, \n     including 11 based in low-tax foreign countries such as \n     Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg.\n\n  The Romney campaign called the discrepancies ``trivial.''\n  But this information is not trivial to the American people's trust in \ngovernment, and the use of offshore tax havens is not trivial to our \neconomy.\n  Studies have found that tax offshore tax havens, and other similar \nloopholes, cost taxpayers $100 billion per year.\n  I want to commend Senators Levin and Conrad for the work they have \ndone to shine a light on these nefarious practices.\n  Those two Senators successfully included a provision in the Senate \nTransportation bill that will give the Treasury Department greater \ntools to crack down on offshore tax haven abuse. It is an important \nstep forward, but more must be done.\n  The American people are rightly concerned that the wealthy and well-\nconnected are skirting our laws to avoid taxation, and they deserve to \nknow that the people who hope to represent them in Washington--and \nthose who are trying to attain those positions--aren't cheating the \nsystem.\n  Nothing in this bill impinges on an individual's right to hold \nfinancial interests within the global economy. If there is a legitimate \nreason for a candidate or a Member of Congress or any other individual \nwho files a financial disclosure to hold their money in an account on \nthe Cayman Islands, they should have no problem explaining it to \nvoters. But any individual who has or wants to have the public's trust \nshould be honest about practices they have engaged in that cost the \ntaxpayers they wish to represent billions of dollars every year. This \nis an important step that we must take to restore the public trust.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNTS HELD IN TAX HAVENS.\n\n       Section 102(b)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 \n     (5 U.S.C. App.) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``, with a specific \n     accounting of any financial interest held by the covered \n     individual or their spouse in a country that is considered as \n     a tax haven as listed by the Secretary of the Treasury and \n     made available to the filer'' after ``calendar year''; and\n       (2) inserting at the end the following:\n     ``In compiling the list of tax havens under subparagraph (A), \n     the Secretary of the Treasury should consider for inclusion \n     those jurisdictions which have been previously and publicly \n     identified by the Internal Revenue Service as secrecy \n     jurisdictions in Federal court proceedings.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 2256. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for community-based mental health infrastructure improvement; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, the Community-Based Mental Health Infrastructure \nImprovements Act.\n  According to the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island, 38,000 \nadults and 11,000 children in the state have a serious mental illness, \nand approximately 15 percent of Rhode Island adults report suffering \nfrom serious psychological distress every year. Unfortunately, mental \nillness is often linked to poor physical health--obesity, high blood \npressure, and high cholesterol.\n  Community mental health centers help these individuals get the mental \nand behavioral health care that they need to lead healthier, more \nproductive lives through no or low-cost treatments. This cost structure \nhas been particularly critical throughout the recent recession and as \nour economy continues to recover. Individuals and families didn't have \nto forgo health care because they lost their job or health insurance. \nThe proof is in the numbers. In just the last 6 months of 2010, \nCommunity Mental Health Centers in Rhode Island treated nearly 30,000 \nindividuals. The demand for care will only grow as more Americans gain \naccess to comprehensive, affordable health insurance in 2014.\n  It is critical that Community Mental Health Centers have the \ninfrastructure necessary to treat every individual who needs care. In \nRhode Island, some of the community mental health centers are in older \nbuildings that need updating. Others need more space to be able to meet \ncurrent demand and prepare for the expected increase in patients in \n2014. These needs are true of community mental health centers across \nthe country. The Community-Based Mental Health Infrastructure \nImprovements Act would help ensure that Community Mental Health Centers \nhave the resources to construct and modernize these mental and \nbehavioral health facilities.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been included in a broader \nmental health care bill, the Excellence in Mental Health Act, that I \njoined Senator Stabenow in introducing today. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to improve our mental and behavioral health care \ndelivery system, and urge my colleagues to support these important \nbills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide liability protection for claims based on \nthe design, manufacture, sale, offer for sale, introduction into \ncommerce, or use of certain fuels and fuel additives, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce bipartisan energy \nlegislation, the Domestic Fuels Act. This legislation is designed to \nhelp hard-working Americans with the high fuel prices, the high gas \nprices they are paying at the pump. This legislation will truly help us \ndo ``all of the above'' when it comes to producing and providing lower \ncost energy for American consumers, American businesses, and to fuel \nour economy, help create jobs, and also to create greater national \nenergy security. It is part of what I believe we need to do to truly \nhave an energy security plan for our country.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the Domestic Fuels Act. We \nare going to start with a quick review of gas prices. As we all very \nwell know, gas prices are high, and they continue to go higher. AAA \nindicated this week the national average for a gallon of gasoline is \n$3.91 a gallon. Gasoline prices, over the last 3 years of the current \nadministration, have more than doubled from about roughly $1.87 to the \nnational average today of more than $3.90. I believe there are nine \nStates right now where, on average, gas is more than $4 a gallon. In \nChicago, for example, I believe it is about $4.68. Over here, a few \nblocks from the Capitol, I checked not too long ago and it was $4.39 a \ngallon.\n  This puts enormous pressure and strain on American consumers, hard-\nworking Americans, every day, when they are being forced to fill their \ncar at the gas pump and spend close to $4 per gallon. Some predictions \nare that later this summer, it may go to $5 a gallon. Clearly, we have \nto find a way to help with gasoline prices across this country.\n  What it comes down to is supply and demand. More supply creates \ndownward pressure on gasoline prices; more demand, of course, pushes \nprices higher. So we have to find ways to increase the supply and \nincrease the supply in a dependable way. That means not only increasing \nsupply now but having policies in place that increase supply now and in \nthe future.\n  We need to send signals to the market that we are serious about \ngrowing our supply of energy--all types of energy--certainly gas and \noil but all types of energy in this country, as well as working with \nour neighbors we can count on, such as Canada, for more supplies to \nhelp reduce the price of gasoline and, frankly, reduce the cost of all \ntypes of energy to help get the economy going, to have more national \nsecurity and more jobs to put the 13 million people who are unemployed \nback to work. Energy is a key aspect of creating the type of economic \nenvironment that will help us do that.\n  This chart shows our current level of crude oil production. The first \nbar shows that between ourselves and Canada, we produce just under 10 \nmillion barrels of crude and crude equivalent right now. In North \nAmerica--Canada and the United States--we produce under 10 million \nbarrels of crude today. That comes not only from conventional oil but \noil shale, tight oil, oil sands, Arctic, and offshore--all these \ndifferent sources.\n  Under the current policies, we can see by looking at this next bar \nthat over the next 15 years the supply of oil and gas coming from \nCanada and the United States will shrink. Under the current policies \nand the current approach, without the kind of energy policy we need in \nthis country, we actually will have less oil and gas from Canada and \nthe United States over the next 15 years.\n  The key is this: We have to implement the kind of energy policy that \nwill help us produce more energy, oil and gas, and from all sources, \ntraditional and renewable. That is what we are talking about with this \nDomestic Fuels Act.\n  The third bar on this chart shows that just from oil and gas, with \nthe right kinds of policies over the next 15 years--this is a 15-year \ntimeframe--we can produce more oil and gas in Canada and the United \nStates than we consume. So before we bring in other types of energy--\nbiofuels and any other types, any renewable energy we want to include, \njust from oil and gas, with the right kinds of policies in Canada and \nthe United States, over the next 15 years we can produce more energy \nthan we consume.\n  Think what that means in terms of helping bring down the price of \ngasoline and in terms of creating jobs in our country; think of what \nthat means in terms of national security, not needing to depend on \ncrude oil from the Middle East. That is just with the right policies to \ndevelop more oil and gas. Of course, we can develop all the other types \nof energy resources as well.\n  Let's not take 15 years to get this done. Let's have a plan for \nnational energy security that gets it done in the next 5 to 7 years. \nThere is no question we can do it. We can absolutely do it. How do we \ndo it? Very simple and very common sense. When we talk about producing \n``all of the above,'' let's actually do that. Let's not say ``all of \nthe above'' and then block energy production. Let's have the kinds of \nenergy policies in place, traditional sources and renewable sources, on \na bipartisan basis. Let's put the types of policies in place that will \ntruly help us get to energy security, and let's do it over the next 5 \nto 7 years. Let's increase oil production in the United States and \nCanada. Let's have the policies that help us produce more oil onshore \nand off. Let's increase natural gas production and usage.\n  Again, let's join with Canada and do this with North American energy. \nWe have incredible potential with Canada. We are the closest friends \nand allies in the world. Let's increase the renewable fuels we produce \nright here at home. We can do that with a market-based approach. Let's \nincrease our use of renewable fuels with market-based approaches that \nwork. Let's use technology to drive energy production--produce more \nenergy--with better environmental stewardship.\n  We can do all these things. When we talk about an energy security \nplan or the path to energy security in our country, these are very \ncommonsense steps. I have bills, as do other Members of this body, on a \nbipartisan basis, to do all these things--increase oil production, \nincrease the use of natural gas, increase renewables with market-based \napproaches, and use technology\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\nto drive energy and do it with better environmental stewardship.\n  One of the things I submitted legislation to do is approve the \nKeystone Pipeline. It is an issue that has been very much in the \nnational discussion. It has gotten a lot of attention. It is a \nstraightforward concept. It simply says let's develop the \ninfrastructure in our country, so that as we produce more oil in \nCanada--Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world. No. 1 \nis Saudi Arabia, No. 2 is Venezuela, and No. 3 is Canada. Let's work \nwith Canada to tap and use more of that oil. If we don't, it will go to \nChina. But we can do it. We simply have to develop the infrastructure \nand work with Canada.\n  What has the opposition to that oil development been? A number of \narguments have come up. The main one behind it is, some people say we \ndon't want to produce oil in the oil sands; we don't want to do that. \nThe concern, in their opinion, is greenhouse gas. It has about a 6-\npercent higher greenhouse gas emission than conventional drilling \nproduction.\n  The important point is--going back to the last chart, which I \nmentioned in the national energy security plan is let's use technology \nto produce more energy with better stewardship. What I mean is, when we \ntalk about the oil sands, rather than using the current excavation \nmethod, 80 percent of the new development is going to in situ, which is \nessentially drilling. So it is basically the same footprint and same \ngreenhouse gas emissions as conventional drilling for oil and gas. So \nlet's use that new technology to produce more energy, more oil in the \nCanadian oil sands, and do it with better environmental stewardship.\n  We will then be getting oil from a dependable ally, rather than \ngetting 30 percent of our crude from the Middle East and Venezuela. It \nis just common sense. We win with more energy at a lower cost. We win \nwith job creation, and we win with better environmental stewardship. We \nneed to just get the right policies, the right law, and the right \napproach to how we regulate these things in place.\n  That is what the Domestic Fuels Act is all about. It is an example of \nexactly how we do that. The Domestic Fuels Act essentially says, all \nright, when we pull up to the gas station, we should be able to get \nwhatever fuel provides the best energy for what we need at the best \npossible price.\n  It is about consumer choice, and it is about lowering the cost at the \npump.\n  Right now, when you pull in, very often the petroleum retail marketer \nhas multiple tanks in order to dispense various types of fuel. It might \nbe traditional gasoline from petroleum, it might be some blend of \npetroleum and ethanol, he might have biodiesel, and increasingly \nservice stations, gas stations, are looking to market natural gas. But \nthink about it. If they have to have a different set of tanks, \ndifferent set of piping, and different dispensers for each type of \nfuel, then they have to make a choice, don't they. They can maybe offer \ngasoline from petroleum, they can maybe offer some ethanol blend, they \ncan maybe offer biodiesel, or maybe they try natural gas; right?\n  But if they have to have tanks and pumps and piping for each one, \nthink of the cost--hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  So how do you get consumer choice? How do you get consumer choice in \nthere? Also, how do you get the lowest price? If petroleum-based \ngasoline versus ethanol-based is cheaper, well, then, maybe they want \nto offer straight petroleum, not have a blend. But if they can mix it \nwith ethanol, offer even up to E85, and that is cheaper, they may want \nto offer that. If they want to offer biodiesel rather than traditional \ndiesel or if they want to offer natural gas--because increasingly we \nhave trucks and buses particularly in our urban areas using natural \ngas--how do they do it? That is the point.\n  What this act provides is that the EPA has to streamline the process \nso a service station or gas station can use their existing tanks and \nequipment so they can decide to offer any one of those products. Now we \nhave more consumer choice and we have a way to drive down prices at the \npump--drive down the cost of gasoline, drive down the cost of biofuels, \ndrive down the cost of natural gas, or whatever it is--consumer choice, \nlower prices, and that extends back through the production chain as \nwell. If I produce ethanol, if I produce biodiesel, if I produce \ngasoline or natural gas, I know I am going to be able to market those \nproducts to consumers.\n  This is about looking to the future instead of looking to the past. \nThis isn't about government spending any more money. This is about the \ngovernment empowering industry, empowering entrepreneurship, empowering \nthe energy sector, and empowering our consumers with choice and lower \ncosts at the pump. It is just common sense. It is just common sense. We \ngive the marketer a way to market whatever product makes the most sense \nand whatever best serves the consumers at the best price. We give them \nliability protection so they know they can go forward and offer these \ndifferent products without worrying about being sued and losing their \nlivelihood so they are willing to do it. We provide a clear and simple \npathway so they know what they have to accomplish in order to best \nserve their consumers and build their business.\n  This is about the right kind of legal framework. This is about the \nright kind of legislation that is clear, understandable, and \nempowering. This is how we get government working for people rather \nthan people working for government. This is how we build the right kind \nof energy future based on all of the above. This isn't just about \nsaying, hey, let's do all of the above when it comes to energy \ndevelopment. This is about doing it. This is about making a difference \nfor the American consumer, and we can do it.\n  This legislation is bipartisan legislation. I am very pleased Senator \nRoy Blunt of Missouri is cosponsoring it with me, along with Amy \nKlobuchar of Minnesota, Mike Crapo of Idaho, and I believe we will have \nmany others joining us on both sides of the aisle. Also, we are working \nwith Representative John Shimkus in the House who will be introducing \ncompanion legislation as well.\n  The other point I want to make in concluding is that we have broad-\nbased support from companies and people who work in the traditional \nenergy sector as well as the renewable energy sector, who make the \nequipment that dispense gasoline and other types of fuel products and \nthe people who sell gasoline and all types of fuel. They are all \nonboard.\n  Let me give an example. From the renewable fuels energy sector, we \nhave the Renewable Fuels Association endorsing this legislation, and \nalso Growth Energy. From traditional oil and gas, the American \nPetroleum Institute has endorsed this legislation, as has Tesoro \nCorporation and ExxonMobil, and there are many others. From the service \nstations--the marketers that actually dispense the product--endorsing \nthis legislation is the National Association of Convenience Stores, the \nSociety of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, the Petroleum \nMarketers Association of America, and the National Association of Truck \nStop Operators. From the people who make the equipment, the \nmanufacturers that make the equipment, we have received endorsements as \nwell from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and also \nthe Outdoor Power Equipment Institute.\n  Look, everybody is onboard. Now we need to get to work and get it in \nplace. This is about building the right kind of energy future for our \ncountry. We have to get going. Gasoline prices are $4 at the pump, and \nthey are going higher. We can do something about it, and that is \nexactly what we need to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2271. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe time for making S corporation elections, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nElection Simplification Act with my friends, Senators Snowe and Enzi.\n  I want to thank them for this collaboration, and I especially want to \nacknowledge Senator Snowe for her leadership. As Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Snowe is one\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\nof the Senate's experts on small business issues. She is always working \nto make sure that the Federal Government meets the needs of small \nbusinesses and is committed to creating the best possible environment \nfor entrepreneurs.\n  That is exactly what our legislation is about--making it easier and \nmore straightforward for entrepreneurs to start small businesses.\n  When starting up a new business, entrepreneurs often choose to \norganize their business as an S Corporation because of its simplicity. \nOwners of S Corporations report business income on their individual tax \nreturns. So instead of having their business profits taxed at the \ncorporate level of 35 percent, they pay taxes at their individual \nincome tax rate. Not only is this simpler, but it also often saves \nsmall business owners money.\n  To become an S Corporation, small business owners have to go through \nwhat's called an ``election process'' and submit an election form to \nthe IRS. The deadline to submit this election form is currently set a \nyear in advance of the tax return deadline for businesses. This means \nthat a new small business owner must know to submit the election form a \nfull year before they have to do their taxes.\n  Unsurprisingly, many first-time business owners are unaware of this \nrule and therefore miss the election deadline. These taxpayers must \nwait an additional year before their business becomes an S Corporation, \nwhich can have serious tax consequences. Or they must go through a late \nelection process with the IRS, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n  This is a real problem. In 2009, nearly 100,000 S Corporation returns \ncould not be processed as filed. That was almost a quarter of all new S \nCorporation fillings. Missing or late elections is one of the main \nreasons that returns are rejected as filed.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate--whose job is to watch out for the \nneeds of taxpayers--described the current S Corporation election \nprocess as an undue burden on small businesses. Simplifying the S \nCorporation election process was one of 11 legislative recommendations \noutlined in the National Taxpayer Advocate's 2011 Annual Report to \nCongress.\n  Our legislation does just that. The Small Business Election \nSimplification Act would extend and coordinate S Corporation deadlines. \nIt would match the S Corporation election deadline for new businesses \nwith the deadline for tax returns. This would reduce the number of \ntaxpayers who inadvertently miss the S Corporation election deadline \nand suffer negative tax consequences.\n  To further simplify the process and reduce paperwork, our legislation \nwould also allow new small businesses to elect to become an S \nCorporation simply by designating the election on their S Corporation \ntax return. This would eliminate the need for business owners to fill \nout an additional election form.\n  Here in the Senate, we are always saying that small businesses are \nthe engine of our economy; that they are the job creators; and that we \nneed to support entrepreneurs coming up with the next big idea that \nwill get our economy growing again.\n  Passing the Small Business Election Simplification Act is one thing \nwe can do to help them. It can make a difference right now. By making \nit easier and more straightforward for new small businesses to become S \nCorporations, our legislation would free business owners to concentrate \non the important stuff--like growing their business and hiring new \nworkers, instead of worrying about IRS election form deadlines and \nlearning about complicated business tax rules.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Talkeetna Ranger Station in \nTalkeetna, Alaska, as the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would officially rename the Talkeetna Ranger Station in Talkeetna, \nAlaska, the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station.\n  The Talkeetna Ranger Station, which is the home of Denali National \nPark's mountaineering rangers, sits just about 100 miles south of the \nentrance to the park. Of course, the landmark that's most commonly \nlinked to both the park and the ranger station itself happens to be the \nmountain that features a summit which represents the highest point in \nNorth America: Denali.\n  In fact, anybody who intends to attempt a climb of Mt. McKinley is \nrequired to first stop at the Talkeetna Ranger Station for their permit \nand mountain orientation.\n  It is only fitting, then, that we honor the memory of Alaska Native \nWalter Harper by forever linking his name with this specific ranger \nstation. It was Mr. Harper, that 100 years ago next year became the \nfirst person to reach the summit of Mt. McKinley.\n  My bill is a simple one, and it is not likely to gain much notice \noutside of Alaska. Within my home state, however, this small gesture \nmeans a great deal. Alaskans, like the people who call any other state \nhome, are proud of the historical accomplishments of their fellow \nAlaskans. Walter Harper was one such Alaskan, and his feat is one that \nwill always be remembered.\n  Certainly, officially designating the Talkeetna Ranger Station--the \nvery building where any hiker today planning to climb Mt. McKinley is \nrequired to first stop--the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station is a \nfitting tribute to the man himself, as well as his spot in our state's \nhistory books.\n  June 7 of next year, 2013, will mark the 100 year anniversary of Mr. \nHarper's historic climb. It would truly be special for Alaska and \nAlaskans to have this designation in place by that date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 2276. A bill to permit Federal officers to remove cases involving \ncrimes of violence to Federal court; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that I \nam introducing on behalf of a bipartisan group of Senators, the Officer \nSafety Act of 2012, S. 2276. This bill allows a Federal law enforcement \nagent, who stops a violent crime while off-duty and is indicted in a \nState court for those actions, to petition for the State criminal \nprosecution against him to be removed to Federal court.\n  The bill effectuates this change by amending the Federal removal \nstatute, found in 28 United States Code, Section 1442, to clarify when \na Federal law enforcement officer is acting under the color of his \noffice.\n  As a 2003 Judiciary Committee report stated, ``Law enforcement \nofficers are never `off-duty.' '' Many are required to carry an off-\nduty weapon. When they fly on personal business, they are expected to \ncarry their weapon and check-in with the airline as a Federal law \nenforcement agent so they can defend the pilots and passengers if \nsomething bad happens. In fact, Federal agents are specifically paid to \nbe available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Agents can be disciplined \nif they are not available when called.\n  They are not even allowed to engage in activities on their personal \ntime that regular citizens take for granted, like coaching their kids' \nsports teams, if it might interfere with their ability to respond to a \ncrisis.\n  Federal law enforcement agents are extensively trained, at the \nexpense of the taxpayer for the benefit of the taxpayer. They not only \ntrain in basic academies, but they are required to participate in \nadditional and regular training and re-certifications many times each \nyear. If training is missed or if standards are not up to par, the \nagent is disciplined or removed. Federal law enforcement agencies take \ntraining requirements very seriously. The United States is known for \nhaving the best trained Federal law enforcement officers in the world.\n  So what if one of these exceptionally trained Federal law enforcement \nagents walks into the grocery store on a Saturday and witnesses a woman \nbeing repeatedly hit by her husband; do we want him to walk past the \nwoman? No. The taxpayers spend money on his training so that he can \nprotect victims, not walk away from them. In this situation, we all \nhope that he would use his training to protect the victim. But when he \nsteps in to protect the victim from a crime of violence occurring in \nhis presence, he risks state criminal prosecution and damage to his \ncareer. That might lead him to hesitate. This is contrary to good \npublic policy. If we were the victim in this scenario, every one of us \nwould want that Federal law enforcement officer to help us.\n  If a Federal agent acts to protect an individual in his presence from \na crime of violence, as taxpayer dollars have trained him to do, and \nthen is indicted in State court for that act, he should have the right \nto defend himself within the Federal court system.\n  So the Officer Safety Act amends the removal statute, found in Title \n28, United States Code, Section 1442, to clarify when a Federal law \nenforcement officer is acting under the color of his office. This bill \ndoes not provide immunity for law enforcement agents, and it does not \ngrant them additional authority. It doesn't even guarantee that the \ncase will be moved from State to Federal court: the State will be heard \nand its position will be weighed by the judge before deciding if \nremoval is appropriate. It does allow a Federal law enforcement \nofficer/agent, who is indicted in a State court for actions related to \nhis protection of a victim of a violent crime that is committed in the \nofficer's presence, to petition for that criminal case to be removed to \nFederal court, where the officer will be required to defend his \nactions.\n  Current law provides that removal is proper so long as defendants \ndemonstrate that they are officers of the United States that acted \n``under color of'' their office and have a ``colorable federal \ndefense''.\n  In general, a Federal agent acts ``under color of'' his office when \nhe takes actions that are necessary and reasonable for the discharge of \nhis Federal responsibilities. Accordingly, the prototypical example of \na Federal officer acting under color of his office is a Federal law \nenforcement officer who kills someone while performing an act related \nto Federal law enforcement and, in the subsequent State homicide \nprosecution, claims he was acting in self-defense and/or is entitled to \nofficial immunity. The Supreme Court has upheld this \nprototypical example as appropriate for removal from State court to \nFederal court.\n\n  The primary restraint on the current statute's scope is its \nlimitation to defendants who acted under color of Federal office or, in \nother words, while performing official duties. Defendants must show in \ntheir petition for removal that there is a causal nexus between the \nactions challenged and their Federal duties.\n  The history of the removal statute explains why this is important. \nThe statute dates back to 1815. It was passed in response to the New \nEngland States' opposition to the trade embargo with England during the \nWar of 1812. The law provided for the removal to Federal court of any \nsuit or prosecution commenced in State court against a Federal customs \nofficer or other persons enforcing Federal customs laws.\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nThus, Federal agents did not need to fear performing their jobs because \nthe local authorities opposed the embargo and wanted to stop them from \nenforcing it.\n  A few decades later, the U.S. Government encountered a similar \nproblem in South Carolina, which in 1833 declared certain Federal \ntariff laws unenforceable within its borders. Congress responded by \nauthorizing the removal of any suit or prosecution commenced in a State \ncourt against an officer of the United States for the enforcement of \nthe Federal revenue laws.\n  During the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, Congress' \ndisenchantment with State courts in the South led to new Federal \nofficer removal laws. In the 1863 Habeas Corpus Act, Congress provided \nfor the removal of suits or prosecutions against persons acting under \nFederal authority for actions, or failures to act, during the Civil \nWar. In addition, Congress passed a removal statute similar to those of \n1815 and 1833, authorizing the removal of suits or prosecutions \ncommenced in State court against Federal officers for actions, or \nomissions, related to the collection of Federal revenue. However, it \nwas not until the enactment of the Judicial Code of 1948 that Congress \nextended the statute to cover all Federal officers.\n  The courts view the history behind section 1442 and its statutory \npredecessors as justification for construing the statute broadly to \nassure the supremacy of U.S. law and protect Federal operations against \ninterference from State judicial proceedings.\n  This bill does not infringe upon States' rights, as they retain the \nsame due process rights to be heard on the question of removal that \nhave existed since the early 1800s. In fact, this Congress passed a \nbill by unanimous consent that amended this statute, without a word \nabout States' rights.\n  Today, Federal law enforcement officers, whether or not in uniform, \nrequire protections when they take actions to assist citizens. Civil \nliability protections are provided to officers under The Good Samaritan \nAct, codified at Title 28, United States Code, Section 2671. This bill, \nthe Officer Safety Act, while modeled on the Good Samaritan Act, is \nnarrower, more restrictive, and provides no liability protection. \nRather, this bill clarifies the ``color of law'' prong required in the \nremoval process, as courts have invited Congress to clarify.\n  The bill makes no change to the current standards governing when \nremoval is permissible, and therefore leaves alone existing standards \nand case law. But it provides that in three situations, the law \nenforcement officer who is a defendant in a State criminal prosecution \nwill be deemed to have acted under color of his or her office: when the \nofficer protects a victim from a violent crime committed in the \npresence of the officer; when the officer provides immediate assistance \nto an individual who suffered or is about to suffer imminent bodily \nharm; and when the officer prevents the escape of an individual the \nofficer reasonably believes committed or was about to commit, in the \npresence of the officer, a crime of violence that resulted in or was \nlikely to result in serious bodily injury. I believe that in these \nsituations, the Federal courts should always determine that the law \nenforcement officer acted under the color of his or her office for \npurposes of determining whether to grant the officer's removal \npetition. But the courts remain free to determine under current law \nthat there are other circumstances in which an officer seeking removal \nsatisfies the color of office standard.\n  So the bill is a modest change that nevertheless provides an \nimportant layer of safety for the people who risk their lives day-in \nand day-out to protect us. It will help make our communities safer and \nprotect those who are sworn to guard and serve the American public.\n  This principle and this bill are supported by the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nAgents Association, and the National Border Patrol Council.\n  I want to thank Senator Coons, a member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, who co-chairs the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, and is a \nco-sponsor on this bill. He understands the need to support law \nenforcement officers who risk their lives every day so that we can \nsleep safely at night.\n  Further, I want to thank Senators Coburn and Sessions, also members \nof the Judiciary Committee and co-sponsors. They, too, understand this \nallows us to support Federal agents without spending a dollar.\n  ``Law enforcement officers are never `off-duty.' '' To expect them to \nstandby while a victim suffers violent acts in his presence is contrary \nto the oath they take to protect and renders their tax-funded training \nwasted as a citizen becomes a victim. Please join me in protecting \nthose who protect us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2280. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act and the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 to require certain creditors to obtain \ncertifications from institutions of higher education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau reported that outstanding student loan debt in \nAmerica has hit the $1 trillion mark--student loans.\n  A CFPB official was cited by Bloomberg News saying that ``excessive \nstudent debt could slow the recovery of the housing market, as young \npeople repay money for their education rather than buying homes.'' \nMassive student debt is also affecting consumers' ability to purchase \ngoods and services.\n  Yesterday, at the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General \nGovernment hearing focusing on student debt, Treasury Secretary \nGeithner came to talk about it. While the overall growth of student \nindebtedness is troubling, the most pressing concern is private student \nloans.\n  Secretary Geithner also recognized that private student loans do not \ncome with any of the consumer protections that Federal loans do. \nPrivate student loans are far riskier. Federal student loans have \nfixed, affordable interest rates--3.4 percent. They also have a variety \nof consumer protections. The Federal loans have forbearance in times of \neconomic hardship, and they offer manageable repayment options, such as \nthe income-based repayment plan.\n  Private student loans, on the other hand, often have high variable \ninterest rates--some have been quoted at 18 percent, the kind of rates \nyou are careful about when it comes to your credit--and they have hefty \norigination fees and a lack of repayment options. Private lenders have \ntargeted low-income borrowers with some of the riskiest, highest cost \nloans.\n  In many respects, private student loans are like credit cards--except \nunlike credit card debt, private student loan debt can never be \ndischarged in bankruptcy. In 2005, Congress changed the bankruptcy \nlaws. I want to make a point here: I voted against it. Congress changed \nthe bankruptcy laws and included a provision making private student \nloan debts nondischargeable in bankruptcy, except in the rarest of \ncircumstances. I have never found one that qualifies. That means \nstudents are stuck with their loans for life.\n  While the volume of private student loans is down from its peak a few \nyears ago when it accounted for 26 percent of all student loans, \nprivate lending is still aggressively promoted by the for-profit \ncollege industry. The Project on Student Debt reports that 42 percent \nof for-profit college students had private loans in 2008, up from 12 \npercent 5 years earlier. For-profit college students also graduate with \nmore debt than their peers who graduate from public or private and non-\nprivate colleges. Many for-profit colleges employ a business model that \nsteers students into private student loans because of the 90/10 rule.\n  For the record, private for-profit schools can only receive 90 \npercent of their revenue from the Federal Government. They are the \nclosest darn thing to a Federal agency you have ever seen, except they \nare making millions of dollars at the expense of the government and \nunsuspecting students and their families. So to find the 10 percent of \nnonfederal money, for-profit schools get the students to sign up to pay \nfor 10 percent of their education in private student loans, even if \nthey qualify for Federal loans, which are a much better deal.\n  The 90/10 rule that requires at least 10 percent of revenue from non-\nFederal\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nstudent aid sources makes this an imperative for many for-profit \nschools. As a result, many students are encouraged to take up private \nloans when they are still eligible for Federal loans--even when the \nlenders know the students are going to default--so schools can comply \nwith the 90/10 rule.\n  Kari Schaab contacted my office seeking relief from her burdensome \nstudent debt. She received a bachelor of arts from the International \nAcademy of Design and Technology, a for-profit college. When she spoke \nto an admissions representative, she was enrolled almost immediately. \nLooking back, she says of the school: ``They take whoever is willing to \npay.''\n  She was assured she would be able to obtain a position in her field \nthat would help her pay off her student debt. Reflecting on her \nexperience, she said: ``I was young and didn't understand how much I \nwould owe or what the loans were. I trusted them.''\n  After completing her BA program, she decided that she would pursue a \nmaster's in her field. What she found out shocked her. No schools would \naccept her degree. It was a worthless diploma. With no job, no future \nin her chosen field, and about $58,000 in debt, she decided to switch \ncareers entirely so that she would be able to pay off her student \nloans.\n  She currently attends Oaktown Community College for nursing. She is \nunable to get a mortgage because of her old student loan debt of \n$58,000. Worse yet, her parents, trying to help her out, took out \n$19,000 in loans to help pay her tuition. Her parents are currently in \nchapter 13 bankruptcy, but that loan won't be discharged.\n  We need to begin now to address this looming student debt bomb \ncrisis. We need to protect students and prevent more students from \nstepping into the same traps that have caught so many others.\n  Today, Senator Tom Harkin and I are introducing the Know Before You \nOwe Private Student Loan Act of 2012. Here is what it says: It requires \nthe prospective borrower's school to confirm the student's enrollment \nstatus, the cost of attendance, and the estimated Federal financial aid \nassistance before the private student loan is approved. Often, students \nhaven't applied for Federal student aid before they are asked to apply \nfor private student loans, which are not nearly as generous or \nflexible.\n  Requiring school certifications also gives the school the opportunity \nto make students aware of Federal Government student aid options.\n  The bill requires schools to counsel the student about their options, \ntell them how the private student loan will affect those options, and \nwhat it will cost to repay the loans. Basics.\n  In addition, schools will be required to inform students about the \ndifferences between Federal and private student loans. And the \ndifferences are dramatic. This will give students time to weigh their \noptions, make a choice, and be informed.\n  When students such as Kari contact my office about their student \nloans, they often don't know the difference between the two types of \nloans. They said: ``It was just a student loan, Senator.'' Most go on \nto say that if they had known, they would have thought more carefully \nabout a private student loan and the debt they were incurring.\n  For those students who do decide to take out a private student loan, \nthe bill requires lenders to provide the borrower with quarterly up-to-\ndate information about their balance and interest rate.\n  Finally, the bill requires lenders to report information to the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau about how many students are taking \nout loans and at what rates. There is very little information about \nprivate student loans currently available. More information will help \nCongress and the CFPB effectively inform consumers about these private \nstudent loans.\n  This legislation is supported by a huge coalition of education, \nstudent, and consumer organizations. I want to thank Tom Harkin for his \nwork on this bill, especially all of the hard work he has put in on \nthese for-profit colleges.\n  Mr. President, it is finally dawning on a lot of Members of Congress \nas they see programs such as ``Frontline'' talking about the for-profit \ncollege industry, and as they meet these students who are going to \nthese worthless for-profit colleges--students who are just stacking up \ndebt for a worthless diploma--it is time for our Federal Government to \nstep up. How can we blame a student or their family if they are going \nto a school where we, the Federal Government, are willing to offer Pell \ngrants and Federal loans? What is a student to think? Well, if it is \ngood enough for the Federal Government to loan money, it must be a good \nschool.\n  In fact, in many instances--in most instances--these for-profit \nschools are not good schools. They are not offering a good education. \nThere are exceptions, but too many of them are just bad operations. We \nsubsidize them. Ninety to ninety-five percent of their revenue comes \nstraight from the Federal Government. When they talk about freezing \nFederal employees' salaries, we ought to freeze the employees at these \nfor-profit schools. They are the closest thing to Federal employees we \nhave--95 percent Federal. We don't hear that from the other side of the \naisle. But it is a fact.\n  I will tell you this: This student loan debt bomb we are facing, \nwhich I talked to Secretary of the Treasury Geithner about yesterday, \nis going to explode on us, just as the subprime market loans did. More \nand more students are going into default. They can't pay back these \nstudent loans, and they are going to face life decisions that will \nchange their futures and the future of the American economy.\n  We now have 40 percent of students who are making payments on their \nstudent loans--40 percent. Sixty percent are not. Some are still in \nschool, I will concede that point, but many of them just can't do it. \nWe pile this debt on, we give them preferred treatment in the \nBankruptcy Court so the lenders can't have the debt discharged, and we \nsit there and watch as the lives of these young people deteriorate.\n  As one young lady testified at my hearing that she borrowed $37,625 \nfrom the Federal government, $40,925 in private loans. She went to the \nHarrington College of Design in the suburbs of Chicago and ended up \nwith a worthless diploma--worthless. Five years later, her debt is no \nlonger $78,000; it is $98,000. It just keeps going up. She pays $830 a \nmonth, and the private student loan debt is exploding right in front of \nher. She can't pay it. She doesn't know what she is going to do. She \nsaid she is going to have to give up the little home she and her \nhusband just bought. It looks pretty desperate for her, and her \ndesperate situation faces her at the age of 32--32.\n  How do we let this happen? Don't we have an obligation as a \ngovernment, as a people, to stop this exploitation of children and \ntheir families? That is what is going on.\n  This bill I have put in today will require these schools--all \nschools--to tell the students first that they have Federal loan \neligibility left. It is 3.4 percent, not 18 percent. There is loan \nforgiveness if they become a nurse or a teacher. It is based on the \namount of income they have later in life what their repayment is going \nto be. If they do get into trouble, they can have a delay in payment \nwithout watching their loan just stack up. These are basic things we \nbuild into the law to help students. Students and their families ought \nto know that, and that is what this bill is about.\n  I commend this bill to my colleagues. I hope they will join Senator \nHarkin and me. I want to offer this on the Senate floor, and I want \nsome colleagues to go home and face this student loan issue and listen \nto the families they represent. We are hearing from our Web site, and I \ninvite students and families to come to my official Web site to tell \ntheir stories. As we learn what it is all about, we see the need to \nmove on this, and move quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the authorization of appropriations to \ncarry out approved wetlands conservation projects under the North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act through fiscal year 2017; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nreauthorization of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, NAWCA. \nThis bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and I am pleased to have \nSenators Boxer, Vitter, Landrieu, Cochran, Johnson, and Klobuchar as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  In fact, this is a conservation program that has long enjoyed support \non both sides of the aisle. Back in 2006, I worked with my colleagues \nto pass the last reauthorization of this program by unanimous consent \nand was pleased that President Bush signed the bill into law.\n  This bill also has the support of many conservation and hunting \ngroups including: Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and \nWildlife Agencies, Boone and Crockett Club, Bowhunting Preservation \nAlliance, Catch-A-Dream Foundation, Congressional Sportsmen's \nFoundation, Conservation Force, Dallas Safari Club, Delta Waterfowl, \nDucks Unlimited, Izaak Walton League of America, Mule Deer Foundation, \nNational Assembly of\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nSportsmen's Caucuses, National Rifle Association, National Trappers \nAssociation, National Wild Turkey Foundation, North American Bear \nFoundation, North American Grouse Partnership, Orion-The Hunters' \nInstitute, Pheasants Forever, Pope and Young Club, Public Lands \nFoundation, Quail Forever, Quality Deer Management Association, Rocky \nMountain Elk Foundation, Ruffed Grouse Society, Safari Club \nInternational, Texas Wildlife Association, The Conservation Fund, \nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Whitetails Unlimited, \nWildlife Forever, and Wildlife Management Institute\n  NAWCA was first enacted in 1989 and incentivizes non-federal \ncontributions to maintain and restore wetland habitat throughout North \nAmerica. Since its inception, each Federal dollar has been matched, on \naverage, by $3.20 in state and private funds. Not only do these funds \nhelp to support waterfowl populations that were once nearing all time \nlows, these voluntary projects also support nearly 7,500 new jobs \nannually.\n  The success of this program lies in the fact that these projects are \nnot top down regulations coming from the Federal Government. These \nprojects involve multiple partners from private organizations and the \nFederal Government who work together voluntarily to protect and restore \nmillions of acres of wetlands.\n  In my home State of Oklahoma, NAWCA currently has 12 projects either \ncompleted or underway. These projects have conserved 26,869 acres of \nwildlife habitat and leveraged $11.3 million in partner contributions. \nThese projects benefit outdoor recreation, hunting and fishing, as well \nas boosting local economies.\n  NAWCA is a great example of how environmental conservation should be \nachieved. This program should put to rest the notion that voluntary \nefforts aren't successful. I would argue that these voluntary programs \nhave been more successful and more cost effective than other mandatory \nFederal regulations.\n  I look forward to this reauthorization moving quickly through the \nSenate. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2257-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 411--CONGRATULATING THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY \n IFC/PANHELLENIC DANCE MARATHON ON ITS CONTINUED SUCCESS IN SUPPORT OF \n    THE FOUR DIAMONDS FUND AT PENN STATE HERSHEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. CASEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 412\n\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is one of Africa's \n     oldest and most violent armed groups, responsible for \n     committing crimes against humanity against civilian \n     populations, including women and children, and believed to be \n     operating since 2006 in the Central African Republic, the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, and what would become South \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas the ongoing atrocities committed by LRA members \n     target innocent civilians, including women and children, and \n     include abduction, murder, mutilation, burning and looting of \n     villages, and destruction of communities and livelihoods, \n     causing the massive displacement of human populations and \n     creating a humanitarian crisis;\n       Whereas the abduction of children and their forced \n     conversion into LRA fighters is an LRA hallmark and involves \n     initiating children into combat through brutal methods and \n     brainwashing and subjects girls to forced sexual slavery and \n     servitude;\n       Whereas the governments of those countries most affected by \n     the LRA's reign of terror for over twenty years, including \n     Uganda, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo, and what would become Southern Sudan, are leading \n     efforts, with international support, to apprehend Kony and \n     neutralize the LRA;\n       Whereas the African Union convened a regional ministerial \n     meeting in October 2010 to bring together countries affected \n     by the LRA, the United Nations, and international partners to \n     address the LRA threat and promote humanitarian assistance \n     and development aid to affected populations, and subsequently \n     authorized, in November 2011, the Regional Cooperation \n     Initiative for the Elimination of the Lord's Resistance Army \n     (RCI-LRA), with a mission to strengthen the operational \n     capabilities of the affected countries and create an \n     environment conducive to stabilizing those areas;\n       Whereas, on March 5, 2012, the nonprofit organization \n     Invisible Children reinvigorated the national and global \n     dialogue on the LRA and Kony by engaging millions of young \n     citizens via creative social media and inspiring them to \n     demand action and accountability of global leaders, which in \n     turn has mobilized leaders within and outside of the United \n     States Government in support of these concerns;\n       Whereas, on March 24, 2012, the African Union's Special \n     Envoy for the LRA, Francisco Madeira, and Head of the United \n     Nation's Regional Office for Central Africa, Abou Moussa, \n     launched the operational phase of RCI-LRA by formally \n     announcing the planned deployment of up to 5,000 soldiers to \n     advance anti-LRA and anti-Kony efforts, and the next day \n     formally inaugurated the Headquarters of the Regional Task \n     Force in South Sudan to coordinate efforts to eliminate Kony \n     and neutralize the LRA;\n       Whereas, in December 2008, Operation Lightning Thunder, a \n     multinational effort, failed to capture and kill Kony in \n     northern Congo, and escaping LRA fighters killed more than \n     800 civilians, abducted at least 160 children, and pillaged \n     villages en route to the Central African Republic in an \n     incident known as the Christmas Massacres, according to Human \n     Rights Watch;

Res. 413\n\n       Whereas autism is a general term used to describe a group \n     of complex developmental brain disorders known as pervasive \n     developmental disorders, commonly known as autism spectrum \n     disorders;\n       Whereas autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that \n     results in difficulties with communication and social \n     interaction, as well as repetitive behaviors;\n       Whereas autism affects individuals differently, mildly \n     affecting some and significantly disabling others;\n       Whereas according to a 2012 report published by the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 2008, autism \n     affects an estimated 1 in every 88 children in the United \n     States, including 1 in 54 boys, which is a 23 percent \n     increase from 2006;\n       Whereas autism is 4 times more likely to be diagnosed in \n     boys than in girls;\n       Whereas autism can affect anyone regardless of race, \n     ethnicity, or other factors;\n       Whereas the lifetime incremental cost of caring for a \n     person with autism is $3,200,000;\n       Whereas the cost nationally of caring for persons affected \n     by autism is estimated to be at least $90,000,000,000 per \n     year;\n       Whereas the number of autistic adults grows daily and, \n     absent fundamental breakthroughs, will continue to increase \n     in the years and decades ahead;\n       Whereas it is both a moral and fiscal imperative that \n     services be made available that maximize the potential of \n     each unique adult living with autism to contribute to the \n     greatest extent possible to the society and economy of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas it is well established that early intervention can \n     improve outcomes by significantly improving the cognitive, \n     language, and adaptive skills of people with autism;\n       Whereas the promise of early intervention is not being \n     realized as close to 80 percent of adults with autism, even \n     those without an intellectual disability, are unemployed and \n     living at home with relatives rather than independently;\n       Whereas a variety of physical, medical, and mental-health \n     issues may accompany autism, resulting in marked functional \n     impairment in all activities of daily living;\n       Whereas these conditions may include epilepsy, Down \n     syndrome, fragile X syndrome, gastrointestinal problems, \n     immune-system disorders, sleep disturbance, sensory \n     integration dysfunction, and metabolic disorders;\n       Whereas many individuals on the autism spectrum face co-\n     occurring mental-health challenges, including anxiety, \n     obsessive compulsions, and depression;\n       Whereas individuals living with autism are highly valued \n     and deserve the highest level of dignity and acceptance by \n     society; and\n       Whereas April 2012 would be an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Autism Awareness Month to increase \n     public awareness of the need to support individuals with \n     autism and the family members and medical professionals who \n     care for individuals with autism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses support designating April 2012 as National \n     Autism Awareness Month;\n       (2) recognizes and commends both individuals living with \n     autism and the parents and relatives of those individuals for \n     the sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special \n     needs of autistic individuals and for absorbing financial \n     costs for specialized education, medical clinical \n     interventions, and support services;\n       (3) recognizes that--\n       (A) autism is a major public health crisis that is taking \n     an enormous toll on millions of families who need answers \n     that can come only through further research;\n       (B) meeting the education, employment, and service-\n     provision needs of individuals on the autism spectrum is a \n     clear and compelling public policy issue that requires a \n     rapid national response; and\n       (C) individuals and families are desperate to access \n     services that are, at this point, inadequate to meet the \n     current and growing needs of individuals with autism;\n       (4) stresses the need to begin early intervention services \n     soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism, noting \n     that there is a strong consensus that intensive treatment as \n     soon as possible following diagnosis can significantly \n     improve cognitive functioning, language, and adaptive \n     behavior, reduce the cost of lifetime care, and yield the \n     most positive life outcomes for children with autism;\n       (5) recognizes--\n       (A) the importance of assistance in the areas of \n     comprehensive early intervention, health, recreation, job \n     training, employment, housing, transportation, and early, \n     primary, and secondary education; and\n       (B) that with access to, and assistance with, this type of \n     service and support, individuals with autism can live rich, \n     full, and productive lives;\n       (6) recognizes that services for transitioning youth and \n     adults with autism are an especially pressing need, as are \n     services that enhance the safety of individuals with autism \n     of any age; and\n       (7) recognizes that by providing adequate service and \n     support at crucial points in life, adults with autism can \n     become tax-paying citizens with productive and rewarding \n     lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2258-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 414--COMMEMORATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT PEMBROKE\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Hagan) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 416\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is the second most common \n     neurodegenerative disease in the United States, second only \n     to Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the \n     incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as of 2011, \n     it is estimated that the disease affects from 500,000 to \n     1,500,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's \n     disease is a combination of genetic and environmental \n     factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is \n     still unknown;\n       Whereas there is no objective test for Parkinson's disease, \n     and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;\n       Whereas symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to \n     person and include tremors, slowness, difficulty with \n     balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity, cognitive \n     problems, dementia, mood disorders, such as depression and \n     anxiety, constipation, skin problems, and sleep disruptions;\n       Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's \n     disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with \n     dose-limiting side effects;\n       Whereas ultimately the medications and treatments lose \n     their effectiveness, generally after 4 to 8 years, leaving \n     the person unable to move, speak, or swallow;\n       Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt \n     the progression of Parkinson's disease; and\n       Whereas increased education and research are needed to help \n     find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, \n     ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson's \n     disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month;\n       (3) continues to support research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;\n       (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance knowledge of \n     the disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of local and regional \n     organizations, volunteers, and millions of Americans across \n     the country working to improve the quality of life of persons \n     living with Parkinson's disease and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2259-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 417--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                           PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \nMr. Akaka, Mr. Coons, Mr. Tester, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Begich, Mr. Brown of \nOhio, and Mr. Johnson of South Dakota) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

We are both committed--the Republican \nleader and I--we are committed to doing appropriations bills this year, \nand we have to do that.

Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to enforce policies that infringe on fundamental \n     freedoms of Tibetans, including punitive security measures \n     against monasteries, mass arrests, and restrictions on \n     freedom to practice religion;\n       Whereas both the Dalai Lama and the Kalon Tripa, Dr. \n     Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister democratically elected by \n     the Tibetan exile community, have specifically stated that \n     they do not seek independence for Tibet from China;\n       Whereas, in his inaugural address on August 8, 2011, Kalon \n     Tripa Sangay stated that he will ``continue the Middle-Way \n     policy, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the \n     People's Republic of China'';\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's 2011 Report \n     on Tibet Negotiations, since 2002, nine rounds of talks \n     between the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     envoys of the Dalai Lama ``have not borne concrete results'';\n       Whereas, despite persistent efforts by the Dalai Lama and \n     his representatives, the Government of the People's Republic \n

Republic of \n     China in Tibetan monasteries, stating that such measures \n     ``not only curtail the right to freedom of religion or \n     belief, but further exacerbate the existing tensions, and are \n     counterproductive'' and affirming that ``the right of members \n     of the\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\n     monastic community, and the wider community to freely \n     practice their religion, should be fully respected and \n     guaranteed by the Chinese Government'';\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2012, Maria Otero, Under Secretary \n     for Civilian Security, Democracy and

Tibetan areas of China, \n     including reports of security forces in Sichuan province \n     opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring \n     others'';\n       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but \n     the July-December 2010 International Religious Freedom Report \n     of the Department of State states that ``the [Chinese] \n     government's repression of religious freedom remained severe \n     in the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas'';\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     announced that he would relinquish his last remaining \n     governmental duties in the Central Tibetan Administration, \n     and would turn over political authority to the leadership \n     democratically elected by Tibetans in exile;\n       Whereas, on March 20, 2011, the Tibetan government in exile \n     conducted competitive democratic elections that were \n     monitored by international observers and deemed free, fair, \n     and consistent with international standards;\n       Whereas nearly 50,000 people in over 30 countries, more \n     than half of all the eligible Tibetan exiles voters, \n     participated in the March 20, 2011, elections;\n       Whereas Dr. Lobsang Sangay was elected Kalon Tripa, or \n     prime minister, of the

Res. 356\n\n       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism, and His \n     Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the most revered \n     figure in Tibetan Buddhism;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to enforce policies that infringe on fundamental \n     freedoms of Tibetans, including punitive security measures \n     against monasteries, mass arrests, and restrictions on \n     freedom to practice religion;\n       Whereas both the Dalai Lama and the Kalon Tripa, Dr. \n     Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister democratically elected by \n     the Tibetan exile community, have specifically stated that \n     they do not seek independence for Tibet from China;\n       Whereas, in his inaugural address on August 8, 2011, Kalon \n     Tripa Sangay stated that he will ``continue the Middle-Way \n     policy, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the \n     People's Republic of China'';\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's 2011 Report \n     on Tibet Negotiations, since 2002, nine rounds of talks \n     between the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     envoys of the Dalai Lama ``have not borne concrete results'';\n       Whereas despite persistent efforts by the Dalai Lama and \n     his representatives, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China and envoys of the Dalai Lama have not held any \n     formal dialogue since January 2010;\n       Whereas, since March 2011, more than two dozen Tibetans \n     have set themselves on fire, and at least 19 have died;\n       Whereas the repressive policies of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China have created an environment of \n     despair, hopelessness, and frustration among many Tibetans;\n       Whereas, on November 1, 2011, the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Heiner \n     Bielefeldt, expressed concern over ``restrictive measures'' \n     implemented by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China in Tibetan monasteries, stating that such measures \n     ``not only curtail the right to freedom of religion or \n     belief, but further exacerbate the existing tensions, and are \n     counterproductive'' and affirming that ``the right of members \n     of the monastic community, and the wider community to freely \n     practice their religion, should be fully respected and \n     guaranteed by the Chinese Government'';\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2012, Maria Otero, Under Secretary \n     for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, and United \n     States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, issued a \n     statement expressing concern about ``reports of violence and \n     continuing heightened tensions in Tibetan areas of China, \n     including reports of security forces in Sichuan province \n     opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring \n     others'';\n       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but \n     the July-December 2010 International Religious Freedom Report \n     of the Department of State states that ``the [Chinese] \n     government's repression of religious freedom remained severe \n     in the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas'';\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     announced that he would relinquish his last remaining \n     governmental duties in the Central Tibetan Administration, \n     and would turn over political authority to the leadership \n     democratically elected by Tibetans in exile;\n       Whereas, on March 20, 2011, the Tibetan government in exile \n     conducted competitive democratic elections that were \n     monitored by international observers and deemed free, fair, \n     and consistent with international standards;\n       Whereas nearly 50,000 people in over 30 countries, more \n     than half of all the eligible Tibetan exiles voters, \n     participated in the March 20, 2011, elections;\n       Whereas Dr. Lobsang Sangay was elected Kalon Tripa, or \n     prime minister, of the Central Tibetan Administration after \n     receiving 55 percent of votes in the March 20, 2011, election \n     and was inaugurated on August 8, 2011;\n       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay was selected to study in the \n     United States under the Department of State's Tibetan \n     Scholarship Program, earning a doctorate in law from Harvard \n     University, and served as a Senior Fellow at the East Asian \n     Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School;\n       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay, while at Harvard University, \n     promoted dialogue among Tibetan exiles and Chinese students \n     and visiting Chinese scholars to enhance mutual understanding \n     and advance the prospects for reconciliation; and\n       Whereas it is the objective of the United States \n     Government, consistent across administrations of different \n     political parties and as articulated in the Tibetan Policy \n     Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public Law 107 228; 22 \n     U.S.C. 6901 note) to promote a substantive dialogue between \n     the Government of the People's Republic of China and the \n     Dalai Lama or his representatives in order to secure genuine \n     autonomy for the Tibetan people within China: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the death of Tibetans who have self-immolated \n     and deplores the repressive policies targeting Tibetans;\n       (2) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to suspend implementation of religious control \n     regulations, reassess religious and security policies \n     implemented since 2008 in Tibet, and resume a dialogue with \n     Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives, to resolve underlying grievances;\n       (3) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to release all persons that have been arbitrarily \n     detained; to cease the intimidation, harassment and detention \n     of peaceful protestors; and to allow unrestricted access to \n     journalists, foreign diplomats, and international \n     organizations to Tibet;\n       (4) calls on the Secretary of State to seek from the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China a full \n     accounting of the forcible removal of monks from Kirti \n     Monastery, including an explanation of the pretext or \n     conditions under which monks were removed and their current \n     whereabouts;\n       (5) commends His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his decision \n     to devolve his political power in favor of a democratic \n     system;\n       (6) congratulates Tibetans living in exile for holding, on \n     March 20, 2011, a competitive, multi-candidate election that \n     was free, fair, and met international electoral standards;\n       (7) reaffirms the unwavering friendship between the people \n     of the United States and the people of Tibet; and\n       (8) both--\n       (A) calls on the Department of State to fully implement the \n     Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public \n     Law 107 228; 22 U.S.C. 6901 note), including the stipulation \n     that the Secretary of State seek ``to\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\n     establish an office in Lhasa, Tibet, to monitor political, \n     economic, and cultural developments in Tibet'', and also to \n     provide consular protection and citizen services in \n     emergencies;

They seek to promote stability \n     and well-being in the North Atlantic area. They are resolved \n     to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the \n     preservation of peace and security.'';\n       Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic \n     security cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting \n     stability in Europe and throughout the world for over 60 \n     years;\n       Whereas the NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, is an \n     opportunity to enhance and more deeply entrench those \n     principles, which continue to bind the alliance together and \n     guide our efforts today;\n       Whereas the new Strategic Concept, approved in Lisbon, \n     Portugal in November 2010, affirms that all NATO members \n     ``are determined that NATO will continue to play its unique \n     and essential role in ensuring our common defence and \n     security'' and that NATO ``continues to be effective in a \n     changing world, against new threats, with new capabilities \n     and new partners'';\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit will mark a critical turning \n     point for NATO and a chance to focus on current operations, \n     future capabilities, and the relationship between NATO and \n     partners around the world;\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit will be the first NATO summit \n     held in the United States since the 50th anniversary summit \n     was held in Washington, District of Columbia, in 1999 and the \n     first NATO summit held outside of Washington, District of \n     Columbia;\n       Whereas NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, \n     ``Chicago is a city built upon diversity, and on \n     determination. Those are values that underpin NATO too.'';\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit presents an opportunity to show \n     to the world the Heartland of the United States--the site of \n     the first elevated railway, the first skyscraper in the \n     world, the busiest futures exchange in the world, and the \n     starting point for historic Route 66;\n       Whereas the thousands of visitors to the Chicago Summit \n     will have the opportunity to enjoy the hospitality of the \n     city of Chicago, the 77 distinct neighborhoods in Chicago, \n     and the State of Illinois; and\n       Whereas the contributions of generations of immigrants have \n     made the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois what they \n     are today and the ancestral homelands of the immigrants now \n     contribute to making NATO the organization it is today: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the service of the brave men and women who \n     have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the \n     United States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance;\n       (2) honors the sacrifices of United States personnel, \n     allies of the North American\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n     Treaty Organization (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``NATO''), and partners in Afghanistan;\n       (3) remembers the 63 years NATO has served to ensure peace, \n     security, and stability in Europe and throughout the world;\n       (4) reaffirms that NATO, through the new Strategic Concept, \n     is oriented for the changing international security \n     environment and the challenges of the future;\n       (5) urges all NATO members to take concrete steps to \n     implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the NATO \n     summit in Chicago, Illinois, to address current NATO \n     operations, future capabilities and burden-sharing issues, \n     and the relationship between NATO and partners around the \n     world;\n       (6) conveys appreciation for the steadfast partnership \n     between NATO and the United States; and\n       (7) expresses support for the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2280-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2280-S2282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PROMOTING PEACE AND STABILITY IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 414\n\nCommemorating the 125th anniversary of the University of North Carolina \n                              at Pembroke\n\n       Whereas the University of North Carolina at Pembroke \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``the University'') was \n     founded on March 7, 1887, in Robeson County, North Carolina \n     by an act of the General Assembly of North Carolina;\n       Whereas the University, originally named the Croatan Normal \n     School, was created in response to a petition from the Indian \n     people of Robeson County;\n       Whereas the University was founded for the purpose of \n     training American Indian school teachers;\n       Whereas the University opened in the fall of 1887 with 15 \n     students and 1 teacher;\n       Whereas the University moved to its present location in \n     Pembroke, North Carolina in 1909;\n       Whereas a 2-year program beyond high school was added to \n     the University in 1926;\n       Whereas the length of the program of college studies at the \n     University was extended to 4 years in 1939;\n       Whereas, in 1941, the General Assembly of North Carolina \n     changed the name of the University to Pembroke State College \n     for Indians;\n       Whereas, until 1953, the University was the only State-\n     supported 4-year college for Indians in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 1969, the General Assembly of North Carolina \n     changed the name of the University to Pembroke State \n     University and made the University a regional State \n     university that provided instruction at both the \n     undergraduate level and the graduate level;\n       Whereas, in 1972, the General Assembly of North Carolina \n     established the 17-campus University of North Carolina system \n     and made Pembroke State University 1 of the constituent \n     institutions of the system;\n       Whereas, on July 1, 1996, Pembroke State University became \n     the University of North Carolina at Pembroke;\n       Whereas, today, approximately 6,000 students from diverse \n     backgrounds are enrolled in 41 undergraduate programs and 17 \n     graduate programs at the University of North Carolina at \n     Pembroke; and\n       Whereas March 7, 2012, marks the 125th anniversary of the \n     founding of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the 125th \n     anniversary of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.\n\n                              S. Res. 415\n\n    Designating April 4, 2012, as ``National Association of Junior \n                           Auxiliaries Day''\n\n       Whereas the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries and \n     the members of the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries \n     provide valuable service and leadership opportunities for \n     women who wish to take an active role in their communities;\n       Whereas the mission of the National Association of Junior \n     Auxiliaries is to encourage member chapters to render \n     charitable services that--\n       (1) are beneficial to the general public; and\n       (2) place a particular emphasis on providing for the needs \n     of children; and\n       Whereas since the founding of the National Association of \n     Junior Auxiliaries in 1941, the organization has provided \n     strength and inspiration to women who want to effect positive \n     change in their communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 4, 2012, as ``National Association of \n     Junior Auxiliaries Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the great contributions made by members of \n     the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries to their \n     communities and to the people of the United States; and\n       (3) especially commends the work of the members of the \n     National Association of Junior Auxiliaries to better the \n     lives of children in the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 416\n\n   Supporting the designation of April as Parkinson's Awareness Month\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is the second most common \n     neurodegenerative disease in the United States, second only \n     to Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the \n     incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as of 2011, \n     it is estimated that the disease affects from 500,000 to \n     1,500,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's \n     disease is a combination of genetic and environmental \n     factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is \n     still unknown;\n       Whereas there is no objective test for Parkinson's disease, \n     and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;\n       Whereas symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to \n     person and include tremors, slowness, difficulty with \n     balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity, cognitive \n     problems, dementia, mood disorders, such as depression and \n     anxiety, constipation, skin problems, and sleep disruptions;\n       Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's \n     disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with \n     dose-limiting side effects;\n       Whereas ultimately the medications and treatments lose \n     their effectiveness, generally after 4 to 8 years, leaving \n     the person unable to move, speak, or swallow;\n       Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt \n     the progression of Parkinson's disease; and\n       Whereas increased education and research are needed to help \n     find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, \n     ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson's \n     disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month;\n       (3) continues to support research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;\n       (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance knowledge of \n     the disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of local and regional \n     organizations, volunteers, and millions of Americans across \n     the country working to improve the quality of life of persons \n     living with Parkinson's disease and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2282-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 5\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was surprised earlier today when I was \ntold by David Schiappa and Gary Myrick that somebody I care about a \ngreat deal is going to leave the Senate. I am so surprised. I served \nhere when her dad was the Parliamentarian and I thought so much of him. \nHe was a very courageous man. He jeopardized his position here in the \nSenate doing what he thought was right. He looked at the law. It didn't \nmatter to him if it were a Republican asking for a decision or a \nDemocrat, he did what he thought was right. I have so much admiration \nfor Bob Dove.\n  Then I have gotten to know his daughter Laura, whom we all care about \na great deal. She is somebody I can joke with or be serious with. She \nunderstands what my obligation is here as the majority leader and she \ndoesn't hold it against me. She knows I am trying to do what I think is \nright.\n  She has been dedicated to making the Senate a better place during her \n10 years as the assistant Republican secretary. This is her last week \nwith us so, for me, since we are going to go out of session, this is \nher last day with us. She is an example of how this operation works.\n  Mr. President, I read through this stack of stuff very quickly. Could \nI have arranged all that myself? No. It is the Laura Doves of the \nSenate who allow us to get our work done. She was a page, just like \nthese young boys and girls here, as a teenager. She may work for the \nother party but, as far as I am concerned, I never hesitated to ask her \na question when somebody on this side wasn't available and she never \nhesitated to tell me what she thought or give me the information I was \nseeking. Her work is essential and she has done it with dedication.\n  Laura, I really have appreciated our relationship. Please give my \nwarm regards to your very fine father. I have heard a little about what \nyou are going to do in the next little bit. I hope as you have that \nmotor home and come to Las Vegas, hopefully this summer, you will come \nto Searchlight, because that will be a place you have never been--I am \nsure of that. What could I do with you there, though? I could show you \nmy home.\n  Anyway, I am so grateful to you for being the nice person you are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/29/senate-section/article/S2283-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 2, TO MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it adjourn and convene for pro forma \nsessions only, with no business conducted on the following dates. The \nreason we are going through this pro forma session which we thought we \nwere through with is the House has not acted yet on agreeing to what we \nhave done. But it is very clear there will be no recess appointments, \nperiod, because we are not going to be in recess, we hope. We hope the \nHouse will go along with us. But that is what Senator McConnell and I \nhave worked for and it has been accomplished.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness today, it adjourn and convene for pro forma sessions only, \nwith no business conducted, on the following dates and times, and that \nfollowing each pro forma session, the Senate adjourn until the next pro \nforma session: Monday, April 2, at 2 p.m.; Thursday, April 5, at 11 \na.m.; Monday, April 9, at 10 a.m.; Thursday, April 12, at 2 p.m.; and \nthat the Senate adjourn on Thursday, April 12, until 2 p.m. on Monday, \nApril 16, unless the Senate has received a message from the House that \nit has adopted S.
