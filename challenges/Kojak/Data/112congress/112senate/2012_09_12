I was disturbed and saddened to learn late last night of \nthe deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other personnel in an \nattack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. I would be happy to talk by name \nabout them, but their names have not been released at this stage. It \ndoesn't take away from how important the jobs are of these Foreign \nService officers.\n  I join President Obama in condemning these senseless acts of \nviolence. My thoughts are with the families of those who were killed in \nthis horrible attack. It is too often forgotten that American diplomats \nrisk their lives on a daily basis.\n  I had the good fortune in my days on the Foreign Affairs Committee in \nthe House to travel the world. I always make sure, wherever I go, to \nvisit with the Foreign Service personnel. They are everyplace. There is \nno group of people--and I tell them this every time I have the \nopportunity to visit with them--who do more for our country in a \npositive sense than these Foreign Service officers. They work so hard, \nand most of the time their duty stations are very difficult.\n  For example, take this good man, Ambassador Stevens, who was just \nconfirmed a few months ago. He was a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco. \nHe taught English there. He was fluent in Arabic, French, and English. \nHe served in the Foreign Service in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia. \nHe was the Staff Assistant of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. He \nhad an education that was really unbelievably strong and powerful. He \ngraduated from Berkeley. He had a law degree from Hastings, one of the \npremier law schools in the country. He had a master's degree from the \nNational War College. What a loss to our country.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6241, September 12, 2012, the Record reads: . . . \nForeign Service in Jerusalem, Cairo, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Foreign \nService in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Our diplomatic corps is filled with admirable and dedicated public \nservants, and the four Americans who lost\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\ntheir lives yesterday exemplify the courage that happens every day in \ndiplomatic posts around the globe. They learn the language, and they \nlive with the people wherever they go.\n  As I have indicated, I have traveled to many of the American \nEmbassies abroad. I have always been so impressed and grateful for \ntheir leadership, and I communicate that to them every chance I get. We \nare so fortunate to have had Hillary Clinton leading the State \nDepartment for the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  I have indicated that Ambassador Stevens was not a political \nappointment; he was a Foreign Service officer. As I indicated, he \nserved in the Peace Corps and spent his life giving his time and his \ntalents to drum up democracy and American values around the world.\n  I support President Obama's directive to increase securing our \ndiplomatic posts around the world and provide whatever resources are \nnecessary to keep our personnel in Libya safe. I will continue to \nmonitor the situation as we learn more about these terrible events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6242-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JAMES BILLINGTON'S 25 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Henry Ward Beecher, the famous \nabolitionist, once said, ``A library is not a luxury, but one of the \nnecessities of life.'' I agree. Our Founding Fathers also agreed, and \nthat is why we have the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress \nwas initially the library of Thomas Jefferson. That is what started the \nLibrary of Congress. It was established in 1800. It was this country's \nfirst Federal cultural institution. It is the largest library in the \nworld. There are 35 million books and 838 miles of bookshelves. The \nnumbers are staggering. Almost 10,000 new items are added every day.\n  For 25 years the Librarian of Congress has been Dr. James Billington. \nHe has been a faithful and effective leader. I first got to know Dr. \nBillington in 1986 when I came to the Senate. There was a little \nsquabble between a couple of the more senior Senators, which was a \nwonderful opportunity for me because one of the very senior Senators \nthought that maybe he deserved more than being the chair of the \nSubcommittee on the Legislative Branch. I grabbed that. I was happy to \ndo that. I loved that experience. I learned a lot about what goes on \nhere and how we pay for things. At that time it was an effort to really \nhurt the Library of Congress, so I had that opportunity to stand for \nthe Library of Congress. Every time we had a vote, we won and they were \nnot able to damage the Library of Congress.\n  I got to know Dr. Billington. I had the good fortune to travel once \nwith him to Russia. Dr. Billington, before coming to the Library of \nCongress, was one of the foremost scholars on the former Soviet Union. \nHe knew everything about that land. He still writes about the new \nRussia. He is a very stalwart academic. When he took over the Library \nof Congress in 1987, computers were a scarcity, but he had a vision of \nwhat the future should be, and he thought it would be important to \ndigitize the Library's collections and make them available on the \nInternet. There was a little pushback at first, but, of course, now \nthat is history. That is what happened.\n  I have such admiration for him as a person. He is a good person not \nonly from an academic standing but as an administrator. I am glad they \nwere unable to slash the Library's budget as they tried, and as a \nresult, people came to a better understanding of what the Library of \nCongress was all about. I am glad I was able to play a part in that. He \nhas always ensured that the Library of Congress would remain an \nunmatched resource for knowledge and enlightenment. So it is with \npleasure that I congratulate my friend Dr. Billington on 25 years--a \nquarter of a century--of dedicated service at the Library of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6242-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Very quickly, Madam President, I was very disappointed to \nhear Speaker Boehner say yesterday that he was giving up on reaching a \nbipartisan agreement to avoid huge cuts to both domestic and defense \nprograms. I don't feel that way. I can assure everyone within the sound \nof my voice that I have not given up on finding a reasonable and \nbalanced approach to reducing our debt and avoiding these difficult \ncuts. Democrats agree that across-the-board cuts are not the best way \nto solve the problems. Sequestration is a bitter pill, but we did that \non purpose. That was no accident. That is why there was overwhelming \nsupport for the budget deficit reduction act to have sequestration. The \nsequestration was engineered to be hard to take, so it forced us to \ncompromise. It was designed to be tough enough to force the two sides \nto reach a balanced deal. That is why there was widespread bipartisan \nsupport for this.\n  I hope Speaker Boehner will reconsider. I believe it is much too \nearly to give up. I urge my Republican colleagues not to give up on \nthemselves because I am not going to give up on them. It is time for \nthem to stop rooting for the economy to fail and root for Congress to \nsucceed and reach common ground. Remember, the markets are watching our \nevery move, with Moody's saying yesterday that they were thinking of \ndowngrading our debt standing credit rating. This is not the right time \nto say there is no hope in getting things done. I disagree. I say that \nthe glass is half full, not half empty.\n  The Speaker's statement came an hour after that reminder from Moody's \ncame forward. We are willing to work. I say that to my friend John \nBoehner and to everyone else. We are willing to negotiate, we are \nwilling to cooperate, we are willing to consider the difficult cuts to \nprograms we hold dear, and I think the Republicans should do the same. \nSo far they have refused. Due to the orders of their leader Grover \nNorquist, they have refused to raise even a penny of new revenue. They \nhave refused to ask millionaires to contribute their fair share to help \nreduce the debt and the deficit. And Democrats won't agree to a one-\nsided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing \nthe middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship. I \nrepeat, we are willing to consider difficult cuts to programs we \nbelieve are extremely important.\n  The sequestration is not a perfect legislative tool, but rarely do we \ndo anything legislatively that is perfect. That is the way it has been \nfor generations. But at least it has the benefit of being a balanced \napproach, and it has the power of law.\n  Republicans, including Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan, would \ndo well to remember that they voted for the sequestration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6242-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we learned yesterday, and are \nreceiving reports this morning, of the attacks against the U.S. Embassy \nin Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. In Benghazi, our \nAmbassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the \nservice of our Nation. Our thoughts and sympathies today are with the \nfamilies of these brave Americans.\n  These attacks remind us of the sacrifices made on a daily basis by \nforeign service officers, diplomatic security personnel, and our marine \nsecurity guards. I join my colleagues in strongly condemning the murder \nof these innocent Americans, and I support employing every available \ntool at our disposal to ensure the safety of Americans overseas and to \nhunt down those responsible for these attacks.\n  Yesterday we commemorated the anniversary of the attacks of September \n11, and today we are reminded that brave Americans serve us every day \nat the risk of their own lives. We honor the Americans we lost in Libya \nand we will stand united in our response.\n  Among the things we can agree on in Washington is that the attacks on \nthe United States and its representatives will be met with resolve and \nthat America's presence and defense of our national interests across \nthe globe will not be deterred by the acts of violent extremists.\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6243-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this is a great Nation.\n  I was interested to hear the comments of our two leaders today, and I \nam saddened, as are all of us here, regarding the news of Ambassador \nStevens and three other hard-working public servants who represent us. \nWe are a great Nation. This is a great Nation. People such as those \nindividuals demonstrate the exceptionalism of Americans all around the \nworld.\n  That is why it saddens me to come to the floor today, on the eve of \nhearing about whether the Federal Reserve, which will decide tomorrow, \nis going to print more money. Our markets are volatile each day, trying \nto figure out and read the minds of what our central bankers are going \nto do. Two days ago I spoke with one of our leading administration \nofficials--someone whom I respect greatly--who had just attended a \nmeeting in the Asian area where Christine Legarde was speaking to a \nsmall group of folks. She is the head of the International Monetary \nFund. She stated that the real difference in how the world is going to \nevolve over the next short term and how the economies of the world are \ngoing to react is based upon whether people in Europe and people in the \nUnited States of America are going to rise up and deal with the \nproblems they have internally.\n  I look at what is happening on both sides of the Atlantic, with \ncentral bankers printing money to buy debt of great nations--nations \nthat have evolved, that are sophisticated, that are democracies. They \npave the way for other cultures to evolve and develop economically \nthemselves. Yet we wake up in a world where because politicians in \nEurope and politicians here in the United States of America have not \nrisen to deal with the fiscal issues within their own countries, the \ncentral bankers are left in a situation where they are printing money \nand buying debt in order to move a crisis further away from the day we \nnow live in.\n  I know the majority leader talked about negotiations that are taking \nplace regarding sequester and I know everybody in this body has been \ninvolved in some meeting of some kind to deal with the fiscal issues \nour Nation faces. I realize that over the next 60 days there is likely \nnothing that we as a body are going to do. I understand that. I don't \nthink anyone in America expects that is going to happen over the next \nweek and a half. We will figure out a way to move out of here and \nhopefully not do any damage to our country.\n  What I hope will happen is when we come back after the election, \nduring a lameduck session or shortly thereafter, all of us will get \nserious about dealing with our Nation's fiscal issues. The majority \nleader spoke to the economy. I want our economy to do well. I want \ncitizens in Tennessee and New York and all across our country to do \nwell. Yet what we have done over the course of the last year and a half \nor so is passed silly little bills that have nothing whatsoever to do \nwith sustaining a long-term economy, and we find ourselves again waking \nup on the eve of finding out whether the Chairman of our Federal \nReserve is going to print more money to buy our debt to make it less \npainful for us and cause us to be in a position where we put off making \nthe tough decisions. I hope the Federal Reserve Chairman tomorrow is \ngoing to show the humility he needs to show, that monetary policy has \nits limits, and it is up to us now to do our job.\n\n  So I am saddened today about the news of some wonderful public \nservants having lost their lives. I wake up every day with a tremendous \nsense of privilege to serve in this body and to represent people such \nas those who died, who are living in tough circumstances around the \nworld, to make sure that all of us here are safe. I hope what will \nhappen in this body is that Republicans and Democrats alike will honor \nthe sacrifices, as we honored them yesterday and we today solemnly \nthink about, that people make around this world on our behalf to keep \nus free and safe, and that we as a body, Republicans and Democrats, are \ngoing to rise and do the things we need to do to put in place a real \nfiscal reform package that will not rely upon the sugar of the Federal \nReserve, but that we will do the things we need to do to create a \nsustained economy.\n  I believe--and I think most people in this body know it when they \nthink about it--we are one fiscal reform package away from being able \nto focus on being a great Nation--we are a great Nation--but to be able \nto focus on that. When we look at where we are as a country, with the \ntremendous energy resources that 2 years ago we didn't even realize we \nhad in this continent; when we look at the technology breakthroughs \nthat are happening in this great country; when we look at the \npharmaceutical breakthroughs that are happening and saving lives around \nthe world, we are one reform package away from putting this problem in \nour rearview mirror and focusing on the greatness of this Nation.\n  So, again, I know we are not going to do anything over the next week \nand a half and we are not going to do anything over the next 60 days. \nBut I hope Senators from all around this country and House Members from \nall around this country will come back after this election and have the \ncourage that has been demonstrated so often by so many Americans to \nmake the tough choices that are necessary to put our fiscal woes behind \nus, to cause this economy to grow, to allow the standard of living of \nAmericans to rise and, candidly, to help lift hundreds of millions of \npeople around this world out of poverty. That is what people are \ndepending on. It is an embarrassment to find ourselves in this position \nwhere we are being diminished around the world, because people are \nlooking at us--the great example to the world of free enterprise and \nlimited government and democracy--and knowing that we don't have that \ncourage today.\n  So I am hopeful we are going to come back and deal with these issues, \nwe are going to do it in a bipartisan way, and then as a Nation we can \ncontinue to focus on our greatness and we can help not only uplift our \nown citizens through economic growth but help continue to be a beacon \nto the world.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I have been coming to the \nSenate floor on a daily basis to talk about the importance of the wind \nproduction tax credit, and I intend to do so today. But before I bring \nup that important topic I want to speak to a situation, an incident, \nthat is on everybody's mind; that is, what happened in Libya earlier \ntoday.\n  I think all of us in the Senate adhere, or should adhere, to the \nconcept that politics should cease at the water's edge. I hope in this \nterrible tragedy that philosophy will hold fast. I, along with all \nColoradans, absolutely condemn the murders--and that is what they \nwere--of Ambassador Stevens and other U.S. State Department personnel \ntoday in Libya.\n  I am a member of the Senate Committees on Armed Services and \nIntelligence, and I know the men and\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nwomen of our diplomatic corps do absolutely vital work under difficult \nconditions every single day. Ambassador Stevens was a dedicated public \nservant who was working in Libya to advance freedom and democracy, and \nwe will continue undeterred in our pursuit of those goals.\n  We salute the service and sacrifice of all those who were taken from \nus today, and their families are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Madam President, as I mentioned when I first rose, I am here again on \nthe floor of the Senate to urge all of us to take action on an issue \nthat already has broad bipartisan support; that is, the renewal of the \nproduction tax credit for wind energy.\n  I was back in my home State of Colorado for the August work period, \nas I know the Presiding Officer and all my colleagues were, and I saw \nfirsthand the very positive effects wind energy has had on my State of \nColorado. I also saw the sobering effects of congressional inaction, \nwhich only strengthened my resolve to have extended the production tax \ncredit.\n  I want to share some specific insights and developments in Colorado \nand then move to the State I am going to discuss today in a little bit.\n  Xcel Energy operates in my home State. It has a wide area in the \nupper Midwest as well, but it announced it had set a record for the \namount of electricity generated from wind resources. At one point \nXcel's Colorado customers got over half--to be precise, 57 percent--of \ntheir electricity generated from wind power. This is a huge success, \nand it highlights in so many ways the potential that wind energy has to \nfill a larger and larger portion of our energy portfolio as this \nindustry fully matures.\n  Sadly, though, I also saw the negative effects of our failure to \nrenew the wind PTC. Vestas Wind systems, which the Presiding Officer is \nfamiliar with, does business in Colorado. It announced layoffs last \nmonth affecting 2,300 workers worldwide who are manufacturing the \nturbines themselves, including about 100 workers at Vestas' facilities \nin Pueblo and Brighton, CO.\n  This was both predictable and predicted, and it is time for us to act \nto protect American workers in the wind energy industry. Each day we \nfail to act to extend the production tax credit, more American jobs are \nput at risk, and we further cede more of our clean energy leadership to \nforeign competition. Look no further than Colorado for both the promise \nof wind energy but also the peril of congressional inaction.\n  Of course, these effects are not limited to my State. I am biased. I \nthink I represent the best State in the Nation, but every day I come to \nthe floor and I highlight a different State and the positive impacts \nwind energy has had there. Literally every State in the Nation has a \nstake in this crucial wind industry space. Today, therefore, I would \nlike to talk about the great State of North Carolina where wind energy \nhas literally boomed in recent years.\n  North Carolina--as have a lot of States--has seen a tremendous growth \nin its wind manufacturing sector. What are the numbers? Well, as of \n2012, there are at least 17 wind manufacturing facilities in North \nCarolina that provide jobs to their local communities, and at least one \nmore facility is scheduled to come online soon. The facilities produce \neverything from steel to lubricants and bearings.\n  We can see all the green circles which designate where these \nfacilities are all across the great State of North Carolina. Let me \nfocus on one manufacturer in North Carolina. It is PPG Industries. PPG \nis a major supplier of fiberglass to the wind industry, and there are \nhundreds of jobs linked to its activities. Their fiberglass facilities \nare in Shelby and Lexington, which are outside of Charlotte and \nGreensboro, respectively. Their growing role has been good for not only \nthe company but for North Carolina. In 2010 PPG expanded its presence \nand brought online an additional furnace and created another 1,800 \njobs. In sum, across North Carolina there are over 2,000 good-paying \njobs, and those jobs then create a ripple effect.\n  If we want to look more broadly at North Carolina, they are \nmanufacturing but they also have very significant wind energy potential \nin the State itself. Offshore wind resources are abundant. The American \nWind Energy Association estimates that wind energy could provide enough \nelectricity to power some 800,000 homes. That is not all: Onshore wind \nresources could also provide a substantial amount of power for the \nState.\n  If we look at these numbers, this is an important industry in North \nCarolina. It certainly has made a difference. But if we do not extend \nthe wind production tax credit, this strong growth in the manufacturing \nsector plus the potential to harvest the wind in North Carolina is at \nrisk and the years of strong progress we have seen here toward a clean \nenergy future in North Carolina could be literally dashed if the wind \nproduction tax credit expires at the end of the year.\n\n  Here is the bad news. The wind industry in North Carolina, because \nthey are anticipating the expiration of PTC, is beginning to downsize \nand shelve expansion plans, predictably. This story is being repeated \npotentially all over the country. It is heartbreaking. I remain \nhopeful, however. I am dedicated to extending the PTC. I know the \nPresiding Officer has been very helpful and very supportive and \nunderstands its importance.\n  A little bit of good news. The Senate Finance Committee passed a \nbipartisan tax extenders package as we left for our August State work \nperiod and it did include an extension of PTC. I want to stress an \nimportant point about that effort: The package was bipartisan. I want \nto see the Senate take up the Finance Committee's legislation \nimmediately and pass it immediately.\n  In a few hours the House is going to see an interesting discussion. \nThe Presiding Officer served in the House. So did I. They are an equal \npartner of ours in the Senate. Over a dozen Members in the House are \ngoing to take the floor today and express their strong support for \nAmerican jobs and the extension of the PTC. I am pleased these members \nof the House Sustainable Energy and Environmental Coalition will be \nadding their voices to what has become a bipartisan and now bicameral \npush to extend the PTC.\n  As I begin to close, let me also talk about the support that is out \nthere in the country. It is a broad array of groups that have stood and \nsaid we think the PTC ought to be extended. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Governors Association, the Governors' Wind \nEnergy Coalition, the American Farm Bureau Federation and many major \nnational newspapers have all weighed in saying this is important to our \ncountry's future.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle, as I have mentioned, have said \nthe PTC should be extended because they know and they have seen the \npositive effects of the PTC on their communities and across the \ncountry. They also know that wind energy--and renewable energy more \ngenerally--is the future. It is the wave of the future. There is no \nquestion. All you have to do is look at the rest of the world--look at \nChina, look at Spain, look at Denmark, look at every developed country \nand the developing countries in Asia and India. They are all investing \nin clean energy. This is not something they are doing just to feel \ngood. It is where economic growth will occur.\n  In sum, extending the PTC is a no-brainer. It is common sense. We \nought to be doing the job we were sent here to do. We ought to be \nextending the PTC as soon as possible. PTC equals jobs. We ought to \npass it as soon as possible. I am going to continue coming to the floor \nevery day until we finish the job. I will not stop until we vote to \nprotect American jobs. Failure to act has already hurt this vital \nindustry. Continued inaction will result in the loss of thousands of \nAmerican jobs which then has a ripple effect on the rest of the \nNation's economy.\n  Colleagues, stand with me, stand with the Presiding Officer, stand \nwith American workers. Let's extend the production tax credit now, as \nsoon as possible.\n  I thank the Chair for her support and her interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes \nto address the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, last night when I went to sleep I was \ngoing over in my mind the speech I wanted to give here today--which is \nan important day in the history of the American space program. It is \nthe day that President Kennedy challenged us to go to the Moon, to land \nsafely on the Moon and to return safely as well.\n  When I woke up this morning I woke up to terrible news, to learn that \nour Ambassador in Libya had been killed by a mob. We've lost Ambassador \nChris Stevens. We lost three others at the American Embassy in Libya. \nIt is a terrible tragedy.\n  At the same time yesterday our Embassy in Cairo was stormed. Thanks \nto the vigilance of its leadership and our wonderful Marine Corps \ndefending the Embassy, we lost no one in Cairo.\n  Madam President, I first want to extend to all of the families who \nlost someone in Libya overnight my extreme and definite condolences and \nsympathy. I am a little bit at a loss for words because these tragedies \nthat happen to our men and women who serve at our Embassies happen all \ntoo frequently and then we say: A grateful nation never forgets; and \nthen we go on to bash our Federal employees and our State Department \npeople, saying: Oh, they have these cushy jobs in exotic places and \nthey must be out eating brie somewhere.\n  We lost, at the Nairobi bombing, Consul General Bartley, head of our \nconsulate service, who was serving there, one of the highest serving \nAfrican Americans in our Foreign Service. His son interned there that \nsummer, wanted to be like his dad. They died there. They died there. \nBut he was at his duty station.\n  It has been almost 15 years. These men and women were serving the \nUnited States of America. They were at their duty station. They were \ntrying to help Libya to rise up now to be able to create a government \nand be able to create opportunity for its own people, and they gave \ntheir lives. Ambassador Chris Stevens had already served two tours in \nLibya but wanted to go back again at this new moment in history, to \nstand up, to help Libya stand up a true government that was free and \nwould give their people a chance at democracy and participating in a \nnew Middle East.\n  And then there was Sean Smith, who was a 10-year veteran of the \nForeign Service. He was an information management officer. He had \nserved in Iraq. He is a father of two children, a devoted husband. We \nknow what happened to them.\n  So we must continue our strong partnership with Libya after the fall \nof Qadaffi. But I call upon the new leadership: Call for calm, call for \ntolerance. If you are angry, there are ways to do protests and so on. \nYou don't have to go around killing the American Ambassador when our \nAir Force flew over Libya and our President and our Congress worked to \nsupport this new government coming up.\n  And then there is Cairo. Because of anger over a video--I do not know \nabout this video. I don't know its content but I do know the outcome--\nthat our Embassy in Cairo was stormed. They tore down our American \nflag. They replaced it with another flag. But it is the flag of the \nUnited States of America and our flag is in Egypt. Our flag is in Egypt \nbecause we are great allies to the Egyptian Government and great \nsupporters of the Egyptian people as they come through the Arab \nspring--again, trying to create a new day and a new way.\n\n  I say to Ambassador Patterson and the entire staff, again: Our \nthoughts and prayers are with you. I was in Cairo. I know what they do \nevery day. I know how, during the Arab spring many of them were locked \nin the Embassy, trying to keep our government functioning while their \nown families had to be evacuated. Some did not see their families for 3 \nweeks because they were inside, they couldn't leave, and we had the \nmost massive evacuation of civilian employees in our history since, \nreally, the beginning of some other armed conflicts.\n  So I say to those embassy staff, both our wonderful Ambassador, Anne \nPatterson, but to a lot of the little people who work at the Embassy, \nthe people who keep the commercial commerce office open, the people who \nare doing the wonderful work with NGOs to show them how to build a free \nand new kind of society, and also to the foreign nationals who work in \nour Embassy--we think about you.\n  I say to the leadership in both countries again: Call for calm, call \nfor tolerance. But I say to my colleagues here, we have to call for \ncalm and tolerance right in this institution. We have to support our \nmen and women in the State Department, our men and women in the \nmilitary. All who serve overseas are representatives of the United \nStates of America. Whether you are the Peace Corps or the Marine Corps; \nwhether you are the Foreign Service or the commercial service or \nwhatever--you are in the service of the United States of America, \npromoting our values, trying to help promote democracy and also trying \nto have economic and strategic cooperation.\n  I thank our Foreign Service staff. Many of them live in Maryland but \nthat is not the point. They live in the United States of America. So I \nsay to all, when you point your finger and say we don't need a \ngovernment--I think we do need a government. And when we talk about \nstanding up for our military now, in these tough budget times, \nabsolutely we should. But remember there are others overseas who also \ncarry our flag in very dangerous areas.\n  Let's start respecting the people who work for our government. Let's \nmake sure they have the right resources to do their job and then let \nour President, our talented Secretary of State, help work with the \nother world leaders to do something to bring about stability.\n  I feel very strongly about this. I guess what you are hearing from \nSenator Mikulski is grief for what has happened in Libya, worry about \nwhat has happened in Cairo, tension about what continues to happen in \nthe Middle East, and then frustration about what goes on here. When all \nis said and done--more gets said than gets done and what is said is \noften not very good.\n  The world is watching us here. We are supposed to be the greatest \ndemocracy in the world. Not only are we supposed to be, I believe that \nwe are. But democracy begins with us. Democracy is not only something \nwritten on a piece of paper which are our founding documents but we \nhave to live what is in those founding documents. We have to, first of \nall, start with civility, start with respect, start with conversations \namong ourselves about how we could truly work together to help our \ncountry and to help our country help the world.\n\n\n      50th Anniversary of President Kennedy's Space Flight Speech\n\n  This is what it was all about 50 years ago when a young President \nwent to Rice University. The Russians were pounding their chests. They \nput something up in the air called Sputnik. President Eisenhower had \nresponded. We were going to do something called the National Defense \nAct. We were promoting math and science to catch up with the world. \nDoes it sound familiar? Then, also, though, our President wanted to do \nmore and he went to Rice University. During that speech he rallied the \nNation on why, as part of his vision of the New Frontier, why we should \ntravel into space. That historic day he said:\n\n       We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in \n     this decade, and do other things, not because they are easy, \n     but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to \n     organize and measure the best of our energies and our skills.\n\n  That is how in a robust way we took a nascent space program and \ntransformed it into a space superpower. It literally took us to the \nfrontier of space and took us to a new frontier.\n  For those 50 years, America continued to lead the way in space and to \nkeep space a peaceful area. Not to militarize space, not to colonize it \nfor a single country, but to explore and along the way in exploring the \nuniverse to get to invent science and technology that would help \ntransform our lives here.\n  America continues to lead the way in space. As an appropriator for \nthe space program I am so proud of what we continue to do--what we \ncontinue to do in the area of space exploration, space and space \nscience.\n  Look at where we are now. We are right up there in the space station. \nWe have completed its development. We are going to do new research that \nhas never been done before and we are part of our wonderful, gallant \nastronaut\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nprogram. At the same time, we have invented new technologies to explore \nthe universe. The work for the Hubble Telescope is located in Maryland \nboth at Goddard and the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n\n  Most recently, we landed Curiosity on Mars, a robot the size of a \nMini Cooper, that will tell us so much about our nearest neighbor. As \nPresident Kennedy might have said, I sent Curiosity to Mars not because \nit is easy but because it is hard and we are very curious.\n  Over the summer, we lost two of our great people--two of our great \nastronauts. We lost Dr. Sally Ride, the first woman to go into space, \nwhom we so admired, and then we lost astronaut Neil Armstrong, who on \nJuly 20, 1969, took that giant step for mankind.\n  Tomorrow at the National Cathedral we will honor Astronaut Neil \nArmstrong, and later this year at the National Space Museum we will \nhonor Dr. Sally Ride. We not only want to respect our astronauts of the \npast, we want to respect the astronauts of today and our astronauts of \ntomorrow. We want to respect all those wonderful young men and women \nwho want to study space and aeronautics, who want to explore the new \nfrontiers of today and will come up with new ideas that will lead to \nnew jobs tomorrow.\n  We keep asking NASA to do the hard jobs, such as explore the \nuniverse, protect the planet, make airplanes safer and more reliable, \nlook beyond the reach of Earth, develop those new technologies, and \nsearch for extraterrestrial life out there. Maybe it is out there, \nmaybe it isn't--study Earth as if it were a distant planet. Maybe there \nis intelligent life on Earth. Let's look for that, and let's look for \nit right here. We need to continue to broaden our reach, to go beyond \nlow-Earth orbit and also continue our research.\n  This year, there was a unique, bold partnership when a private \ncompany, SpaceX, sent cargo to dock at the International Space Station. \nNo private company and few nations have accomplished that. This year, \nSpaceX will be joined by another private company, Orbital Science, \nwhich will launch from the east coast Spaceport Wallops. They are \nlocated in Virginia. It is a Maryland-Virginia cooperation. How \nexciting.\n  Our future in space will be built on innovation and discovery, \nwhether it is the commercial rocket industry, the James Webb Space \nTelescope that will take us well beyond the work of the Hubble, new \ntechnologies, including fixing satellites or, again, that mission to \nplanet Earth. New technologies don't just happen; they come from \nAmerican ingenuity, but they are built through investments. They made \nAmerica great and they made the missions of the United States worth \nimitating.\n  In the last couple weeks the Presiding Officer talked about an \nexceptional America. America is exceptional because of the daring and \nthe do of people such as our astronauts, because of talented people who \nthink and study and come up with new ideas and because their government \nbacked them.\n  I wish to conclude by saying I am proud of what President Kennedy \nannounced. Right here in this body two people teamed up. Actually, it \nwas one person in this body and the other was a Vice President. It was \nan odd couple. Their names were Vice President Lyndon Johnson and \nMargaret Chase Smith. Margaret Chase Smith was once the longest serving \nwoman in Congress. I now hold that record. Margaret Chase Smith, from \nMaine, was a devotee of the space program. President Kennedy set the \ngoal. He gave it to Lyndon, his Vice President, to make the goal into a \nreality. The Vice President turned to Congress, and Margaret Chase \nSmith helped carry the weight of the Congress to put in the right \npolicies and the right funding. Isn't that a wonderful story? It is a \nwonderful story we need to take with us, that when we work together \nwith our President and both parties work across the aisle, that is the \nnew frontier which takes and keeps America an exceptional Nation.\n  God bless our President Kennedy, all the astronauts who risked their \nlives, and everyone who worked to create these new frontiers.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Veterans Jobs Corps Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof the bill. I would like to thank Senator Nelson for introducing the \nbill, and I would like to thank Senator Murray, chair of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, for bringing this bill to the Senate and \nfor all she has done for our Nation's veterans.\n  Veterans have done so much for our country, serving courageously in \nthe military, and they have been tested so profoundly and so many times \nover the last decade. These men and women have done everything for us. \nWe owe them. That means they deserve the best health care and other \nbenefits they have earned from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  And that means a home. Last weekend I was back in Minnesota for \nHabitat for Humanity, making critical home repairs for a Minnesota \nGuard veteran, SGT Brian Neill, and his family. Brian is a 23-year \nveteran of the National Guard, is part of the Minnesota National Guard \nunit, the legendary Red Bulls, who had their deployment in Iraq \nextended so that it was one of the longest, if not the longest, \ndeployment in U.S. history.\n  While Brian was in Iraq, his son was hit by a drunk driver while \nreturning home from his junior ROTC training. He sustained a severe \nbrain injury and is severely disabled.\n  In Iraq, Brian, who mentored younger soldiers, saved the life of one \nof those solders. Brian, being a 23-year vet, mentored these young \nkids. They were in a convoy, and he saw one of them get out and \ncollapse. He recognized the heatstroke and saved his life.\n  Sergeant Neill himself returned from Iraq suffering from very serious \nphysical and psychological wounds that leave his wife Jane as a \ncaregiver for both Brian and their son. I have to tell you, they are \nthe most wonderful people. It was an amazing experience to help them \nwith home repairs to make sure they will have the home that meets their \nneeds.\n  But when I talk to veterans in Minnesota these days, the thing I hear \nmost about is jobs, about employment. Jobs mean money, of course, but \nit means much more. It means a new mission. Without a job, you really \ncannot reintegrate into your community and start a new phase of your \nlife.\n  Veterans unemployment in Minnesota, as I am sure it is in the \nPresiding Officer's State of New York, is way too high. My message to \nemployers in Minnesota is simple: These are the people you want to \nhire. They have skills. They have discipline. We all have a role to \nplay in making sure veterans have jobs--employers in the private \nsector, State government, colleges and universities, municipalities, \nand also the Federal Government.\n  This is how we do it in Minnesota. Let me give an example. We had \nseveral thousand Red Bulls deployed to Kuwait. The Minnesota National \nGuard recognized that a large number of them were not going to have \njobs when they came back, so the Guard and Minnesota's outstanding \nDepartment of Employment and Economic Development went upstream, as \nthey say, to Kuwait to get ahead of the problem. They brought corporate \nleaders from Minnesota, businesses such as Target and Best Buy, and \nthey also brought folks from MNSCU, which is the Minnesota State \nColleges and University System, to Kuwait to provide training for the \nGuard members on entering or reentering the workforce. They were able \nto share valuable information with the Red Bulls on writing resumes, \ngetting ready for an interview, and doing it well.\n  One of the problems is that very often soldiers coming back from \nAfghanistan, coming back from Iraq, from Kuwait, very often in a job \ninterview will say: We did that, we did this, we did that. That is how \nyou think in the military. Employers want to know what you yourself \nindividually did. So it was simple. The employment guys from Target \nsaid: Say ``I''--you know, little tips like that. And it has been very \nhelpful.\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\n  So we all have a role to play. At the Federal level, last year we \npassed the VOW to Hire Heroes Act that expanded and created new tax \ncredits for businesses that hire veterans. I have been spreading the \nword in Minnesota--I know the Presiding Officer has been spreading the \nword in New York--so our businesses know that for every unemployed \nveteran they hire, they can get a tax credit for up to $9,600. That is \n$9,600 for hiring a veteran who has a service-related disability and \nthen ratchets down a little bit. But this is a good incentive for \nbusinesses to be hiring our veterans.\n  The legislation we are considering today, the Veterans Jobs Corps \nAct, is the next step that we can and should take at the Federal level. \nThe bill creates a Veterans Job Corps through the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, in cooperation with other departments, where \nthousands of veterans will be able to work on conservation and resource \nmanagement in our Nation's public lands. Under this bill, veterans will \nhave the opportunity to restore and protect parks, forests, and other \npublic lands, whether they be national, State or tribal. Veterans will \nbe hired to maintain the infrastructure and facilities on these public \nlands. It will also provide funding for veterans to become firefighters \nand law enforcement officers. It will also provide licensing and \ncertification for certain skills veterans had when they were deployed--\nemergency medical, nursing assistants, and also drivers. Many men and \nwomen drive in these theaters, and to ease their getting certification, \nthis bill does that as well so they can work in our Nation's parks and \nthese national lands that are so treasured.\n  This is really based on the Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC from \nthe New Deal, which was created through a combination of actions by \nFranklin Roosevelt and legislation, of course, by Congress. It was very \nsuccessful. It was the most popular program of the New Deal. In fact, \nat that time veterans were specifically included among those who could \nbe enrolled in the CCC. As I said, the CCC was one of the most \nsuccessful programs to help us get through the Depression.\n  My wife Franni's uncle James, who died not long ago at the age of 96, \nworked for the post office, the Postal Service, and served with the \nU.S. Army postal service in England, France, and Germany during World \nWar II--a ``greatest generation'' guy. But before that, during the \nDepression, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps. He was part of \nthe crew that built the road through Evans Notch, a beautiful, \nmountainous area at the border of Maine and New Hampshire. My wife is \nfrom Maine. This was one of James' proudest achievements in life. If \nyou read his obituary, it was one of the most prominent parts, along \nwith his service during World War II.\n  That is the kind of thing the Veterans Job Corps can be. We have to \ndo this work on our public lands, our parks, our forests. Our public \nlands need to be maintained and preserved and improved. Why not put our \nveterans to work doing it? They have the skills, they have the \nexperience, and they have the discipline. For instance, if you spent a \nlot of time on duty outside and you work in teams, which is obviously \ntrue of a huge number of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, you \nare going to be very well suited for this work. If you built roads in \nIraq or Afghanistan, you are well prepared to maintain or manage \nresources in Minnesota's beautiful parks, forests, trails, and other \npublic lands--under a little less pressure, by the way.\n  Minnesota has over 227,000 acres of land in 73 State and national \npark and recreation areas. That does not count our innumerable public \nlands under more local jurisdiction. Those are some of the most \nbeautiful places in the country--the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, \nVoyageurs National Park, Superior and Chippewa National Forests, or the \ntrail along the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers, just to name a few. \nThose need to be protected, maintained, improved, and restored too. \nThis is important work, and it is dignified work. If you are making \nsure it is in your obituary 70 years later, you know it is very \nimportant, dignified work. What better way to preserve the beauty of \nthese places than having veterans do it, for our heroes to do it.\n  The bill also incorporates a number of other veterans job provisions \nfrom other bills sponsored by my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle. The one I started to mention before is the certification-\nlicensure requirements for becoming a nursing assistant or emergency \nmedical technician--I knew I was looking for a word; it was \n``technician''--and for getting a commercial driver's license. This is \nalso an issue on which my colleague, my senior Senator from Minnesota, \nMs. Klobuchar, has spent a lot of time.\n  The provision in this bill authored by Senator Pryor also states that \nthey have to take military training into consideration in issuing \nlicenses for those jobs if they want to continue getting Federal funds \nfor some important veteran employment programs that States administer. \nThis will provide an additional incentive for States to make sure that \nservicemembers' highly relevant training and experience in these fields \ncan be translated into civilian qualifications, eliminating the need \nfor duplicative training and opening the door to many more jobs for \nhighly trained veterans.\n  I can tell you, after seven USO tours, our men and women in the \nmilitary are magnificent. They are highly trained and, man, are they \ndisciplined and, man, are they great. They deserve this. The Veterans \nJob Corps is a great idea for employing our Nation's veterans doing the \nimportant work of preserving, protecting, and improving our Nation's \npublic lands and serving as first responders, police, and firefighters.\n  It is my strong hope that we will be able to bring debate on this \nbill to a close, pass it, and have it enacted into law. Our Nation's \nveterans deserve nothing less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe bill that is pending, and I must say: Here we go again. And let me \nsay that what we are doing today, under the auspices of helping \nreturning veterans get jobs--and there is nothing wrong with wanting to \ndo that and there is nothing wrong with trying to pay for that--is \nreally passing a bill for political reasons so we can say we did \nthings, because this is not going anywhere in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  A couple of points I would make are that, first, yesterday, on the \nanniversary of 9/11, we started the consideration of this bill, but \nthis bill has had no hearings, no committee work, and essentially no \ndebate until today, despite the fact that it will affect six different \nFederal agencies, at a minimum.\n  Before I discuss the bill itself, though, I want to mention another \nanniversary. One year ago yesterday, SPC Christopher D. Horton, Army \nSPC Bret D. Isenhower, and Army PVT Tony J. Potter, Jr. were killed in \nAfghanistan. They were 1 of 13 Oklahomans from the Oklahoma National \nGuard serving in Afghanistan who paid the ultimate sacrifice--a pure \nand noble sacrifice. As we debate a bill that will largely benefit \nthose who have safely returned home after serving their country, it is \nimportant that we not forget those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, \nthis pure and noble sacrifice for the benefit of the rest of us.\n  The bill before the Senate provides $1 billion--$1 billion--in \nmandatory spending. For the folks at home that means it is not subject \nto appropriations; it will be spent, period, regardless of what we do \nif we pass this bill and the President signs it--over 5 years for the \ncreation of a new mandatory program called the Veterans Jobs Corps.\n  One point I will make is that we already have six veterans jobs \nprograms and not one of them has a metric on it to see if it is \nworking. There hasn't been one hearing to see what the jobs programs we \nare running now are doing, to measure their effectiveness or their cost \neffectiveness and see if they are actually performing for veterans what \nwe say we want them to do. Yet we have a bill on the floor that didn't \ngo through that committee, where no\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nhearings were held, and we are going to do the same thing again. \nBecause there is not a metric in this bill.\n  So what is happening here is we are playing the political election \ncard to say, How could anybody oppose a veterans jobs corps bill? The \nreal question to be asked is: How callous is it to put forth a \npolitical bill when we have no idea whether it may or may not work, for \nthe pure political purpose of an election, without looking at the whole \nof the veterans jobs programs? There is not going to be any \ncongressional oversight on this.\n  Just 2 weeks ago I released a report on job training in my own State. \nI was highly effective in looking at every Federal Government job \ntraining program, veterans and nonveterans alike, in my State. I looked \nat every State job training program and then published a report. Here \nis what the report found.\n  And, by the way, we have 47 other job training programs, of which 90 \npercent don't have metrics on them, and we spend $19 billion a year on \nthose job training programs.\n  What we found is that State-run, State-financed, State-supported job \ntraining programs work in Oklahoma. We actually take our own money, \nwith our own institutions, with our own individuals and our own \nemployees, knowing what businesses and industry and service industries \nand institutions need, and we match job training to what those needs \nare and actually put people to work. Consequently, Oklahoma has a 4.7-\npercent unemployment rate. So we are highly effective at training \npeople for the jobs that are available. But we are not very effective \nwith the Federal programs.\n  The assessment in Oklahoma--and I am not sure it applies across the \ncountry, but it certainly does in Oklahoma--is that we are very good at \nemploying people in the job training industry but not very good with \nFederal dollars when it comes to training people a life skill to keep \nthem employed.\n  This legislation is going to provide $1 billion for the Federal \nGovernment to hire veterans on a temporary basis.\n  I understand that Senator Burr's recommendations are going to be \nincorporated. That is a marked improvement to the bill. His puts them \nin line for a career, not a temporary job--which shows the lack of \nthinking because Senator Burr, the ranking member on VA, couldn't get a \nhearing. We didn't have a markup, didn't have a chance for ideas to \nflow through. I am not certain we are going to have amendments. I have \nfour I would like to offer to the bill that are better pay-fors and \nwill actually improve the bill. I am not sure we are going to do that \neither.\n  So we didn't have a hearing, and we didn't have a markup. We come to \nthe floor, and we are not going to have amendments. What is this really \nall about? Is this about veterans or is this about politicians? I \nsuspect it is about politicians. I suspect it is about elections and \nnot veterans.\n  The legislation grants broad authority to the Department of Justice, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, the Interior \nDepartment, and the Army Corps of Engineers to hire veterans in jobs \nsuch as conservation and first responders.\n  However, to comply with the pay-go rules, we manipulate the system \nagain. We include revenue increases to equal the cost of the bill. We \ndo that by requiring a continuous levy on payments to Medicare \nproviders and suppliers--which is not a bad idea--and also by denying \nor revoking passports in cases of seriously delinquent taxes. I have \nheard that is going to be pulled, but nobody knows. Nobody has seen it. \nThat is why we have committees, so we don't have to play with things \nbefore we have a base bill and we know what it will do.\n  The bill already violates the Budget Control Act's allocation for \nVeterans Affairs funding. It is subject to a 302(f) point of order \nbecause it is outside the bounds of their appropriations.\n  The bill also states a distinct preference for veterans of the \ncurrent war in Afghanistan and the most recent war in Iraq by stating \nthat these jobs are primarily for veterans who have served since \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  As with the veterans caregiver bill in 2009, this is blatant \ndiscrimination against our other veterans. One class of veterans is \nbetter than another class of veterans? Tell me how. Is somebody who \ndied in the Vietnam war less honorable than somebody who has given \ntheir life in Afghanistan? Yet we are making that distinction in terms \nof the benefits available to those who served our country honorably.\n  So we are blatantly discriminating against veterans who served before \n9/11. I would also remind us that those veterans didn't have the post-\n9/11 GI bill. They didn't have the other significant benefits that have \ncome along and been passed down, both paid benefits, family transfer of \nthe post-9/11 bill, or the educational benefits for in-service that the \npresent veterans have.\n  Another thing I would remind my colleagues is that right now there is \na preference in every branch of the Federal Government for hiring \nveterans. It is already written into law. Since 1944 the Federal \nGovernment has stated that veterans with honorable or general \ndischarges are preferred for hiring in competitive positions and may \nalso be hired without competition in many cases. In other words, they \nget an absolute preference. Disabled veterans get even a higher \npreference over nondisabled veterans. Veterans also have priority in \nretention in terms of government downsizing: If you were a veteran, you \ndon't get downsized; if you are not a veteran, you will.\n  Senator Burr's bill--which it appears the majority will take and add \nto their bill rather than replace their bill--will direct the Office of \nPersonnel Management to require that each of the 10,000 job vacancies \npresently in the Federal Government today should be filled by veterans. \nThis would actually provide a real career path for veterans, not a \ntemporary make-work job slot that will go away as soon as the $1 \nbillion runs out.\n  According to a 2011 GAO report, there are six job training programs, \nwhich I have outlined, already on the books. They are not working, but \nthey are on the books, and we are spending money on them. We have no \nmetrics to know whether they are working. We have had no oversight \nhearings to know whether they are working. None has ever been held.\n  There is the Labor Department's Disabled Veterans Outreach Program. \nIt does job readiness, skills training, retention training, and \nemployment counseling.\n  The Labor Department's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Project does \neverything the first one I mentioned does.\n  The Labor Department's Veterans Employment Representative Program \ndoes exactly the same thing as the first two.\n  The Labor Department's Transition Assistance Program does job search \nand job readiness training.\n  The Labor Department's Veterans Affairs Workforce Investment, again, \ndoes all the same tasks as the first two I mentioned.\n  The Veterans Affairs' Rehabilitation for Disabled Veterans Program \ndoes nearly everything from job training to employment counseling to \njob referral to on-the-job training to basic adult literacy.\n  This bill and those training programs are in addition to the post-9/\n11 GI bill and the Tuition Assistance Program, which provides 100 \npercent tuition assistance plus expenses, plus a monthly stipend salary \nfor unemployed or any other veterans to attend college, vocational \ntraining, pursue licensure, with fees paid for by the Federal \nGovernment, and allows them to transfer this benefit to their spouses.\n  The question I have, with that benefit--and we are doing another one \nnow for political purposes, not because we really care about veterans--\nwhy isn't this one working? We are going to spend billions on the post-\n9/11 GI bill, and we are going to pay them at the rate of a \nnoncommissioned officer all the time they are going to college. Why \nisn't that working? Where is the oversight hearing to see why what we \njust did 2 years ago isn't working?\n  Instead, what we are going to do is--which the Congress has done \nunder both Democrats and Republicans--we are going to throw in more \nmoney and do another one. Instead of measuring what works and measuring \nwhat we are doing, we are going to create another program. Granted, \nsupposedly it is only 5 years.\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\n  When it comes to 5 years, what will happen whether it works or not? \nNobody will vote against extending the veterans program, will they? How \ncan anyone be against veterans?\n  So we would not do the hard work of having committee hearings; we \nwould not do the oversight. We would not even change this bill to make \nsure it has absolute metrics on what it is doing. So we are continuing \ndown the road to bankruptcy, all in the name of putting a bill--that \nisn't going to pass the House--on the Senate floor so two or three \nMembers of the Senate can go home and claim they did something.\n\n  I think it is hypocritical. I don't think it matches the pure valor \nof the three individuals I mentioned. It doesn't come close. It doesn't \nmeasure up. Those 13 Oklahomans who died in Afghanistan this last year \nfrom the Oklahoma National Guard, the Thunderbirds, represented the \nreal value of America. This bill doesn't.\n  The post-9/11 GI bill pays 100 percent of the highest cost public \nschool in any State. So veterans can go to the best public school paid \nfor completely by the government if they are a post-9/11 veteran. They \ncan get the same equivalent pay as a noncommissioned officer the time \nthey are going. That is what we have already got out there.\n  Without this legislation, today any unemployed veteran who can get \ninto a community college can go for free, receive 3 years' of pay, all \ntheir expenses paid, their housing paid--all of those things paid.\n  Well, if that isn't working, why isn't it working? Where is the \nhearing to find out why that isn't working? No, we are just going to \npass another bill without a hearing, without a committee markup, for \npolitically expedient purposes. Oh, it is just $1 billion.\n  Where is our honor? Where is our valor? Where is our sacrifice?\n  The Department of Defense Tuition Assistance Program, another \nprogram, while you are in the military, is paid for. All you have to do \nis make a C or better--online, off line, whatever way you want to go.\n  So let me summarize: We have the Tuition Assistance Program, we have \nthe post-9/11 GI bill, we have the GI bill, we have six separate VA job \nprograms. We have a bill on the floor to do another one, and nobody is \nasking the question: What is wrong with what we are doing now, and why \naren't we fixing it?\n  If what we are doing now isn't working, why aren't we fixing that? \nWhy aren't we going to allow amendments to fix things? Why are we going \nto fill the tree and not allow the process that our Founders for \ndesigned the Senate to work so that all ideas could be considered?\n  No, this is a political exercise. I am going to call it what it is. \nThis isn't about veterans; this is about politicians. My hope is that \nwe wake up before our country fails.\n  When I came to the Senate, the average family's responsibility for \npublic debt per individual was $26,000. Within the 8 years I have been \nhere, it is now 51,400 and some-odd dollars. We are playing a game. We \nare thinking short term. We are worried about political careers and \nelections, but we are not worried about the country. This is about the \ngreatest example of the incompetence of the Congress of United States I \nhave ever seen.\n  I am for helping veterans, I am for paying for it, and I am for \nmaking sure they get rewarded for their service and their sacrifice. \nThis bill isn't it. This is a charade. That is exactly what it is. To \ncall it anything else dishonors the service of those who have defended \nand protected our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, before I \nbegin my remarks on the subject that brings me to the floor today, \nwhich is the DREAM Act, I wish to take a moment to reflect on the \nbrutal, unconscionable attacks that occurred on our diplomatic posts in \nLibya and Egypt. Like many of my colleagues, I am outraged and saddened \nby the brutal murder of four courageous Americans in a cowardly, \nunconscionable attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Their \nfamilies are in the thoughts and prayers of my family as they are for \nmany others of my colleagues.\n  These great diplomats were patriots and professionals, putting their \nlives on the line to advance American ideals and interests. Their vital \nwork is done daily by countless Americans, diplomats abroad who serve \nin every corner of the world.\n  In my own visit to Libya last year with a number of my colleagues, \nincluding Senator McCain and Senator Graham, I saw the vital work and \nthe accomplishments of such brave Americans on the ground as well as \nthe great peril and severe danger they constantly face. I also saw \ntheir sense of satisfaction and patriotism in the work they are doing. \nI add my voice to that of my colleagues asking for more support for \nsecurity, enhanced safeguards, and protection for our diplomats in \nthese kinds of situations. They go about their work with understated \nperseverance and determination as well as constant courage in the face \nof often chaotic and unpredictable dangers.\n  The cowardly attacks on these patriots should not deter the people of \nLibya from moving forward. Neither should it deter us from working \ntogether with others abroad who have a common interest in tolerance, \nfreedom of speech, and democracy.\n  I commend President Obama and Secretary Clinton for their immediate \nresponse to this situation, their words of encouragement. I wish \nGodspeed to the Marine Corps Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team en \nroute to Libya.\n  The diplomats who were killed in this tragic and brutal action \nembodied American values and the highest traditions, not only of the \nprofessionals among our career diplomats, but all who serve and \nsacrifice for this country in uniform in very similar situations of \ndanger--the marines who guard our embassies as well as the other \nmarines and troops who are fighting on foreign soil to uphold our \nfreedoms.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Those American values in some sense bring me also to the floor today \nto talk about the DREAM Act and about a young generation of people in \nour communities across America and across the country who would benefit \nfrom this important legislation. Our immigration system right now is \nbroken and is in dire need of comprehensive reform. Any comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation must include the DREAM Act. I believe \nthe DREAM Act is worthy of adoption without that comprehensive \noverarching reform because these young Americans in our communities \ndeserve the opportunity to earn their citizenship by contributing to \nour Nation. That is exactly the opportunity the DREAM Act seeks to \nafford them.\n  Over this last recess I was pleased to talk to many of those \nDREAMers. I was particularly proud to talk to them about the work a \nnumber of us are doing here, to try to achieve and make possible this \nlegislation that would enable and empower them to contribute further. I \nam grateful to Senator Durbin and others who have championed this \nmeasure at the Federal level, much as I have done in the State of \nConnecticut as attorney general. I was also proud to talk about the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals policy. This policy took effect on August 15 when DHS started \nto accept applications for deferred action.\n  Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DREAMers will have \na temporary reprieve--and I emphasize temporary reprieve--from \ndeportation. This policy step is a good one. It is in the right \ndirection. But it affords only a temporary reprieve.\n  The DREAM Act would afford a permanent path to individuals who \nqualify: individuals who have entered the United States before the age \nof 16; they have been brought here by parents who may be undocumented--\nbut young children, many of them much younger than 16, most of them in \nfact younger than 5 or 6 years old and who have been present in the \nUnited States for at least 5 consecutive years prior to enactment of \nthe bill; are here through no fault or action of their own but who want \nto be here permanently and contribute and give back. They must have \ngraduated from a U.S. high school or have obtained a GED or have been \naccepted into an institution of higher education. They must be between \nthe ages of 12 and 35 at the time of application and be of good moral \ncharacter.\n  These requirements establish a path for people who want to \ncontribute,\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nhave come here through no fault of their own, know the United States as \nthe only country where they have ever lived. They usually speak no \nother language. Their life and their friends and their future are here.\n\n  I want to talk, as I hope to do literally every week that I am able, \nabout an individual who embodies the DREAM Act. Her name is Zuly \nMolina. Her full name, actually, is Zuleyma Molina, but she goes by \n``Zuly.'' She is a proud member of our Connecticut community, one of \n11,000 to 20,000 young people living in Connecticut who would benefit \nfrom the DREAM Act. Zuly is here with us today through her picture. I \nwant to talk about her life, which has been full of hardships and \nchallenges, but also her future.\n  She was born in Mexico and brought to America when she was 6 years \nold. Her family settled in Connecticut--in fact, in New Britain. She \nhad to learn English, which was not easy for her. In fact, she was \ntaunted and bullied because of her lack of language skills. But she was \nup to the challenge. She learned English. She speaks it absolutely \nfluently. She decided to go to the library and translate books on her \nown so that she would have a command of English. She went through the \nNew Britain public schools and graduated from New Britain High School \nin 2008, but at that point there were additional challenges.\n  Zuly wanted to stay in Connecticut and perhaps attend 2 years of \ncommunity college before going to a 4-year institution. But she was not \neligible at that point for in-State tuition and the option of staying \nin Connecticut was simply too expensive.\n  What did she do? Endlessly resourceful and determined, she decided to \ncommute every day to Bay Path College in Massachusetts. There she \nworked in many leadership positions outside the classroom. She was \npresident of Rotaract, which is Rotary's youth service club for young \npeople. She was vice president of the Bay Path Christian Fellowship. \nShe was cocaptain of the cross-country team. And she graduated with a \nbachelor's degree in biology, becoming the first college graduate in \nher family.\n  She felt discouraged even after graduation because she knew she could \nnot apply for many jobs that require documentation. She decided to \npursue further education, a master's degree from Bay Path College in \noccupational therapy. She understands now life will not be easy, but \nher goals of working for a hospital's feeding program and pursuing an \nMD are realistic. She hopes she can pursue that profession so she can \nwork for nonprofits that help families with low income--not altogether \ndifferent from the one where she grew up.\n  It has taken many years for Zuly to accept and thank her mother for \nsending her to America. She would be upset--more than upset--if the \nland of her life, the land that she loves--America--refuses to give her \nthe opportunity to stay here. She has that opportunity temporarily with \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. It is an \nadministrative program. It could be ended with a new administration. It \ncould be ended by any administration virtually overnight. She has \napplied for deferred action and she is undergoing the process, but she \ndeserves more than a temporary reprieve. That is why I stand here \nurging my colleagues to enable Zuly to come out of the shadows, to seek \na career that will enable her to contribute mightily and monumentally \nto all of us as a doctor, and to raise a family of her own here, as a \nproud United States citizen.\n  To these young people who identify as Americans and who were brought \nto this Nation at young ages as children or infants and who are here \nthrough no fault of their own, I urge my colleagues to offer one of the \ngreatest gifts, one of the greatest privileges one can have, which is \nUnited States citizenship, so that we can say to the DREAMers on some \nday soon, ``my fellow American.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are at a moment in time when \nAmericans across the country are confused by what they are hearing; it \nis hard to discern truth from fiction.\n  One of the proposals that is being talked about is from the \nRepublican nominee for Vice President, Paul Ryan, who is known for his \nbudget proposals. We have to look at them squarely and decide what is \nreliable, what is true, and what is, as I said earlier, fiction.\n  Those proposals cut taxes for the rich, raise taxes on the middle \nclass, while abandoning the sick, the poor, and our children. The Ryan \nbudget can only be good for one very small group of Americans: the \nwealthiest among us.\n  Now, I was fortunate to succeed in business--succeed in a way that \nwould have been impossible to dream about when I was growing up in a \npoor family. But I was helped by our country's government for my \nservice in the military during the big war.\n  But in our democracy, each person gets one vote. So what do you do as \na candidate for national office when your vision for the country is \ngood for the few and bad for the many? You can pretend it is good for \neverybody. You can say it will benefit all Americans. In short, you can \nsubstitute fiction for truth. This approach was on brilliant display at \nthe Republican Convention when Paul Ryan claimed the Republican plan \nwould help the middle class--help that, frankly, we believe would take \nus downhill instead of Operation Uplift.\n  An article on Fox News' Web site described his convention speech as, \n``an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number \nof blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political \nspeech.''\n  Fox News, a conservative communications organization. Maybe that is \nwhy they call him ``Lyin' Ryan.'' His speech in Tampa was the most \npublic and extreme example of the smokescreen he has been blowing \naround here for a long time. So today I want to look at the numbers in \nPaul Ryan's budget because numbers don't lie, even if some politicians \ndo.\n  It is obvious Paul Ryan doesn't want us to see the specific programs \nhe would cut, but let's look at the devastating consequences if his \ncuts were distributed evenly.\n  Under the Ryan budget, 200,000 preschool children would be kicked off \nof Head Start rolls in 2014. We have a chart that clearly shows that. \nImagine slashing funding for a program designed to help children learn \nhow to learn. In our country today there are many situations where \nchildren don't have parental advice or the encouragement of parents to \nlearn. Head Start is a terrific program because Head Start teaches \nthese children that learning is fun, so that when they enter school \nthey are ready to accept learning and they look at it as something that \nwill be interesting and pleasant and worth doing. Ryan's cuts are \nshortsighted and they are cruel and they will only harm America's \nfuture.\n  As much as $115 billion could be cut from education funding over the \nnext decade if we follow the Ryan budget. With less support and rising \ncosts for higher education, young people would be forced to take on \nmore debt in order to attend college. If we were to talk to college \nstudents today, we would learn how tough it is, so that when they \ngraduate from college they may have a debt of $50,000 to $100,000. And \nhere they want the average college student to take on more. It is an \noutrage.\n  Why would anyone put obstacles in front of young people seeking an \neducation? They are not concerned about those who want to learn or how \nthey merge into our society.\n  I never would have been able to attend Columbia University without \nhelp from the government and the GI bill. When we came home from World \nWar II, this country invested in us--and that investment helped create \nthe ``greatest generation'' and decades of prosperity. The GI bill \nenabled me to cofound one of America's most successful companies, ADP. \nThat company\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\ntoday employs over 50,000 people in more than 23 countries. But instead \nof offering a helping hand to this generation's students, the Ryan \nproposal closes the door in their face.\n  Under the Ryan budget, government investments in science, technology, \nand medical research could also be shortchanged--cut by more than $100 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Medical research funding alone could \ntake a hit of nearly $6 billion by 2014. This would delay research on \nnew treatments for diseases such as cancer, childhood asthma, and \njuvenile diabetes. All of these would start to fall by the wayside.\n  We have a chart that says the Republican budget plan would take $5.8 \nbillion that would otherwise be used for asthma, juvenile diabetes, \ncancer, autism, and more. Who would want to deliver a message to a \nparent in America that says: Your country cannot provide the funds to \ncure your child's illness?\n  The Ryan budget also wants to add pain to those dependent on health \ncare programs. Instead of reassuring seniors that they can look forward \nto retirement in good health, he adds anxiety with cuts. He has \nproposed to end Medicare as we know it, giving seniors a voucher \ninstead of a guarantee. If that voucher can't cover the cost of needed \nmedical services, this is the Republicans' attitude: Too bad. You are \non your own. If Ryan succeeds, tell the Medicare beneficiaries that \ntheir costs for medical services can be increased at the will of \ninsurance companies.\n  Ryan's plan says: All right, cut Medicaid--that is a program for the \nimpoverished--cut Medicaid by more than $800 billion over a 10-year \nperiod. Medicaid is there to provide vital resources for expectant \nmothers and nursing home care for seniors. We created Medicare and \nMedicaid to be there for seniors and the poor when they get sick. Ryan, \nwith that sharp knife of his, wants to cut funding and break that \npromise. It is shameful.\n  A budget isn't just a collection of numbers; it is an expression of \nprinciples and priorities, and we shouldn't look at a budget like an \nauditor. We should see it as a way to fulfill the obligations of our \ndemocracy and to be there for those who need help. A budget sets forth \na vision for our Nation's future and makes a statement about what \ncounts in America and what are our values.\n  So when we see the budget authored by Paul Ryan called ``marvelous'' \nby Mitt Romney--Mitt Romney, candidate for President of the United \nStates called this budget by Paul Ryan and the budget passed by the \nHouse Republicans ``marvelous''--we should be deeply disturbed. It is \nan outrage for Republicans to say we should give the wealthiest \nAmericans more tax breaks as they increase the burden on a middle class \nalready struggling to afford the essentials. Who are we going to fight \nfor, middle-class families or the multimillionaires?\n  In our country last year, 400 people made over $200 million on \naverage. Should they carry their fair share of the country's \nopportunities and continue to invest in the country rather than \nshepherd the funds for their own personal use?\n  Everybody knows we cannot build a house from the chimney down and we \ncannot build a balanced society by soaking the poor to feed the rich. \nAt a time when our economy is fighting strong headwinds, when too many \nAmericans are out of work, Paul Ryan and his running mate offer the \nsame old prescription: tax cuts for the rich and austerity for \neverybody else. We will not hear this from him. Paul Ryan likes to \ndistract and distort. He has been hiding the truth about his budget so \nthe American people do not truly know what is going on.\n  The bottom line is this: Paul Ryan knows very well he cannot afford \nto tell the American people what his real agenda is because he knows \nwhat would happen. There would be no more buyers for what he is \nselling. Americans are now seeing the values the Republican Party and \ntheir new leader Paul Ryan are fighting for.\n  We let the Republicans have their way for 8 years, and it led to the \nworst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  Very often we will hear them say: Obama has not done what he should \nhave done. There are 4 million more people working now in the private \nsector than there were just two years ago and people are excited about \nthe health care plan because they know this health plan is going to \nhelp them be better, have wellness in their lives. It ultimately will \nreduce costs substantially.\n  It goes that way. But rather than help those who could use a boost, \ncould use some support--could use it to make sure their kids get \neducated or to help their parents, the people who built the strength of \nthis country over the years, past generations--rather than help them, \nlet's protect those, the wealthiest, who do not need the help.\n  During World War II, there was an excess profits tax. That tax was \nthere, designed to take some of the excess profits that companies were \nmaking. Now we ought to apply the same logic. We have people fighting \nfor their lives in Afghanistan and other places. Instead of saying \nlet's make sure everybody feels like they are included in this great \ndemocracy of ours, they are saying: No, let them take care of \nthemselves. As a matter of fact, it was suggested by Mitt Romney, the \ncandidate for President--he said these college students ought to borrow \nfrom their parents. In many cases, the parents are struggling to keep \nfood on the table or pay the rent or the mortgage.\n  Enough is enough. There is too much at stake to let ourselves be \nfooled by their tricks once again. We have to support the programs that \nhave been working. Perfectly? Not yet, but they are getting better all \nthe time. More people are going to work and more people view America as \nan opportunity for them to succeed in life.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  While I have the floor, I wish to pay my respects to Ambassador Chris \nStevens' family and to note that four American heroes were murdered \nyesterday at the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya, people who had an \nassignment to make sure their country, America, was working in Libya to \ntry to bridge the gaps that might exist. It is a terrible tragedy that \nhappened. We all have to note our sorrow.\n  My deepest condolences are with their families, their friends and \nloved ones as they mourn the loss of these patriots. This is a tragedy \nabout which all Americans are deeply saddened.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, and Senator Graham from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto speak about the horrific attack yesterday on the U.S. Consulate in \nBenghazi that killed four American citizens. The two confirmed thus far \nto be among the dead are Sean Smith, an Air Force veteran turned State \nDepartment information management officer, and Ambassador Chris \nStevens, one of America's finest and bravest Foreign Service officers.\n  I did not know Sean Smith--I know he was a great American who served \nhis country--but I had gotten to know Chris Stevens quite well. In \nAmbassador Chris Stevens' death, the Libyan people have lost a great \nchampion and believer in the peaceful aspirations of their democratic \nrevolution; the American people have lost a selfless and dedicated \nservant of our interests and our values, and I have lost a friend.\n  My thoughts and prayers today are with Chris's family and the loved \nones of his fallen colleagues. May God grant them comfort in their time \nof grief.\n  Our most urgent order of business now is to make sure our citizens \nstill living and serving in Libya and Egypt and elsewhere across the \nregion and the world are safe. Americans look to the governments in \nLibya and Egypt and elsewhere to meet their responsibilities in this \nregard. We also look to the Libyan Government to ensure that\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\nthose responsible for yesterday's attack in Benghazi are swiftly \nbrought to justice. In all of these critical tasks, we are confident \nthat our government will provide all necessary assistance and support.\n  Yesterday's attacks are an important reminder that so many of \nAmerica's civilians and diplomats and development professionals are \nrisking everything--everything--to advance our Nation's interests and \nvalues abroad. We must do everything in our power to ensure their \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, our thoughts turn to broader concerns: the mourning \nof our fallen friends, and how we as a Nation should respond to these \ntragic events.\n  One of my most memorable meetings with Chris Stevens was last April \nin Benghazi. As U.S. Envoy to the Libyan opposition, Chris had traveled \nto Benghazi at great personal risk to represent the country he loved so \nmuch while Libya was still gripped in a brutal fight for freedom. It \nwas clear there was nowhere that Chris would rather have been than \nLibya. We spent the day together, meeting Libyan opposition leaders and \nmany ordinary citizens, who spoke movingly about how much the \nopportunity to finally live in freedom meant to them, and how grateful \nthey were for America's support. Chris Stevens embodied that support, \nand his passion for his mission was infectious.\n  I kept in touch with him often and frequently after my visit. I was \nvery happy when President Obama nominated him to be America's \nAmbassador to the new Libya. The last time I saw Chris Stevens was \nshortly after he had taken his post, during my most recent visit to \nTripoli. I especially remember the lighter moments we spent together, \nincluding when Chris insisted on personally making me a cappuccino, a \ntask that he carried out with as much pride and proficiency as his \ndiplomatic mission.\n  That was on the morning of July 7--the day Libyans voted in their \nfirst election in half a century. Chris Stevens and I spent the day \ntogether again, traveling around Tripoli, visiting polling places, and \nspeaking with Libyan voters. We met a man whose father had been \nmurdered by Qadhafi's henchmen. We met a woman whose brothers had \nrecently given their lives fighting for their country's liberation. We \nmet countless others, including many older Libyans, who were voting for \nthe first time in their lives. And everywhere we went, we were greeted \nby crowds of cheering Libyans, bursting with pride and eager to shake \nour hands and express their gratitude for America's support. It was one \nof the most moving experiences of my life, and it was only made better \nby the fact that I got to share it with our outstanding Ambassador, \nChris Stevens.\n  What we saw together on that day was the real Libya--the peaceful \ndesire of millions of people to live in freedom and democracy, the \nimmense gratitude they felt for America's support for them, and their \nstrong desire to build a new partnership between our nations. That is \nwhy I am not surprised that senior Libyan leaders were among the first \nto condemn the horrific attack that killed Chris and his colleagues. \nAnd that is why I was not surprised to learn from our Secretary of \nState that many Libyans fought to defend our people and our consulate \nin Benghazi when they came under attack, that some were wounded while \ndoing so, and that it was Libyans who sought to get Chris and his \ncolleagues to the hospital. And that is why we cannot afford to view \nthe despicable acts of violence perpetrated yesterday by a small group \nof fanatics as in any way representative of the country and the people \nof Libya. That is not the real Libya, the Libya Chris Stevens knew and \nlearned to love so well.\n  After such a heartbreaking loss for our Nation, I know many Americans \nare asking whether the United States was naive or mistaken to support \nthe vast movement for change that is known as the Arab spring. I know \nmany Americans may feel a temptation, especially with so many domestic \nand economic challenges facing us here at home, to distance ourselves \nfrom people and events in Libya and Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle \nEast. We cannot afford to go down that path.\n  Yesterday's attack in Benghazi was the work of a small group of \nviolent extremists, whose goals and actions could not be more at odds \nwith those of the people and government of Libya. The Libyan revolution \nbegan peacefully and was dedicated throughout to the ideals of freedom \nand justice and democratic change. When Libyans turned out by the \nmillions to elect a new government in July, they gave the plurality of \ntheir vote not to religious fanatics but to a political party led by a \nmoderate technocrat and committed to friendship with the United States.\n  Libyans arose last year to free themselves from exactly the kinds of \nmurderers and terrorists who killed our American citizens yesterday in \nBenghazi. Their enemies are our enemies, and they remain as committed \nas ever to imposing their evil ideology through violence on people in \nLibya and the Middle East, and ultimately on us. They want to hijack \nthe Arab spring for their own insidious purposes. If we turn our backs \nnow on the millions of people in Libya and Egypt and Syria and other \ncountries across the Middle East--people who share so many of our \nvalues and interests, people who are the true authors of the Arab \nspring--we will hand our common enemies--the terrorists and \nextremists--the very victory they seek.\n  We were right to take the side of the Libyan people and others in the \nregion who share their peaceful aspirations. We would be gravely \nmistaken to walk away from them now. To do so would not only be a \nbetrayal of everything Chris Stevens and his colleagues believed in and \nultimately gave their lives for, it would be a betrayal of America's \nhighest values and our own enduring national interest in supporting \npeople in the Middle East and the world who want to live in peace and \nfreedom.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my friend from \nConnecticut. I know he shares with me the sorrow that we and all \nAmericans feel at the loss of a brave and dedicated American. But it \nwill be a long time before we forget Chris Stevens because he will \nstand as a shining example of patriotism and love of country.\n  Chris Stevens was not unaware of the danger he faced. He was privy to \nintelligence information, and others. But he went forward and did his \njob with a smile, with love of his country, and love of the country \nwhere he was serving. I cannot be more proud of Ambassador Chris \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \nvery eloquent statement. I associate myself with it.\n  It strikes me, as I listen, that it was no accident that these \nviolent extremists launched this attack on the American consulate in \nBenghazi, Libya, on 9/11, on September 11--a day of infamy in our \nhistory, a day when people across our country and around the world were \ncommemorating the worst terrorist attack in our history, which was \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Those who perpetrated the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, which \nresulted in the death of our Ambassador Chris Stevens carried out an \nact of terrorism and barbarism that they hope will sow fear and hatred \nbetween Americans and Muslims, just as Osama bin Laden and his \nfollowers hoped that attack of 9/11, 2001, would do 11 years ago. But \nwe did not let bin Laden succeed then, and we will not let these \nviolent extremists who killed Chris Stevens yesterday in Benghazi \nsucceed in dividing America and the West from Muslims and the Arab \nworld. Good, well-intentioned people in both great communities will \nrise and join together to renounce these extremists and killers.\n  I want to speak for a moment about Ambassador Stevens.\n  Simply put, Chris Stevens was one of the finest, bravest, most \nspirited, most talented diplomats in our Nation's service.\n  As a volunteer in the Peace Corps, he served in Morocco, where he was \ninspired to pursue a lifetime of service in the Middle East. When the \nuprising against Muammar Qadhafi began in February of last year, Chris \nwas the deputy chief of mission at our Embassy in Tripoli, Libya.\n  He was evacuated, along with other American personnel, from the \ncountry, but returned to Libya within weeks as the Special Envoy of the \nUnited States\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nof America to the opposition there--courageously slipping into rebel-\nheld Benghazi onboard a cargo freighter. It was an act of bravery that \ntypified Chris Stevens' service to our country and his devotion to our \nNation's ideals and his commitment to build bridges between Americans \nand Arabs, Americans and Muslims.\n  Chris remained in Benghazi throughout the war, standing with the \npeople of Libya during some of the darkest and most difficult hours in \ntheir struggle for freedom.\n  He became, in fact, the bright symbol of America, a heroic and \ninspiring figure to many Libyans, as Senator McCain and Senator Graham \nand I heard during our visits, and was thus the natural choice of \nPresident Obama to become our Ambassador to Tripoli after the Qadhafi \nregime fell. This is also why his death at the hands of violent \nextremists in Benghazi, which was the seat of the revolution against \nQadhafi, is so tragic and infuriating. Of course, we still do not know \nwhat happened at our consulate in Benghazi yesterday, but what is clear \nis that these attackers have to be apprehended and must be punished.\n  I am encouraged but not surprised by the statements of Libya's \nleaders condemning this attack. I say I am not surprised because these \nstatements of condemnation of those who killed Chris Stevens are \nconsistent with what I know the leaders of the new Libya to be, what I \nknow to be their profound admiration and love for Chris Stevens and \ntheir respect and gratitude for the United States of America. We look \nnow to the Libyan Government to act swiftly and decisively and to our \nown government to provide the Libyans whatever support they need to \nfind the attackers and killers.\n  While a specific group of individuals was responsible for this evil \nact and their target immediately was the Americans in that consulate--\nbut really their target was the new order in Libya, and they were \nanimated in this by an ideology that is now all too familiar to us that \nwe cannot ignore or excuse. This hateful and violent ideology is a \nthreat not just to the lives of Americans like Chris Stevens and the \nthree others who died yesterday in Benghazi but to the future of Libya \nand the future of the Muslim world. It is the exact opposite of the \nideals that inspired millions of Libyans to rise up last year against \nQadhafi to realize their dreams of a life of dignity, democracy, and \nhuman rights. For that reason, it is imperative now for those Libyan \npeople themselves to echo their leaders and condemn this violence and \ntake on the extremists who have taken shelter in their midst and who \nthreaten to hijack their revolution and imperil the future of their \ncountry, returning them to days as dark as under Qadhafi.\n  I know the overwhelming majority of Libyans reject this violent \nextremist agenda. They want a good education for their children. They \nwant foreign investment that will create jobs and raise their standard \nof living. After 42 years of despair and oppression under Qadhafi, they \nbadly want again to be part of the world, part of the modern world. The \nUnited States should stand ready and willing to help them on that path.\n  The fact is that the people who killed Chris Stevens yesterday in \nBenghazi do not represent the people of Libya or their elected \nleadership. But these killings require confronting the extremist \nminority that imperils this future, the fanatics who want a clash of \ncivilizations between the Muslims and the West and who will try to \njustify their violence in the name of Islam. They are wrong. They are \nmistaken. They are on the wrong side of history.\n  Finally, let me come back home and say--to echo what Senator McCain \njust said--that I know there will be some here in our country who in \nthe wake of this attack will be tempted to argue that it shows that \nAmerica's support for the Libyan revolution was naive or mistaken, that \nthe Arab spring will ultimately be defined not by a desire for \ndemocracy and freedom among the people of the Middle East and Arab \nworld but by the dark fanaticism of al-Qaida and its associates and \nthat the United States should give up trying to support people in this \npart of the world and instead retrench back here at home. That would be \nterribly wrong. That would misunderstand the motivations of the people \nwho have risen in the Arab world to overthrow the totalitarian \ngovernments that dominated their lives. They do not want the fanaticism \nof al-Qaida. They want the bright light of a democratic future.\n  We cannot allow what happened yesterday to be a victory for the \nextremists and the terrorists because to do so would be a betrayal of \neverything Ambassador Chris Stevens stood for, which is to say a \nbetrayal of America's best ideals.\n  I note the presence on the floor of the Senator from South Carolina. \nI would yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be brief. There is not a whole lot to be added to \nthe eloquent statements of my two friends other than to be here and to \nlet the family of Chris Stevens know that we saw in their loved one \nwhat you saw--a wonderful man who did great things with a life cut way \ntoo short.\n  I do not think most Americans can ever appreciate the leadership \nChris provided in Libya and throughout the world at a time when we \nneeded it the most. So America has lost one of her greatest diplomats, \nthe Libyans have lost one of their best friends, and the family has \nlost their dear loved one.\n  The one thing I can say for sure--Senator Lieberman just mentioned \nit--do not compound this tragedy. The worst possible outcome is to take \nthe death of this wonderful, noble man and use it as an excuse to \nwithdraw from Libya and the region and turn it over to the thugs who \nkilled him. Chris would not want that, it is not in our national \nsecurity interest, and Republicans and Democrats do not want that.\n  To the American people who are war-weary and frustrated, I totally \nget it. But the Arab spring--call it what you like--is a historic \nopportunity to change things in the Middle East. It will not come \nwithout a fight.\n  What we are trying to do in the Mideast and what the people in the \nMideast are trying to do is have a better life for themselves. If you \nare a young person, you have been exposed to life outside of the \ncorrupt country in which you live and you see it can be better and, \nquite frankly, you are demanding it can be better. You are demanding a \nbetter say if you are a young woman. You are demanding economic \nopportunity if you come from a certain class, not available to you \ntoday. And Chris Stevens risked his life because he understood that \nthose demands were just and in our best interests. The people whom we \nare fighting and the people the Libyan people are fighting are the ones \nwho have no interest in this agenda of being able to choose a better \npath for young women, being able to be tolerant, open, accept free \nmarkets, and to have a place where people can live their own dreams.\n  The world which we are fighting--your dreams are defined by the \nAyatollah. Your aspirations are defined by someone else's view of where \nyou should go and what you should be based on their interpretation of \nGod's plan for you. That, to me, is so unacceptable that it compels \npeople like Chris Stevens to risk their lives. That is what is at \nstake.\n  The good news is that we will beat these folks. The ace in the hole \nis that the people in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Afghanistan, and Iraq now \nhave been exposed to a different way of life. Given the capacity, they \nhave the will to fight back. But if we think this is going to be done \nwithout a struggle, we are kidding ourselves. Chris knew that. He knew \nthe fight that was going on for the heart and soul of the Arab spring \nin Libya was a fight worth engaging in and, yes, risking one's life \nfor. What more can you say about a fellow human being, an American, \nthan the fact that they realized their time on Earth could be best \nspent in service of a cause, as Senator McCain said, greater than \nthemselves. Chris understood what was at stake. He went to a place he \ndid not have to go. He accepted risks he could have avoided. He did it \nfor all the right reasons.\n  The one thing we should all unite around is that what compelled Chris \nStevens to risk his life is absolutely in our national security \ninterest; that is, to get the Mideast right, have a second opportunity \nnever known before in the Mideast to live in peace with people who in \nthe past wanted to kill us all. I am convinced that if we stick with it \nand we learn the lessons of Chris Stevens' life, we will eventually \nprevail\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\nbecause the ones who want to kill us all are really a minority. The \nones who would live with us in peace if they could just need our help. \nLet it be said that Chris Stevens was there to help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend for his eloquent words. I would also \nlike to again emphasize that there were four brave Americans--four. \nSean Smith was one of them, a truly great American. There are two \nothers--we do not even know their identity. So I hope the families who \nhave suffered this loss appreciate that we grieve for all. We had the \nopportunity of knowing Chris Stevens. I did meet Sean Smith and the \nothers. We mourn for them, and we thank them for their service to this \nNation.\n  I ask my friend from Connecticut, wouldn't the worst legacy of Chris \nStevens' service to this country be a movement of the United States to \nwithdraw, to fortress America, to renounce our service to the world in \nhelping these countries achieve the same democracy and freedom for \nwhich our forefathers strived? I do not mean to use his death as any \nkind of political agenda, but I remember him well enough to know that \nthe worst outcome of this tragedy would be for the United States to \nwithdraw. In fact, I am confident that if he were here, he would be \nurging us to get right back in, bring these extremists to justice, and \npress on with the democracy and freedom the people of Libya deserve and \nhave earned at great loss of blood and treasure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I could not agree more with my friend \nfrom Arizona. It would really dishonor the service of Chris Stevens and \nthe other three Americans who served us in Libya if their murders by \nthese extremists led us to retrench and pull out of Libya and stop \nsupporting the new Libyan Government, democratically elected, pull out \nof other parts of the Arab world. That would be exactly the opposite of \nwhat Ambassador Stevens devoted his life to. As I mentioned, inspired \nby his experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco, he devoted the \nrest of his life to service on America's behalf in the Middle East. The \nlast thing he would want this murder to do is to lead us to pull out, \nleave the area.\n  It would also be the fondest hope of the attackers, the extremists. \nWhy do they attack? They attack to kill individual people, but they \nreally attack to, as I said before, push America out and create a war \nbetween the Western world, America, and Islam. It is not natural. It is \nnot the direction in which history is going. History is going much more \ntoward integration. In fact, the revolution in Libya, which has gone so \nsuccessfully when you consider the 40 years of dictatorship under which \nthey lived--they held a free election. They elected what I would \ndescribe as a moderate rule-of-law slate to run the country. But those \nuprisings in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and now in Syria are the most \nprofound rejection and defeat for the extremism of al-Qaida and its \nallies and presumably this group who attacked the American consulate in \nBenghazi yesterday. I understand that the results of some of the first \nelections are unclear, in some sense unsettled to some people here, but \nthe fact is they have chosen democracy. People are self-governing, and \nthey are looking for a better life. That is exactly the opposite of \nwhat bin Laden, al-Qaida, and I would guess the people who killed Chris \nStevens yesterday desire.\n  Senator McCain is absolutely right. I can almost hear Chris Stevens \nsaying: Come on. Get up. Stay in the fight. Do not surrender to the \ncrazies, to the fanatics, to the violent extremists. Stand with the \noverwhelming majority, with the people of Libya, who want what we \nwant--a better future for themselves and their families.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to say in conclusion that I thank my old and dear \nfriend from Connecticut and the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Finally, I would share with my colleagues that on last July 7 I was \nin Tripoli with Chris Stevens and it was the first free and fair \nelection the Libyan people ever experienced. As we went from polling \nplace to polling place, we met people who had lost brothers, husbands, \nfathers, mothers, and sisters at the hands of one of the more brutal \nbutchers who has ever been on Earth, Muammar Qadhafi.\n  That night we went to the square, where some 200,000 people were \ndriving around, honking horns, celebrating, and waving Libyan flags. It \nwas a really auspicious start. And as Senator Lieberman pointed out, it \nwas a moderate group who were elected to govern Libya by the people of \nLibya. Chris Stevens was recognized by all of them. They knew Chris \nStevens and they knew what he represented--the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So those are memories I will never forget, and I hope his family will \nappreciate the magnificent service he provided to this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, before I say what I originally came \ndown here to say, I want to join my colleagues in condemning the \nsenseless, horrible attack at the U.S. Consulate in Libya and pay \ntribute to the four Americans, including our Ambassador there, Chris \nStevens, who were killed. I think all of us hope the killers will be \nbrought to justice quickly, and I suspect that will be the case.\n  Our country has lost four true public servants in the part of public \nservice which is the least known and sometimes the most important. It \nis a high calling, public service in general, but especially in \ndangerous places around the world. Ambassador Stevens was a serious, \ndedicated, and highly experienced diplomat with a tremendous depth of \nexpertise in Libya and the region. He and his colleagues spent their \nlives working on behalf of the United States of America and I hope \ntheir proud families and the entire diplomatic corps know we are deeply \ngrateful as a people.\n  This cowardly attack is a setback, but it will not stop us from our \nmission of promoting freedom and democracy for the people of Libya, and \nit should not. It will not keep our diplomats from their important work \noverseas.\n  I remember when I was a student in Japan, the Ambassador there at the \ntime, back in the early 1960s, was a fellow named Dr. Edwin Reischauer, \nwho was probably at that time the preeminent Japanologist in America. \nHe was a gentle, wonderful, marvelous person whom the Japanese loved. \nHe was stabbed in one of those senseless things that happen. It can \nhappen on American streets, but it can happen on the streets of other \ncountries, even with security. Some mad person got in and stabbed him \nin a traditional Japanese manner with a Japanese sword. It was a \nhorrible event, but he survived and it enlarged his legend. There was \nno bitterness from his family or his wife, and it didn't set anything \nback. The person was brought to justice.\n  Now I wish to speak also about other ways we must join together to \nhelp those who serve our country, and that is in creating job \nopportunities for our unemployed veterans. We have many veterans, and \ntoo many of them are unemployed or homeless. I am now talking about the \nVeterans Jobs Corps Act. This is a responsible investment and we should \ndo it promptly.\n  Standing for our veterans has been one of my top priorities since I \nbegan public service. You can't help but be that way if you live in \nWest Virginia. I suspect it is true in Oregon and lots of places all \nover the country. By definition it is true, but it is always personal, \nand in the Senate it has never waned.\n  Before I was a Senator, the person who held my seat for a long time \nwas Senator Jennings Randolph. I took his place on the Veterans \nCommittee and I have been on it now for 28 years. It is a glorious \ncommittee, brilliantly led now by Senator Patty Murray. I was chairman \nonce myself, perhaps not quite so brilliantly.\n  So many brave servicemembers, men and women, have fought to defend \nour way of life. People say that, and it is true, and they protect us \neach and every day. After such courageous and selfless actions, the \nleast we can do is make sure when they return home they get good jobs, \nbecause they deserve those good jobs.\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n  Military experience builds leadership, dedication, bravery, and \nteamwork, and these traits are learned from working on the frontlines. \nNot everything in the military happens on the frontlines, but I just \nhappen to be talking about that particular aspect in my short remarks. \nNo experience could prepare these workers better for the jobs they hope \nto do after they leave their military service.\n  I have a nephew who has just come back from Afghanistan. He may be \n23, maybe 25, but he is almost unreachable in his strength, his \npatriotism, and what has happened to him as a human being internally, \nintellectually, and in broad vision. He has grown so large and so \ngreat. He has a job, so I am not talking about him, but with so many \nbrave servicemembers--men and women--we need to pay attention to them \nwhen they come home.\n  Political rhetoric and partisanship have no business delaying efforts \nto help our veterans. Everybody likes to talk about veterans--actually, \na lot of bills do pass but not as many bills as should. Veterans did \nnot delay or decline when we called them for deployment, so we should \nnot delay now.\n  It is tragic that the unemployment rate for younger returning \nveterans is so much higher than the national unemployment rate. In \n2011, the unemployment rate for young male veterans was over 29 \npercent, more than 11 percent higher than nonveterans of precisely the \nsame age. It is heartbreaking that those who bravely served face \nunemployment or homelessness. This bill will not solve all problems, \nbut it will solve many of them.\n  West Virginians understand the importance of military service. With \nnearly 170,000 West Virginian veterans, we need to be sure they have \nour full support: getting a job, getting health care, and getting their \npensions. These words come out of one's mouth easily; getting the job \ndone is harder.\n  The Veterans Job Corps Act invests in our veterans and in our \ncommunities. Veterans would have a new opportunity to serve and protect \nAmerica by gaining priority placement in first responder positions, \nsuch as police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical \ntechnicians. That makes sense, doesn't it? Our veterans have the \nexperience and the instinct to do these jobs--they did it while they \nserved--and our communities need their help.\n  I don't know what is going to happen to the budget, but it is not \ngoing to be rosy and happy, and we need to have those jobs which help \nprotect us and keep us safe in play, for our veterans and for others \ntoo. It would create conservation and resource management jobs for \nveterans, enlisting them in efforts to rebuild America through \nrestoration of our forests, parks, coasts, and public lands. I think \nthe Presiding Officer would agree that is important.\n  The Veterans Job Corps Act would establish a pilot program to provide \nveterans with access to the Internet and computers to assist in job \nsearches and would offer the military's Transition Assistance Program \nto eligible veterans--and their spouses--at sites outside military \ninstallations in order to make it easier to relocate and pursue job \nopportunities.\n  The legislation would also provide veterans in rural areas, such as \nWest Virginia and Oregon, with greater access to career specialists to \nhelp them write resumes and prepare for interviews and therefore to \nfind jobs. The programs in the Veterans Job Corps Act are supported by \na fully paid-for $1 billion investment in our veterans' futures. It is \na responsible effort to support our veterans and provide help for \ncommunities across America.\n  In closing, I would like to especially thank Leader Reid and Chairman \nMurray for working with me to protect West Virginian jobs as part of \nthis bill. The Veterans Job Corps Act is an important investment in our \nNation's veterans and our economy, and I hope we can quickly move this \nbill through the Congress.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to first join with the many \nSenators today who have strongly condemned the violent attacks against \nthe men and women serving bravely in our diplomatic corps. The \nsenseless murders in Libya are a reminder of the dangers these public \nservants take on every day and the courage they show in furthering our \ndiplomatic goals all across the globe. We are all so grateful to them. \nMy thoughts and prayers go out to Ambassador Chris Stevens and the \nother victims of the attack, and I stand with the President, as we all \ndo, in supporting efforts to secure those who continue to serve us \nabroad.\n  I have come to the floor today to respond to the statements that were \nmade here earlier, that are completely inaccurate, about the bill we \nare currently considering on the floor, the Veterans Job Corps bill. In \nparticular, I want to respond to the baseless and frankly offensive \ncharges the Senator from Oklahoma made, insinuating that supporters of \nthis bill don't ``really care about veterans'' and that this bill \n``isn't about veterans.''\n  I have been working on veterans issues in the Senate for nearly two \ndecades and in all of that time, under Democratic and Republican-\ncontrolled Senates, under administrations of both parties and in times \nof war and peace, if there was one issue I have seen that rises above \nthe day-to-day bomb throwing that often characterizes the debate here, \nit has been the care and benefits for our veterans.\n  We can certainly disagree about policy, of course. We can fight with \nall of our hearts for what we think is right. But never--never--have I \nseen accusations that one party or one group was not fighting for what \nthey believed to be right for our veterans. In fact, the accusations \nleveled on the floor here earlier today were one of the biggest \ndepartures from the spirit of cooperation around veterans issues I have \nseen in my time in the Senate. So I am here today to set the record \nstraight about the steps this bill takes to put our veterans back to \nwork.\n  In doing so, I will not question the motives or the degree to which \nthose who may oppose this legislation care for our veterans because, as \nchairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee myself, I see \nRepublicans' commitment every single day. I will not level allegations \ndesigned to make our veterans political pawns and I certainly will not \nmislead anyone about what we have set out to do. I will not because \nhonestly I believe our veterans deserve far better. What they and the \nAmerican people deserve is the truth.\n  The truth is that caring for our veterans and helping to provide them \nwith the training they need to find jobs when they return home is a \ncost of the wars we have fought for the last decade. The truth is that \nless than 1 percent of U.S. citizens serve and sacrifice for the well-\nbeing of the other 99 percent. The truth is that what the Senator from \nOklahoma calls a charade is an effort to give those veterans as many \navenues as possible to find work. It is an effort to give them the \neconomic security and self-esteem that only a job can provide and that \nis so essential to their return home.\n  I understand it has taken some in the Senate a long time to come to \ngrips with the fact that our fiscal commitment we owe to those who wear \nthe uniform does not end the day they are discharged. The truth is, it \nis not enough to give our veterans a pat on the back for their military \nservice. We also have to give them a helping hand in the job market \ntoday. As the jobs report that was released last month reminds us, we \nhave over 720,000 unemployed veterans across the Nation, including over \n225,000 veterans who served since September 11. Despite what the \nSenator from Oklahoma may have said, this bill makes the resources \navailable to all of them. In fact, that is exactly why we brought this \nbill forward.\n  What we need right now is an ``all hands on deck,'' ``all of the \nabove'' strategy. That is why in fact this bill includes both \nDemocratic and Republican ideas. This is a bill that will increase \ntraining and hiring opportunities for all veterans, using proven job \ntraining programs from across the country. For instance, it increases \ngrants under the COPS and SAFER Programs that we have seen work to \ntrain and hire qualified veterans to work as police officers, \nfirefighters,\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nand other first responders. This is at a time when 85 percent of law \nenforcement agencies were forced to reduce their budgets last year. It \ncomes at a time when we face a $10 billion maintenance backlog for our \npublic lands. This bill will help training and hire veterans to restore \nand protect our national, State, and tribal forests, our parks, and our \nother public lands.\n  Because training and hiring veterans has never been and should never \nbe an effort that divides us, we have included a host of Republican \nideas into this bill. We included a bill from Senator Toomey that gives \nveterans increased access to computers and Internet tools to help them \nfind jobs in in-demand areas in their own communities. We included a \nbill sponsored by Senator Boozman that will increase transition \nassistance programs for eligible veterans and their spouses. And we \nincluded a very important provision from Senators on both sides of the \naisle that will help force our States to consider the military \nexperience of our veterans when they issue licenses and \ncertifications--something we have all heard when we go home.\n  We figured this comprehensive bipartisan approach would certainly be \nenough to gain Republican support, even if it did come as we are, of \ncourse, inching closer to an election. But over the course of the last \n48 hours or so we have heard that Republicans, including Senator Burr, \nwho is the ranking member of my committee, had an alternative version \nof the bill that Republicans wanted to push forward. The bill of \nSenator Burr includes a system to have States certify military \nexperience for jobs skills and helps veterans get hired into the \nFederal workforce, among a number of other provisions. It appeared to \nall of us that this late alternative might derail what I believe can be \nand ought to be a bipartisan effort. But again, we are committed to \nmaking this a bipartisan effort. So, instead of showing our veterans \nthat we are just about gridlock and partisanship, here is what we have \ndone.\n  Because, as I said before, this has to be an ``all of the above'' \napproach, we have, therefore, added every one of the provisions in the \nalternative offered by Senator Burr to our bill. Now I believe we have \nan even more bipartisan, more inclusive bill on the floor right now \nawaiting action. This is a bill that is paid for with offsets that both \nRepublicans and Democrats have supported. It is a bill unquestionably \nthat represents ideas from both sides of the aisle, including now from \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  There is no reason now that Republicans should not join us in passing \nthis bill and passing it quickly, because this does not have to be an \neither/or situation. Neither party has the magic bullet to solve these \nproblems, so we have to open as many proven opportunities to employment \nas we can.\n  You know, veterans are out there watching and waiting. They are tired \nof excuses and they certainly have no stomach for the kind of political \nposturing they saw earlier today, that comes only at their expense.\n  I know some Republicans have pointed to the calendar as the reason \nfor their opposition to this bill. Honestly, I wish it were not \nSeptember and we did not have to deal with the silly season here in \nWashington, DC. But who could care less about what month it is or how \nmany days out from an election we are? Here is the issue: Nearly 1 \nmillion unemployed veterans are looking for work today. They are \nconcerned about what jobs are available in their communities. Their \nconcern is what training program they can take advantage of and what is \nbeing done to honor their two or three tours overseas.\n  This is a bill now that offers them new resources to answer those \nquestions. It is a bill that will help them serve their community and \nhelp them provide honorably for their families. I truly hope now, with \nthe change we have added to the alternative bill offered by Senator \nBurr, we will have overcome our last hurdle before passage.\n  I come to the floor today to urge Republicans to join us now in \nrising above politics as we have done time and time again for our \nveterans. Ignore the calendar and the never-ending chatter about who is \nup and who is down. That is not what this is about. This is about \nmaking sure our veterans come first this and every week and that we \nintend to keep our commitment to them for their services.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the important \nVeterans Job Corps Act of 2012 that is on the floor of the Senate. But \nI did wish to first express my thoughts, as so many of my colleagues \nhave done on both sides of the aisle, that I strongly condemn the \nattacks in Egypt and Libya. I have been deeply saddened by the death of \nour Ambassador there as well as several other American citizens, and I \njoin all Americas in not only condemning these attacks but also in \nsending my prayers and thoughts to the families of those killed by \nthose senseless and horrific acts of violence.\n  On to the Veterans Corps Job Act. As we all know, as we have seen by \nthis horrific violence and by what we have seen overseas and in the \nMideast, our troops face that every single day when they are there, as \ndo our diplomats. They face that kind of threat. When they come home to \nthis country, we must treat them with great dignity and respect.\n  I have always believed that when we ask our young men and women to \nfight in defense of our Nation, we make a promise that we will give \nthem the resources they need to complete their mission. We also promise \nto take care of them when they come home to this country. When they \nsigned up to serve, there was no waiting line, and when they come home \nto the United States of America and they need a job or they need health \ncare or need an education, there should never be a waiting line.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, fighting for our veterans has been a \nmajor focus. While we do not have an Active-Duty base, we have the \nfifth largest National Guard in the country. Given that our population \nis only 22nd in the country, we can see we have a lot of people who \nwant to serve our country and sign up to serve on the frontline. We \nhave worked to cut through the redtape and streamline credentialing to \nhelp servicemembers transition their military skills into good-paying \njobs at home. To give just one example, right now returning paramedics \nare too often unable to count the medical training they receive in the \nmilitary toward receiving a license to become a civilian emergency \nmedical technician.\n  That is why I introduced the Veterans to Paramedics Act to fix that \nproblem by encouraging States to give paramedics credit for the medical \ntraining they have already received in the military. Not only does this \nhelp our veterans, it also helps relieve the shortage of emergency \nmedical personnel, especially in our rural areas, where we have seen \nthose shortages.\n  With commonsense solutions such as these, we cannot only fulfill our \ncommitment to our veterans but we can also help lift our economy and \nmake sure people who have the skills fill the jobs we have available. \nThis is what the Veterans Job Corps Act is all about, fulfilling our \npromise to our veterans, ensuring training and the opportunities they \nneed to find good-paying jobs and strengthening our Nation in the \nprocess.\n  To list just a few of the important provisions in this bill, first, \nthe Veterans Jobs Corps Act gives veterans a new opportunity to serve \nand protect America by granting them prioritized placement in first \nresponder positions such as police, firefighters, and emergency medical \ntechnicians.\n  Second, this bill would create conservation and resource management \njobs for veterans, enlisting their help in building a stronger and more \nbeautiful America through the restoration of our forests, parks, \ncoasts, and public lands.\n  Third, the Veterans Jobs Corps Act would establish a pilot program to \nprovide veterans with access to the Internet and computers to assist in \njob searches, a key bipartisan provision first introduced by my \ncolleagues across the aisle.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  Fourth, the Veterans Jobs Corps Act would especially help rural \nveterans find employment by granting them greater access to career \nspecialists who can help them write resumes, prepare for interviews, \nand find jobs. We know all too often the amazing experience and \nleadership experience they have had overseas fighting for our country \ndoes not always translate the terms and the words and the ways \ndescribed by the resume into truly explaining what it is to a potential \nemployer. That is why this skill training is so important.\n  This would also allow eligible veterans and spouses to enroll in the \nmilitary's innovative Transition Assistance Program at sites outside \nmilitary installations so they can relocate or return home in pursuit \nof job opportunities. This is a key benefit in my State of Minnesota, \nas I noted, which is very rural and also has no military bases.\n  The fact is, our returning veterans have battle-tested skills that \nare available to employers in all kinds of fields. This is something \ncompanies in my State have recognized. In fact, our business community, \nsmall and large, is already leading the way in reaching out to \nservicemembers before they have even begun the process of transitioning \nhome. In April of this year, when Minnesota's 34th Infantry Division, \nknown as the Red Bulls, was still deployed in Kuwait, representatives \nfrom several major companies in Minnesota actually flew into Kuwait to \nhelp the soldiers spruce up their resumes and prepare them for job \ninterviews. All across Minnesota, large and small companies are \ntargeting their recruitment efforts on returning servicemembers. This \nis the type of initiative we need.\n  In recent months, the unemployment rate for Minnesota veterans who \nhave served since 9/11 has hit nearly 23 percent, almost double the \nnational average for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan war. An \nunemployment rate that high among the men and women who have served and \nsacrificed for our Nation is unacceptable, especially when our State's \nunemployment rate is, in fact, at 5.8 percent.\n  I truly believe that with initiatives such as those launched by \nprivate sector companies in our State, with training programs such as \nthose created by this critical legislation, we are going to turn this \nsituation around. That is why I am calling on all my colleagues to \nsupport the Veterans Jobs Corps Act. This important bill, which is \nfully paid for, goes a long way in providing our returning veterans the \nleg up they need in transitioning to the civilian workforce.\n  Minnesota has always been a State that understands the debt we owe to \nmen and women who have served and sacrificed for us. I call on all my \ncolleagues to vote for this bill and to take a step toward fulfilling \nthat debt. This is the least we can do for the people who have fought \nand died to protect our values, freedoms, democracy, and human rights.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Veterans Jobs Corps bill, properly \nwritten, could be a positive piece of legislation. And I am not \nspeaking about the intent of the bill, whether it can be done \neffectively, but as ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I have \nto point out that this bill violates the budget. It violates the \nprinciples of common sense and good management, and it is the typical \nreason this government is on an unsustainable financial path. It is the \ntypical reason of why we are going broke.\n  This bill will cost $1 billion over 5 years in spending on a new \nprogram. It claims to be offset by new taxes and new revenue sources, \nbut my staff has worked on it and has confirmed there is a 302(f) \nBudget Act point of order against this Veterans Jobs Corps Act and the \nmanagers' amendment, and I am confident that if and when it is raised, \nthe Parliamentarian will agree. There is a budget point of order \nagainst this bill because it violates the Veterans Affairs Committee's \nallocation for budget authority and outlays for what was agreed to in \nthe Budget Control Act.\n  There was a limit to how much we would spend on the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee. They had a limit on the number of dollars they got. It was \npart of the August agreement--the Budget Control Act--of a little over \na year ago this past August. This is serious. We told the American \npeople we would raise the debt ceiling by about $2.1 trillion but we \nwere going to cut spending. We would immediately raise the debt ceiling \nand allow $2.1 trillion more in spending, but we promised we would \nreduce spending over the next 10 years by that same amount. That was \nthe agreement. The President signed it, our Democratic colleagues \nsupported it, and it passed. The debt ceiling was raised, so the \ngovernment continued to go forward. We were borrowing 40 cents of every \ndollar we spent in the U.S. Government. If we had not raised the amount \nof money we could borrow in this country, the entirety of government \nexpenditures would have been reduced immediately by 40 percent. So that \nis how big a hole we are in.\n  What this new bill does, with good purpose, is it spends $1 billion \nmore than we agreed to spend. So then what occurs? What occurs is, if a \nperson objects to that and raises the budget point of order, the Senate \nhas to waive it openly, publicly, before the American people. We have \nto say we can't find money within our budget to spend $1 billion more, \nbut we are going to spend it anyway, and every penny of it either has \nto be borrowed or will be paid for by increased revenues somewhere. So \nthat's what we are going to vote on. I intend to raise the Budget Point \nof Order.\n  But it is even worse than that. Some say, ``Well, over 10 years we \npromise to raise enough money to pay for this, that over the 10-year \nperiod we will raise the $1 billion. Don't worry about it. These tax \nincreases and revenue enhancements will pay for it. Count on us.''\n  I hate to say it, but it is not so. We have in this bill at least \none-third the amount of money that would be spent by the jobs corps \nbill coming from a well-known gimmick, a manipulation of an accounting \nsystem around here that allows us to spend more money than we have, and \nit scores not as an expenditure but as being a proper, valid pay-for. \nAnd it is as bogus as a three-dollar bill. I say without danger of \ncontradiction that this is a gimmick. If a private company were to do \nthis and utilize this method to manipulate and mislead stockholders, \nthey would have a lawsuit against the officers of the corporation. They \nwould. It is totally bogus.\n  Let me explain how this is done. This has been done before. I have \noffered a bill called the Honest Budget Act. Senator Olympia Snowe \njoined me in that, and that would have eliminated a number of \nmisleading gimmicks and fraudulent activities, including this one. Now, \nto explain, there is a certain corporate tax revenue we get from \ncorporations, and the drafters of this bill cleverly got the idea that \nthey could just accelerate the amount of money from fiscal year 2014 \ninto fiscal year 2013. They would bring that money back into 2013 and \ncollect it just a little bit earlier, and they could then say: We have \nanother $135 million in revenue in 2013, so we can spend that money, \nand it doesn't cost anything because we have this new money and it is \npaid for.\n  So this new Veterans Jobs Corps bill will be partially paid for. \nAbout one-third of its total cost will be paid for by collecting \ncorporate revenue taxes sooner. But think about that, if the \ncorporation pays its taxes a few months earlier--it pays it in fiscal \nyear 2013--then it won't owe them in 2014, will it? If they were \nplanning on paying them in 2014, now, they don't have to pay them in \n2014. So the hole has moved from 2013 to 2014. We moved the money over \nhere, but we won't have the revenue the next year that we would \nnormally have had. And that is to be done over 5 years.\n  In the fifth year--which is where our colleagues wanted the number to \nfall--it shows as if we had a $392 million total increase in revenue. \nThe money, added up each year over 5 years, plus increases, totals $392 \nmillion. Isn't that great? We didn't raise taxes. All we did\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\nis call in a little money a little earlier, and we have netted $392 \nmillion, right? Wrong. Year 6 is where the revenue doesn't come in, and \nin year 6 it shows that we will bring into the U.S. Treasury $392 \nmillion less because that money was collected early in the previous \nyear--$392 million less in year 6. It never is a net increase to the \nU.S. Treasury, although it might appear to be, according to the \nconventions of accounting the CBO uses around here. And CBO knows this \nis true. They would tell anyone the same thing if they were to ask \nabout this. They know exactly what this system is. But they follow \ntheir rules, and in the fifth year it suggests we have a $392 million \nsurplus from this advance collection of corporate taxes, and that is \nnot so.\n  So, my colleagues, this is a problem for us. We do not need to \ncontinue down this pathway. We need to be honest with the American \npeople. The President of the United States should be objecting to this \nkind of stuff. He should say: No, you can't play that game. The \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, should be saying: No, that is a \nmanipulation. The budget chairman, Senator Conrad, ought to say: No, it \nviolates the Budget Act. This isn't the way to do it.\n  Now, the alternative bill authored by Senator Burr is an honest piece \nof legislation and would do much of the same thing; however, it does \nnot violate the Budget Act and is therefore not subject to a budget \npoint of order.\n  This legislation could have been crafted that way, too. But being as \ngreedy as I guess we are, rather than having to face up to a little bit \nof the difficulty of finding a couple of hundred million dollars, out \nof $3.7 trillion we will spend next year, we would rather manipulate it \nthis way.\n  So what did we mean in August a year ago when we said we were going \nto cut spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years? Was that just a joke? \nIs this the kind of thing we are going to do every time a bill comes \nalong that has some appeal to it and we wish to support? Are we not \nwilling to stand up and pay for the legislation? Is there no waste, \nfraud, and abuse in this government that we couldn't work on? There \ncertainly is.\n  This government is mismanaged, it is out of control, and the Chief \nExecutive spends his days getting on an airplane going somewhere to \nmake a speech. What we need is somebody in the shop managing the \ntaxpayers' money. And when Congress tries to play these gimmicks, we \nneed a President that says, No. That is what this country needs. Until \nwe get that, we are never going to bring spending under control.\n  What do my President and my Democratic colleagues in the Senate say? \nSend more money. We can't cut anything. We have no ability to find \nsavings. We need more money, American people. Send more to Washington, \nprivate sector. It doesn't make a whole lot of difference in an \neconomic sense where it comes from. It is all a further drain out of \nthe private sector, so the public sector can spread the money around \nand maybe solicit some votes in the process.\n  This is how we got into this fix. I am concerned about it. I do not \nthink we should go forward with the legislation as drafted. Perhaps \nsome compromise can be reached. Senator Burr has worked hard on it. \nMaybe our Democratic colleagues can get together and put up a veterans \njobs bill that is honestly paid for. I know they could. And if it is \nworth it and we can find ways to make the tough choices that we are \npaid to do and set priorities, and help veterans find jobs through some \nsort of mechanism such as this, then let's do it. But let's pay for it, \nand let's don't use these gimmicks. Let's don't go about it in a way \nthat misleads the American people about how much the legislation is \ntruly costing.\n  I feel strongly about it. I am getting frustrated about it. It is \nalways: Well, it is just a few hundred million here and a few hundred \nmillion there, and the bill needs to pass, and don't raise these \nproblems now, we are slowing down the machine, we have a lot of things \nto do. It doesn't look as if we are so busy right now, but people think \nwe have things to do and they don't want to have to wrestle with the \nminutiae of a few hundred million dollars a year. But we should do \nthat. If we do that every day and if we stay within the budget amount \nwe agreed to last August, we will have made some improvement in the \noverall debt course of America.\n  To make clear, the Budget Control Act agreement called for a \nreduction of $2.1 trillion in spending over 10 years. During that time, \nwe were projected to spend $47 trillion. So the net reduction would be \nfrom $47 trillion to $45 trillion. Surely the Republic is not going to \nsink into the ocean if we reduce our spending from $47 trillion to $45 \ntrillion. Surely we can find that. It is not enough. We need to do \nabout three times that much at a minimum, and we can do that, too. This \nis still a substantial increase in spending. This is not a cut in \nspending over 10 years. At the current rate of spending, we spend about \n$37 trillion. So we are going from $47 trillion to $45 trillion over 10 \nyears instead of $37 trillion over 10 years. It is still a major \nincrease in spending over 10 years, but we are told that is impossible; \nall we can possibly do is $2.1 trillion in reductions.\n  The President was claiming credit for reaching this agreement, but \nthe budget he submitted this year wiped out the entire $2.1 trillion. \nIt wiped out the entire sequester and raised taxes by $1.5 trillion in \nincreased spending and about $1.8 trillion in increased taxes; no cuts \nat all under his budget; actually a spending increase over the \ntrajectory we were already on, which is an unsustainable trajectory.\n  I know I am being frank about this. Some can say this is a political \nargument. Well, we are in a political season, and I believe what I have \nsaid is accurate. I believe what I have said is true. I believe a \nbudget point of order lies against this bill because it spends more \nthan the Veterans' Affairs is allocated to spend, and we need to vote \non it. It is this kind of breaking the budget and spending more than we \nagreed that has helped put us in this fix, and we need somebody to help \nbring order out of chaos.\n  We are on an unsustainable path. This Nation is on the wrong track. \nWe are on the track to decline and debt and financial crisis, not the \nroad to prosperity. We cannot continue in this path.\n  Erskine Bowles and Senator Simpson before the Budget Committee told \nus that we have never faced in this country a more predictable debt \ncrisis. That was their joint statement, ``never faced a more \npredictable financial crisis.'' What they told us was: We are on an \nunsustainable path. If we stay on this path, we will have some sort of \ndebt crisis, another 2008 or 2007 recession caused by a financial \nbubble. And for the U.S. Government, what a disaster that would be if, \nas we are struggling to get people back to work and get the economy on \nthe rise, we have a financial crisis again putting us back into \nrecession. We need to avoid that. We have got to be mature and honest \nabout our money. We have got to get our debt under control.\n  This bill violates the deemed allocations included in the Budget \nControl Act. It violates sound principles of financial policy. It \ncontains a major gimmick, really a bogus allocation of over $300 \nmillion that claims to exist that does not exist at all. We need to fix \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 499, \nS. 3521.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to proceed.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 499, S. 3521, a bill to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend certain \n     expiring provisions.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, now that the Senate has finally adopted the \nmotion to proceed to the veterans jobs bill, we have brought to a close \nthe 380th filibuster during my time as majority leader--less than 6 \nyears. And just now, to start to bring debate to close on the veterans \njobs bill itself, I have had to file the 381st cloture motion during my \n5\\1/2\\ years as leader. That is 381 cloture motions filed in just 6 \nyears. Actually, it is less than that.\n  For comparison, in the 6 years that Lyndon Johnson was majority \nleader, he had to file one cloture motion. This has become outrageous. \nThe peoples' time is being wasted. We just finished 30 hours of \nnothing. We are now starting our next 30 hours of nothing, just \nstanding around looking at each other.\n  Filibusters have increased in recent years, but this is really \nunbelievable what has happened. The level of Republican obstruction has \nincreased dramatically. It has increased dramatically just in the last \nfew years.\n  We do not have to fight over everything. A veterans jobs bill, does \nthat deserve a fight? When we were in recess subject to the call of the \nChair, an Afghan veteran was brought out here. He is missing one leg. \nHe is 25 years old. He is an Army veteran. He is trying to hang on to \nhis other leg. The pages who are in here, I called them up and \nintroduced them to this young man. I wanted them to see what all of \nthis talk is about, of people who sacrifice for our country. Hopefully \nthis man will be well enough after some more rehabilitation time that \nhe can go out and look for a job. He will have at least one artificial \nlimb.\n  This is a veterans jobs bill that is being held up for what reason? I \ndo not know--or do I know? The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports there \nare about 200,000 unemployed post-9/11 veterans, approaching a quarter \nof a million. And as our Nation appropriately winds down our military \ncommitments abroad, we can expect increased numbers of newly separated \nveterans to enter the workforce.\n  The veterans jobs bill is a $1 billion investment in our veterans. \nThis bill would increase training and hiring opportunities for \nveterans. It would help to create jobs for veterans.\n  I commend Senator Nelson of Florida and the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, Senator Murray, for their hard work on this bill. \nUnfortunately, I have already received word that the Republican \nSenators are simply unwilling to pass this measure. One Republican \nSenator, for example, is insisting on a vote on something related to \nPakistan.\n  Another Senator has filed a right-to-work amendment. Yet another \nRepublican Senator has filed the Department of Defense authorization \nbill as an amendment to this bill. As important as Pakistan and many \nother issues are, the Senate ought to be able to focus on this young \nman who was here in the well this evening. We ought to be focusing on \ncreating jobs for veterans.\n  Now, we all know what is happening over here. The Republican leader, \nyou have to admire him, he stuck to it. His No. 1 goal is to defeat \nPresident Obama, and that is why we have not been able to legislate. \nEverything has been stopped. Everything. We have been able to push \nthrough a few things but not many.\n  As always, I will do everything I can to work with Senators to get \nconsent agreements to provide for consideration of this legislation. \nHopefully we can reach such agreement. I do not have much hope, but I \nam always, I guess, hopeful. But in the meantime, I will do what I need \nto do to ensure that the Senate can vote on this important measure. I \nwill do what I can to help create jobs for America's veterans. We need \nto do it for everyone, but could we just not agree on veterans?\n  I know we are now 30 hours postcloture. We all know the drill. Scores \nand scores of times--the Presiding Officer is a new Member of this \nSenate, relatively new. He has served going on two Congresses. But he \nis an expert at watching this. The Senator from Oregon has watched \nthis, and he understands what is going on, and it is not very good.\n  So the time will run out on this 30 hours from whenever the vote was \nturned in. First of all, we just--it is easy to get--especially when I \nam used to the Ryan math mixed up on numbers a little bit. So let's go \nback where we were.\n  We just completed and wasted 30 hours. I had to file cloture now on \nthe underlying bill. I have done that. Now we have to wait 2 days for \nthis to ripen. The 2 days is going to expire on Friday.\n  Now, we are going to vote on Friday, but it is not going to be at a \ntime convenient to everybody. We are going to come in shortly after \nmidnight tomorrow night, and we are going to vote on this. Then the 30 \nhours can start running, and then we will vote Saturday generally.\n  If people cannot work together to help veterans, then we are going to \nmake sure the American public knows what is going on here. So we will \nnot vote tomorrow night, but we will vote--it has to be anytime 2 days \nfrom now. We can do that tomorrow night or actually Friday morning \nearly, a little after midnight.\n  I am sorry I got a little mixed up on 30 hours, 2 days for something \nto ripen. Then, as I said, I have been very confused because of the \nRyan math. It has been difficult for me to accept all of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3457\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, where to start? I mean, what a charade and \nwhat a farce. The majority filibusters their own bills. They fill up \nthe amendment tree. They do not even pretend like they are going to \nwork with the other side. How do they expect to pass legislation if \nthey will not allow any input from the other party? A charade and a \nfarce.\n\n  As far as helping that young veteran, our soldiers went to war in \nAfghanistan to get bin Laden. We finally got bin Laden, and we got him \nwith the help of Dr. Shakil Afridi. I do not hear one peep from the \nother side, I do not see one bit of concern for the man who helped get \nbin Laden.\n  Our soldiers went to Afghanistan. That young man lost a limb. A young \nman in my town also lost three limbs. They did it to get this horrible \nmass murderer bin Laden. This happened, and this is why we went to war. \nWe are going to do nothing to support the man who helped us get bin \nLaden?\n  We send good money after bad. Billions of dollars have been \nsquandered in Pakistan. Pakistan then tortures the man who helped \nAmerica get bin Laden. And we do nothing. I have asked for 15 minutes \nto vote on this\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nissue--15 minutes. No one is obstructing this for any sort of personal \nvendetta. I am more than happy to work with the majority. I care deeply \nabout the veterans. I care deeply about housing and helping the \nveterans who have fought for their country. But this is about whether \nwe as a country and the American taxpayers will be asked to send good \nmoney after bad to allies that are not acting like allies.\n  Today we are reminded that our enemies are relentless, but we are \nalso reminded that our so-called allies are not acting like allies at \nall. We are saddened by the assassination of Ambassador Stevens and his \nfellow workers, and we are appalled by the lack of protection for our \nembassies by our supposed allies. We send billions of taxpayer dollars \nabroad. And what do we get in return? Disrespect, disdain, and now \nultimately violence.\n  I have two amendments I wish to call up. First, not one penny should \nbe sent to Libya until the assassins are delivered to justice. Not one \npenny should go to Egypt until they guarantee the safety and protection \nof our embassies.\n  Second, not one more penny should go to Pakistan until the doctor who \nhelped us get bin Laden is freed. Is it too much to ask of the Senate? \nI am more than willing to cooperate. I am more than willing to let \nthose go home who want to go home and campaign. I know it is going to \nbe a tough election for the other side. But the thing is, I am more \nthan willing to let them go home anytime.\n  I do this because it is important that our allies act like allies. It \nis important that we have a vote, that this Senate go on record and \nsay: Do you support the American taxpayer? Do you want to help the man \nwho helped us get bin Laden?\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendments and call \nup amendment No. 2783 and also another amendment that is at the desk \nand yet to be numbered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky says there is no \ninput from the minority, but, in fact, the substitute amendment we are \ngoing to vote on in the next day or two which is now pending before us \nhas numerous provisions authored by Senate Republicans.\n  I respect the interest of the Senator from Kentucky in relation to \nPakistan, Egypt, Libya, but every now and then the Senate should be \nable to focus on a small good thing. To veterans this is a big thing. I \nlike helping them. So I understand my friend's tenacity. But I also \nunderstand how the Senate operates.\n  I just think my friend from Kentucky maybe should have run for \nSecretary of State rather than the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Julie Hasquet, my \nlongtime press secretary and dedicated staff members, whose way with \nwords, quick wit, and sharp pen has served me and the people of Alaska \nvery well for over 9 years. Julie had a tall task working for my then \nnew mayoral administration for the Municipality of Anchorage as we \nbrought down blighted buildings, drove out drug dealers, and culled out \nthe ``cat lady'' in an effort to clean up the city. Julie staged press \nevents all over town with backdrops that included bulldozers, \njackhammers, demolition crews and even a wrecking ball painted as a \npumpkin to take down a dilapidated gas station one cold Halloween \nafternoon.\n  A former television news reporter, Julie expertly guest hosted talk \nradio shows where she would interview and cajole her own guests, \nincluding me, to discuss politics, policy, police, and issues of the \nday with the ease of a well-seasoned pundit. She used those skills in \nthe mayor's office and in the U.S. Senate to write more than 4,500 \npress releases, thousands of tweets and texts, and to bring our office \ninto the Facebook age with quips, quotes, and photos to tell the whole \nstory as it was unfolding.\n  Over the years I have watched with pride as Julie has balanced family \nlife with civic duty, raising two smart, talented, daughters, Shelby \nand Savannah, participating in many charitable organizations, and \nvolunteering at events while spending time with her many friends.\n  Julie spends her spare time pursuing every kind of Alaskan activity \nfrom triathlons to target practice and scrapbooking to snow-machining. \nJulie's love of Alaska shines through everything she does and her \nability to tell Alaskans their own story, in as few words as possible, \nis a rare talent indeed.\n  While Julie may be leaving the wild world of politics now, or so she \nthinks, I commend her and thank her for each and every one of her well \nsaid words and a job extraordinarily well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6261-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I wish to express support for women \nacross America who are battling ovarian cancer and their families and \nfriends who stand with them in their fight. It is estimated 22,280 \nwomen will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. Of these women, \n15,500 of them will lose the battle against this disease--1,040 of the \nwomen who will lose the battle this year live in Florida. To put those \nnumbers in perspective, this year, across America, 3 percent of new \ncancer diagnoses in women will be ovarian cancer, but ovarian cancer \nwill account for 6 percent of female cancer deaths this year.\n  September marks National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, which is why \nI chose now to bring attention to this disease. Ovarian cancer is the \nninth most common cancer in women and the fifth leading cause of \ncancer-related deaths because ovarian cancer is a unique cancer--there \nare no screening tests or early detection tests available. However, if \novarian cancer is treated before it has spread past the ovary, the 5-\nyear survival rate is 93 percent. Sadly, only 15 percent of ovarian \ncancer diagnoses happen in this early stage, making the overall 5-year \nsurvival a mere 46 percent.\n  Until a screening test is developed, the best we can do to protect \nour wives, daughters, sisters, nieces, mothers, grandmothers, aunts, \nand friends is to bring awareness to the risk factors, signs, and \nsymptoms of ovarian cancer. I urge my colleagues to help educate women \nabout the potential warning signs to help with early diagnosis, which \nis the best method to save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6261-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6261-S6262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOYE KELLEY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncareer of Joye Kelley who is retiring as the president of the Rogers \nBoard of Education after a lifetime of service and dedication to \neducation.\n  Joye Kelley has been a fixture of the Rogers School Board for more \nthan 29 years serving 20 of those years as president. During her \ndecades of service, Joye has been a visionary for expansion and growth \nof a school system challenged to meet the needs of the growing \npopulation. During her years on the board, Joye ushered in many \nimprovements to schools including the construction of 14 new schools to \naccommodate the tremendous growth.\n  Joye has led the Rogers School District to be one of the best \ndistricts in Arkansas establishing the mission that welcomes all \nstudents and works to help each student succeed. The result of her \nvision and leadership is the creation of an award-winning education \nsystem that is recognized nationally. Both Rogers High School and \nHeritage\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\nHigh School have been named among the top 1,000 high schools in the \ncountry by U.S. News & World Report. Both are ranked in the top five \nschools in Arkansas, and the school district is home to a National Blue \nRibbon School.\n  Joye sets a great example of being a hands-on leader, insisting that \nthe board members tour all 23 school campuses at the beginning of the \nschool year to make sure students are provided with a quality learning \nenvironment. Joye's husband, Gene, estimates that she spends up to \n1,000 hours each year in service to schools.\n  Perhaps one of Joye's greatest achievements was her influence on \neducation funding in Arkansas and encouraging the State to make it a \npriority. Her courage to lead the Rogers School Board to challenge \neducation funding helped pave the path for a better education system in \nArkansas for students no matter what school district they are enrolled \nin or where they live.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Joye as a member of the school \nboard. Her expertise and vision made a lasting mark that will be \nenjoyed by the community and students for generations after she no \nlonger presides over school board meetings.\n  Joye has displayed dedication, perseverance and commitment to \neducation. I appreciate her friendship and am grateful for her years of \nservice and efforts devoted to improving the education of Arkansas \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6262-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO HOMETOWN HERO MEDAL\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nsecond year of the presentation of the Idaho Hometown Hero Medal and \ncongratulate the 2012 recipients of this esteemed honor.\n  This award was established by Drs. Fahim and Naeem Rahim, who, in \naddition to their professional and medical service, have a belief in \ncommunity service and a desire to give back to the community and our \ncountry. After receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, they decided \nto return to Idaho and start the Idaho Hometown Hero award to recognize \nand celebrate individuals who embody the spirit of philanthropy while \nshowing remarkable commitment in both their personal and professional \nlives. Their efforts to recognize those working for the betterment of \nour communities play an important role in inspiring all of us.\n  I am honored to be among the 2011 recipients of this medal, and I \ncongratulate the 2012 award recipients and recognize the efforts of the \nRahim brothers, the award's committee members, the cosponsors, \nvolunteers, and other organizations supporting this honor. Ten \nextraordinary individuals are 2012 Hometown Hero award recipients: Don \nAslett, a businessman, author, and builder of Pocatello's Museum of \nClean; Cpl Phillip Baldwin, a marine veteran of Afghanistan now \ntraining for the Paralympics; Jonathan Cree, M.D., a physician and \nmedical educator; Patti Farrell, a women's advocate and founder of the \nDrive for the Cure; Warren E. Nyer, a nuclear energy expert and last \nsurvivor of the Manhattan Project; Jody Olsen, a lifelong athlete and \npromoter of the Southeastern Idaho Senior Games; Rudolfo M.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Jennifer Joy Pinniger upon her retirement \nas president and CEO of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, \nNSSGA. Joy joined the National Stone Association in December 1996, and \nshe has been ``Romancing the Stone'' ever since. To her that means \nhelping decisionmakers, the aggregates workforce, and the public \nunderstand the purpose and value of the aggregates, or the stone, sand \nand gravel industry. She has focused NSSGA's advocacy on those issues \nwith the most potential impact on the industry, always aware that the \nmost effective advocates are those members of NSSGA who work every day \nto produce the construction materials essential to the built \nenvironment.\n  Joy has reminded me on several occasions that her father's roots are \nin Oklahoma, although as a Navy officer he moved his family around the \nworld. Prior to joining NSSGA, Joy served very ably as chief of staff \nto former Senator John Warner and as an aide to Virginia Governor John \nDalton before that.\n  Joy has championed the industry in meetings with administration \nregulatory agencies, always intent on finding solutions that will not \nonly be positive for the aggregates industry but that are right for \nAmerica. The Rocks Gallery in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History \nis an example of an NSSGA-member endowed opportunity for the aggregates \nstory to be told from the vantage point of a world-renowned educational \ninstitution--an example of teamwork between innovative members and the \nNSSGA team quarterbacked by Joy Pinniger.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Joy as she led the NSSGA's \nadvocacy for passage of the last two surface transportation \nauthorization bills. Joy realized early on that involvement of the \npublic--those affected by the need to get to and from jobs on a daily \nbasis, to take parents to the doctor, to attend children's soccer \ngames; in reality all of us--was critical to success in moving surface \ntransportation legislation forward. She worked tirelessly facilitating \nNSSGA member contacts with community leaders and lawmakers to build \nmomentum for this often overlooked national priority. Success came in \nthe form of passage of SAFETEA-LU in 2005 and MAP-21 in 2012.\n  Joy's advocacy leadership extended well beyond transportation to \nthose regulatory issues affecting the aggregates industry. She \ncontinually emphasized the industry's ethics and credibility through \nNSSGA member company commitments to safety and health resulting in 11 \nyears of record-breaking achievements.\n  With diplomatic leadership, Joy's policy, management, and \nmotivational strength has helped NSSGA members reinforce message and \nguide relation bridges to fend off unjustified regulations like \ntightened standards for ``farm dust,'' and legislation that does not \naccurately distinguish aggregates operations from others.\n  Joy Pinniger has led the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association \nwith distinction and integrity. I will miss her steadfast leadership, \nbut congratulate her on her retirement and extend best wishes for \nwhatever she chooses to do next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6262-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6262-S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NORTHEAST WISCONSIN TECHNICAL COLLEGE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Northeast Wisconsin Technical College for its 100th \nanniversary.\n  Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, founded in 1912 as the City \nVocational Schools in Green Bay and Marinette, has grown exponentially \nin size and impact over the past century. From its earliest offerings \nof courses in machine shop, woodworking, bookkeeping, and shorthand to \ntoday's workforce development in business management, engineering \ntechnologies and web development, it has maintained a commitment to \nproviding students with exceptional hands-on training in traditional, \nnew and emerging sectors.\n  I am proud to have supported NWTC throughout my time in the Senate, \nworking to secure funding for various educational programs and the \nN.E.W. Clinic, where patients have access to\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\nmuch needed, quality medical care while the next generation of health \ncare workers receives exceptional, hands-on training. The N.E.W. \nClinic, like NWTC, has become a tremendous asset to the residents of \nWisconsin.\n  Today, NWTC graduates more students than all other Green Bay area \ncolleges combined, preparing tens of thousands of students for careers \nthrough its 180 programs of study. For the last 2 years, NWTC has rated \nin the top 10 percent of community colleges nationally as ranked by the \nAspen Institute.\n  Northeast Wisconsin Technical College has built a strong reputation \nand steadfast foundation that helps support and grow the regional \neconomy. With statistics showing that 95 percent of its 2011 graduates \ncontinue to work in Wisconsin and 73 percent remain in the region, NWTC \nalso shapes the local economy. Students, thousands of area businesses, \ntheir employees, and the entire region all benefit from NWTC's \ncommitment to building partnerships and alliances that help everyone \nsucceed.\n  On behalf of our entire Nation, I join the people of Wisconsin in \nrecognizing and commending Northeast Wisconsin Technical College for \nproviding 100 years of outstanding service and quality education to its \nstudents. Today, we honor the leaders who founded the college, and all \nof the faculty, staff, and students who enrich Wisconsin's long, proud \ntradition of excellence in education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6263-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an \noutstanding non-profit in Columbia, MD, Enterprise Community Partners, \non the occasion of its 30th Anniversary.\n  In 1982, Jim Rouse and his wife Patty founded Enterprise Community \nPartners as a neighborhood-based partnership to revitalize communities. \nThey founded Enterprise with the ambitious goal of making sure every \nAmerican lives in a decent, affordable home. Over the years, this \norganization has grown to be a leading provider of capital and \nexpertise for affordable housing in thriving communities. Today, Terri \nLudwig leads the organization as it continues on the important work of \nits founders.\n  Enterprise Community Partners has invested more than $11.5 billion to \nbuild and preserve nearly 300,000 affordable rental and for-sale homes \nand create more than 410,000 jobs nationwide. This includes almost $1.2 \nbillion invested directly in Maryland--building and preserving \nthousands of homes in the State. Because of Enterprise, over 14,000 \nindividuals and families have a place to call home in Maryland.\n  As a member of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nput money in the federal checkbook to build and protect our \ncommunities. Providing safe, affordable and adequate housing has always \nbeen one of my top priorities. Safe, sustainable, and affordable \nhousing is essential for community growth and stability. Kids in \nquality housing do better in schools, neighborhoods have much less \ncrime, and communities are stronger.\n  In 1992, I worked with Senator Kit Bond to create the HOPE VI program \nwhich revolutionized public housing by leveraging public and private \nresources to replace dangerous and run-down public housing projects \nwith mixed-income communities that integrated schools, businesses and \ncommunity services alongside public, affordable and market rate \nhousing.\n  HOPE VI has been successful in transforming communities and \ntransforming the lives of people living in public housing. Enterprise \nhas been an important partner in stabilizing Baltimore's stressed \ncommunities and encouraging investment by residents and businesses so \nthat neighborhoods in Baltimore remain places to live, work, shop and \nworship.\n  Enterprise stories include families who, due to a reduction in hours \nat work and layoffs, are at risk of foreclosure; young adults who age \nout of foster care and face homelessness; and homeless individuals with \ndisabilities. Enterprise develops and preserves affordable housing in \ncommunities linking people to opportunities for success.\n  The Enterprise Green Communities Initiative is the first national \nframework for green affordable housing. The 5-year, $555 million \ninitiative plans to build more than 8,500 environmentally healthy homes \nfor low-income families. It provides grants, financing, tax credit \nequity and technical assistance to developers who meet Green \nCommunities Criteria for affordable housing that promotes health, \nconserves energy and natural resources, and provides easy access to \njobs, schools, and services.\n  Four years ago, Enterprise announced the formation of the Save \nAmerica's Neighborhoods Campaign, a coalition of national and local \norganizations concerned about the foreclosure crisis' impacts on \ncommunities. The coalition's efforts were important contributors to \nestablishing the Neighborhood Stabilization Program at the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, which offers grants to \nhelp families and communities at risk of foreclosure.\n  Enterprise should be recognized for its work to sustain and restore \nthriving communities nationwide. Enterprise tackles some of the \ntoughest problems in our communities and continues to transform both \ncommunities and families throughout the country. They invest in \nneighborhoods that are working together to solve their own problems for \nthe collective good of the community.\n  I thank the volunteers, staff, board members and foundations \nsupporting Enterprise Community Partners for all of their work, for \ntheir commitment to each other, for their commitment to community, and \nfor their commitment to Maryland. And I congratulate you on this \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6263-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6263-S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LaCASSE BAT COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as you are aware, baseball is \nconsidered our national pastime. Every spring millions of Americans \neagerly await the crack of a wooden bat as baseball and softball season \nbegin. With this in mind, today I rise to recognize and commend the \nsuccess of LaCasse Bat Company, located in Skowhegan, ME and its owner, \nJesse LaCasse.\n  Mr. LaCasse is a former local baseball standout, playing at Saint \nJoseph's College of Maine, where he earned a degree in Sports \nManagement. While in college, he was inducted into the Saint Joseph's \nAthletic Hall of Fame. As a hitting fanatic who was driven by his love \nof the game, he began manufacturing wooden bats for his personal use in \n2006. The custom bats caught on with his summer league teammates, and \nsoon he was making bats for individual players, adding a logo and the \nplayer's name to the design.\n  LaCasse Bat Company, a one-person operation, was founded in 2008 \nusing local Maine materials in production. From cutting the trees to \nthe final product, each step of the development of these bats is \nmeticulously crafted. LaCasse Bat Company uses premium quality wood and \nmakes bats from solid ash, birch, beech, and maple. Mr. LaCasse turns \neach bat by hand on a wood lathe, a process which takes roughly 15 to \n20 minutes, and brands it with his logo. Through this careful method, \nMr. LaCasse is able to fine-tune the balance of the bat and make each \nbat distinctive to the individual player. This personal touch and \ndedication to craftsmanship contributes to the truly unique nature of \neach handmade bat.\n  In 2010, LaCasse Bat Company teamed with Subway Restaurants to \nhandcraft four custom-colored bats to be donated at the 2010 Senior \nLeague World Series held in Bangor, ME. These were the first colored \nbats made by LaCasse Bats and each features the green, yellow, and \nwhite colors of the Subway franchises.\n  Since the exposure of the 2010 Senior World Series, LaCasse has seen \na high demand for tailor-made and colored bats. LaCasse Bats takes \nevery aspect of personalization into account, offering customization of \nhandle, barrel, and logo colors and sizes, as well as the specific bat \nweight and type of wood. LaCasse Bats currently supplies teams from \nLittle League through college in the United States and Europe, with \nmost of its sales coming from Maine. As sales continue to grow, Mr. \nLaCasse hopes someday one of his bats will make it to the plate in \nMajor League Baseball.\n  As a small business, LaCasse Bat Company's success in just a few \nshort\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nyears has been exceptional. It is inspiring to know that entrepreneurs \nsuch as Mr. LaCasse continue to draw upon their passion, ingenuity, and \nenergy to develop new businesses. I extend my congratulations to Jesse \nLaCasse for his tremendous effort and offer my best wishes for the \ncontinued growth and success for LaCasse Bat Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6264-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SERVICES CENTER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION\n\n Mr. THUNE.

As a community charter, membership is open to all who live \nor work in Bon Homme or Yankton Counties. Building upon their mission \nof being responsive to their members' needs by providing competitive \nfinancial services, their membership has grown to nearly 6,500 Bon \nHomme and Yankton County residents.\n  As a credit union member myself, I understand firsthand the benefit \nof a credit union membership. Credit unions are a part of the community \nand they are well aware of the specific needs of their members. Their \ncommitment to providing the best possible service is commendable, \nespecially in the financial environment we are faced with today.\n  The SCFCU commemorated their 50th anniversary during their annual \nmeeting held in Yankton, SD, on June 23, 2012. I would like to offer my \ncongratulations to the leaders and membership of the SCFCU on this \nmilestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6264-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6264-S6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY MIZEL\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a great Coloradan--Larry A. Mizel--on the occasion of his \n70th birthday on September 14.\n  There are few Coloradans who embody the spirit of the Centennial \nState as well as my friend Larry, and it is a privilege today for me to \nbe able to share my thoughts about him with my Senate colleagues.\n  Larry is many things to many people, but at root, I think of Larry as \nan independent thinker; a savvy businessman; a man who cares about the \nworld, his community and his family; and a man whose philanthropic \nreach is as wide as the Rocky Mountains are tall.\n  I ask my colleagues to indulge me while I talk a bit about Larry and \nrecount some of his most notable accomplishments. The list is long, but \nhis work stands as a model for others.\n  Larry always has believed in the value of a good education, and his \nown educational history is impressive. He graduated with a bachelor's \ndegree in business administration from the University of Oklahoma in \n1964, and 3 years later, Larry received his law degree from the \nesteemed University of Denver College of Law.\n  From there, Larry took off at warp speed.\n  In 1972, Larry founded the company that became M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., \nwhich is one of the Nation's top homebuilders. MDC is the parent \ncorporation to Richmond American Homes and is a New York Stock \nExchange-listed company.\n  Forty years after founding M.D.C., Larry still serves as chairman and \nchief executive officer of the company. That is an amazing run, with a \nlot more to come, I hope and predict.\n  Under Larry's visionary leadership, M.D.C. consistently has \nmaintained one of the strongest financial positions in the industry.\n  But it is not just profits that distinguish M.D.C. M.D.C. also is \nknown for its high-quality work. For example, M.D.C. has the \ndistinction of being one of the few homebuilding-based companies to \nreceive an investment-grade rating from all three rating agencies.\n  Larry has never been one to rest on his laurels. In addition to \nM.D.C., he has pursued other business ventures. Larry was a founder \nand, until 1996 chairman of the board of Asset Investors Corporation, a \nNew York Stock Exchange-listed real estate investment trust, as well as \nof Commercial Assets Inc., a real estate investment trust that traded \non the American Stock Exchange. In addition, Larry served as chairman \nof the board of directors of Omnibank, a multi-bank holding company, \nuntil its sale to KeyCorp in 1995.\n  Yet, Larry is known in Colorado for more than these business-world \naccomplishments, as impressive as they are. Larry stands as a shining \nexample to Coloradans about how to enrich the communities in which we \nlive and to give voice to those who sometimes cannot speak loudly \nenough for themselves.\n  Larry has been actively involved in numerous charitable, religious, \nand community causes, some that reach beyond our borders.\n  For example, there are few leaders in Colorado who care as deeply as \nLarry does about issues related to Israel and to Jews around the world. \nLarry is a member of the national board of directors of the American \nIsrael Public Affairs Committee better known as AIPAC which works to \nensure a strong United States-Israel relationship.\n  Larry also is one of the founders of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an \ninternational human rights organization, based in Los Angeles, CA. He \nhas served as the International Chairman of the board of trustees of \nthe Wiesenthal Center since 2003. As most of us know, the Wiesenthal \nCenter helps to accomplish goals that Larry holds dear--namely, \npromoting tolerance and combating racism and anti-Semitism around the \nworld.\n  It bears noting that the educational arm of the Wiesenthal Center--\nthe Museum of Tolerance--is a recipient of the 2004 Tolerance Award \ngiven at the United Nations. It is a world-class human rights \nlaboratory and learning center dedicated to challenging visitors to \nconfront important contemporary issues.\n  Closer to home, Larry also founded the Mizel Arts and Culture \nCenter--known as the MACC--located in Denver at the Jewish Community \nCenter. The MACC aims to illuminate the human experience through \nperforming, visual, and literary arts for the Jewish community and the \ncommunity at large.\n  Larry's interests and expertise in international affairs extend far. \nFor example, he is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations, \nan independent organization dedicated to finding solutions to the \nchallenging foreign policy choices facing the United States and other \ncountries--choices made all the more challenging after the terrorist \nattacks of 9/11.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6264, September 12, 2012, the Record reads: . . . and \nother countries choices made all . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . and other \ncountries--choices made all . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Thankfully, Larry has brought his business acumen into the public \npolicy arena. For example, in 1986 Larry founded and served as the \ninaugural chairman of Colorado Concern, an organization committed to \npromoting sustainable business growth and advancing the economic well-\nbeing of Colorado. I am privileged to work closely with Colorado \nConcern, especially in these tough economic times, when we are all \nsearching for innovative ways to get our Nation back on sounder \neconomic footing.\n  Larry also is a founding member of the Denver Rustlers, a group that \nhas given him the opportunity to work with other Colorado business \nleaders to support community youth. As with Colorado Concern, I have \nbeen fortunate to participate in events with the Denver Rustlers. From \nraising scholarship money, to supporting participants at the Junior \nLivestock Sale at the annual Colorado State Fair in Pueblo, to opening \nthe Denver Rustlers Kids Cafe in 1994 to combat childhood hunger, Larry \nhas been instrumental in the Denver Rustlers' positive effect on \nchildren's lives.\n  I also want to take a moment to underline another great love of \nLarry's--another pursuit that fills Coloradans with pride. Larry is the \nfounder of the Mizel Museum in Denver. The Mizel Museum provides \nregular artistic and educational programs that promote community \nunderstanding and tolerance for residents of the Rocky Mountain region. \nIt is a stunning facility that makes a big difference in our state.\n  As part of the Mizel Museum and its related Mizel Institute, in 2004 \nLarry founded another crown jewel: the Counterterrorism Education \nLearning Lab, better known as the CELL. The CELL is a nonprofit \ninstitution dedicated to the prevention of terrorism through education. \nLocated in Denver, the\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\nCELL's exhibit was developed in consultation with world-renowned \nthought leaders and award-winning artists.\n  As Larry points out, it is the only exhibit of its kind in the world \nand has evolved into a greater institute for terrorism prevention and \npreparedness training. Through its acclaimed exhibits, distinguished \nspeakers series, and training programs, the CELL has impacted thousands \nof individuals and has helped to enhance our public safety. Many \nMembers of this Chamber have visited the CELL and have witnessed \nfirsthand the power of its dynamic programs and interactive exhibits.\n  In early 2012, I was proud to colead, with Larry and the CELL, a \npublic event that examined our Nation's foreign policy challenges 10 \nyears after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It is a testament to Larry that \nthe event was able to attract a broad range of top national security \nexperts, Members of Congress, policymakers, the media, and members of \nthe public.\n  Over the years, many acclaimed organizations have recognized Larry's \nwork and his philanthropy. I want to name some of the honors that he \nhas received.\n  In 1987, Larry received the National Humanitarian Award from National \nJewish Health, a global leader in the research and treatment of \nrespiratory, immune and related diseases.\n  In 1996, Larry was named honorary dean of the University of Denver's \nBurns School of Real Estate and Construction Management.\n  In 2001, he was one of the recipients of the distinguished Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor, which gives tribute to the immigrant experience \nand individual achievement.\n  In 2002, Larry was awarded the title Honorary Irishman by the Ancient \nOrder of Hiberians, a Catholic-Irish-American Fraternal Organization \nfounded in 1836, for his work supporting the Heroes of 9/11.\n  In 2005, Larry received the Defenders of Freedom Award from the \nNational Homeland Defense Foundation, an organization that is dedicated \nto securing freedom in the fields of homeland defense and security.\n  In 2010, he was awarded the Ben S. Wendelken Special Trustees' Award \nby Colorado's El Pomar Foundation, for embodying the spirit of service \nand giving through his life's work.\n  And in 2011, Larry received the Steve Ross Lifetime Achievement Award \nfrom the Milken Institute and was named a Colorado State Patrol \nHonorary Colonel.\n  I could go on and on, but I think these examples help illustrate the \nscope of Larry's work and his life passions and the way that he is \nvalued in our community.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also recognize the people closest to \nLarry--his family. He cares deeply for them. Larry and his wife Carol \nhave two grown children and five grandchildren.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6265, September 12, 2012, the Record reads: . . . \npeople closest to Larry his family.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . people \nclosest to Larry--his family.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. President, I want to close with this observation. There are very \nfew leaders who have brought our community together since September 11, \n2001, like Larry has. Larry has rallied Coloradans together literally \nto remember the heroes and victims of 9/11 and to rise up against the \nevils of terrorism. It is what he does best: He assembles diverse \ngroups of people, finds their commonality, and marshals them toward a \nnoble purpose. Larry cares greatly about the security of the United \nStates, as well as our allies worldwide. And he will stop at nothing to \ntry to create a world where people do not live under the constant \nthreat of attack, whether by persecutors, terrorists, or other enemies.\n  Today Colorado thanks a great American--Larry A. Mizel--for a \nlifetime of good work--and many more years to come. Happy 70th \nbirthday, Larry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6265-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING FRANK WILLETO\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in the annals of our \nNation's military history, the Navajo Code Talkers will always be \nremembered. They were a small group of marines, but their impact was \nfar beyond their numbers. Their skills were crucial to American victory \nin the Pacific during World War II. They turned their Native language \ninto an unbreakable code, and wielded that power as a great force in \nsecuring Allied victory.\n  Today, we mourn the loss of one of those heroic men. On June 23, Mr. \nFrank Chee Willeto died at his home in Pueblo Pintado, NM. Mr. Willeto \nwas 87 years old. His life was a remarkable story of valor, of \ndedication, and of service.\n  Mr. Willeto was born and raised in Crownpoint, NM. In January 1944 he \nenlisted with the U.S. Marines, 6th Division. He trained for 8 weeks as \na Navajo Code Talker. He served in the Pacific Theater in the Saipan \nand Okinawa campaigns.\n  Frank Willeto and his fellow Navajo Code Talkers joined a fight for \nfreedom in a world that did not always accord freedom to them. They \nknew firsthand the ugly face of discrimination, of intolerance. U.S. \nlaw had recognized Native Americans as citizens for only 17 years when \nour country entered World War II.\n  And yet, many Native Americans bravely served during World War II, \nserved at a higher percentage rate than the general population. And \namong them were Frank Willeto and the legendary Navajo Code Talkers.\n  Mr. Willeto was awarded the Congressional Silver Medal. Our Nation is \nforever in debt to him and his fellow Navajo Code Talkers. But that is \nonly part of his story. When he came home from war, he devoted his life \nto his community. He worked for many years with the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and then with the Department of Education.\n  In 1974, he was elected as a Navajo tribal councilman. He was later \nelected president of Pueblo Pintado Chapter. He also served as a judge \non the Navajo Supreme Judicial Council and as vice president of the \nNavajo Nation.\n  Last November, Mr. Willeto testified before the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs. He shared his experiences in the military, and he \nreminded us all how important it is that our veterans receive the \nbenefits they were promised. He was a tireless advocate for housing and \nhealth benefits for veterans. Frank Willeto lived a long and productive \nlife, and to the end he was steadfast in his efforts to help others.\n  His was a life of service, of defending others in time of war, and \nserving others in times of peace. A life that is inspiring to all who \nknew him, and who mourn him now. We remember Frank Willeto, and we \nhonor his legacy when we hold true to the ideals that he lived: honor, \ncourage, commitment. I extend my sincere sympathies to Mr. Willeto's \nfamily, to his many friends, and to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6265-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6265-S6266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING RICK BARTOW\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today a part of the Pacific \nNorthwest is coming to Washington, DC. Thanks to the immensely creative \nand dedicated work of artist Rick Bartow and his team, two wooden pole \nsculptures will be placed in the garden of the Smithsonian National \nMuseum of the American Indian. Atop one pole sits a bear and the other \npole a raven, representing the healer and the rascal, respectively. The \nBear pole is 27 feet tall, and the Raven pole, 23 feet tall. The \npoles--collectively titled ``We Were Always Here''--will face the \nWashington Monument and overlook the National Mall.\n  The artist behind this project, Rick Bartow, is a Native American of \nWiyot and Yurok heritage who was born in Newport, OR. His previous work \nhas been shown throughout the world, including his Cedar Mill Pole, \nwhich was displayed at the White House in 1997. When you hear Mr. \nBartow discuss his art, his process, and the world around him, you \nrealize that you are listening to one of the country's foremost \nartistic minds.\n  That talent is clearly showcased in ``We Were Always Here.'' The \nlevel of detail, history, and meaning in each pole is truly amazing. \nThe poles are based on Native beliefs, but the message and meaning \nbehind them are universal. For example, Mr. Bartow explains that the \nrepeated horizontal patterns on each pole, ``symbolize successive \nwaves, generations following generations, an accumulation of wisdom and \nknowledge.'' This idea that we can learn from our ancestors and from \nhistory is critical to the progress of our Nation and is one that is \nbeautifully captured through these sculpture poles.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. Bartow and his team, folks \nvisiting the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian or \nwalking the National Mall will now be able to look\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\nupon these sculptures and gain an understanding of the important role \nthe Native American community has in Oregon and throughout our country.\n  It is important to note that it is not only Oregon that is \nrepresented in these poles, but rather the Pacific Northwest. The two \ntrees from which they are carved--a 1200 and 500 year old cedar--are \nfrom our northern neighbors, Washington State, and artists from around \nthe area contributed in the creation of these sculptures. This sense of \ncommunity is a staple of the Pacific Northwest and one that is \nrepresented in ``We Were Always Here''.\n  I want to commend Mr. Bartow and his team for their great work, and I \nencourage everyone to get out and experience ``We Were Always Here'' by \nvisiting the American Indian Museum or The National Mall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6266-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 538.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of church pension plans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nstatement be included in the  Record upon introduction of my \nlegislation, the Church Plan Clarification Act of 2012, with Senator \nCardin.\n  Today, my colleague Senator Cardin and I are reintroducing this \nlegislation, which refines the language included in our previous bill, \nS. 143.\n  Our goal is to resolve an unfortunate application of our current \npension rules on church pension beneficiaries, and protect the \nretirement security of ministers and church lay workers.\n  Church pensions are critically important compensation plans that help \nsupport over one million clergy members across the country in their \nretirement--particularly those who dedicated their careers to serving \nin economically disadvantaged congregations.\n  Some of these plans date back to the 18th Century, and they are \ndesigned to ensure that our pastors and lay staff, who are often paid \nlower salaries, have adequate resources during their retirement years.\n  Today, denominational church plans provide benefits to an estimated \none million-plus ministers, church workers, and their dependents, most \nof them working for small churches throughout the nation.\n  Church plans developed structures and mechanisms that reflect the \ndiffering church polities they serve and their unique status has been \nrecognized in law.\n  However, recent IRS regulations governing 403(b) pension programs and \nlegislative changes have resulted in uncertainty and compliance issues \nfor church pension plans. In response, Senator Cardin and I sent a \nletter to the Internal Revenue Service informing them of our \nlegislation, nothing that the unintended consequences of their \nregulations may negatively affect church ministers and church lay \nworkers.\n  I hope we can work to provide clarity for these distinctive plans and \nresolve this issue before the end of the year.\n  This unequal treatment is simply unfair, and it is time we correct \nit.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Cardin and me today in \nestablishing parity for the beneficiaries of church pensions by \nsupporting this necessary, long overdue fix to the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 6336.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6336) to direct the Joint Committee on the \n     Library to accept a statue depicting Frederick Douglass from \n     the District of Columbia and to provide for the permanent \n     display of the statue in Emancipation Hall of the United \n     States Capitol.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the statues and busts in the U.S. Capitol \ndepicting distinguished Americans number more than 120. However, among \nthe collection are only two African Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. and Sojourner Truth. This disparity fails to acknowledge the \nhistorically significant contributions of African Americans to our \nNation. I am pleased that passage of H.R. 6336 today begins to address \nthis need to display in the U.S. Capitol the statues and busts of \noutstanding African Americans whose contributions to the country \ndeserve such recognition.\n  In my fiscal year 2013 Senate Financial Services and General \nGovernment appropriations bill reported by the committee on June 14, I \nincluded a provision to permit the District of Columbia to donate and \nthe Joint Committee on the Library to accept a statue of Frederick \nDouglass for placement in the United States Capitol. All costs of the \ntransportation and placement of the statue would be borne by the \nDistrict of Columbia. Subsequently, I joined Senator Schumer in \nintroducing a free-standing resolution for acquisition of the Douglass \nstatue. The House acted on its own measure and unanimously approved it \nearlier this week.\n  Frederick Douglass was one of the most influential orators and \nwriters of\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nthe 19th century, an advocate for abolitionism, women's suffrage, and \nthe equality of all people. He worked tirelessly on behalf of \nemancipation. As a pivotal figure in Underground Railroad activities, \nhe was an inspiration to enslaved Americans who aspired to freedom and \nequal rights.\n  As one of our Nation's most powerful voices for justice and the \nequality of all people, Frederick Douglass' writings and teachings \nstill speak to Americans today. Moving a statue of Frederick Douglass \nto the Emancipation Hall not only will recognize the accomplishments of \none of the most important political activists in American history, it \nalso will help correct the imbalance of influential African Americans \nhonored in the halls of our Nation's Capitol.\n  It is particularly fitting that this long overdue legislation will be \nenacted near the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of President \nAbraham Lincoln's signing of the preliminary proclamation on September \n22, 1862, that paved the way for the Emancipation Proclamation to be \nsigned on January 1, 1863.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to praise my Senate and \nHouse colleagues for passing H.R. 6336, a bill that will allow a statue \nof American hero and Rochester resident, Frederick Douglass, to reside \npermanently in the U.S. Capitol. I am proud that after a 5-year delay, \nCongress is acting to ensure that millions of visitors who come to \nWashington every year will see Frederick Douglass among the pantheon of \nstatues of great Americans in our Capitol.\n  I want to thank my good friend and colleague Senator Dick Durbin for \nworking with me and co-sponsoring the Senate bill that would ultimately \nlead to the passage of H.R. 6336. I also want to thank Representatives \nLungren and Brady for their bipartisan support in the House that helped \nbring this bill to the Senate for final passage. Lastly, I want to \nespecially thank Delegate Norton for her tireless efforts towards \nbringing the statue of this great American to our Capitol.\n  Bringing Frederick Douglass to the U.S. Capitol is an important step \ntoward ensuring that Americans depicted in the art of the Capitol \nreflect the true heritage of our Nation and the people who have helped \nto make it great. Currently there are only two African Americans \ndepicted in the U.S. Capitol: Sojourner Truth in Emancipation Hall and \nthe Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Rotunda. There is little doubt \nthat more needs to be done to make sure that a greater diversity of \noutstanding Americans is represented in the U.S. Capitol. There is no \ndoubt that a statue of Frederick Douglass, a man of towering influence \nnot only during his lifetime in the 19th century but also, through his \nwritings and actions, to the present day, has earned a place in our \nCapitol.\n  He was born into slavery in Maryland, and at the age of 20 escaped to \nfreedom. After living in Massachusetts, he moved to Rochester, NY, \nwhere he spent 25 highly productive and influential years and gained \nprominence as a leading national voice for the causes of human freedom \nand equality.\n  During his time in Rochester, he published and edited The North Star, \nthe most prominent African American newspaper in the country. Douglass \nwas also a leader in the Underground Railroad in Rochester and Western \nNew York. His influential best-selling autobiography, Narrative of the \nLife of Frederick Douglass, served as a rallying cry for the \nabolitionist movement and helped bring an end to that cruel \ninstitution.\n  During the Seneca Falls Convention, a historic gathering near Geneva, \nNY, to promote women's rights in 1848, Douglass participated as the \nonly African American and one of only 37 men out of 300 attendees. \nDouglass' presence at the convention in Seneca Falls visibly displayed \nhis belief that the women's rights movement and that of emancipation \nwent hand-in-hand. Douglass' beliefs on equality helped shape our great \ncountry and inspired generations of men and women elected to serve here \nin the halls of Congress. The passage of H.R. 6336 rightfully \nguarantees that Douglass' legacy will forever be recognized in the \nCapitol of a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements relating to the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6336) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6285-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6285-S6286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING THE FOUR AMERICAN PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO DIED IN BENGHAZI, \nLIBYA, INCLUDING AMBASSADOR J. CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, AND CONDEMNING THE \n       VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE UNITED STATES CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 551.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 551) commending the 4 American public \n     servants who died in Benghazi, Libya, including Ambassador J. \n     Christopher Stevens, for their tireless efforts on behalf of \n     the American people, and condemning the violent attack on the \n     United States consulate in Benghazi.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and his \nteam are heartbreaking. It is easy for a lot of people to forget that \nour diplomats are on the frontlines of the world's most dangerous \nplaces and they are there trying to make the world a safer and better \nplace at great risk to themselves and their families.\n  Chris Stevens was all that and more. He was a foreign service \nprofessional down to his toes, a guy who had served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and embraced tough odds and tough assignments \noverseas. He had the guts and grit to serve as our envoy during the \nrebellion, and his presence there reminded Libyans that America stood \nwith them for freedom in the face of violence. He was continuing that \nnoble work as Ambassador with enormous skill.\n  He was an important part of the work we are doing in Libya, and we \nwill not let this deplorable violence turn back the progress he helped \nmake possible. Let's remember that Libyans fought to protect the \nconsulate and rescue the Americans inside, and that Libyans took Chris \nto a hospital in a desperate and potentially dangerous attempt to save \nhis life. Indeed, the best way to honor his memory and that of the four \nAmerican public servants who perished in Benghazi is to continue their \nwork. The United States must continue to support the aspirations of the \npeople of Libya for political reform based on democratic and human \nrights and the development of an inclusive government that ensures \nfreedom, opportunity, and justice for the people of Libya. This is what \nChris Stevens would have wanted.\n  The violence in Cairo and Benghazi is unacceptable and unjustifiable. \nThe stupidity of one filmmaker, no matter how offensive, is not now, \nand never, a rationale for violence. A despicable act like this hurts \nus all--Americans and peaceful people who aspire to build their own \ndemocracy. I commend President Obama for committing to bring the \nperpetrators of this attack to justice, and I am confident that this is \nprecisely what the United States Government will do.\n  This is one of those moments when Americans must unite as Americans. \nIt is exactly the wrong time to throw political punches. It is a time \nto restore calm and proceed wisely.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho was killed in service to his country, a man who hails from my State \nof California, Ambassador John Christopher Stevens.\n  I was shocked and saddened to learn of the deaths of Ambassador \nStevens and the other three Americans who were killed during the \nhorrible attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. My deepest \ncondolences go out to their families. They remain in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n  He was struck down in the consulate by an act of mob violence which \nshould never have taken place. There is simply no justification for \nthis type of action and I condemn it in the strongest terms.\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n  I would like to begin by telling you a little bit about this \ndedicated public servant, someone with a unique and distinguished \nbiography.\n  Born and raised in Piedmont CA, Ambassador Stevens graduated from \nPiedmont High School before receiving his undergraduate degree from the \nUniversity of California at Berkley in 1982 and a J.D. from the \nUniversity of California's Hastings College of Law in 1989.\n  Before he joined the Foreign Service in 1991, he was an international \ntrade lawyer in Washington, DC, and from 1983 to 1985 he was a Peace \nCorps volunteer in Morocco.\n  His overseas postings were consequential and showed he was an \neffective Foreign Service officer. He served as the deputy principal \nofficer and political section chief in Jerusalem, a political officer \nin Damascus, a consular/political officer in Cairo, and a consular/\neconomic officer in Riyadh.\n  In addition to his service abroad, Ambassador Stevens was the \ndirector of the Office of Multilateral Nuclear and Security Affairs, a \nPearson Fellow with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, special \nassistant to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Iran desk \nofficer, and staff assistant in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.\n  He also served twice in Libya before becoming Ambassador: as deputy \nchief of mission at our Embassy in Tripoli from 2007 to 2009 and \nspecial representative to the Libyan Transitional Council from March \n2011 to November 2011.\n  In May 2012, he became the first U.S. Ambassador to Libya following \nthe fall of Qadhafi.\n  As you can see, he had a long and distinguished career as one of our \ntop diplomats, someone who learned the language and culture of a region \nof the world critical to U.S. national security interests.\n  Clearly, this was someone who was committed to helping the Libyan \npeople achieve their goal of a free and democratic country after \ndecades of brutal dictatorship.\n  As Ambassador, he immediately went to work to help Libya build a new \nfuture, engaging government officials, academics, businessmen, and \ncivil society leaders on a daily basis.\n  Sadly, his term as Ambassador and his service to his country ended \nfar too soon.\n  This attack and the assault on our Embassy in Cairo serve as sobering \nreminders that we must continue to pay attention to the events in the \ncountries involved in the Arab Spring.\n  While in some countries like Egypt and Libya autocrats have fallen \nand the people have elected new leadership, tensions remain high and \nuncertainty about the future abounds.\n  There is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that these \ncountries fully embrace democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n  It is critical that those responsible for these acts are brought to \njustice. And I call on the Governments of Libya and Egypt to work \nclosely with the administration to ensure that this does not happen \nagain.\n  Ambassador Stevens was one of our best. He will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, that all \nSenators be added as cosponsors to the resolution, and all statements \nrelated to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 551\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2012, 4 American public servants, \n     including United States Ambassador to Libya, John Christopher \n     Stevens, and Sean Smith, were killed in a reprehensible and \n     vicious attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi, \n     Libya;\n       Whereas Ambassador Stevens--\n       (1) was a courageous and exemplary representative of the \n     United States;\n       (2) had spent 21 years in the Foreign Service;\n       (3) was deeply passionate about representing the United \n     States through his diplomatic service; and\n       (4) was an ardent friend of the Libyan people;\n\n       Whereas Ambassador Stevens served as Special Envoy to the \n     Libyan Transitional National Council in Benghazi during the \n     2011 Libyan revolution;\n       Whereas Ambassador Stevens was a dear friend of the Senate, \n     having served on the staff of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate in 2006 and 2007 as a distinguished \n     Pearson Fellow;\n       Whereas Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean \n     Smith--\n       (1) was a husband and a father of 2 children;\n       (2) joined the Department of State 10 years ago; and\n       (3) had served in the Foreign Service, before arriving in \n     Benghazi, in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal, and The Hague;\n\n       Whereas the 2 other individuals from Ambassador Stevens' \n     team who perished in the attack made great sacrifices and \n     showed bravery in taking on a difficult post in Libya;\n       Whereas the violence in Benghazi coincided with an attack \n     on the United States Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, which was also \n     swarmed by an angry mob of protesters on September 11, 2012;\n       Whereas on a daily basis, United States diplomats, military \n     personnel, and other public servants risk their lives to \n     serve the American people; and\n       Whereas throughout this Nation's history, thousands of \n     Americans have sacrificed their lives for the ideals of \n     freedom, democracy, and partnership with nations and people \n     around the globe.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the dedicated service and deep commitment of \n     the 4 American public servants, including Ambassador John \n     Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, in assisting the Libyan \n     people as they navigate the complex currents of democratic \n     transition marked in this case by profound instability;\n       (2) praises Ambassador Stevens, who represented the highest \n     tradition of American public service, for his extraordinary \n     record of dedication to the United States' interests in some \n     of the most difficult and dangerous posts around the globe;\n       (3) sends its deepest condolences to the families of those \n     American public servants killed in Benghazi;\n       (4) commends the bravery of Foreign Service Officers, \n     United States Armed Forces, and public servants serving in \n     harm's way around the globe and recognizes the deep \n     sacrifices made by their families; and\n       (5) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the \n     despicable attacks on American diplomats and public servants \n     in Benghazi and calls for the perpetrators of such attacks to \n     be brought to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/12/senate-section/article/S6286-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6286-S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PRINCIPALS MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.
