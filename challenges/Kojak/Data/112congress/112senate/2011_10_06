Mr. President, I have the rare opportunity today to \nintroduce and say a few words about the guest Chaplain. Reverend Chaney \nhas just delivered, as usual, an eloquent invocation.\n  Reverend Chaney is originally from South Carolina, but for the last 2 \nyears he has led the flock of the Second Baptist Church in Las Vegas, \none of the oldest, extremely well-established, and largest churches in \nLas Vegas, NV. He is a man who is involved in the community very \ndeeply. He serves on the board of the Urban League and the NAACP.\n  In addition to his service in the spiritual realm, he has also served \nas a patriot in our Nation's armed services. He served in the Navy for \n4 years, as has our Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black. They were both naval \nofficers. Reverend Chaney recently retired as chaplain of the U.S. Air \nForce Reserve at Nellis Air Force Base.\n  I have met with Reverend Chaney under very unique circumstances on a \nnumber of occasions. He is a wonderful human being. He is one of those \nrare people who have such a pleasant demeanor. The minute a person \nmeets him, they know he is a man of great substance and spiritual \nquality. So I am very happy to welcome Reverend Chaney and his wife \nAvis to Washington.\n  I thank the pastor for the inspiring invocation, which I hope will \nguide the Senate's action today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6277-7", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will hold a vote to \nadvance legislation to end the underhanded practice of currency \nmanipulation by the Chinese Government. This practice gives Chinese \nexports a tremendously unfair advantage over all the global markets but \nespecially the one with our relations with China. It hurts American \nmanufacturers and cheats American workers out of jobs. This practice \nhas helped balloon America's trade deficit with China from $10 billion \nto $273 billion in the last 20 years, costing upwards of 3 million \njobs. Too many of those lost jobs came from the manufacturing sector \nalone, which can't compete as long as the Chinese Government gives its \nexports special advantages.\n  This legislation is a chance to even a tilted playing field, to pump \n$300 billion into our economy in 2 years, and support 1.6 million \nAmerican jobs. That is why it has the support of labor unions and \nbusiness groups. That is why it advanced with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote on Monday. I believe there were 31 Republican votes on \nMonday.\n  I would remind my Republican colleagues that since the Senate began \ndebate of this bill, China has made no move to correct the value of its \ncurrency. It is clear that merely considering congressional action will \nnot solve this problem, so it is difficult for me to comprehend how \npeople could be switching their votes from Monday to Thursday. We have \noffered to work with Republicans on an agreement to consider several \ngermane amendments. I stand by that offer. We talked about that \nyesterday and, in fact, late last night. I repeat, more than 31 \nRepublicans voted to advance this legislation earlier this week. So I \nam hopeful my colleagues on the other side will continue to work with \nus in a bipartisan fashion to advance this important job-creating \nlegislation today.\n\n  I have indicated to the Republican leader that I have a meeting with \nthree of my Senators at the White House at 5:30 this afternoon, so we \neither finish this bill if, in fact, cloture is invoked and we work out \nsomething on the amendments before 5:30 or we can come back tonight \nafter the meeting at the White House or we can come back tomorrow, but \nwe are going to complete work on this legislation before we leave, one \nway or the other. If cloture is not invoked, of course, that ends it, \nwhich I think would be a sad day for relations between China and the \nUnited States, to think we capitulated on something as important as \nthis. But we are going to finish this legislation today. I would like \nto do it before 5:30. We have the Jewish holiday that starts tomorrow \nat 5:30--it is actually an hour or so after that, so 20 until 7, \nsundown. But, anyway, we are going to continue working on this \nlegislation until we complete it one way or the other.\n\n\n                           American Jobs Act\n\n  Early next week, the Senate will begin debate on the American Jobs \nAct, which will create jobs while asking every American to contribute \nhis or her fair share. This legislation will put construction crews \nback to work building the things that make our country stronger: modern \nbridges, roads, dams, sewers, water systems, and up-to-date schools \nwhere our children can get the best education possible.\n\n\n                               Free Trade\n\n  I have spent a lot of time with the Republican leader, knowing how \nstrongly he and some other Members of the Senate feel about the \nColombia trade bill, the Korea trade agreement, and Panama. In spite of \nmy not feeling so strongly about these--I am not a big fan of these \nmatters--I am doing my best to advance this so we can have a vote, \nhopefully as early as Wednesday of next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6278-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, what this week has shown beyond any \ndoubt is that Democrats would rather talk about partisan legislation \nthey won't pass than actually passing legislation we know would create \njobs.\n  Two and a half years after the President signed his first stimulus, \nthere are 1.7 million fewer jobs in this country. Now he wants to do it \nagain. Why? Because Democrats think it makes for good politics.\n  This week, it was revealed that there wasn't enough support within \nthe Democratic ranks to pass the President's so-called jobs bill--it \nwas simply too partisan. So yesterday, instead of making it less \npartisan, they made it more so. By adding a tax on small business \nowners, they made it even less attractive to job creators rather than \nworking with Republicans on legislation that would actually help create \njobs.\n  I mean, what is our goal here? If the goal is to create jobs, then \nwhy are we even talking about tax hikes? The President himself has said \nthat raising taxes is the last thing we want to do in a weak economy. \nThat is the President of the United States. Even the White House \npredicts the unemployment rate will be high when this tax would kick \nin. So the real goal here for Democrats, as far as I can tell, is \nentirely political. By arguing for a permanent tax hike to pay for a \ntemporary stimulus, they are essentially admitting they are not \nparticularly interested in creating jobs. Proposing a partisan tax hike \n13 months before an election will not create one single job--not one. \nSo I would suggest that our friends on the other side put away the \nplaybook and work with us instead.\n\n  As I have said repeatedly, Republicans are ready to act right away \nwith Democrats on bipartisan, job-creating legislation--on the three \ntrade bills, for instance, on regulatory reform, increasing American \nenergy production, and tax reform. All those things would help the \neconomy, and all could be strongly--strongly--bipartisan. Yet \nDemocratic leaders do not seem to be interested in working together.\n  Two days ago, for example, I offered the President his request to \nvote on his second stimulus. Our Democratic friends blocked the vote. \nInstead of working across the aisle with Republicans on solutions that \nwould help put people back to work, Democrats have fallen back to tired \ntalking points--the same, stale rhetoric we have heard literally for \nyears. With 14 million Americans out of work, this is completely and \ntotally unacceptable.\n  We are wasting valuable time. Despite the President assuring \nAmericans that nobody is talking about raising taxes right now and that \na down economy is a horrible time to raise taxes--again, this is what \nthe President said--the new Democratic tax hike would take effect in a \nlittle over a year, when CBO tells us the unemployment rate will still \nbe well over 8 percent.\n  It is no wonder the economy is stagnant, businesses are not hiring, \nand unemployment is at 9 percent. How can anyone be expected to make \nplans when the next ``gotcha'' tax hike to pay for this President's \nspending binge is always lurking right around the corner?\n  The President has said it is wrong to raise taxes in this weak \neconomic environment. If he meant what he said, surely he will join me \nin opposing this unwise tax hike Senate Democrats have proposed.\n  Republicans, along with some Democrats, have progrowth solutions to \nhelp solve this crisis, but we will not stand for a permanent tax hike \nfor a temporary stimulus that is largely a rehash of the same stimulus \nideas this administration has already tried.\n  This bill is the same wasteful spending, the same burdensome union \ngiveaways, and the same temporary tax policy that has failed the \nAmerican people in the last 2 years.\n  This economy can grow and create jobs when Washington reduces \nspending and regulations, and by simplifying our incredibly complex tax \nsystem. This is what is needed to literally unleash the private sector.\n  It is time Democrats move beyond the political rhetoric and for the \nPresident to stop campaigning. It is time for\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\nDemocrats to reach across the aisle on bipartisan legislation that can \nactually pass.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6279-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is 1 hour of time equally divided?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Until 10:30.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So time is equally divided up to that point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I would like to make a comment on the Republican leader's \ncomments on the tax bill. Just make note, American people, the leader \nsays: Do not raise taxes. But he does not mention what our proposal \nactually does. It imposes a 5.6-percent surcharge only on those whose \nincomes are above $1 million. In other words, 99 percent-plus of the \nAmerican people will not have their taxes raised, nor should they.\n  Average middle-class people are struggling. Their incomes are \ndeclining. We should not be doing that. But for those who are the very \nwealthiest--and this is no aspersion to them. I think most of us on \nboth sides of the aisle admire people who have made a lot of money. \nMost Americans would like to be in their shoes, and most of them have \ndone it the hard way: by coming up with a good idea, struggling and \nworking a business. That is great. But they are the one segment in \nsociety whose income has actually increased significantly over the last \ndecade.\n  The one consensus we have in this place is that we have to reduce the \ndeficit and reduce the budget. The one consensus we have is that we \nhave to do that. Well, you are asking middle-class people to chip in by \nmaking it harder to pay for college because student loans are not as \ngood or cutting back on somebody who has been unemployed. They worked \ntheir whole life, lost their job, and now are unemployed.\n  So how do we have the top 1 percent--the one part of society doing \nthe best--chip in? Well, the only way is through the Tax Code because \nthey do not need help getting their kids to college. They do not need \nhealth care help. God bless them. They have enough money to do that on \ntheir own. So this is the only way to do it. If you say no taxes on \nanybody, even the millionaires--which is what, I assume, the Republican \nleader is saying--you are saying the best off in society, who have done \nthe best in the last decade, should not contribute to this deficit \nreduction we have to do.\n  I believe--and I will say this again and again--the only way we are \ngoing to get real deficit reduction is by raising revenues as well as \ncutting spending. The only real way we are going to break through on \nraising revenues is making sure those at the highest income contribute \nand contribute more than others when it comes to the tax system.\n  I would like to go to the bill at hand, which is S. 1619, the \ncurrency act. I know my colleagues have heard me on this all week. It \nis passionate for me. It is passionate not as a Democrat or not against \nRepublicans. In fact, we have religiously tried throughout--Senator \nLindsey Graham and I, throughout the history of this bill, which is a \nlong one, and the bills before it, their predecessors--we have tried to \nkeep this religiously bipartisan.\n  In fact, we have five lead Democratic sponsors and five lead \nRepublican sponsors. Lindsey and I have opposed Presidents on this \nissue--whether it was the Republican President Bush or the Democrat \nPresident Obama--with equal vigor because we think administrations get \ntoo caught up in that highfalutin diplomatic world to understand what \nAmerican companies, particularly middle-sized companies, go through \nwhen China does not play fair.\n\n  I am on the Senate floor on this bill many times, more often than I \nusually speak, because I believe passionately this is about the future \nof America. If we continue to lose wealth and jobs to China because \nthey manipulate trade laws and intellectual property laws and all kinds \nof other economic laws for their own advantage, unfairly--against the \nWTO rules, against the rules of free trade--we may never recover as a \ncountry.\n  This is serious. This is not to gain political advantage, although \nmost Americans agree with it, of course. But I would do this if most \nAmericans did not, and if editorialists did not, business leaders of \nmultinational corporations did not. I do this because when we have \nsmall companies that are growing that have great products, and China \nunfairly competes with them--not because China's products are better \nbut because China's trade allows it to undercut them in our market and \nin the Chinese market--we are giving away our seed corn.\n  Take solar cells. China usually uses a one-two punch to hurt us \nunfairly. First, they will use some trade law to get that business in \ntheir country, whether it is rare earths, and they will say: You want \nthese rare earths? You have to manufacture in China. Whether it is \nintellectual property, they just take it regardless of patent laws and \nother laws. Or in the case of solar cells, whether it is unfair direct \nsubsidies to companies, they say: You make the solar cells here--the \nChinese companies--you will get deep subsidies.\n  But that alone would not be enough to put our American companies on \ntheir butts. What happens is, after they unfairly take the business and \nmove them there, they send them here at a 30-percent discount using \ncurrency manipulation. Our American companies--and I have spoken to \ncompany after company in manufacturing businesses, in service \nbusinesses, and things in between--say: I can't compete. My product is \nusually better, but not against a 30-percent currency disadvantage. So \nthe price of the Chinese good is 30 percent cheaper.\n  There is a window manufacturer I just visited, I think it was last \nFriday. He makes high-end windows for these buildings in New York and \nelsewhere. The window he makes is better than the Chinese window. This \nwas not a theft of intellectual property. He would not use the Chinese \nwindows because he is a contractor as well. He makes the windows, and \nthen he installs them.\n  He said: I wouldn't use the Chinese product, but because it has a 30-\npercent advantage in currency, it undercuts me in price and lots of \nother people use it.\n  Now, who would have thought that we are talking about windows? The \nChinese are competing against us everywhere. High end, middle end, and \nlow end. On the low end, frankly, we will never get the businesses \nback. Toys or clothing or shoes, maybe even furniture--except high-end \nfurniture--is not coming back.\n  The argument that some of these editorialists use, well, they are \ngoing to go to Bangladesh or somewhere else if China has to raise its \ncurrency is true, but that is not what we are fighting for\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nhere. We are fighting for high- and middle-end companies that have \ngreat products--solar panels, in which America has a future; jobs that \nif China played fairly we would win because we make a better product, \nand it does not have to be exported. Yet we somehow sit here and \ntwiddle our thumbs.\n  What I was saying about the window guy is, not only now does China \ncompete in manufacturing the windows, Chinese companies come here and \ninstall them. Again, it is still a 30-percent advantage because they \nare paying the Chinese company and workers the yuan, which is \nundervalued by 30 percent over there.\n  So this is serious. It is about the future of America, about the \nfuture of American jobs. We are all concerned about jobs. There are \nvery few jobs bills that are, A, bipartisan, and, B, do not cost money. \nThis is one of them. It has been a bipartisan bill all the way. The \nvotes showed it.\n  I see my colleague from Alabama who has been a great partner. I saw \nmy colleague from South Carolina who has been a great partner. How else \nin this deadlocked, gridlocked situation can we help American workers \nin a bipartisan way--that does not cost money--in a big way? This is \nit. There are not many others.\n  So I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Leader Reid \nsaid on the Senate floor a few minutes ago what he said last night, \nthat he would certainly entertain amendments and come to an agreement--\namendments from both sides of the aisle, relevant, germane amendments, \nrelevant to trade. I am sure if we could move on cloture, Senator \nHatch's amendment--he is the ranking member of the Finance Committee--\nwhich deals with trade would be debated. We would try to have time \nlimits. There would be a fair and open debate on an important issue, \nand then we could vote on the bill.\n  So I hope we will get a positive vote on cloture this morning, and I \nhope we will--not for political gain or anything like that but for \nAmerican gain. We cannot, cannot, cannot continue to let China flaunt \nthe rules.\n  Ten years ago or eight years ago, when Senator Graham and I started \non this issue, China was a much smaller economy. Now they are huge, the \nsecond largest in the world. They compete against us up and down the \nline. They have found six ways from Sunday to lure businesses there. \nThat deals with the Chinese market. But then, with trade currency, when \nthe businesses go there, with currency manipulation they are able to \nundercut us and send the goods here.\n  Again, to me--and I am just one person and, obviously, I feel this \nissue more passionately than 99 percent of Americans because I have \nbeen involved in it so long--if we could do five things to restore \nAmerican jobs and restore American wealth, this would be one of them. \nThis would be one of them.\n  I want to see our children and grandchildren know that they are going \nto have better lives than their parents and grandparents, and it is a \ndifficult and tough world to ensure that with global competition, with \nso many changes.\n  We were just talking in the gym about how our kids spend so much time \non video games all day long instead of learning in school.\n  There are so many challenges we face as a country. At this time we \ncannot shrug our shoulders and be benign like maybe 20 or 25 years ago \nwhen we were in a different situation, saying: China cheats; so what. \nLet's not risk any change. Let's not get them mad.\n  We cannot afford that anymore. The future of America is at stake. To \nthose who say it will cause a trade war, we are in a trade war. We have \nour clocks cleaned every day and lose jobs every day because of unfair \nChinese practices. To those who say China will retaliate, China has got \nfar more to lose in this than we do. They the are ones who benefit from \nall of these rules, we do not--all of these manipulations. They will \nnot retaliate. Yes, they may do a little thing here and there, but they \nwill not retaliate big time because it will do even more damage to the \nChinese economy.\n  What they will do--Senator Graham and I have seen this, and Senator \nSessions and Senator Brown--when they are faced with the hard reality \nthat they will no longer be allowed by legislation or, I wish, by \nadministration action, but that has not been forthcoming from either \nPresident Bush or President Obama, they then adjust and play fairer. \nThat is what has happened every single time, and that will happen \nagain.\n  I want to first compliment my colleagues on this legislation. I want \nto hope and pray--I pray in this one, me, for the future of America. \nAnd the future of America is linked to free and fair trade with China. \nThe future of America is linked to the fact that we can no longer let \nChina unfairly take advantage of American workers, American wealth, and \nthe American future.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I rise in support of moving forward on this legislation. \nI wish I could fix the Senate. It is not functioning the way any of us \nwishes--plenty of blame to go around. The Congress's approval rating is \nat 15 percent.\n  But here is some good news. There is a piece of legislation before us \nthat, if we can ever get a vote on the legislation, would have \noverwhelming bipartisan support that actually would matter to the \naverage, every-day person. When you look through your Congress, you \nhave got to say: What is it about those folks up there? Why can't they \ndo the things that all of us know need to be done?\n  There is a difference of opinion about how to deal with China. This \nis a complicated issue. But the one thing no one is telling me on the \nother side: Lindsey, they are not manipulating their currency. I think \nas the American Taxpayers Union--great organization; I am in pretty \ngood standing with them. I disagree with them on how to proceed against \nChina in this particular instance. I think they said in their own \nletter: We agree, China manipulates their currency.\n  Well, if they do manipulate their currency, what does it matter? It \nmatters a lot if you are an American business man or woman trying to \ncompete in the world marketplace. As Senator Schumer said, the Chinese \nmanipulate the value of their currency--6.3 yuan to the dollar; it used \nto be 8-point something. What does that mean? That means if a product \nproduced in China is sold in the world marketplace and you are in \nbusiness in South Carolina, Alabama, or New York, competing with that \nChinese company, the value of their money builds a discount of 30 to 40 \npercent. You are going to have a very hard time winning in the \nmarketplace, not because you do not work hard, not because your \nemployees are inferior, simply because the Chinese Government is doing \nthings with their currency we do not do.\n  We have a Federal Reserve. Some of their policies I do not agree \nwith. But to suggest that our Federal Reserve system manipulates our \ncurrency to create a trade advantage is ridiculous. If we are doing it \nfor that purpose, everybody should be fired, because we have a $273 \nbillion trade deficit.\n  Every country has a right to set monetary policy. That is not the \nissue. If you disagree with the way we are doing monetary policy in the \nUnited States, I think you have a valid claim. This is about a country \nmanipulating its currency for an advantage in the export market. The \nChinese manipulation of the yuan has cost this country at least 2 \nmillion jobs--41,000 in South Carolina--and it is an unfair trade \npractice in another name.\n  If this were an island nation somewhere, none of us would care. But \nthis is the second or third largest economy in the world, and all of us \nshould care. The people who are opposing this legislation today are \nprobably doing business in China and they are afraid to offend the \nChinese. I have some manufacturing in my State that has a big footprint \nin China. They are nervous about this bill. I have most people in my \nState dying for me to get them some relief so they can stay in \nbusiness.\n  But here is a warning: It will come--this movie will come to a \nneighborhood near you soon. In 2016, the Chinese are going to start \nproducing, in large numbers, commercial aircraft. It will be difficult \nfor American aircraft companies to compete with China if the aircraft \nis 30 percent discounted because of currency manipulation. One day they \nwill be producing cars, not to be\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\nsold in China but throughout the world. If you are in a high-tech \nindustry, what has happened to the textile industry and other elements \nof our country such as steel is coming toward you. All we ask of China \nis build cars, build airplanes, but sell their products based on trade \npractices that are accepted throughout the world. Do not manipulate \nyour currency to create a discount on products made in your country at \nour expense.\n  Since 2004, I have been dealing with this. We started with a sense of \nthe Senate because everybody said this is delicate. I buy into that to \na point. So sense of the Senate, we all agreed with 100 votes: You \nmanipulate your currency. Please stop.\n  In 2005, after they did not stop, we introduced legislation, got 67 \nvotes to proceed forward with a 27.5 tariff. We stopped our bill \nbecause we hoped things would change. Guess what. The yuan has \nappreciated about 31 percent since we have been doing this exercise, \nbut not nearly enough. There is a restriction on the yuan trading. It \ncannot float more than 0.5 percent a day. It is tied to the dollar. It \nis still crushing our manufacturing community unfairly.\n  So from 2004 to now, I have been reasonable. I have sent message \namendments, I have taken votes where I won overwhelmingly, and backed \noff. I have had it. Enough is enough. I am sorry the amendment process \naround this place is so screwed up. It is. There was an effort to get \nsome amendments up. Not as much as people on our side would like.\n  I hate the idea of filling up the tree and becoming the House. But \nthis is not about Senate procedure for me. I try to be a team player \nwhere I can be because I do believe Senator McConnell is doing a very \ngood job. Senator Reid has got his own agenda. It is not about Harry \nReid. It is not about Mitch McConnell. It is not about some rule of the \nSenate. It is about people in my State who are going to lose their job \nif we do not do something.\n  I know what I need to be doing as a Senator here. The institution I \nneed to be protecting is the American workforce which is having its \nclock cleaned by a Communist dictatorship that cheats. They do not \noutwork us. They do not outperform us. They steal our intellectual \nproperty. They manipulate their currency. They subsidize their \nindustries. A few years ago they dumped steel all over the world--in \nthe American marketplace, in particular--produced in China below cost, \nand the Bush administration pushed back with a countervailing duty \nclaim.\n  I want to do business with China. The Chinese people are good. Their \ngovernment is bad. They are mercantilists. They look at every \ntransaction with an eye of what is best for us in the short term. They \ndo not play by the rules. Since they have been in the WTO, their trade \ndeficit has almost quadrupled. So enough is enough for Lindsey Graham.\n  We are going to have a chance, after 7 years, of getting a vote that \nwill matter to the American people. I am sorry we are mad at each other \nall the time about everything. I am tired of being mad about the Senate \nnot working well. I am going to set aside my displeasure for the \nprocess and do something I think will help the people I represent. I am \ngoing to vote to move forward in an imperfect procedural environment, \nknowing that if we can ever get a vote, it will be the best thing that \ncould happen to the American manufacturing community. It will be a shot \nacross China's bow that is long overdue.\n\n  The last thing I would say is that Senator Sessions has come into \nthis issue, and he has brought an intellectual weight to it, emotional \ncommitment. He understands the middle class. Jeff Sessions has been the \nbest partner anyone could hope to have to try to push a bill forward \nthat will give America a fighting chance in a world economy dominated \nunfairly by a Communist dictatorship. I want to recognize what Senator \nSessions has done. He is going to vote to move forward. We have had it \nwith China. Let's do something that will matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I was very interested in the comments of \nthe distinguished Senator from New York and my friend from South \nCarolina as well.\n  This morning, the Senate will have the opportunity to send a strong \nmessage to China and the world community. Whether that signal is one of \ninward protectionism or outward engagement remains to be seen. In my \nmind, the choice is clear. If we support the motion to invoke cloture \non the underlying bill, we will be sending a signal to China that the \nSenate is angry over China's manipulation of its currency, but we are \nnot serious about taking real, long-term action to stop it.\n  We are also telling the world community that the United States is \nturning inward once again, seeking protectionist solutions to global \nproblems, and not interested in working with other countries to solve \nour current international economic crisis. At the same time, we would \nbe interjecting further uncertainty into our own economic recovery as \nour exporters and workers face potential retaliation from one of our \nleading trading partners.\n  There is a better way, and it can be bipartisan. We can defeat \ncloture and give Senators an opportunity to vote on my amendment, which \nnot only has the best chance of actually resolving our serious currency \nproblems with China but also demonstrates to the international \ncommunity that the United States will continue to lead by promoting \ntrade liberalization and holding countries accountable to the rules of \nthe game for the long haul.\n  If given the chance to vote on my amendment, we can demonstrate our \nserious commitment to developing long-term and meaningful solutions to \nthe persistent problem of currency manipulation. It tells them we are \ncommitted to starting that process today.\n  Yesterday, I outlined some of the serious problems with the \nunilateral approach adopted by the proponents of this bill. Allow me to \nsummarize them for the benefit of my colleagues. First, this is not a \njobs measure. Proponents of the unilateral approach argue that their \nbill will create thousands of jobs right now and millions of jobs in \nthe years ahead. But all we have to do is take a close look at the \nnumbers and the process laid out in the bill to see this is not the \ncase.\n  I am also concerned that the bill will inject economic instability in \na key bilateral relationship and subject U.S. exporters to potential \nretaliation by the Chinese.\n  Yesterday, the White House also expressed concerns about this bill, \nthough they still have not stated publicly what those specific concerns \nare. I wish they would. It would be helpful to us up here to have the \nWhite House weigh in and say what they actually want, instead of \nwaiting for the Senate to do whatever it wants to.\n  A growing chorus has come out to criticize the unilateral approach in \nthis bill--a growing chorus. The New York times called this bill ``a \nbad idea'' and ``too blunt of an instrument'' which, if enacted, is \nvery unlikely to persuade China to change its practices, while adding \nanother explosive new conflict to an already heavy list of bilateral \nfrictions.\n  The Wall Street Journal called the underlying bill ``the most \ndangerous trade legislation in many years.''\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a letter yesterday stating that \nthe unilateral approach in the underlying bill would be \ncounterproductive in persuading China to alter its currency practices \nand that ``in the end, such unilateral action would very likely cause \nretaliation by China and ultimately damage the U.S. economy, including \nexporters, investors, workers, and consumers.''\n  It does not get any tougher than that.\n  Again, there is a better way. My amendment calls for a bold new \napproach which will empower U.S. negotiators to work within the WTO and \nthe IMF to develop long-term effective remedies to counter the effect \nof currency manipulation by China or any other country and develop \npractices to persuade countries to stop currency manipulation. If that \ndoes not work within 90 days, they are directed to go outside of these \ninstitutions.\n  My amendment would also send a great message to both the WTO and the \nIMF.\n  My amendment would also establish a new priority negotiating \nobjective, so as we negotiate trade agreements with trading partners, \nwe should all commit in those agreements to not manipulate\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\nour currencies. My amendment also ensures that we have a partner by \nholding the administration accountable until they achieve results--and \nthat is whether it is this administration or some administration in the \nfuture.\n  This is not a quick fix. But truly resolving complex and longstanding \nproblems, such as currency manipulation, will take much more than a \nquick fix. It requires that we stand together as a country and do the \nhard work necessary with the international community to achieve real, \nlong-term results.\n  Although my amendment was only recently introduced, it is already \ngaining widespread support. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce endorsed the \nHatch amendment, arguing that coordinated and multilateral pressure, \nthrough international organizations, is essential to encouraging China \nto adopt market-determined currency and exchange rate policies. That is \nprecisely the approach taken in the Hatch amendment.\n\n       This morning, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, wrote in National Review Online \n     that the Hatch amendment ``is a more complex solution to the \n     [currency] problem,'' and while ``not nearly as sexy or \n     slogan-inspiring as the Currency Exchange Oversight Reform \n     Act . . . happens to have a much greater likelihood of being \n     effectual.''\n\n  Americans for Tax Reform wrote a letter in support of my amendment, \nsaying the Hatch amendment ``offers a sensible approach that utilizes \nthe mechanisms created by the international trade community to resolve \nsuch disputes.''\n  The Emergency Committee for American Trade says that the Hatch \namendment ``will more effectively address concerns about currency \nmisalignment by China and other countries, without opening the door to \nmany harmful effects on U.S. business and workers.'' These and other \norganizations, such as the Retail Industry Trade Association and the \nFinancial Services Roundtable, recognize there is a better way. Let's \nquit playing politics with this issue.\n  Today, we face a clear choice. By voting against cloture, we can \nstand against unilateralism, stand against protectionism, stand against \nretaliation, and stand against ``quick fix'' solutions and slogans. We \ncan then turn to vote on my amendment, one that offers the prospect of \nreal long-term and effective solutions, that shows the Chinese and the \nworld community we are serious about solving this problem over the long \nhaul, and that tells this and subsequent administrations they will be \nheld accountable. Even the administration basically agrees with this.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to make a difference. The Atlanta \nJournal Constitution wrote this today:\n\n       We have a trade problem with China. But Georgians will pay \n     dearly if Congress keeps taking the wrong approach to solving \n     it.\n\n  I could not agree more. But it is not just Georgians who will pay \ndearly but all Americans.\n  I urge colleagues to make the right choice today, to vote against \ncloture and support my amendment.\n  I am even willing to give my amendment to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York and others--have it be theirs. I don't care who gets the \ncredit. When we work on trade issues, I want them to work right. I \ndon't want to have politics played with this. This is too important.\n  I hope everybody votes against cloture, and I hope we can then take \nup the amendment I have been talking about--and we can refile it, so \nthose who feel so deeply about the Schumer amendment can be for \nsomething. I would like to do that and see this done. I would like to \nsee our country move ahead with an intelligent approach toward currency \nand trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the majority leader has agreed that if \ncloture is invoked, Senator Hatch's amendment will be one that will be \nvoted on. There was an agreement. Other amendments, too, would be \nallowed. I believe the minority has to protect its right to offer \namendments, consistent with other processes that we have had here that \nI am not happy with. The amendments offered by the majority, I believe, \nare legitimate.\n  I am a bit offended, and I don't appreciate the view that this is a \nprotectionist piece of legislation. I believe it protects free trade \nbecause trade can't exist when one party is manipulating the rules in a \nsignificant way that substantially impacts the balance of trade.\n  I will just ask the question: Is former Governor, now Presidential \ncandidate, Mitt Romney a protectionist? Governor Huntsman from Utah, a \nPresidential candidate and also former Ambassador to China for \nPresident Obama, said he would sign this bill if it came before him if \nhe is elected President; and Rob Portman, our fabulous new Senator, \nPresident Bush's former Trade Representative, said he supports the \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I don't think it is protectionism. I think it is an effort to protect \ntrade. There are some who are religious about free trade; it is a \nreligion. They believe that no matter how bad our trading partners act, \nwe should not retaliate because that might cause a trade war. I think \nthat is not against common sense. Trade is not my religion. I think any \ntrading relationship should depend on how well the agreement serves the \ninterests of both parties. It is similar to any other business \nrelationship. Is it serving the interests of both parties? In this \ntrade situation, it is a dramatic factor in the American loss of jobs. \nIt is indisputable, in my opinion.\n  A group of professors from California said our trade imbalance, over \nthe last decade, has cost 10 million jobs. Let me just say we are going \nto have dynamic changes in our economy. That happens all the time, and \nthere are winners and losers. We can compete with China and we are, in \nmany ways. When we give them a currency advantage as large as this, \ngood companies that are capable of competing and being successful are \nbeing hammered. The middle class in this country is being hammered.\n  This has to stop, and we have to ask ourselves: Is this country going \nto abandon its commitment or belief in a manufacturing economy? Are we \ngoing to give up manufacturing entirely? I don't think that is remotely \nconceivable. We have had brilliant economists tell us we need to be a \nservice economy and we can just deal with computers and e-mails and \nmove paper around and that this creates growth and wealth. We need a \nmanufacturing economy.\n  I see Senator Brown, who has been a strong advocate of this. Senators \nSchumer and Graham have been at this for years. I voted for the \nlegislation in 2005. I have become energized about this because I \nbelieve it is a deep responsibility for every government official to \nprotect our national security and protect our economic security. When \nwe have clear evidence that a predatory trade policy of a major world \nexporter--the largest exporter in the history of the world is China to \nthe United States. They are abusing their trade privileges, and the \nadministration refuses to act. I say the Congress can and should act.\n\n  I believe this is a reasonable bill. It allows the administration to \nnegotiate an end to this matter over a period of time, and it will \nprovide the power and the requirement that that happen.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the Senator's consistent push for \nfair trade policies. We have worked on Alabama's and Ohio's issues, \nfrom sleeping bags to steel. I appreciate that. The Senator said how \nimportant manufacturing is and that we cannot just turn to a service \neconomy or we begin to lose the middle class. I appreciate the \nSenator's advocacy there.\n  Will the Senator explain, before the debate is wrapped up, what this \ncurrency depreciation, if you will, by the Chinese does to our economy. \nSenator Merkley explained yesterday that when we export to China, their \ncurrency advantage--artificial advantage--gets the Chinese a 25-percent \ntariff on our sales to China, making it harder for a Montgomery or a \nDayton company to sell into China. Coming the other way, it is a 25-\npercent subsidy to the Chinese company--or their government's company--\nselling in Mobile or Cincinnati. Could the Senator wrap up the debate \nand go through that again--to the point of what currency does to \nmanufacturing and the middle class.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If a manufacturing company in Dayton is competing with \nthe Chinese company to manufacture a widget, they can, on the currency \nalone, more than have an advantage\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\nshipping the product from China here--a 25-percent advantage. As we \nknow, in modern trade and sales today, margins are very small, and 25 \npercent is a huge margin that would be provided by the currency alone. \nThen we have the things that are done in trying to block our companies \nfrom moving and selling there. To go beyond currency, it adds to the \nprice of our goods if we attempt to sell them in China.\n  This is not a two-way street. I believe that any rational government \nshould not allow its manufacturing industry and its workers to be \nsubjected to such unfair practices. We have an absolute responsibility \nto stand up and fix it. The best way to do it is the bill that Senators \nSchumer, Graham, Brown, and others have offered. It will do it in a \nrational, effective way. Other alternatives are less effective and will \nnot do the job. It is time for us to do it now.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, what is the time status for the \nmajority and minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has no time remaining. The \nminority has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. They are much better at this than we are.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield the 2 minutes to Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. All four of us have spoken. Again, I make a plea to my \ncolleagues. We have had 8 months talking about debt, and many have said \nthat is the future for our children and grandchildren. I think there is \na consensus on both sides that is true. I argue that this is also about \nthe future for our children and grandchildren, because if good American \ncompanies with great ideas are wiped out in the next 10 years--as they \nwill be if China continues its predatory practices--the future for our \nchildren and grandchildren in this country will not be bright. Our seed \ncorn, our family jewels are being decimated by a plague of unfair \ncompetition that has been allowed to continue. It is as if we have a \nplague and some of the leaders of this country, whether political or \neconomic, shrug their shoulders and say: That is that. We cannot do \nthat much about this.\n  In a bipartisan way, we have said we can do something about this \nplague. We are at the moment of decision. It is my belief that if we \npass this in a bipartisan way--as we have to; it is the way the Senate \nworks--the House may not take up our bill exactly, but they will do \nsomething. We will have a conference committee, and we can get \nsomething done. The odds are quite high that when China sees the train \nheading down the track, when their ability--I have seen the articles--\nand I wanted to read some of them into the record--of China urging \nAmerican companies with plants in China to lobby against this bill. But \nwhen China sees the train heading down the track and that, for the \nfirst time, their efforts with their multinational allies to stall this \nbill will not succeed, they will adjust and correct themselves, not \njust on currency but on all the other areas where they don't treat us \nfairly.\n  So this is an important vote and an important day for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am here to discuss S. 1619, the \ncurrency exchange rate oversight bill. I support this bill. Back in \n2007, I helped draft some of the language that is contained in this \ncurrent bill.\n  China is a big beneficiary of international trade, yet it fails to \nallow its currency to float freely. As a result, U.S. exporters get \ncheated. It is time we do something to send the message that enough is \nenough.\n  I am all for free trade, I want free trade. Free trade helps our \nfarmers, manufacturers, and our Nation as a whole. There is talk that \nthis bill will cause a trade war with China. I am not convinced that is \nthe case. Plus, keep in mind, this bill is about more than China. This \nbill is a much needed overhaul of a law that dates back to 1988. This \nbill puts in meaningful consequences for countries that do not address \ntheir currency manipulation.\n  All of that being said, I have to say I do not support the way this \nbill is being brought to a vote. While I want a vote on this bill and I \nwant to vote for this bill, my colleagues should have the right to \noffer and debate their respective amendments. The majority leader's use \nof cloture to prevent the meaningful debate on motions is unacceptable. \nIt is more of the same partisan politics that the American people are \ntired of. And in this instance, when there is bipartisan support for \nthe bill, the majority leader's heavyhanded approach just doesn't make \nsense.\n  That is why, even though I support the currency bill, I am voting \nagainst cloture. If cloture fails, I sincerely hope we can have a \nmeaningful debate and still move toward passage of this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report \nthe motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1619, a bill to \n     provide for identification of misaligned currency, require \n     action to correct the misalignment, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Sherrod Brown, Charles E.

I move to reconsider and lay this matter on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not in order.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we could have the attention of the \nSenate, we are now 30 hours postcloture. What the Republican leader and \nI would like to do--there is, of course, with what has happened \nprocedurally, no opportunity to offer amendments unless we agree to \noffer amendments, except for the issue dealing with suspending the \nrules. What we would like to do is have Senators work to come up with \nsome amendments they feel should be offered.\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n  Senator McConnell and all of us are happy to see whether we can work \nour way through this. I would hope Senators would check with floor \nstaff and see how we can get this done. It would be to my liking to not \nhave to spill over into tomorrow. The highest holy day of the Jewish \nfaith is tomorrow starting at sundown. There are a number of people who \nwish to leave to be able to be home with their families on that day, \nbut we have to finish this legislation this week. I would like to do it \ntoday if we can.\n  People should have an opportunity to offer amendments, give a little \nspeech or a big speech--whatever they feel is appropriate--and we can \nvote. I am happy to do that. I have called off the quorum, people can \ntalk, and in the meantime the floor staff will be waiting to hear from \nyou as to what we can do regarding amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add that the practical \neffect of where we are, not having been allowed to offer any amendments \nduring the consideration of this bill, is we are left with motions to \nsuspend. As the majority leader indicated, we are going to have some \ndiscussions about how many motions to suspend the majority will, shall \nI say, tolerate. The bad part of all of this from the Senate's point of \nview as an institution is that the minority is put at a substantial \ndisadvantage.\n  Having said that, as the majority leader indicated, the floor staff \nis going to work together and see whether we can come up with some list \nof motions to instruct that will at least allow the minority to have \nsome voice in the course of the consideration of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a number of things we can do. We \ncan do the motions to suspend. We are happy on this side to, with \nconsent, just do amendments. That is fine over here.\n  I don't want to get into a long debate, but I have been in a \nsituation during the entire pendency of this legislation to have \namendments allowed. I said that yesterday. I have no problem with that. \nThe problem we had is that the Republican leader offered the \nPresident's jobs bill in a form that is not the President's jobs bill. \nI told him this morning: If you want to vote on that, fine. We will do \nthat. We will have a vote on that today. It can either be a motion to \nsuspend the rules or it can be a regular amendment. I feel that way \nabout all the motions to suspend that have been filed.\n  There are times when I accept the blame of not allowing amendments. \nThere are times that certainly I am willing to take that burden of \nbeing criticized but not on this one. Not on this one. I have said \npublicly and I have said privately to the different Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans, that amendments could be offered. I don't want to get \ninto a long debate about that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my good friend yield for a question? I listened \nvery carefully to what the majority leader said. We interact every day. \nWhat my good friend has just said is that he would be more than happy \nto have amendments he gets to pick. He gets to pick what amendments we \nget to offer. That is not, I would say to my good friend, the view of \nthe minority as to how we ought to operate. We ought to be able to \ndetermine what amendments we are going to offer, not my good friend the \nmajority leader. What he is saying, in effect, is, yes, he would be \nprepared to allow us to offer amendments, but he would select which of \nour amendments might be appropriate. That is not a place that the \nminority, no matter which party is in the minority, would like to find \nthemselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried to set up a system here that \nis fair. Fair is in the mind of the person who says ``fair,'' and I \nunderstand that. We have had an open amendment process here, and that \nhas led, because of the intransigence of the Republicans, to getting \nnothing done. Offer an amendment, and there is no way to get rid of it. \nSo the system we have on this bill may not be the best in the world, \nbut with what has been going on in the Senate, sometimes we do the best \nwe can with the tools we have. There was no way of managing this \nlegislation other than how I just described it. People can imagine what \nthis place would have been like had we had a simple ``anybody can offer \nanything they want''--get the troops out of Afghanistan and on and on \nwith all the many things people would have done in this legislation.\n  So without ``he said, she said,'' or I guess in this instance ``he \nsaid, he said,'' I think what we should do is try to finish this \nlegislation today. The motion to suspend has been filed. That is fine \nwith us. Let's try to work through as many of those as we can and see \nif we can finish this today; otherwise, we will finish it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add the way the Senate \nused to work was the majority didn't pick the amendments the minority \nchose to offer, but there was some ability to determine whether it got \na vote because any Senator could prevent a time agreement on the \nopportunity to get a vote on an amendment. So it wasn't totally \nfreewheeling. Then at some point, if 60 Members of the Senate thought \nwe ought to move to conclusion, we would. It was a much more orderly \nand open process, leading to the same result, which is that if 60 \nMembers of the Senate wanted to end the matter and bring it to a \nconclusion, they could. So my complaint is about what we do before we \nget to the 60 votes, which I think in this particular instance is \nunfair to the minority.\n  Now, my party was divided on this issue. Some Members were for it; \nsome Members were against it. That meant for sure that at some point 60 \nvotes were going to be achieved and it was going to pass. The problem, \nI would say to my good friend, is what we did before then, which has \nthe practical effect of putting the minority in the position where it \ngets no amendments at all or is, once again, at the sufferance of the \nmajority with motions to suspend at the end, in which we are \nbasically--the majority determines how many we get, and all of that.\n  This level of control is not necessary, in my judgment, in order to \nmake the Senate move forward because, I will say again before I yield \nthe floor, if 60 Senators are in favor of bringing a matter to a \nconclusion, it will be brought to a conclusion. That is what just \nhappened a few minutes ago.\n  So I hope we can move forward in a more orderly process in the \nfuture, and maybe we can work out some agreement to have motions to \nsuspend this afternoon that will not require us to be here tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader and I came here about the same time. \nI remember the good old days too. But everyone who follows government \nat all knows that during the last Congress and part of this one, the \nNo. 1 goal of Republicans has been to stop legislation from moving \nthrough here--look at what has happened this year--and they have been \nfairly successful doing that, I have to acknowledge.\n  I have said publicly, and I say here today, I admire my friend, the \nRepublican leader, because he was very candid with what his goal is in \nthis Congress: to make sure President Obama is not reelected. That has \nbeen their goal. As a result of that, legislation has been very slow \nmoving, and we have not been able to legislate as we did in the good \nold days.\n  So let's now try, with the situation in which we find ourselves, to \nwork through this on a bipartisan basis. This is a good piece of \nlegislation. Let's see if we can get through these amendments. I am \nconfident we can. We have two outstanding floor managers for both \nSenator McConnell and for me in Gary Myrick and Dave Schiappa. They do \ngreat work. They are going to try to sift through all of this stuff and \nput us on a pathway they can show Senator McConnell and I will work \nand, if folks agree, we will get out of here today; otherwise, we will \ndo it tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My good friend referred to ``the good old days.'' The \ngood old days weren't that long ago. I can remember just a few years \nago when my party was in the majority in this body, and I was the \nassistant leader,\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nmaking the point with great repetition while listening to a lot of \ngrumbling that the price for being in the majority is, you have to take \nbad votes; you have to take votes you don't like in order to get \nlegislation across the floor and finished.\n  So this is not ancient times we are talking about where the minority \nactually got votes, took votes, and were not shut out. I hope we can \nmove back in that direction. I think it would be a lot better for the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not going to argue with my friend. The \nrecord speaks for itself. We know what has happened. I repeat, we are \nwhere we are today, and that is what we have to do to move forward on \nthis most important legislation. I will do my best to cooperate and \nallow the Senators to have votes on issues they believe are important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to \nrecommit amendments thereto fall as being inconsistent with cloture.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              the Jobs Act\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, as were many of my colleagues, I was back \nhome last week talking, in my case, to Alaskans, and the issues on \ntheir minds are pretty simple: the economy and jobs. Alaska has fared \nbetter than most States over the last 2 years, but no matter where I \ngo--maybe a small convenience store, while I am driving around town or \nat Home Depot, a gas station, or wherever I may get a chance to engage \nwith Alaskans--people are concerned about the economy and the ability \nfor jobs to be created in this great country of ours.\n  Alaskans know the economy will take some time to turn around. That is \nwhy today I am pleased to talk a little bit about the jobs act before \nus this week and, hopefully, while moving forward we will spend some \ntime on the debate about how important this work will be.\n  Last week when I was in Alaska, I had Transportation Secretary LaHood \nin Alaska, and we had a chance to travel around and get a good sense of \nwhat is important to Alaska with regard to ports, roads, airports, and \nrail. The core infrastructure of our State is no different than any \nother State. It is critical that we repair, put into shape, some of the \nfacilities that are falling apart or, in some cases, expand them. The \njobs act alone would mean $200 million to repair Alaska's \ntransportation network.\n  As one can imagine, that $200 million will be spent in the private \nsector by construction companies and contractors hiring private \nindividuals, workers to work on those jobs--good-paying jobs to provide \ngood incomes for their families. The same is true that the jobs act \nwill offer for Alaska around $62 million for school construction.\n  As I travel around my State--and I am sure for many other States--the \nneed is strong for improvements to and expansion of schools for those \nthat have been there for many years and have not had the renovations \nnecessary, again, providing hundreds and hundreds of jobs.\n  The jobs act also has some good steps to deal with small businesses--\nhow to ensure they get a break off their taxes, to ensure they have a \nbenefit as we try to move this economy forward. The tax provisions, the \npayroll tax reduction, which would affect 20,000 Alaska businesses in a \npositive way, will reduce their tax burden, as well as working \nfamilies, who will see a reduction in their payroll taxes.\n  On average, for a middle-class family, it would be almost $2,000--not \na bad gift, in a sense, as we move into this holiday season. But it is \nreally their money. Giving back this $2,000 to middle-class families \nmeans they will put it into the economy. They will spend it in the \neconomy. They will use it as they see fit.\n  However, I wish to lay down a marker. As I have said, the jobs bill \nis important for the roads and water and sewer and ports that need to \nbe repaired and renovated and expanded, the schools that need to be \nbuilt or expanded and repaired also, as well as the benefits to our \nsmall business community and the benefits to our middle-class working \nfamilies--all important. But how we pay for it is also important \nbecause we have to make sure it is paid for. But I wish to put down a \nmarker on at least the first proposal that was laid down regarding how \nthe President was planning to pay for this.\n  Let me first start with the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas \nindustry for Alaska is about 85 percent of our economy in the sense \nthat the money goes into our State treasury and provides well over \n40,000 jobs. Nationwide, the oil and gas industry produces over 9 \nmillion jobs and contributes over $2 trillion to our economy.\n  I know some of my colleagues on my side of the aisle like to blast \nBig Oil. But as we know, the oil and gas industry is made up of \nhundreds, well over 500 companies of all sizes--small, medium-sized, \nand large. Singling out a growing industry and imposing a tax penalty, \nin my view, is the wrong choice. It is the wrong road to go down. We \nneed to recognize the potential for more job creation instead by \nsupporting increased domestic oil and gas development.\n\n  By developing Alaska's Arctic offshore resources alone, we can create \nover 50,000 jobs nationwide over the coming decade, jobs being created \nright here in our country. As an example, 400 jobs just in Washington \nto upgrade the Kulluk drilling unit which will be utilized in Alaska or \nthe 1,000 jobs in Louisiana to build a new Arctic supply ship right \nnow.\n  So when we look at the potential, and when we look at the \nopportunities in the Arctic for oil and gas development, it creates \nAmerican jobs, American jobs not only in the Arctic in Alaska but also \nthroughout the country where many of the facilities or the material \nutilized is located to construct what is needed, such as in Washington \nState and Louisiana, as I mentioned.\n  Also, Federal revenue would be generated. The Chamber of Commerce has \nestimated that developing and increasing production on Federal lands \ncould produce well over $200 billion in new revenues to our country.\n  An Alaska analysis puts the Federal revenues just for Beaufort and \nChukchi Sea at $160 billion. For those who are not familiar with where \nthose are, those are just above the North Slope in the Arctic. These \nhave a potential of well over 24 billion barrels of oil development in \nthe known technically recoverable reserves today--upwards to 24 \nbillion, 26 billion.\n  I will tell you I do support--and I understand in the original \nproposal they wanted to take away some of these tax incentives that \nhelp our industry move forward, especially the smaller companies to \nexpand exploration and development. I recognize that tax reform needs \nto be done, and I am a strong supporter of tax reform. Senator Wyden \nand Senator Coats and I have supported a piece of legislation that is \nall about tax reform. I believe in a holistic proposal, not just \nselective industries. So do not get me wrong. Do I believe in tax \nreform? Do I believe in trying to clear out loopholes and incentives \nthat are not working or may be used improperly? Absolutely. Again, that \nis why we supported a much broader perspective. But in pay-fors or tax \nproposals to pay for the jobs bill, this is not the right approach.\n  Another concern I have is on aviation. Alaska has 6 times more pilots \nand 16 times more aircraft per capita than any other State in the \ncountry. Alaska has limited road infrastructure. Eighty percent of our \ncommunities are accessed not by roads but by water or air. So it is \ncritical we have the right kind of aviation system.\n  General aviation is not a luxury in Alaska, it is a necessity. It is \nour highway in the sky. That is the utilization of our airlines and \nsmall planes. The general aviation component is critical for business, \nlife safety, moving things from one village to another.\n  One piece of the President's jobs bill would change the way \nbusinesses can treat the depreciation of general aviation aircraft and \ncreate a disincentive to buy American-made aircraft and further depress \nan industry that has already felt a significant impact due to the \nrecession.\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n  The administration and Congress should not be demonizing legitimate \nbusiness travel. General aviation is more than just business jets. I \nknow we like to read about it and see it in papers and that is what \npeople like to highlight. But in Alaska it is about moving from one \ncommunity to the other. This would impact the turbo-prop aircraft which \nare the workhorses for Alaska's general aviation fleet.\n  Another administration proposal would impose a $100-per-flight user \nfee on certain general aviation aircraft. This is not a wise or even \ncost-effective way to administer a tax. General aviation users pay \ntheir fair share now. They pay for the aviation system through a per-\ngallon tax on their aviation fuel.\n  As a matter of fact, the general aviation industry has even agreed to \na modest increase in this fuel tax as part of the FAA, Federal Aviation \nAdministration, reauthorization bill which passed the Senate earlier \nthis year. It shows their commitment to pay their fair share, but in an \nefficient way, and also puts it back into aviation, which is what in \nour State is, again, as I said, the highway in the sky to move goods \nand people all across our State. Again, I think the idea the \nadministration has of a $100-per-flight user fee is just another \nburden, another fee, another tax that is not necessary and very \ninefficient.\n  As we think about job creation and what is going on, the other piece \nof this I am concerned about as to the taxes that are associated with \nthis idea of the jobs bill--which I support elements of, as I \nmentioned; very important--but the issue when it comes to limiting the \nitemized deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest \nfor families earning over $200,000, again, I think this is not a well-\nfounded idea. I recognize the administration is trying to find ways to \npay for things, but this is not, in my view, a good idea or a smart \nmove.\n  When we think of a family, some might say: A family making $200,000 \nis wealthy. I will tell you, if they have a couple kids in school and \nare trying to figure out their future, after they figure out the \ndeductions, their health care costs, and everything else, $200,000 \ndisappears very quickly. We need to ensure that the deductions for \nmortgage interest and charitable contributions continue for these \nmiddle-class families at the level they can take a benefit from.\n  So for those three or four items I have a concern with the way the \npay-fors or the tax increases to pay for the jobs bill are being \nhandled. I know there is new discussion. I am glad there is new \ndiscussion because it would be difficult for me to support any jobs \nbill with a pile of these new taxes or tax increases that are being \nproposed. This would not be in the interest of my constituents in \nAlaska. It would not be in the interest of my industries that work hard \nin Alaska, creating jobs not only in our State but across this country.\n  I agree we need to do what we can to have a jobs bill, but let's have \na fair pay-for in order to pay for it, not these additional taxes that \nI think would be a burden on working families and small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I would like to digress for one last second before I \nyield the floor to speak on another issue. It is always enjoyable. I \nread every business newspaper I can. I try to read every business \nmagazine I can. I want to absorb as much information as I can when I am \nhere in Washington during the sessions and workweeks and then when I go \nback home, hearing from individuals. But it is amazing to me--and I \nknow on the Senate floor we have our philosophical debates. We saw some \nof that just a little bit ago on the old days versus the new days. I \nhave never seen the old days. I have been here only 3 years, and this \nplace has not run very well in the sense of trying to get things up and \ndealt with.\n  But I will tell you, Mr. President, some of the positions you have \ntaken and I have taken and many on this side of the aisle have taken \nhave been a lot of votes that have helped move this country forward. I \nwill tell you one specifically which is about the auto industry.\n  As I was sitting here waiting for the debate, I was looking through \nthese articles. Here is one from yesterday from the Wall Street \nJournal, which is not the most liberal newspaper, to say the least. But \nif we recall, a couple years ago we made a decision that we were going \nto take some risk, we were going to try to move the country forward, \nsave an industry that was struggling that employed people in this \ncountry and was competing worldwide.\n  Folks on the other side said we were going to create a disaster by \nour actions, we would destroy the economy, we would sink this industry. \nThe list went on and on--all the complaints. But as I read the headline \nin the Wall Street Journal from yesterday, it reads: ``Automakers Now \nImport Jobs.''\n  ``Import jobs,'' what does this mean? This means they are bringing \njobs back to this country. They specifically mention Japan and China.\n  Now, 3 years ago, I could read a different headline: Auto Industry on \nTheir Deathbed, never going to survive. Maybe we would only have one \nauto company left. We now have three. Actually, if we look at the \nnumbers, Chrysler is 27 percent up over the previous year in sales; GM, \n20 percent up; Ford, 9 percent up. The American auto industry is doing \nwell because of what we did here.\n\n  Some called it a bailout. I disagree. What we did was partner with \nindustry to help them get over the hump, the recession, the struggle. \nThey are paying back every dime the Federal Government loaned them, and \nthey are profitable. They are hiring people. They are growing the \nindustry, and they are bringing jobs back to this country.\n  I would say the policy we had--despite the naysayers, the negative \nattitudes people had on the other side--worked. Maybe the Wall Street \nJournal is wrong, but I do not think so because I have seen article \nafter article that states the same. I can point to many others.\n  Is it as robust as we want in the economy? No. Can it do better? \nAbsolutely. That is why the jobs bill is important--important for my \nState, important for every State, investing in the issues that matter: \nwater, roads, sewers, electrification, schools, you name it, putting \nmoney back into taxpayers' pockets instead of the IRS taking it and \nhoarding it, putting it back where it counts. That is what the jobs \nbill does.\n  We have disagreements on how to pay for it. I think we are going to \nget to a better solution because several of us--more the moderate wing \nof the Democrats--are arguing that we cannot have these selective taxes \nthe way they are laid out in the proposal presented by the President. \nWe need to have a more simplified system and pay for it in a different \nway but not penalize certain companies because maybe we do not like \nthem or it creates a great headline. But let's focus on the right way \nto do this.\n  I anticipate we will be able to have a different pay-for, a different \nproposal on how to pay for a great potential to bring more jobs back. \nBut I end on that note only because I want to make sure--I know we are \ngoing to hear more naysaying, but the bottom line is the proof is in \nthe pudding. That article I just read from gives us that.\n  Mr. President, I, again, thank you for the time and the opportunity \nto say a few words about the jobs bill, my concern, where I want to lay \nmy marker down, but also to speak about the success we have had on \ntaking some votes that were tough votes and the success we have had to \nmove this economy forward--not as fast as we all would like, but better \nthan I think what the folks said on the other side who just say nay, \nsay no to everything.\n  So let me end there, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Unemployment Crisis\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this country faces many problems. But I \nthink if we go out on Main Street, if we go out to rural America, if we \ngo to my State of Vermont, what people will tell us is, the major \ncrisis we face is we have a massive problem with unemployment.\n  Some people will suggest that unemployment is 9 percent in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nThat is not quite accurate. If we look at the numbers for those people \nwho have given up looking for work, if we look at the numbers for those \npeople who are working part time when they want to work full time, we \nare looking at a situation where 16 percent of the American people are \nunemployed or underemployed. That is 25 million Americans.\n  The job of the Congress now is to start putting those people back to \nwork. That is what we have to do. There is an enormous amount of work \nthat needs to be done. Virtually every American who gets into his or \nher car understands that our infrastructure is crumbling; that is, \nroads and bridges. Talk to mayors all over Vermont and in the United \nStates of America, and they will say they are having major problems \nwith their water systems. If we look at our rail system in this \ncountry, it is way behind Europe, Japan, and China. We need to rebuild \npublic transportation and have a 21st-century rail system.\n  So if you put people to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, \nrebuilding our transportation system, you are going to make the United \nStates of America more productive, you are going to make us more \ncompetitive internationally, and you are going to create the millions \nof jobs we desperately need. It is stunning to me that we have not \nmoved aggressively in terms of job creation. That is exactly what we \nhave to do.\n  If we put $400 billion into infrastructure, we can create millions \nand millions of good-paying jobs, we can make our country more \nproductive and more internationally competitive. Every single year we \nare importing and spending about $350 billion on foreign oil, bringing \nthat oil in from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries. As we move \nto energy independence, as we break our dependence on fossil fuels, \nmoving to energy efficiency and sustainable energy such as solar, wind, \ngeothermal, biomass, we can create millions more jobs.\n  It seems to me at a time when the middle class is disappearing, at a \ntime when poverty is increasing to a record-breaking level, at a time \nwhen people in every section of the country are saying we need to put \nour people back to work, now is the time to do that.\n  Last year I introduced the concept which said, let's have a surtax on \nmillionaires. The reason I said that is the wealthiest people in this \ncountry are becoming wealthier. Their real effective tax rate is the \nlowest in decades. I am very pleased to see that the Democratic \nleadership is moving forward in that direction.\n  As we create the jobs we need by rebuilding our infrastructure, by \ntransforming our energy system, it is absolutely appropriate that at a \ntime when the gap between the very wealthy and everybody else is \ngetting wider that we ask the wealthiest people in this country to help \nus fund job creation so we can pull the middle class out of the \nterrible recession they are suffering.\n  I think the job is a major jobs program now for our country, rebuild \nour infrastructure, transform our energy system, ask the wealthiest \npeople in this country to start paying their fair share of taxes. Let's \nend many of these tax loopholes and breaks that large corporations \nhave. We can fund a serious jobs program and put millions of our people \nback to work, which is something we absolutely have to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                             Jobs Creation\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, as we discuss what we should be talking \nabout--how to get more people back to work--there are a lot of \ndifferent approaches on how we get there. But I hope we can reach the \ndecision that we need to do the things in government that allow private \nindividuals to make the decisions they make to create jobs. Our Federal \ndebt has reached, of course, a record high. It continues to grow every \nday. National unemployment is lingering around 9 percent. Home prices \nhave plummeted in almost every community in America. Gas prices and \nhealth care costs have skyrocketed.\n  On the energy issue my friend from Vermont was talking about, the \nshortest path to more American jobs is more American energy. I am not \nopposed to any of the green jobs he was talking about. I wish to see us \nhave all of those jobs, if they can eventually be a competitive part of \nan energy environment. I think they can. But I think we should also \nfocus on the jobs that power America today.\n  Even if we knew what the country was going to look like energywise 30 \nyears from now, it would take a long time to get there. I am for more \nAmerican energy jobs of all kinds. For 50 years we have not met the \nmarketplace need with what we could produce. But the marketplace need \nis always there. It is always there in a bad economy, it is always \nthere in a good economy. Let's meet that need. Certainly that can mean \nmore solar and more wind and more biofuels and more anything else we \ncan think of. It also needs to mean more shale gas and more shale oil, \nmore using the fossil fuel deposits such as coal that we have as we \nmove toward a different energy future, and to do that in a way that \nallows us to continue to be competitive.\n  If our utility bill doubles in the middle of the country where the \nPresiding Office of the Senate today and I are from, we are not as \ncompetitive, and I don't think we lose the jobs we lose to \nMassachusetts or to California. I think we lose those jobs to places \nthat care a whole lot less about what comes out of the smokestack than \nwe do.\n  At the same time, jump-starting our economy will require \nbipartisanship. If we are going to compete in a global economy and help \ncreate economic opportunities, we have to be willing to work together. \nThis week we saw a long-awaited but still a real example of that kind \nof bipartisanship when President Obama submitted the three pending \ntrade agreements. They have been pending for 3 years and we have lost \nopportunities in those markets for 3 years. But in fairness to the \nPresident, for at least the first 2 of those 3 years, the House of \nRepresentatives would not have passed these agreements. But they would \npass them now, and they will pass them now, and so will the Senate--I \nam hopeful as early as next week. That creates opportunities in \nMissouri, where I am from, and across the country.\n  I have worked closely with our colleagues. Senator Portman and I put \na letter together from Republicans who told the White House we are \nwilling to work on the trade adjustment assistance as part of the \npackage, if that is what it takes to get these trade agreements sent to \nthe Capitol. And we did. Those trade adjustment agreements have now \npassed the Senate and are ready to move forward with the trade bills. \nThese free-trade agreements would mean an additional $2\\1/2\\ to $3 \nbillion in agricultural exports every year. Every billion dollars of \nagricultural exports is an estimated 8,000 new jobs. These are the \nplaces where we can get the jobs: trade, travel, tourism, energy. This \nis not that complicated a formula, but the government cannot continue \nto stand in the way of all of those things moving forward.\n  In Missouri, exports accounted for 5.4 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct in 2008. Companies in our State sold products in nearly 200 \nforeign markets. Since 2002, exports have increased three times faster \nthan the rest of our economy. That is one State in the middle of the \ncountry working to be competitive in the world.\n  The passage of these trade agreements will increase trade for \nsoybeans, for beef, for corn, for pork, for dairy products, for \nprocessed food, for fish, all of which we produce in our State, plus \nall kinds of manufactured products which in South Korea, in Colombia, \nand Panama, given the choice of two products on the shelf, the American \nproduct is still a product that consumers in those countries will \nchoose even with some disadvantage. Imagine what will happen when we \neliminate more of that disadvantage.\n  This week the bill on the floor--I think this bill that concerns me \nabout managing China currency, but only if the President does not \ndisagree with what the Congress has passed--has much greater potential \nto start a trade war than it does to solve any given problem. I am not \nhere to defend the Chinese or its leaders or its trade practices. In \nfact, one of those practices where you make a product in China and \nthere is already a finding that that product is somehow unfairly being \nimported or exported in the WTO agreements, and so you put another a \nlabel\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\non it that says it is from somewhere else, sometimes called \ntransshipment, Senator Wyden and I have a bill, the ENFORCE Act, that \nwould deal with that, and it deals with that specifically, directly, \nand actually will produce a result. I look forward to that bill being \non the floor.\n\n  I am proud to cosponsor Senator Hatch's alternative to the bill that \nis on the floor this week that, in fact, is multilateral. It involves \nother countries plus the WTO, plus the IMF, in a discussion that might \nactually produce a real result of what the various countries in the \nworld, including China, are doing as they manage their currency in ways \nthat may not be found to be fair in the foreign marketplace.\n  But we need results. We do not need legislation purposes of using up \ntime when we have so many important things we could be doing. I have \ncosponsored the Affordable Footwear Act with Senator Cantwell. That \nwill ease the tax burden on American consumers who unknowingly pay up \nto 40 percent duties on retail costs that cover this import duty or the \nshoe tax on shoes made outside the United States. All of those bills \nrepresent ways we can level the playing field for American workers, for \nAmerican job creators, and spur economic growth right here at home.\n  Another topic we should be focused on is Federal regulation and \nregulation that simply does not make sense. I have met lots of job \ncreators in Missouri even this year, and certainly in past years. But \nthis year more than any other, they want to talk about the regulators. \nThey want to talk about the air rules, the utility MACT rule, the \ncross-State air pollution rule, that could cause as much as 15 percent \nof our coal-producing energy plants to shut down. When they shut down, \nthat means the price goes up. I know it is a philosophy of many in the \ncurrent administration that our problem is that our energy is not \nexpensive enough, but I do not find any Missouri families who are \nsitting down at the kitchen table looking at their utility bill and \nsaying, the problem here is this bill is not high enough. What we need \nto do to solve our energy problem is raise this. Nobody is saying \nthat--even though the cap-and-trade legislation that passed the House \nin 2009 would have doubled the utility bill in Missouri in about 12 \nyears.\n  A lot of things work at today's utility bill that do not work later. \nUnder the new EPA regulations on cross-State air pollution, the Ameren \nElectric Company announced that they will be forced to close two of \ntheir coal-fired plants by the end of this year. Not modify, not redo, \nclose. The only thing that makes sense is to close those plants. The \npeople who get the utility bill will know those plants are closed \nbecause they are going to be paying a higher price. Electric rates \ncould rise 20 percent in some areas in a very short time.\n  Fugitive dust. There is actually a rule the EPA is talking about \nwhere farmers cannot let dust from their farm go to another farm. I was \nraised on farms and around farms. You cannot farm without dust. You \ncannot harvest a crop without dust. You cannot farm in the mud. You \ncannot contain the dust that is part of farming. It is the kind of rule \nthat simply does not make sense.\n  There is a rule on boilers that would impact universities and \nhospitals as well as sawmills and other facilities that generate their \nenergy from industrial boilers.\n  There is a cement regulation.\n  We are not going to have the kind of recovery we want in this country \nwithout a recovery in housing.\n  The House recently passed a bill that would require the \nadministration to evaluate the economic toll of the new EPA rules on \ncement and other industries. The House also is set to take up a bill \nthat would delay the cement rules for at least 5 years. You are not \ngoing to have a construction industry if you do not have access to \nproducts that make sense to build things out of.\n  I have said for some time that we ought to have a moratorium on all \nof these regulations. In fact, I am cosponsoring Senator Collins' bill \nto call a timeout on new major regulations and give employers the \ncertainty that they need to create new jobs in an environment that they \nunderstand what it is going to be like as those jobs have a chance to \nbecome permanent jobs.\n  This is an easy solution to help job creators. But instead, we are \ntalking about the jobs bill. Almost all of the President's speeches on \nthe jobs bill are in politically competitive States. I am wondering if \nthat is not a 2012 political strategy instead of a 2011 legislative \nstrategy.\n  There are 1.7 million fewer American jobs since the President signed \nthe first stimulus bill into law. We do not need stimulus 2. We need to \ndo the things that encourage private sector job creators to create \nprivate sector jobs. Let's vote on the bill. Instead of this debate we \nare having this week on China currency, let's vote on the President's \nbill. He said in, I think, Dallas last Tuesday, late morning in Dallas: \nLet the Senate at least vote on the bill. So the minority leader, \nSenator McConnell, came to the floor and said, let's vote on the bill. \nWe are ready on our side. Let's vote on the bill. Let's get beyond the \n``pass the bill,'' let's see if the votes are there to pass the bill so \nwe can get to the things that will get the country going again.\n  These regulations and this talk of higher utility bills and higher \ntaxes put a big wet blanket on the entire economy. This discussion of \nwho we are going to be puts a big wet blanket on the entire economy. \nLet's take that blanket off and do the things at the government level \nthat allow private job creators to do what they can to create private \nsector jobs. I hope we can get on with the business the country needs \nto get done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the issue \nof creating jobs in America--more specifically, the loss of jobs that \nhas been driven by the unfair trade practices of China. The bottom line \nis this: Chinese manipulation of currency is a tariff on American \nproducts and a subsidy to Chinese exports, greatly disadvantaging \nmanufacturing in America and destroying thousands of American jobs.\n  When we look at our challenge, it is not to simply strengthen the \noverall economy, often measured by the gross domestic product. Our \nchallenge is to strengthen the American family, the financial \nfoundations that depend upon a good living-wage job. So every proposal \nwe consider should be weighed by whether it creates jobs or destroys \njobs. That is true in times of a robust economy. It is particularly \ntrue now when we have a persistent high unemployment rate, when \nfamilies have been battered not just by the loss of jobs but by the \nloss of equity in their homes, by the loss of their health care that \nwent with their jobs, by the loss of their retirement savings--all of \nthese at a time when the price of things fundamental to families keeps \ngoing up.\n  There are many who looked to the opening of China as an opportunity \nto have a vast market for American products. Indeed, many continue \ntoday to talk about China in terms of the market opportunities for \nAmerican products. But the picture has changed dramatically over the \nlast decade, and we, as policymakers here in the Senate, must recognize \nthat change: that China has become a vast manufacturing enterprise, \nthat it has done so through a deliberate manufacturing and export \nstrategy, and that strategy is destroying jobs in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Over the last 10 years, China has reaped benefits, but it has not \nupheld its end of the bargain. Indeed, one piece of the deal is that \nthey would create a rule of law that they would enforce restrictions on \nthe theft of intellectual property. But I can tell you that when we \ntook a bipartisan delegation to China earlier this year, led by the \nmajority leader, company after company told us the stories of their \nproducts being stolen by Chinese enterprises, and not just the design \nof their products that were then replicated and sold without the \nappropriate patents but also the software.\n  If you want a simple example of this, take Microsoft Windows and its \nproducts and its Office suite. Only about\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nhalf of the copies used by the official government in China are legal \ncopies, and outside of the government, only a very small fraction of \nthe copies are legal copies. That is just the beginning of the vast \nintellectual theft where China has not upheld its end of the bargain to \ncreate a rule of law and stop the outright thievery of American \nintellectual property, damaging American companies.\n  Second, we have the Chinese-pegged currency. Now, when a country pegs \nits currency to another, as they have their currency to the dollar, \nthey can do so and adjust it periodically according to market \ninfluences; they can decide to end the pegging and let it float, which \nthen you get a real market valuation or they can deliberately keep \nprinting money to sustain a situation in which the currency is \nundervalued. And that is exactly what China has done. When they make \ntheir currency cheap, what they do is make their products much less \nexpensive to other nations. That is equivalent to subsidizing their \nexports. When they make their currency cheap and make dollars very \nexpensive, it is equivalent to putting a tax on American products, a \ntariff on American products.\n  While much of America has thought of the World Trade Organization as \none that created a platform for free trade or even a level playing \nfield, that is far from the truth. The truth is that China has been \nallowed to sustain a pegged currency that puts the equivalent of a 25-\npercent tariff disadvantage to American products and a 25-percent \nsubsidy to Chinese products.\n  There are those in this Chamber who have come to this floor and said \nthat to challenge the Chinese tariff on American products is to launch \na trade war. My friends, do you not realize that the Chinese tariff on \nAmerica is a trade war and that they are winning this war and they are \ndestroying American jobs while vastly increasing their own production? \nIf not, please go to China and talk to American companies and talk to \nthe American companies that have been shut down in America. We have \nlost 3 million manufacturing jobs since 1998, a little bit over a \ndecade. Not all of that is the consequence of Chinese practices, but a \ngreat amount of it is.\n  We must not stand by trying to pretend that the world is one way and \nthat China represents solely a market and not a manufacturing \ncompetitor when the truth is they are a fierce competitor using \nindustrial policy and a pegged currency to outcompete American \nproducts, to penalize American products.\n  In terms of the currency manipulation, our Secretary of the Treasury \nsaid this:\n\n       Whatever your definition of manipulation is, what matters \n     is the currency is undervalued. They are intervening--\n\n  Referring to China--\n\n     to hold it down. That adversely affects our economic \n     interests, and there is an overwhelmingly compelling economic \n     case for the world, for China's trading partners, for China, \n     for us, to try to alter that basic practice.\n\n  Well, certainly we have the Secretary of the Treasury echoing that we \nhave a challenge that is hurting America and that we need to respond to \nthat challenge. That is why we have this bill on the floor addressing \nthe Chinese manipulation of currency.\n  This is not the only strategy China uses. They also, through their \nuse of rules, use a strategy of holding down interest rates below the \ninflation rate. This means any Chinese citizen who puts their money in \na state-controlled bank--and that is the only option they have--loses \nvalue every year on that money. This is sometimes given the fancy name \nof ``financial repression'' by economists--where they repress or hold \ndown the interest rates. But let's call it something a little more \nunderstandable: insurance rate manipulation. That is done in order to \nallow the central bank--the Chinese banking system--to reap great \nrevenues, which they can then take to subsidize their manufacturing. \nThey do this through a series of grants and through a series of \nsubsidized loans.\n  An American entrepreneur was in my office the morning before \nyesterday talking about how an individual he knows went to China and \nstarted out negotiations with China, where they offered him a 3-percent \ninterest rate on money to operate his enterprise. They ended up \noffering a negative 3-percent interest rate. In other words, they would \npay him to take the money in order to bring that manufacturing to \nChina. In other words, take his plant out of the United States and \nbring it to China. They would pay him to do that. That is a vast \nsubsidy.\n  That is not the only subsidy. The grants, the subsidization of water \ncosts, and the subsidization of electricity--all these subsidies--have \na big impact. If we go to the WTO Web site, we will see how it \nsummarizes the structure of the WTO. Under the section called \n``Subsidies,'' they note:\n\n       [Subsidies] are prohibited because they are specifically \n     designed to distort international trades, and are they're \n     therefore likely to hurt other countries' trade.\n\n  So the plan was, when subsidies were used deliberately to distort \ninternational trade, they would be outlawed. Guess what. China is \nignoring this. China is flaunting this. They are required to disclose \neach and every year all the subsidies they provide to their \nmanufacturing, and they do not do it. They did it once in 2006, a very \nminimal disclosure.\n  Why is it we continue to believe we have a structure that facilitates \nmutually beneficial trade in the WTO when China, through currency \nmanipulation and direct subsidies to exports, is breaking every key \naspect of the WTO framework with hardly a protest from the United \nStates?\n  We have on the floor a bill which says we will no longer turn our \nhead from the deliberate distortion of the international trading regime \nthat was supposed to benefit both nations but, in fact, has become a \npowerful international tool for stealing jobs from the United States of \nAmerica and undermining the success of the American worker.\n  Let's take a look at paper. Just a few months ago, Blue Heron, a \ncompany that has operated for nearly a century in Oregon, shut down. It \nis a paper company. They shut down for one simple reason: because the \nChinese currency manipulation and the Chinese direct subsidies to those \nwho manufacture paper for export in China completely undermined the \nmarket for manufacturers in the United States. So the lives of these \nAmerican workers are destroyed. The workers owned Blue Heron. When they \ngot notice they were going to have to shut down because of these \nChinese subsidies and Chinese currency manipulations, they basically \nwere completely out on the street--no health care after the Friday they \nshut down, no severance payment. Indeed, they are having to start from \nscratch--workers who are 40, 50 years old starting from scratch--in an \neconomy where there are no jobs to be found. But they are not alone. \nPaper companies across the United States have been shutting down for \nexactly the same reasons.\n  Let's take the case of wind turbines. Wind turbines imported into \nChina are subject to a 10-percent tariff, while wind turbines imported \ninto the United States are subject to only a 2\\1/2\\-percent tariff. Why \ndo we--on top of everything else I have noted--add to the injury by \nputting a lower tariff on their imports than they put on ours?\n  Can someone in this Chamber explain to me why shutting down \nmanufacturing in the United States and opening manufacturing in China \nand piling on lower tariffs on a country that is already subsidizing \nits exports and already putting a tariff on ours makes any sense? I \ncertainly would be very interested in that explanation. I think the \nworkers in an industry that would otherwise be manufacturing these wind \nturbines in the United States would be very interested in the \nexplanation.\n  China doesn't give our wind turbines a fair chance to be used in \ntheir energy products. Let me read this quote from 2009 regarding the \naward of contracts on Chinese projects.\n\n       . . . all multinational firms bidding on National \n     Development and Reform Commission projects [were] quickly \n     disqualified on technical grounds within 3 days of applying.\n\n  In other words, a nontariff barrier in China was added, on top of \neverything else, to make sure that only Chinese manufacturers would \nhave a chance to get the contracts.\n  Let's turn to solar--solar voltaic panels. The whole technology was \ninvented in the United States, but we can see that over the last 3 \nyears the tremendous subsidies to solar in China are destroying the \nAmerican industry. One of the few remaining manufacturers is\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\nSolarWorld. It is located in my State--the State of Oregon. In the span \nof less than 10 months--from 2009 to 2010--three major manufacturers \nshut down, destroying hundreds of jobs--jobs that would not be \nrestored.\n  SolarWorld is incredibly efficient. They are working with American \ntechnology. We should be building and selling these solar panels to the \nworld, but we aren't going to be able to do so if China--using their \nmanipulated interest rates to produce funds for grants and subsidized \nloans--continues to virtually pay folks to ship their manufacturing \ninto China and discriminates against American products. I want \nSolarWorld to be there not just next year but 10 years from now or 20 \nyears from now. That will not happen if we don't address this massive \nassault on American manufacturing.\n  Because China has failed to disclose its subsidies, as required under \nWTO, I have proposed an amendment to the bill--an amendment that will \nnot be heard because a deal cannot be worked out to allow amendments on \nthis bill. I am very disappointed in that. This amendment simply says, \nif China or any other country under the WTO fails to do the \nnotification of subsidies that is required, our U.S. Trade \nRepresentative will do a counternotification, putting those subsidies \non the table. That way we can see exactly what they are and we can be \npart of this debate. It is the beginning of holding China accountable \nfor breaking the WTO rules.\n  This is not a Democratic amendment and it is not a Republican \namendment. This is an amendment about the future of the middle class in \nAmerica, the future of the worker in America. I am pleased to have \nSenator Enzi as my chief cosponsor and additional colleagues from \nacross the aisle--Senator Barrasso and Senator Snowe. I am pleased on \nthis side of the aisle to have Senators Nelson, Schumer, and Levin as \ncosponsors. That pretty much spans the spectrum of opinion in this \nChamber, where everyone agrees China should be held accountable. If \nthey are subsidizing their manufacturing, which they are, they have to \ndisclose it, and they are not. We can have a better debate about how to \nend their rule-breaking under the WTO if we have that information.\n  In closing, I just wish to note that this debate should have happened \na decade ago--it should have happened 5 years ago--because over that \ntimespan we have continued to hemorrhage jobs, we have continued to \nhope China would apply the rule of law on intellectual property, we \nhave continued to hope they would end their manipulation of their \ncurrency, we have continued to hope they would end their illegal \nsubsidies and the undermining of American products. Those hopes have \nnot been realized. China has not chosen to honor the framework that was \nestablished. So while we hope, American workers are losing their jobs. \nThat is why we have to have this debate on the floor. That is why this \nbill before us must be passed--to give the President greater leverage \nand to send a message to China that we are now fully paying attention \nat a level we should have a decade ago. The fact we have not paid \nattention is water under the bridge, but we are paying attention now. \nIf anyone cares about having an American middle class, with living \nwages for workers, then I ask them to fully support this bill. The \ntrade war China has been carrying out, decimating manufacturing in our \nNation, must not go without full debate and a full response.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I stand here to talk about the case of an \nabuse of another kind than we are currently speaking of with regard to \nChina and its currency manipulation. Youcef Nadarkhani was arrested in \nOctober of 2009 in Iran. I will read the charges against him, pursuant \nto a document signed by two judges, and I will say their names because \nI think one day they will be held accountable: Morteza Fazel and \nAzizoallah Razaghi. I think I got the pronunciation right. Here is what \nthe document says, as reflected in a news article: ``Mr. Youcef \nNadarkhani, son of Byrom, 32 years old, married, born in Rasht in the \nstate of Gilan, is convicted of turning his back on Islam, the greatest \nreligion the prophesy of Mohammad at the age of 19,'' the document \nstates.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       He has often participated in Christian worship and \n     organized home church services, evangelizing and has been \n     baptized and baptized others, converting Muslims to \n     Christianity. He has been accused of breaking Islamic Law \n     that from puberty . . . until the age of 19 the year 1996, he \n     was raised a Muslim in a Muslim home. During court trials, he \n     denied the prophecy of Mohammad and the authority of Islam. \n     He has stated that he is a Christian and no longer Muslim. \n     During many sessions in court with the presence of his \n     attorney and a judge, he has been sentenced to execution by \n     hanging.\n\n  He was sentenced to hanging for this alleged crime, and that is what \nhe has been convicted for. That conviction was upheld by an appeals \ncourt in Gilan in September 2010.\n  In July, the Supreme Court of Iran overturned the death sentence. \nAgain, this is according to media reports. They did not overturn the \nconviction, just the death sentence, and sent the case back to his \nhometown of Rasht. Here is what has happened since it has gone back to \nhis hometown.\n  The deputy governor of that province says, while he is guilty of \napostasy, that is not why he was sentenced to death. They have come up \nwith some new charges. They say he is a security threat--in particular \nhe is an extortionist and, they claim, he is a rapist.\n  By the way, they had never said this before until the case came back \nto them. By the way, he is also a Zionist, which in and of itself, \naccording to them, is punishable by death in Iran. That is where the \ncase stands today.\n\n  There have been reports time and again about what has been happening \nin Iran with this case. His lawyers have now been publicly saying they \nexpect to know by Saturday whether their client will be executed in \nIran, quite frankly for the crime of not just being a Christian but of \nconverting others to Christianity.\n  Obviously, this is an outrage. I am glad to see that the voices from \nthis government and from all over the world have expressed themselves \nagainst it. But I think it is important for us to express ourselves \nagainst it for another reason. This is a time when Americans in this \nNation have increasingly been asked to turn to international bodies to \nresolve disputes. Let's visit that for a moment because we have \ninternational bodies and we have international conventions that Iran \nhas signed--particularly two. One is the Declaration of Human Rights. \nThey signed it in 1948. The other is the International Covenant of \nCivil and Political Rights. They signed that in 1966. Any nation that \nsigned on to these covenants--any action like this in the courts of \nyour country are unconscionable, illegal. They violate these \nagreements.\n  I hope we will see some action on the part of the United Nations and \nnations such as Russia and China, for example. Of course it would be \ndifficult for China to speak out against oppressing religious \nminorities when they do that quite often in that country as well. But \nthat being said, we are interested in seeing where some of these \ncountries will be on this matter. We are obviously very encouraged that \nthe European Union has spoken about this matter. We would like to see \nsome of these other countries step up. We would like to see the United \nNations take a break from figuring ways to sanction and take on Israel \nand maybe focus a little bit on these sorts of things, where people are \nfacing a hangman's noose because of their religion.\n  By the way, in Iran this sort of thing is not just happening to \nChristians. Not only Christians feel oppressed, but non-Shiite Muslims \nexperience great oppression.\n  But here is the greater point. Beyond this outrage, let me say I \nencourage everyone to pray tonight for the safety of Youcef Nadarkhani \nand his family. We hope this will resolve itself. We hope, in that \nnation and in that Government of Iran, there are reasonable people who \nrealize what an outrage, what an atrocity, what a human rights \nviolation, what a crime it would be for this man not just to be \nsentenced to death but even to be in jail.\n  We should be sorry for the people in Iran. It is hard to believe that \nthe vast\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\nmajority of people in that country agree with us. In fact, they look at \ntheir government and say: You are isolating us from the world.\n  If the people of Iran want to know what it is that is isolating them \nfrom progress in this 21st century, they need to look no further than \nTehran and the people running that government. It is sad because I \nthink, going back to 2009, the evidence is there that especially young \npeople in that country just want to have normal lives and live in a \nnormal country. Instead, their country is being run by individuals who \nthink this sort of thing is OK.\n  By the way, I also point out to leaders in places such as Venezuela \nand other nations of Latin America who so warmly welcome leaders from \nIran when they visit that this is whom you are doing business with. I \nencourage those people in Latin America to turn to their leaders and \nask them: Why do we have a relationship with people like this? Why are \npeople like this being invited to come into our countries and do \nbusiness with us and tour our streets as heroes?\n  This is who they are. Forget the rhetoric, put everything aside, if \nyou want to know what the leadership and Government of Iran is about, \nit is about this. This is who they are. I can think of no other case \nbefore us today with regard to Iran that more clearly outlines the \nmonsters we are dealing with within that government than this case I \nhave outlined.\n  I believe there is a broader conversation to be had about what Iran \nmeans. There is a lot going on in the world, but what is happening in \nIran is important, and Iran's neighbors know it. Whether they will \nadmit it publicly, Iran's neighbors know what a danger that government \nand its vision for the region and the world poses.\n  But I think this case is one we should all speak out about. The eyes \nof the world should be turned to this case. It is an absolute outrage, \nand there is no way in the world we should stand by and allow anyone to \nbe silenced or anyone to be silent, particularly our allies around the \nworld and other countries and members of the so-called international \ncommunity. It is time to step to the plate and condemn these acts \nbecause Youcef Nadarkhani should not--not only should he not be facing \na death sentence, he should not even be in jail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would like to address the Senate on an \namendment I have to the pending legislation, which will be familiar to \nmy colleagues because it is similar to a bipartisan bill Senator \nMenendez of New Jersey and I have introduced, a stand-alone bill. It is \ncalled the Taiwan Airpower Modernization Act of 2011.\n  It does something very simple but very important: It requires the \nUnited States to respond to a request by the Government of Taiwan to \npurchase 66 F-16C/D models of fighter aircraft. Why is this important? \nIt is important for all sorts of reasons, one of which Robert Kaplan \nrecently pointed out in an op-ed in the September 23 edition of the \nWashington Post:\n\n       By 2020, the United States will not be able to defend \n     Taiwan from a Chinese air attack, a 2009 RAND study found, \n     even with America's F-22s, two carrier strike groups in the \n     region and continued access to the Kadena Air Base in \n     Okinawa.\n\n  The United States will not be able to defend Taiwan. So it is very \nimportant that we sell Taiwan, at no taxpayer expense--it is cash money \ncoming from the Taiwanese Government to the United States that happens \nto sustain thousands of jobs right here in America--that we sell them \nthese F-16s so they can defend themselves.\n  Dan Blumenthal, in an October 3, 2011, article published by the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, lists what he calls the top 10 unicorns \nof China policy. He says in the article:\n\n       A unicorn is a beautiful make-believe creature, but despite \n     overwhelming evidence of its fantastical nature, many people \n     still believe in them.\n\n  He lists the top 10 unicorns of U.S.-China policy. The No. 2 unicorn \nrelates to the subject of this amendment, and it is entitled \n``Abandoning Taiwan will remove the biggest obstacle to Sino-American \nrelations.'' In other words, rather than antagonize China, Communist \nChina, by selling 66 F-16C/D models to Taiwan, some might suggest we \nshould withhold and not make that sale, as the Obama administration has \napparently at least decided to do for now, because we do not want to \nantagonize China. If we antagonize China, our relationship will \ndeteriorate. But, as Mr. Blumenthal points out, rather than basking in \nthe recent warming of its relationship with Taiwan, China has picked \nfights with Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and India.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It doesn't matter what obstacles the United States removes, \n     China's foreign policy has its own internal logic that is \n     hard for the United States to shape. Abandoning Taiwan for \n     the sake of better relations is yet another dangerous \n     fantasy.\n\n  As my colleagues may recall, I introduced this amendment earlier on \nthe trade adjustment assistance provisions, the TAA, and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, from Montana, \nquoted Ecclesiastes to make the point that it was not the right time. \nHe said, ``For every thing there is a season.'' He also indicated that \nmy amendment might derail the carefully negotiated bipartisan agreement \non trade assistance. I did not agree with him at that time because my \namendment was related to trade because these F-16s represent an export \nfor the U.S. economy that creates jobs right here at home, in addition \nto its importance for other reasons.\n  But now the reason for that objection no longer exists. The pending \nlegislation is not a carefully negotiated bipartisan agreement. And I \nhope my colleagues who shared my concerns--or shared the concerns the \nchairman of the Finance Committee argued earlier--will find an \nopportunity to support this amendment on the merits today because I \nthink it is very important.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee also argued at the \ntime against my amendment on the TAA bill. He said it was unprecedented \nfor the Congress to force the White House's hand when it comes to \nforeign military sales. The fact is, I remind my colleagues, the Taiwan \nRelations Act that passed and was signed into law in 1979 makes it \nclear that Congress has a very important role to play. The Taiwan \nRelations Act says:\n\n       The President and the Congress shall determine the nature \n     and quantity of such defense articles and services based \n     solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan. . . .\n\n  This is the law of the land.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe the administration's policy when it \ncomes to selling defensive weaponry to Taiwan, that their agreement \nthat we should just upgrade the existing fleet of F-16s is adequate to \nmeet the demands of the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  This chart, taken from Defense Intelligence Agency public materials, \nshows the incredible shrinking Taiwan air force. Taiwan's projected \nfighter fleet over time goes from roughly 400, as part of a total of \n490 combat aircraft. As you can see, the F-5 is an obsolete American \naircraft, basically because of needed repairs, replacement parts, and \nit is basically not dependable anymore. The French Mirage 2000, it is \nestimated, will basically drop off the chart shortly after 2015 or so. \nThen we see the F-16 A/B models, which the administration says we \nshould upgrade, and roughly 150 of those will be basically the \nremaining Taiwan air force, down from a total of roughly 400 fighters \ntoday. Actually, the administration's proposed upgrade will essentially \ntake some of these F-16s offline, a whole squadron of F-16A/Bs, during \nthe retrofitting period, further diminishing the number of aircraft \navailable for Taiwan to defend itself.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act was a responsible decision in response to a \ndecision of the executive branch of the Federal Government that \nCongress happened to disagree with. Congress can disagree with the \nadministration and force the administration's hand when Congress \nbelieves it is appropriate to do so. The Taiwan Relations Act was one \nexample of that. That decision was based on President Carter's \ndiplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China and the \nbreaking of diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\n  Congress had a different view and wanted to make sure the freedom of \nthe Taiwanese people was secure, so we passed bipartisan legislation \nwhich was ultimately signed into law by President Carter.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n  But what is great about the Taiwan Relations Act and the relationship \nof the United States with Taiwan is it has always enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. This is not a partisan issue at all. Here is what \nformer Senator Jesse Helms said about it 20 years after the passage of \nthe Taiwan Relations Act:\n\n       It is a bit of a rarity when an issue comes up that brings \n     Jesse Helms and Ted Kennedy together.\n\n  I never served with Senator Helms. I did serve with Senator Kennedy. \nI can assure you, from what I know about Senator Helms and his record, \nthat was an understatement.\n  He said:\n\n       But this was precisely such an issue. Senator Kennedy, \n     Senator Goldwater, and I--along with Congressman Wolff, \n     Derwinski and others--set out to ensure that after having \n     their treaty of alliance tossed in the trash can, our friends \n     in Taiwan would be left with far more than the vague verbal \n     promises the Carter administration was offering Taiwan. So we \n     went to work and the result was the Taiwan Relations Act.\n\n  I believe my amendment is a natural extension--actually, a \nfulfillment--of the Taiwan Relations Act and a reaffirmation of the \nbipartisan leadership the Senate has brought, which originally brought \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Helms together way back in 1979. We should \nnot depart from that strong bipartisan tradition of supporting our ally \nin Taiwan and providing the defensive weaponry they need in order to \ndefend themselves so the United States will not have to fill that gap.\n  During the debates on the trade assistance authority bill, the \nSenator from Massachusetts and distinguished chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, argued that President Ma of Taiwan is \nhappy with the administration's decision merely to upgrade the existing \nF-16A/B models and not to replace the F-5s and Mirages and other \naircraft that are fast becoming obsolete. The Senator from \nMassachusetts went so far as to say at the time that ``the President of \nTaiwan has said [the approved package] is entirely adequate. He feels \nthey have the defensive capacity necessary under the [Taiwan Relations \nAct] in order to be able to defend themselves at the current level with \nthe upgrade we are providing.''\n  The facts are the government of Taiwan needs both the existing F-16A/\nB models upgraded through this upgrade but also the 66 additional F-\n16C/D aircraft that are the subject of my amendment. To quote Taiwan's \nforeign minister, he said:\n\n       Our government will continue to work closely with the \n     United States to strengthen our national defense and security \n     . . . by urging the United States to continue its arms sales \n     to Taiwan with needed articles and systems for our defensive \n     capabilities . . . including F-16C/D aircrafts and diesel-\n     electric submarines.\n\n  Again, to remind my colleagues, this is a familiar chart from the \nlast time I offered this amendment, which shows the growing imbalance \nof the Taiwan Strait, with China having some 2,300 operational combat \naircraft and Taiwan with 490 operational combat aircraft, including 400 \nfighters, as part of their air force.\n  The fact is we know China doesn't tell the truth when it comes to its \ndefensive and national security expenditures. It shows only a fraction \nof what it spends as it projects power across the world to follow its \neconomic needs and interests.\n  Let me quote the Taiwan defense minister. Earlier I quoted another \nTaiwanese official. Taiwan's defense minister said:\n\n       The F-16A/B fleet upgrade package and the F-16C/D fighters \n     purchase have different needs and purposes. It is not \n     contradictory to have both cases done.\n\n  Last Friday, September 30, a member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, who happens to be of the other party, met with President Ma \nin Taiwan. According to the official press release by the Government of \nTaiwan, President Ma commented that:\n\n       The upgrades of the F-16A/B series aircraft are aimed at \n     extending the life of fighter jets and avoiding a lack of \n     spare parts due to the age of the F-16A/B series. Meanwhile, \n     [Taiwan] wishes to purchase F-16C/D fighter jets to replace \n     its aging fleet of F-5E fighter jets.\n\n  That is in red here, the aging F-5E fighter jets.\n  President Ma explained, ``Therefore, the objectives of the two are \ndifferent.''\n  Let me leave with one final comment. Several of my colleagues have \nargued the Obama administration could approve the sale of the F-16C/D \nseries at a later date, but that is actually not the case. The F-16 \nproduction line recently received a small order from the Air Force of \nIraq to sell Iraq F-16s, but without additional orders the production \nline will soon be shutting down. The people who are working there will \nbe laid off or reassigned other jobs. We are rapidly approaching a \npoint at which the President of the United States will not be able to \napprove the sale of new F-16s because they will not be able to be \nmanufactured because the production line will be shut down. I hope my \ncolleagues will keep this in mind as they consider my amendment.\n  Even if the production line was not an issue, why should we make our \nallies in Taiwan wait? Why would the United States tell our friends to \ncome back later? Well, as I said, the chairman of the Finance Committee \nquoted Ecclesiastes during our last debate. Allow me to conclude with \nsome wise words from Proverbs:\n\n       Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it \n     is in your power to act.\n       Do not say to your neighbor, come back tomorrow, and I'll \n     give it to you when you already have it with you.\n\n  To that, I hope my colleagues would give a hearty amen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the majority \nleader's refusal to bring the Defense authorization bill to the floor. \nOn Monday, the Majority leader came to the floor and acknowledged the \nimportance of bringing the Defense authorization bill forward. He said, \n``It is vital that we get to this bill and pass it.''\n  I could not agree more. That is why it is nothing short of outrageous \nthat the majority leader is blocking this important bill from being \ndebated and passed by the Senate based on misguided objections that the \nadministration has raised to a bipartisan provision in the Defense \nauthorization bill which addresses how we detain and treat terrorists \nwho are captured under the law of war.\n  The American people and our military men and women deserve better. \nThe 2012 National Defense Authorization Act addresses many essential \nissues for our warfighters. I want to mention just a few of the \nimportant measures that the majority leader is blocking from \nconsideration by failing to bring this bill to the floor. The bill \nensures that our warfighters have the weapons they need to win the \nfight, ranging from small arms and ammunition to tactical vehicles to \nsatellites. Some examples include advanced helicopters and \nreconnaissance aircraft, as well as combat loss replacement. It helps \nensure that our soldiers and their families have quality housing. The \nauthorization gives our wounded warriors better access to educational \nopportunities.\n  The bill enhances the deployment cycle support system and \nreintegration for our National Guard and Reserve given how much they \nhave done in sacrificing with the multiple deployments they have \nendured. It strengthens oversight of our taxpayer dollars that are \nbeing used for reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, and it ensures \nthat our money does not continue to be funneled to our enemies.\n  What is so disappointing is that the majority leader is willing to \nprevent passage of the Defense authorization bill, which addresses \nthese essential needs I have talked about for our warfighters and our \nsoldiers, because the Obama administration does not like one provision \nof the bill, the detainee provision of the bill that was passed \noverwhelmingly by Senators from both parties who serve on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  If the majority leader insists on preventing the Defense \nauthorization bill\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\nfrom coming to the floor this year, 2011 would be the first year since \n1960 in which the Congress has not passed the Defense Authorization \nAct. In over 50 years, this would be the first time this bill has not \nbeen passed by this esteemed body.\n  Let me say that again. Here is where we are: in the midst of two \nwars, with our brave sons and daughters, husbands and wives fighting in \nIraq and Afghanistan--and I am the wife of a combat veteran who served \nin Iraq--with our country facing a very serious threat from radical \nIslamist terrorists, this would be the first time in a half century in \nwhich we have not passed the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  It would be shameful to not bring forward the Defense authorization \nbill to the floor and to pass it, after robust debate, where Senators \nfrom both parties can amend it, we can talk about it, and we can let \nthe American people know what is in this bill.\n  I met recently with the sergeant major of the Marine Corps. Sergeant \nMajor Barrett shared with me the stories of several marines serving our \ncountry. I cannot discuss all of them, but I want to give a few \nexamples. One is Sergeant Ramirez, a squad leader assigned to the 1st \nBattalion 5th Marines in Helmand Province in Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Ramirez has a hook as a left hand. In February of 2006 \nSergeant Ramirez lost his hand when he was wounded in action while \nserving in Iraq with the 3rd Battalion 5th Marines. Now he is leading \npatrols in Afghanistan. He wanted to go back and serve our country. \nTalk about bravery. Talk about courage.\n  There is also Sergeant Gill at Quantico and Corporal Pacheco at Camp \nPendleton and thousands of other soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho after being injured on the battlefield have continued to serve \ntheir country. They are doing their jobs with skill and courage in this \n10th year that our country is at war. I just wish we would show half, \neven a quarter of the courage of our military men and women in taking \nup the important issues that need to be addressed to protect our \ncountry, and many of them are addressed in this Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  That is why I am on the floor today. I think it is so important this \nbill be brought forward and we have a debate over it; that we are \nallowed to amend it and allowed to pass it to make sure our military \nmen and women know we are fully behind them.\n  I know the majority leader has said if we just drop the detainee \nprovision in the bill that he would bring forward the Defense \nauthorization bill. But this is not how this body is designed to \noperate. If Senator Reid and the administration do not like the \ndetainee provision in the bill, Senator Reid should move to amend it or \nvote against the bill rather than prevent the entire Defense \nauthorization from being considered. That is how the Senate is supposed \nto operate.\n  Of course, the irony is that in a place where we rarely agree on \nanything, the detainee provision that is holding up this bill the \nadministration has objected to actually received overwhelming support \nin the Armed Services Committee--25 out of 26 members of the Armed \nServices Committee voted for this detainee compromise. That rarely \nhappens around here. I think it shows this was a thoughtful compromise \nand that members of both sides of the aisle worked hard to address this \nimportant issue.\n  This compromise was actually a compromise put together by Chairman \nLevin of the committee, ranking member John McCain of the committee, \nand Senator Lindsey Graham, who also has substantial experience in the \nGuard as a Judge Advocate General attorney.\n  The overall Defense Authorization Act passed out of the Armed \nServices Committee 26 to 0. How often does that happen around here, \nthat every single member of the Armed Services Committee from both \nsides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, and Senator Lieberman an \nIndependent, that we all voted to pass this bill? Yet this bill that is \nso important to our national security and to our warfighters is being \nheld up right now from being considered and brought to the floor.\n\n  In this era of partisanship, the American people want us to work \ntogether, and that is what we did. As a result, not a single member, as \nI mentioned, voted against the final bill. That is not to suggest that \nevery member of the Armed Services Committee got what they wanted in \nthat compromise. I was someone who fought hard in the committee for the \ncompromise to be tougher on terrorists.\n  But I respect that we came together as colleagues to come to this \ncompromise and to move forward on the Defense Authorization Act so it \ncould be brought for full consideration for every Member of the Senate. \nIf the majority leader were to bring this compromise to the Senate \naccording to normal and well-understood procedures, every Member of \nthis Senate, including the majority leader and myself, would have the \nopportunity to debate it, to amend it, and to vote on the Defense \nauthorization bill, including the detainee compromise I just \nreferenced.\n  I may be new around here, but I must ask: Why isn't the majority \nleader bringing this forward? I know he is clearly doing the \nadministration's bidding on these detainee issues. But why would he \nprevent the American people from hearing this important debate? Why \nwould giving terrorists greater rights to our civilian detention and \ncourt system, which seems to be the administration's position, be more \nimportant than ensuring that our warfighters have the right weapons and \nequipment, or ensuring that our wounded warriors get better access to \neducational opportunities, and all of the other important issues that \nare addressed in the Defense authorization bill related to both our \nnational security and to our warfighters?\n  I believe those issues deserve to be addressed by debating and \npassing this bill. I also believe the American people deserve to know \nall of the facts about where we are with respect to our detention \npolicy with terrorists.\n  I have to tell you, as a new member of the Armed Services Committee \nduring the last 8 months and having our military leaders come before \nthat committee, when I have asked them about our detention policy and \nhow we are treating terrorists we have captured, how we are gathering \nintelligence from them, what we are doing to protect the American \npeople, I have been shocked to learn that 27 percent of the terrorists \nwe have released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility have \nactually returned to the battle or we suspect have returned to the \nbattle to harm us and our allies.\n  Too many former Guantanamo Bay detainees are now actively engaged in \nterrorist activities and are trying to kill Americans. Former \nGuantanamo detainees are conducting suicide bombings, recruiting \nradicals, and training them to kill Americans and our allies. Said al-\nShihri and Abdul Zakir represent two examples of former Guantanamo \ndetainees who have returned to the fight and have assumed leadership \npositions in terrorist organizations that are dedicated to killing \nAmericans and our allies.\n  Said al Shihri has worked as the No. 2 in al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula. Abdul Zakir now serves as a top Taliban military commander \nand a senior leader in the Taliban Quetta Shura.\n  Can you imagine having to tell a mom or a dad that their son or \ndaughter was killed in Afghanistan by a terrorist whom we released from \nGuantanamo Bay?\n  Given the facts, I understand why the majority leader and the Obama \nadministration don't want to talk about our detention policy, but as \nJohn Adams said, facts are stubborn things. The American people deserve \nto hear this debate and to have us address this issue through the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  Under our Constitution, we have a fundamental duty to protect the \nAmerican people and to provide for our warfighters.\n  We owe it to our military men and women to take up the Defense \nAuthorization Act right now. Majority Leader Reid, as the leader of \nthis esteemed body, should allow that to happen so we can fulfill our \nresponsibility to the American people.\n  Let me conclude by urging the majority leader to bring the defense \nauthorization bill forward for debate, for amendment, and for passage. \nIn the midst of two wars, it is time Congress does its job and provides \nfor our warfighters and their needs.\n  Sergeant Ramirez, Sergeant Gill and Corporal Pacheco and the \nthousands of\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\nother soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen of our All-Volunteer Force \ndeserve no less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise, first, to thank my \ncolleagues, including the Presiding Officer, for supporting cloture \ntoday. It is the second major step in this body, passing the largest \nbipartisan jobs bill we have seen in this body in years. The bipartisan \njobs bill has the potential to create or save around 2 million jobs, \nwithout cost to taxpayers, because it is simply standing up for \nAmerican companies and American workers. For a change, we put American \nworkers and American manufacturers first.\n  It is important to, for a moment, consider how we got here. This \neffort did not begin this week or even this year. Efforts to combat \nChinese currency manipulation have been underway for over half a \ndecade. It began in earnest around 2005. Since then, the situation has \ngrown worse for workers and businesses. In 2005, there was an intense \ndebate inside the National Association of Manufacturers, which was \nrepresenting a whole range of American manufacturers, from the small \ntool and die shop in Akron to the medium-size manufacturing company in \nToledo, to GM, Ford, and other huge manufacturers. The division was \nsmaller companies, generally--not in every case, of course, but smaller \ncompanies generally supported taking action against currency \nmanipulation with China. Larger companies, many of which had already \noutsourced production to China, generally were opposed to standing up \nto the Chinese. That was because the Chinese are well known for \npunishing companies that are doing business in China if those companies \nactually criticize the Chinese Communist Party Government.\n  So it was an interesting, if unholy, alliance between some of \nAmerica's greatest, best known, largest, longest existing companies. \nThere was an unholy alliance between them and the Communist Party of \nChina--something that would have made, perhaps, Henry Ford turn over in \nhis grave. Nonetheless, that is what happened. Some of these companies \nactually left the organization--the smaller ones--because the larger \ncompanies dominated an organization like that. They paid the biggest \ndues and are the most influential people in the country. Some of the \nsmaller companies left partly because they have to stay in a community \nand do their manufacturing and supply components to companies that \noutsourced these jobs.\n  What is interesting--and we have talked about this--it has become \nalmost--not almost, it has become a business plan, perhaps \nunprecedented in world history, where a large number of companies in \none country--this country, the United States--shut down production in \nSteubenville or Springfield and moved production to Wuhan or Xi'an, \nChina, and sell the goods back to the United States. So it is a \nbusiness plan for many companies to shut down production here, move \noverseas, and sell the product back. To my knowledge, that has never \nhappened the way it has in this country in the last dozen years, since \npermanent normal trade relations was approved here to set the stage for \nChina's entry into the WTO.\n  I remember--and the Presiding Officer was in the House when I was--\nwhen that debate happened in 1999 and 2000. What I remember is, the \nlargest corporations in America were--the CEOs were walking the Halls \nof Congress and doing the bidding of the Communist Party of China, the \nPeople's Republic of China, and they were saying that putting China in \nthe WTO would mean China would follow the rule of law. They also said \nthey couldn't wait until they could get access to 1 billion Chinese \nconsumers, although 5 years later it was apparent they wanted access to \n1 billion Chinese workers. But the whole idea of putting China in the \nWTO was to have them live under the rule of law and practice trade \nunder the rule of law, and that is what we have not seen. We have \nsimply not seen the Chinese follow the rule of law.\n\n  That is why so many economists, including Republican economists and \nDemocratic economists, and including some economists who worked for \nPresident Reagan and some economists who worked for President Clinton \nand President Obama--the ones who are looking at sort of an expansive \nworld--say things like Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute--a \npretty much pro-free-trade, middle-of-the-road organization--who said:\n\n       Some American corporations will fret that these actions--\n\n  These actions meaning regulations on dealing with this currency \nissue, as our bill does--\n\n     that these actions would needlessly antagonize the Chinese \n     and threaten a trade war. I believe these fears are \n     overblown. The real threat to the world trading system is in \n     fact the protectionist policies, including undervalued \n     currencies of other countries, and the vast trade imbalances \n     that result.\n\n  And Bergsten went on to say:\n\n       Not since World War II have we seen a country practice \n     protectionism to the degree the People's Republic of China \n     does.\n\n  We were talking earlier about the split in the National Association \nof Manufacturers--and I am not making too much of it. Most companies \ndidn't leave. But some of the smaller companies, which may or may not \nhave left, have suffered greatly during the gaming of the currency \nsystem.\n  Let me cite one example: the Bennett brothers' Automation Tool & Die \nin Brunswick, OH, a city about 25 miles outside of Cleveland. The \nBennett brothers run this tool-and-die shop, Automation Tool & Die, and \nthey had a $1 million contract they thought they were about to sign \nwith a new customer. The Chinese came in at the last minute with a bid \n20 percent under their bid. That meant I don't know how many jobs that \ndidn't stay in America but went to China, and that 20 percent was given \nto them because of currency.\n  As Senator Merkley said on the Senate floor yesterday, this currency \nadvantage given to the Chinese because they purposely keep their \ncurrency devalued means when we sell products made in our country--made \nin Whirlicote, OH--to China, they have, in effect, a 25-, 30-, 35-\npercent tariff because of the currency undervaluation. When the Chinese \nsell a product into Chillicothe, OH, they get a 25-percent bonus or \nsubsidy--25 or 30 percent. So that is why we have seen this huge trade \ndeficit grow by multiples of something like three or four times.\n  Last week, there was a column by the former president of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Jerry Jasinowski. He was president during \nthe time of this debate in 2005. He has watched as members struggle \nwith this disadvantage of the currency manipulation. He wrote this week \nthat Congress is ``belatedly stepping up to the plate on China's \ncurrency manipulation.'' He called this currency manipulation ``an \nassault on U.S. manufacturing'' that is ``having a deadly impact on the \noverall economy.''\n  Because these companies have lived with this, more than 300 companies \nhave signed a petition in support of this legislation according to the \nCoalition for a Prosperous America. We can see companies such as McAfee \nTool & Die in Ohio, and we highlighted some of the ones in different \nSenators' States and lots of national organizations, lots of State and \nlocal organizations, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of \ncompanies are supporting this because they know--and all kinds of \norganizations know--this isn't working for American companies. It is \nnot working for American manufacturing. It is not working for American \ncommunities or American workers.\n  I had mentioned what happened up until 2005. In 2007, Senator \nStabenow of Michigan, a Democrat; Senator Snowe, a Republican from \nMaine; Senator Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia; and Senator \nBunning, a Republican from Kentucky--of those four, only Senator \nBunning has left the Senate--created the Fair Currency Coalition, which \npulled together manufacturers and labor united to address a serious \nproblem. We can see some of those here.\n  In the 111th Congress, the Senate introduced several bipartisan \nbills. Senator Snowe and I worked this year on countervailing duties, \nlegislation similar to what the House of Representatives passed, \nproviding industries a remedy when it comes to imports that are proven \nto be subsidized by currency manipulation. Since then the Senate \ncombined Senator Snowe's and my bill with that of Senator Schumer and \nSenator Graham into the bipartisan legislation we have today.\n  This bipartisan legislation is a no-cost job creator. In fact, it is \nbetter\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\nthan that because when we have the biggest bipartisan jobs bill--\npassing overwhelmingly 62 to 38 today, with some party leaders trying \nto block it but still passing 62 to 38--increasing jobs, particularly \nif we are not spending money doing it, we are obviously saving on the \nbudget deficit.\n  The Economic Policy Institute says this is more than job creating, \nand it will create more than 1 million jobs. If we have 1 million \npeople going back to work, that means 1 million people who aren't \ndrawing unemployment benefits, who aren't filing for food stamps, and \nwho aren't getting any other kinds of subsidies. They are working and \npaying taxes, and that, obviously, is why we can't cut our way to \nprosperity. We have to grow our way to prosperity and grow our way to a \nmore balanced budget.\n  So that is what this is all about. And I would quote a couple of \nother people--Republicans. David Camp, the Republican chairman of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, who has supported this measure in the \npast, said the bill doesn't ``presuppose an outcome,'' but sends ``a \nclear signal to China that Congress' patience is running out, without \ngiving China an excuse to take it out on U.S. companies and workers.''\n  Mitt Romney, Presidential candidate, Republican, former Governor of \nMassachusetts, said taking action to remove protectionist market \ndistortions wouldn't result in a ``trade war,'' but failing to act will \nmean the United States has accepted ``trade surrender.''\n  That is exactly the point because the strongest objection to this \nbill and the most frequent and compelling argument from, apparently, \nthe three Democrats and the, I guess, roughly three dozen Republicans \nwho opposed the vote a couple of hours ago is that this bill declares a \ntrade war; that it would lead to some kind of trade war.\n  I first want to remind everybody listening that the United States is \nalready in a trade war. When we see the trade deficit in 10 years \ntriple with a country that is not playing by the rules, it is pretty \nclear there is a trade war going on, and they are winning in so many \nways because we are buying so much from them, and they are buying so \nlittle from us. Yes, our exports have increased over the last 10 years, \nbut only marginally. Our imports from China are just growing much more \nrapidly.\n  In the end, common sense says the Chinese aren't going to initiate a \ntrade war. You don't initiate a trade war if you are China--they might \nthreaten to--because we are their biggest customer. One-third of \nChinese exports come to the United States. They have way more to lose \nthan we do if they initiate a trade war.\n  We can predict it, like we can predict the Sun will come up. Whenever \nwe stand up to the Chinese--when President Clinton or President Bush or \nPresident Obama would sort of do a start-and-stop in standing up to the \nChinese, and then back down--the last President to enforce trade law \nwell was Ronald Reagan. President Obama has done it marginally well, \nbut the other Presidents haven't done it much at all. But whenever we \nact like we are going to do that, it is so predictable what the Chinese \nGovernment will say: Trade war. Trade war. Then some Members of the \nSenate will stand up and say: Trade war. Trade war. But just because \nthe Chinese say there is going to be a trade war, they always bluster \nlike that.\n\n  So as certain as the Sun was going to come up on Tuesday morning \nafter the vote Monday night--which was 79 to 19--the People's Bank of \nChina, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce--like \nall birds flying off a telephone wire when one bird does--said this is \nprotectionism, this is a trade war, and all the kinds of things they \nsay. But just because they say it isn't necessarily what they are going \nto do. They want us to believe they are going to do that because far \ntoo often American politicians--Presidents especially--will back down.\n  This bill will begin to help us do what we should be doing in this \ncountry, and that is following--as the Presiding Officer has said so \nmany times before and fought for--real manufacturing policy. Thirty \nyears ago, in the early 1980s, between 25 and 30 percent of our gross \ndomestic product was manufacturing. Today it is only about 11 percent. \nThose manufacturing jobs created an awful lot of middle-class families \nin Garfield Heights, OH, and in Norwood, OH, and in Grove City, OH. \nToday a lot of those families struggle because they have lost their \n$14-, $15-, $18-, and $20-an-hour job making things. Instead, they are \nworking in a service industry, which never pays as much and never has \nthe spinoff effect of job creation that a good manufacturing job has.\n  So I am thrilled about this vote today. What makes me even more \nexcited is I think it is the beginning of the United States having a \nmore coherent manufacturing strategy. We are the only wealthy country \nin the world that doesn't have a manufacturing strategy. While all of \nour trade competitors practice trade according to their national \ninterests, we practice trade according to a college textbook that is 20 \nyears out of print.\n  I am hopeful those days are behind us, and I especially thank Senator \nGraham and Senator Sessions for their stance and making a difference on \nthis vote today. I think this is the beginning of something much better \nfor our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time is being divided now or is it \ndivided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 1 hour under cloture.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use \nunder the 1 hour, and I will not use all that, by any means.\n  Mr. President, this is obviously an issue that is more complicated \nthan the debate may have indicated--at all moments, at least. I think \nthere are complicated and longstanding frustrations that have built up \nwith a lot of Senators and a lot of people in America that bring us \nhere to this moment on the Senate floor.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have a reluctance \nto see us engage in an effort that I think can put other interests at \nrisk in certain ways. On the other hand, I have voted to allow and help \nthis legislation to reach the point of postcloture because I think it \nis an important debate and because I think China needs to carefully \nthink about the process and the substance of what people are saying on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  This is a very complicated relationship, with enormous interests on \nboth sides, and we need to avoid a confrontation in a lot of different \nways. There are a lot of different kinds of confrontations--trade, \nphysical confrontation in the South China Sea and the straits and \nelsewhere, confrontations over human rights in Tibet--and there are a \nlot of issues at play. But with respect to the trade issue, China has a \nhuge interest in the United States being able to export more \neffectively to China.\n  China has an interest in its middle class growing in its purchasing \npower and expressing that purchasing power through consumption. One of \nthe things China needs is its own higher level of domestic consumption. \nIt is saving too much. One of the reasons it saves too much is it \ndoesn't have a safety net structure of any kind, really, so people do \nsave. That is the nature of life there. But at the same time, I think \nChina is seeing a slowdown of its own economy now. One of the reasons \nfor the slowdown in China's economy is the fact that we have had a \nslowdown in our economy and our ability to consume, and the American \nconsumer is paying off debt, wisely, and consuming less of the goods \nbrought in from China. So it all is interconnected.\n\n  China is also our biggest banker. China is critical to our ability to \ndeal with our current economic challenge in many ways--and Europe's, I \nmight add. Both Europe and the United States would benefit \nsignificantly with a new trade relationship with China.\n  That is what I want to talk about for a moment. I believe in trade. I \nhave supported trade here. I don't believe in unequal trade. I don't \nbelieve in unfair trade. I believe in enforcing the agreements we have. \nIf you look at NAFTA, for instance, NAFTA had side agreements--side \nagreements on the environment, side agreements on labor standards--and \nthey were never enforced. People have a right to be angry if they see \nan agreement that is made and then parts of it are enforced, parts of \nit are not, and they see their jobs go\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\noverseas, whether it is from North Carolina or Georgia or Massachusetts \nor Ohio or any other place in our country. So I think it is important \nto have trade that is fair and sensible.\n  You are not going to grow your economy trading with yourself--no \nway--particularly if your overall population growth isn't growing that \nfast and you are a mature economy. Economics just doesn't work that \nway. You need newer markets and other places to expand. So I believe it \nis important for us to recognize that the world's trading system only \nworks if the participants treat each other fairly.\n  Over the last decade, our national debate on the costs and benefits \nof trade has intensified, and, frankly, the uneasy alliance, the uneasy \nconsensus that had been created from the 1980s forward with respect to \ntrade is being frayed right now, is being frayed for understandable and \nclearly definable reasons.\n  The American worker is not seeing their wages go up. There are a lot \nof reasons for that: the unfairness of our Tax Code, the inability of \npeople in America today to be able to bargain the way they used to, the \nlack of an NLRB and a court that uphold the rights of labor to be able \nto negotiate--a whole bunch of reasons people are disadvantaged today. \nOne of them is the fact that you have this unfair competition.\n  In order to keep the consensus that allows Americans to say: Yes, \ntrade is a good thing, it has to be a good thing. And to be a good \nthing, it has to be fair and it has to result in people's lives being \nimproved by it, meaning their wages go up, their job gets better, and \ntheir opportunities are better. But everything has been working in the \nopposite direction. I think that is why so many of our colleagues feel \na responsibility to come to the floor on this legislation and make sure \nthat China and others hear from the American people loudly and clearly.\n  We did this before on a vote we took on currency legislation back in \n2005. I think China heard us then, and China began slowly to allow the \nvalue of its currency to begin to fluctuate rather than keeping it \npegged tightly to the dollar.\n  China has taken measures. In fairness, China's currency has \nappreciated over the course of the last few years. Some argue exactly \nhow much--somewhere in the vicinity of 27 percent, maybe 7 percent the \nlast year--but it is not fast enough, and it is still not fair enough. \nAnd the fact is that there are other Chinese trade tactics that \ncontribute to our increasing trade deficit with China, not just \ncurrency.\n  Unfortunately, our efforts through multilateral institutions--nobody \ncan point a finger at the United States and suggest that we haven't \nplayed by the rules or that we haven't gone to the global institutions \nin order to try to resolve these differences. We have gone to the World \nTrade Organization, and we have won, step by step, slowly but surely. \nBut if your tactic is to just keep in this highly mercantilistic, \nfocused strategy of China's to just keep on pushing, take advantage of \neverything you can, and you get a little nibble against you here and \nthere at the WTO, a little nibble over there, that is really just an \ninconvenience on the road to a kind of trade domination that is bad for \neverybody.\n  That is why I am here today. That is why I have voted for this \nlegislation to come to the floor, to have this debate. This debate is \nan imperfect stand-in for the broader discussion we need to have about \nour economic relationship with China. The truth is that our bilateral \nrelationship is both filled with promise and plagued by complex \nchallenges we have to overcome for the good of both countries.\n  The Chinese market is a huge and growing opportunity for American \nfirms, obviously. Despite the hurdles to entry--and there are hurdles--\nChina is still our fastest growing export market today. People had \nbetter think about this as we go forward.\n  I am convinced that the key to America pulling itself out of this \neconomic challenge we are in today and the key to Europe pulling itself \nout is for the United States and Europe to actually work out, almost \nformally, a new and better relationship with respect to trade with \nChina, as well as with the other fast-developing countries--Mexico, \nSouth Korea, Brazil, India--because if those societies will allow us \nadequate entry to market and if those societies will purchase more from \nEurope and the United States, then we will export more, manufacture \nmore, and come out of the economic doldrums. That reverberates to \nChina's benefit, also, because their investments in the United States \nbecome more secure, because our debt goes down, because we have a \nstronger economy, and because we are purchasing more in return from \nthem. What goes around comes around.\n  My hope is that we can agree on fair terms and conditions for trade \nwith these rising powers. If we do, we will create jobs. That is the \nfastest way we have to create jobs and pull out of our economic \ndoldrums today. The simplest, fastest, most obvious way to do this is \nto be able to access those other markets rapidly with American goods \nand begin to restore confidence to the marketplace so that people \nbelieve they will get a larger return on their investment and begin to \nreinvest in job creation and in the marketplace.\n  The current trade model we are operating under with massive U.S. \ntrade deficits and enormous Chinese trade surpluses is not only unfair, \nit is unsustainable. So we have to rebalance that relationship. And \nChina's own leaders need to understand that their country's long-term \neconomic health absolutely cannot rest on a foundation of subsidized \nexports fueled by an indebted American consumer and the credit card of \nthe American consumer. That is a deathly unvirtuous--to use our former \nFed Chairman's comments about virtuous and unvirtuous cycles, it is \nabout as unvirtuous as you can get in that economic relationship.\n  Now, conflict, in my judgment, is not the best way to resolve our \ntensions. Making clear how we feel and what we think the reality is and \nwhat is important in our relationship is critical.\n  Some of our colleagues have come to the floor to argue that our two \ncountries are already in a trade war. Others have come to the floor to \nsay this bill is going to trigger one. I don't agree with either view. \nI don't think either one of those views is correct.\n  If we were in a real trade war with our largest lender, let me tell \nyou, they would be doing a heck of a lot more damage than the \nmisalignment of currency is currently doing to us.\n  The specific remedy proposed in this legislation is neither as \ndramatic nor as offensive as some people have said. This is a pretty \ncarefully structured piece of legislation, and I think the language has \nbeen chosen in a thoughtful way and the remedies that are available \nunder this bill are not as dramatic as some would suggest. It doesn't \npropose raising tariffs on all Chinese goods. It only proposes \nincreasing tariffs on those Chinese goods that receive an unfair \nadvantage from an undervalued currency and then compete with American-\nmade goods here in the United States. It is a pretty limited and \ntargeted message. And that is within our rights. If the yuan is \nproperly valued, that will simply not be necessary. That is China's \ndecision, China's choice.\n\n  I would much prefer a negotiated, multilateral solution, as I \ndescribed, involving this new relationship, a new trade relationship on \na global basis, which I think would send an extraordinary message to a \nbeleaguered Europe, where Greece, as we all know, is basically \nfundamentally insolvent, needing some kind of a managed, structured \ntransition hopefully that avoids a greater crisis in Italy and Spain \nand contagion in their banking system, which clearly needs \nrecapitalization, clearly needs more than the $440 billion that was put \non the table, clearly needs some kind of a rescue fund with some very \ntight kinds of requirements not dissimilar to what we did in the United \nStates in 2008 and 2009 out of sheer necessity. My hope is they will do \nthat.\n  Nothing would do more to send a message of confidence about the \nfuture of job growth than to have this new trade understanding and \nrelationship where responsible partners are behaving responsibly and \naccepting responsibility for the global marketplace in which we all \noperate, not just exploit it but support it, protect it, nurture it.\n  Beyond the currency, there are many other sources of tension in our \neconomic relationship, and they need to be resolved. China does not \nprotect adequately our intellectual property in its\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nmarket. That is almost a euphemism. The violations of intellectual \nproperty rights, the outright theft in some streets and communities \nwithin China of billions of dollars of American designed and marketed \nand developed property is shocking. In addition to that, China imposes \nartificial regulatory barriers to the entry of many of our goods. It \nfails to crack down on cyber attacks, and it has executed a thinly \nveiled effort to appropriate key foreign technologies. On each of these \nissues, and others, we have been going to the WTO, we have been \nbringing cases, and we have been winning those cases. As I have said, \nthat is not a substitute for this larger fix in the relationship that \nis critical.\n  I believe overcoming market access challenges is actually where we \nought to be focusing our efforts in China and also in the other large, \nfast-growing markets. That, as I have said several times, is really the \nanswer--the quick answer, if you will. We can develop goods and we can \ninvest in companies here, but if we can't sell the goods to more than \nourselves, we have some serious limits on us. It is important for us to \nbe fighting for that market access.\n  I believe that to increase our exports, we are going to have to \nincrease our competitiveness at home and we are going to have to \nconvince our partners to lower their tariffs, remove discriminatory \nregulatory restrictions on our exporters, protect intellectual \nproperty, use scientific standards as the basis for allowing our \nagricultural goods to enter, and recognize that trade in services is \nbecoming as important to the modern economy as trade in goods. We need \nto make the case that doing all of these things is not to the advantage \nof one country or another, it is to all of our shared advantage because \nof the nature of the global marketplace in which we live.\n  Countries such as China, India, and Brazil are stakeholders. Whether \nor not they want to admit it publicly, they are stakeholders in the \nWest's economic success. They need access to our customers. They need \naccess to our investors. They want to make deals over here. They want \nto be in joint ventures. They want to own companies. And their \nbusinesses and citizens will benefit from strong, sustainable growth in \nthe world's largest economies.\n  China is an important partner of the United States in a lot of ways. \nIt is also a major investor in the United States. So I don't think we \nare here to rupture that relationship; I think we are here to send a \nmessage to the Chinese about the urgent need to repair it. We want a \nmutually beneficial relationship, an equitable partnership that will \npay dividends for both countries. And I believe, if we listen to each \nother and work in good faith, we can make that happen and we can enter \ninto a better framework of cooperation that inures to the benefits and \nthe security and the stability and the leadership demands of both of \nour countries.\n  We both sit on the Security Council of the United Nations. We both \nhave remarkable responsibilities through our economic power. We are \nstill the largest economy on the face of this planet, maybe three times \nlarger than China--still, even as China is growing. China will surpass \nus. With that reality of where China stands today economically comes \nmajor responsibility. No country has exercised that responsibility \nthrough all the last century and into this century with a greater sense \nof purpose and responsibility than the United States. Hopefully, China \nwill embrace the notion that its new economic power brings with it that \nsame shared responsibility. I hope we can engage in the creation of \nthat kind of mutually beneficial relationship.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                              Jobs Crisis\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our Nation's jobs \ncrisis. This is a crisis that is real and it is a crisis that is not \ngoing to be addressed by the bill currently being considered by this \nbody. It is not a crisis that is going to be solved by more tax \nincreases, as some would have it. It is a crisis that will be solved \nwhen Congress creates the conditions for job creation by giving greater \ncertainty to businesses and individuals and liberating them to take \nrisks.\n  Americans are more than uneasy about our current jobs deficit. The \nfailure of this economy to create jobs is the single most important \nissue to the citizens of this country. For years now, whenever I have \ntalked to my fellow Utahns about the economy, their No. 1 concern has \nbeen jobs. Throughout the country, particularly in those places that \nare worse off than my own home State, I am quite certain people have \nthe exact, same concern.\n  We have had more than our fair share of posturing on job creation in \nWashington. We heard a speech to a joint session of Congress from the \nPresident, wherein he demanded passage of this jobs bill. Of course, \nthe President's bill has no real chance of passing in either Chamber of \nCongress. Indeed, Members of the Senate Democratic leadership have been \nquoted publicly as saying they don't even believe enough Democrats \nwould vote for the bill to pass it in the Senate, with or without a \nfilibuster.\n  But not all hope is lost. Members of both parties agree we need to \npass a jobs package of some kind. The American people demand it and I \nbelieve Congress can deliver. However, I am not under any illusions. \nThis will be a difficult task, and it will require Congress to \nrecognize some hard truths and to make some difficult decisions. But if \nwe are serious about job creation and not just about campaigning on job \ncreation next year, that is what we are going to have to do.\n  It will not be enough to simply pass legislation that will stimulate \nthe economy in the short term. We have tried short-term stimulus time \nafter time again and it does not work. One of the President's first \nacts after his inauguration was to promote and sign a partisan big \nspending stimulus package. It did not work then and it is not going to \nwork now. What we need to do is change the economic environment in \nAmerica to make it more jobs friendly, to change incentives to allow \nfor long sustained job growth.\n  As I said, it will not be easy, but I believe it is doable because, \nfrankly, there are things we should have been doing all along that will \ncreate more jobs and prevent more job losses in the future.\n  That is what I wish to talk about. I want to unveil my own jobs \nproposal. It is a comprehensive, 10-point plan that I believe \nencapsulates much of what we should be doing to create more jobs in \nAmerica. I wish to take just a few moments to talk about each of the 10 \npoints in my jobs plan.\n  No. 1, we need to restore fiscal sanity in Washington. Our Nation's \n$14 trillion debt is an anchor around the neck of every American and a \nthreat to our economic growth and job creation in the future. Congress \nmust take meaningful steps to reduce our debt and get America's fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  This is something my friends on the other side of the aisle do not \nseem to get--debt and deficit reduction is a jobs issue. The failure to \nget this spending under control led to a downgrade of our Nation's \ncredit rating, an action that will impact our interest rates and impede \njob growth. The failure to get spending under control and the constant \nthreat from the other side of higher taxes to pay for this historically \nlarge government keeps businesses on the sideline and discourages risk-\ntaking. The failure to get spending under control crowds out the types \nof investments in national defense and infrastructure that actually \nhave some impact on jobs. Reining in spending should be our highest \npriority.\n  Given the fights we have had over spending in the last year, this \ngoal may seem to some to be out of reach, but I am optimistic. I expect \nsome success from the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction that is \ncurrently working on finding significant savings and currently trying \nto find a way out of our problems. Members of both parties are on \nrecord supporting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich would ensure greater fiscal discipline in the long run. This is a \nvital element to securing economic growth and job creation in the \nfuture, and we need to act now. As the ranking member on the Senate's \nFinance Committee, I am committed to working with my colleagues there \nto achieve meaningful reform of our Nation's largest spending programs.\n  No. 2, we need to expand markets for U.S. exports by approving the \npending\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\nthree free-trade agreements and renewing trade promotion authority. \nEvery President has wanted that except this one. Congress waited far \ntoo long for the President to send the pending trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea, which would increase U.S. exports by \n$13 billion and create more than 70,000 domestic jobs. Some estimate \neven higher than 250,000 jobs. Unfortunately, in delaying submission of \nthese agreements, the President prioritized his anti-trade union allies \nat the expense of the American workers who stood to benefit from their \npassage. Now that these agreements are before Congress, we need to \nratify them promptly. However, we also need to move forward with a \nrobust trade agenda for the future.\n  Unfortunately, by refusing to seek renewal of trade promotion \nauthority, the President is undercutting our Nation's ability to \nrealize these new trade agreements.\n  No. 3, we need to reform our Nation's Tax Code to allow American \nbusinesses to compete with foreign competitors on a level playing \nfield. Rooted in a bygone era, the U.S. Tax Code is antiquated, \nimpeding our economic recovery and slowing job growth. Our tax system \nis too burdensome, it is too inefficient. Fundamental tax reform will \nallow both individuals and businesses to focus their efforts on their \nfamilies and businesses instead of tax compliance. There is bipartisan \nagreement on the need to fix our Tax Code and if the President and his \nparty will agree that the goal of tax reform should be job creation and \neconomic growth rather than raising taxes, I think progress can be \nmade.\n  No. 4, we need to repeal ObamaCare. I am certain my Democratic \ncolleagues will write this proposal off as blind partisanship, but to \nparaphrase President Obama: This is not partisanship, it is math. \nObamaCare's unconstitutional individual health care mandate will result \nin a $2,100 increase in premiums for families buying insurance on their \nown. Rather than saving money, ObamaCare is costing individuals and \nStates more money, including $118 billion in new costs imposed on \nStates for Medicaid expansions, meaning that our States will have to \ncut other programs such as education or law enforcement to pay for this \nunfunded mandate. Additionally, ObamaCare will result in over $1 \ntrillion in new taxes and penalties over a 10-year period once it is \nfully implemented in 2014, while still increasing the deficit by $701 \nbillion during that same time.\n\n  Collectively, the various provisions included in ObamaCare will \ncontinue to hinder job creation and industry innovation by mandating \nthe imposition of anti-industry burdens such as a 2.3-percent excise \ntax hike on medical device manufacturers that could result in job \nlosses of over 10 percent of the device industry workforce. That is \nnearly 43,000 potential lost jobs. Some experts have calculated that \nnearly 800,000 jobs could potentially be lost as a result of full \nimplementation of all of ObamaCare's provisions.\n  Clearly, calls to repeal ObamaCare are more than political \nblustering. It is simply a necessary step forward toward job creation.\n  No. 5, we need to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act. Again, it would be easy \nfor our friends on the other side to write off this proposal as just \npartisan posturing, but facts are facts. American companies and small \nbusiness owners are paralyzed by the excesses of the Dodd-Frank Act \nwhich has created massive new bureaucracies, imposed job-killing \nmandates, and heaped upon American businesses a slew of regulations \nthat are choking off job opportunities for Americans. Dodd-Frank is \nleading to reductions in the availability of credit to American \nfamilies and businesses and increases in the cost of credit to those \nwho are able to borrow. The price controls required by Dodd-Frank and \nby the Dodd-Frank interchange amendment are a case in point of what \nhappens when government wades carelessly into the economy.\n  I don't know why it came as a surprise to anyone that the price \ncontrols imposed by the interchange agreement, drying up a revenue \nstream for banks, would require new fees on consumers. Yet I doubt the \nannouncement that banks are eliminating free checking and increasing \ndebit card fees, a direct result of the interchange amendment, will \nresult in a long look in the mirror for those responsible for this \nregulation. Rather, the favored response will no doubt be more \nregulation. It is essential that we repeal this fundamentally flawed \nlaw to unleash the full potential of the American economy by unfreezing \nmuch needed credit for small businesses as well as stripping away new \nlayers of burdensome and ineffective regulations.\n  By the way, I have not mentioned Sarbanes-Oxley, which is adding \naccounting costs and other costs so astronomical to small business that \nmany of them are not able to hire, they are not able to accomplish what \nthey want to accomplish, and it has stalled our economy. That doesn't \nmean we don't need some regulations, but these bills have gone way to \nthe excess.\n  No. 6, we need to make our regulatory system more jobs friendly. \nAmerica's regulatory system is out of control. Time and again, \nunelected Washington bureaucrats erect walls of redtape that place \nsignificant burdens on the job creators. Far too often, businesses are \nforced to spend time and resources trying to comply with unnecessary \nFederal rules and regulations rather than on growth and development. \nWith unemployment at over 9 percent, Congress needs to ensure that \npolicies pursued by Federal agencies make it easier for businesses to \nhire and do what is necessary to be able to compete globally. There is \nbipartisan support for this idea. President Obama has proposed \nrequiring regulators to perform a cost-benefit analysis in drafting new \nregulations. This requirement should be set by statute and should apply \nto all Federal agencies.\n  In addition, Congress should have greater influence in the regulatory \nprocess and should pass legislation such as the REINS Act, S. 299, \nwhich would, among other things, require Federal agencies to obtain \ncongressional approval for regulations that will have significant \neconomic impact.\n  No. 7, we need to develop America's energy resources. In the United \nStates, energy is produced by private industry. Yet most energy \nresources are controlled by the Federal Government. The Obama \nadministration has aggressively withdrawn access to Federal energy \nresources and has stalled or proscribed countless domestic energy \nprojects sought by industry. This willful inaction by our President has \ncost Americans hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. It has also \ncost our Federal and State governments billions of dollars in lost \nrevenues from Federal energy royalties which they share. A recent Wood \nMackenzie study found that if our Nation were permitted to allow more \ndomestic energy production in the next two decades, an additional 1.4 \nmillion jobs would result and Federal and State governments would enjoy \nmore than $800 billion in additional revenue. According to the study, \nit would mean more than 40,000 new jobs in Utah alone.\n  I have worked with my colleagues, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana \nand Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, on two legislative proposals that \nwould reverse the President's attacks on domestic energy production. \nThe 3-D, Domestic Jobs, Domestic Energy, and Deficit Reduction Act, \nthat is S. 706, and the American Energy and Western Jobs Act, S. 1027, \nwill get America back in the business of producing its own energy, \ncreating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and billions in new revenue \nfor Federal and State governments.\n  No. 8, we need to help America compete by protecting and encouraging \ninnovation. We must modernize and make permanent research and \ndevelopment, the R tax credit to help keep America on the leading \nedge of technological innovation.\n  The United States once led the world in research and development \nincentives when we created the R credit back in 1981. However, in the \nyears since other countries have responded with their own incentives, \nand now we rank 17th behind many of our global competitors. Senator \nBaucus and I have been the prime sponsors of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit over the years. In order to provide a more level \nplaying field for American companies that compete in the global \nmarketplace, we must provide more certainty to companies that invest \nheavily in research and development.\n  In addition, international infringement of U.S. intellectual property\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\nrights costs American businesses billions of dollars every year. This \naffects big corporations and small businesses alike. By simply ensuring \nthat our trade partners fulfill their international obligations to \nrecognize and enforce intellectual property rights, we can create \nmillions of jobs in this country. Starting now, this administration \nmust take more meaningful steps to address this problem and protect \nAmerican job creators.\n  No. 9, we need to create incentives and remove barriers for small \nbusinesses to create jobs. Small businesses drive the American economy \nand they are the soul of our Nation's entrepreneurial heritage. Small \nbusinesses create two-thirds of the jobs in our Nation's economy. As \nsuch, they should be at the forefront of our economic recovery. To \nachieve this, we need to ensure that American small businesses operate \nin a more business-friendly environment. Big-government solutions have \nfailed to produce jobs, so it is long overdue that we release the \nentrepreneurial power of the private sector to grow our economy once \nagain. We can and must make it easier for small businesses to invest, \ngrow, and create jobs.\n  For example, Congress could provide a 20-percent tax deduction for \nsmall businesses on their income, and Congress could repeal the 3-\npercent withholding requirement for Federal contractors. Both of these \nideas would expand job creation among small businesses.\n  No. 10, finally, we need to reform America's labor laws and rein in \nthe National Labor Relations Board. Congress must enact significant \nreforms to our Nation's labor laws to counteract the pro-union \nextremism of the Obama National Labor Relations Board, or the NLRB. \nInstead of allowing the NLRB to rewrite America's labor laws every time \na new administration takes office, Congress should reform those laws to \nprovide greater oversight, accountability, and judicial review of the \nNLRB's decisions. They are usurping the power of the Congress. They are \nusurping the power of the courts. The fact of the matter is they don't \nhave the right to do that, and they are overturning 76 years of solid \nlabor law which is slightly in favor of organized labor. They want to \nmake it totally in favor of organized labor.\n  In addition, Congress should pass legislation such as the Employee \nRights Act, S. 1507, which I introduced in August to protect the rights \nof workers who do not want union representation, to prevent unions from \nexploiting their current members, and to ensure that the NLRB is no \nlonger able to trample employee rights via regulatory fiat.\n  Congress should finally repeal the outdated prevailing wage \nrequirements in the Davis-Bacon Act or, at the very least, suspend them \nuntil the economy recovers. Doing so would reduce burdens on small \nbusinesses, save the taxpayers money and, of course, create more jobs.\n  Once again, I am not under any illusions that passing this type of \njobs agenda will be easy, but I am convinced of its necessity. Each of \nthese proposals would achieve a commonsense objective, and most of \nthese ideas have broad support within Congress and the American people. \nOne thing is certain, however. We cannot stand by and do nothing. The \npeople of Utah, whom I serve, and people across the country are \ndemanding more jobs. This plan would accomplish this goal, but not \nthrough government, more regulation, more spending, and more taxes. \nRather, it would encourage private sector job growth by getting \ngovernment the heck out of the way. And by ensuring greater economic \nstability in the future, it would help to maintain the conditions for \nrobust job creation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           American Jobs Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to follow on the speech made by \nmy friend and colleague from Utah about the current state of \nunemployment in America and what to do about it. One of the last things \nhe says is, get government out of the way. I wish to suggest that \nmaybe, if he has some time--and I know he is a very busy man--he join \nme on a trip to Peoria, IL, where I was last week visiting Lucas & Sons \nSteel Company. This company has been in business since 1857. It has 26 \nemployees. The CEO is a delightful, dynamic young woman named Margaret \nHanley. She has, as I said, 26 union employees, all ironworkers. What \nshe does is fabricate steel for construction projects all over the \nMidwest and as far away as Antarctica. As I said, the company has been \naround over 150 years.\n  I asked her, Where do you get your steel? She said, It is all \nAmerican steel. I asked her, How are you doing? She said, Great. She \nsaid, One of the reasons we are doing great is because of President \nObama's stimulus package. The President said to American businesses \nsuch as hers, you can borrow money at low interest rates to buy new \nmachinery that will help you be more competitive. She said, Come on, \nlet me show you. We walked in the other room, and here was a computer-\ndriven machine as big as a small room being handled by a fellow that \nwas literally taking steel girders, boring holes in them, and bending \nthem where they are supposed to be bent. She said, I can compete with \nthe big boys with this. We are going to increase the number of people \nworking at Lucas & Sons Steel. Senator Hatch says, Government, get out \nof the way. Thank goodness, government was there for that company, a \nprivate company, paying a living wage with decent benefits, that has \nbeen around for a century and a half and is prospering because they are \nmaking quality products out of American steel with equipment they \nbought through President Obama's stimulus package.\n  How many times do we hear Senator McConnell come to the floor and \nsay, The President's stimulus package was a punch line on nighttime TV? \nWell, it isn't a punch line in Peoria. It is dead serious because \npeople are working, making a good wage, thanks to the investment in \nsmall business through government help.\n  I believe, and most Americans believe, real job creation is going to \nbe in the private sector. Well, look what happened here. Because of the \ninvestment of government helping her to buy this machinery and be \ncompetitive, production and manufacturing jobs stayed right here in the \nUnited States, and that is what we want. There are 14 million people \nout of work.\n  As I traveled up and down my State of Illinois, I visited some days \nwith those who are unemployed, desperately trying to find jobs, and \nother days with businesses such as Lucas & Sons Steel in Peoria which \nare doing well. I asked them the key to their success. They basically \nsay they have been lucky to have good products and great workers and \ngreat infrastructure.\n  Senator Hatch says, Get government out of the way. Government has to \nbe in the way for infrastructure. It is government that builds the \nhighways, the bridges, the airports, the railroads. That is part of \nwhat the government is investing in for the future of our economy. Part \nof President Obama's jobs package is to put Americans back to work \nrebuilding basic infrastructure. We need it. We need it all across the \nMidwest and across the Nation. If you think we can afford to get \ngovernment out of the way and not invest in infrastructure, take a look \nat what is going on in China today. In China, our No. 1 competitor in \nthe world and our No. 1 creditor in the world, they are building right \nand left. They are preparing for the 21st century. They are going to \nbuild 50 new airports in the next 5 years that will accommodate every \nplane of every size made by Boeing Aircraft. That is how big these \nairports are. There will be 50 new ones. They are building the \ninfrastructure to not only compete but pass the United States.\n  When my colleagues on the other side come to the floor and say: Get \ngovernment out of the way, what do they mean? That we should not be \ninvesting in infrastructure to make America strong for the 21st \ncentury; that the businesses, large and small, in Illinois that need \nmodern, safe highways to move their goods back and forth to market \nshould not turn to government for that help? It makes no sense. \nHistorically we have agreed on a bipartisan basis when it comes to \ninfrastructure. We should agree again, and that is part of the \nPresident's jobs bill.\n\n  Let me tell you what else is in there. We know America's working \nfamilies are struggling paycheck to paycheck. They took a survey \nrecently, and they asked working families in America: How many of your \nfamilies could come\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\nup with $2,000 in 30 days either out of savings or borrowing? That \nisn't an unreasonable amount of money. A very moderate injury in an \nemergency room might cost you $2,000. So they asked them, and it turned \nout only a little over half of working families had access to $2,000. \nIt shows you how close to the edge many families are living. It shows \nyou many of them are surviving paycheck to paycheck. Although they work \nhard, they cannot seem to get ahead.\n  President Obama's jobs act says this: These working families deserve \na payroll tax cut of 3 percent. What would that mean? Three percent \ndoesn't sound like much, but look what it means in Illinois. Our \naverage wage in Illinois is about $53,000 a year. The 3-percent payroll \ntax cut would give to these families between $125 and $130 a month. A \nSenator may not miss that amount of money, but for a lot of working \nfamilies, it is the difference between filling your gas tank and buying \nthe shoes for the kids to go to school. So the President's payroll tax \ncut puts money in the hands of working families to buy the goods and \nservices to get the economy moving forward.\n  What else does the President suggest? He suggests in his jobs act \nthat we need to provide tax incentives for small businesses to hire the \nunemployed. One of the things the President said when he spoke to us is \nwe ought to make sure every veteran who served our country can find a \njob when they get home by offering incentives for businesses to hire \nreturning soldiers. That is government involved. We create that \nincentive. The Republican side says: Get government out of the way. I \ndon't think so. These men and women who served our country, who risked \ntheir lives, who fought for America, should not have to come home and \nfight for a job and lose that fight. We ought to stand by them and help \nthem find work. That is part of President Obama's jobs bill, and it is \na reasonable part. Cutting the payroll taxes, cutting the taxes that \nbusinesses, including small businesses, pay so they are more profitable \nand can hire more people is a reasonable thing to do.\n  I was amused that the Senator from Utah brought up one of my issues \nthat I have worked on, and that is the debit card swipe fee. If you use \na debit card to make a purchase at a restaurant, a grocery store, a \ndrugstore, a bookstore, whatever it happens to be, and they would swipe \nthat card, the retailer you bought that good or service from has to pay \na fee to the bank and major credit card company. Well, it turns out \nthat the fee--the so-called swipe fee--is dramatically larger than the \nactual cost of the transaction to the bank and credit card company.\n  Let me give you some numbers. The Federal Reserve investigated, and \nhere is what they found: To use a debit card to make a purchase costs \nthe bank and credit card company somewhere between 4 cents and 12 \ncents. That is to process everything. For you to take money out of your \nchecking account with a debit card to pay for a purchase, what do they \ncharge? On average they charge the retailer 44 cents. That is somewhere \nbetween 600 percent and 400 percent of their actual costs. So what we \ndid is to say that retailers across America deserve a break. With the \nFederal Reserve establishing the number, we said a reasonable fee is \nabout 24 cents. That splits the difference, which is the common outcome \nin Washington. It gives the banks more than they actually have to \nexpend to process, but it doesn't hit the retailers hard.\n  I went to the Rock Island Country Market when I was back home in \ndownstate Illinois. Carl, the manager, talked about his morning \nspecial, a cup of coffee and a doughnut at the country market, 99 \ncents. He said, Senator, do you know what it feels like when someone \nhands me a debit card for that 99-cent transaction? I not only didn't \nbreak even, I lost money, and I will lose it every time.\n  We have to give retailers a fighting chance. When the Senator from \nUtah comes to the floor and says we should not do that, that we should \nstand by the Wall Street banks and the credit card companies, I think \nhe lost sight of the fact that Main Street, not Wall Street, is where \njobs are created in America. Helping retailers, large and small, be \nprofitable, be able to reduce prices on their goods and hire more \npeople is the way for us to emerge from this situation and have more \npeople working across America.\n  There is great controversy associated with the fact that President \nObama made a suggestion when he spoke to us about the jobs bill and \nwhen he said to us: I am going to pay for it. Whatever I do with this \njobs bill, whether it is extending unemployment benefits, payroll tax \ncuts for working families, a break for small businesses to hire \nveterans and other unemployed people, we are going to pay for it. We \nare not going to add this to the deficit. He came up with a plan to do \nit. I thought his plan was reasonable. We have talked on the Democratic \ncaucus side and come up with a plan that is more acceptable to our \ncaucus, and I can accept it too. Here is what it is. It is a little \nover a 5-percent surcharge on people who are making over $1 million a \nyear--a 5-percent surcharge on their income tax. These are people who \nare making $20,000 a week--$20,000 a week--and the President has \nsuggested they should pay their fair share. We have come up with a more \nspecific approach--a little over a 5-percent surtax to pay for what it \nwill take to get the jobs act moving forward and get the economy moving \nforward, which will be to everyone's benefit, rich and poor alike, \nacross America.\n  One would think we said something heretical--the protests that were \nreceived from the Republican side of the aisle in the House and the \nSenate. What I find interesting about their opposition to this is, when \nwe ask the American people point-blank: Do you think to pay for the \nPresident's jobs bill, to get people back to work, it is reasonable to \nclose tax loopholes and ask millionaires to pay a little more on their \nincome tax, here is what the poll says: 64 percent--almost two out of \nthree Americans--support raising taxes on millionaires. How about \nIndependents? ABC News poll: Seventy-five percent support raising taxes \non millionaires. But what about Republicans? Fifty-seven percent of \nRepublicans support raising taxes on millionaires and--hang on tight--\n55 percent of tea party supporters agree with raising taxes on \nmillionaires.\n  It turns out that the majority of Americans at every political level \nbelieve this is a reasonable proposal. The only problem is, we can't \nfind a Republican Senator or a House Member who agrees. They have said \nthey will vote against anything that includes a penny more in taxes for \nthose who are making over $1 million a year.\n  I think Americans believe we are all in this together. Everyone has \nto sacrifice. Families sacrifice every day. Businesses are sacrificing, \ntrying to stay open and prosper in a rough and challenging economy. It \nis not unreasonable to ask those who are doing well in America to pay a \nlittle more so we can get this economy moving forward and create jobs.\n\n\n                           Wall Street Reform\n\n  There are two other points raised by the Senator from Utah I wish to \naddress. One of them is, he said he is against the Wall Street reform \npackage we passed. Do my colleagues remember--it hasn't been that long \nago--when we were told by the previous President that if we didn't \nprovide almost $800 billion of taxpayers' money to the biggest banks in \nAmerica, they would fail and the economy would crater? It is a day I \nwill never forget because it is a stark choice: take $800 billion out \nof our Treasury with all our debt and give it to Wall Street banks or \nrun the risk of our economy collapsing. Many of us said we will stand \nwith President Bush's proposal. We will see if we can keep these banks \nstaying afloat. Does anyone remember the thank-you note we got from the \nmajor bankers across America for the $800 billion in TARP funds? They \ngave million-dollar bonuses to their officers. The same people who were \nin charge and who drove their banks into the ground and drove the \neconomy into the ground that forced the taxpayers' bailout were ending \nup with millions of dollars in bonuses.\n  We decided with Wall Street reform to say, once and for all, we are \nnot going down this road again. This notion that some of these Wall \nStreet banks and bigger banks are too big to fail has to come to an \nend. So we passed Wall Street reform to try to straighten out some of \nthe abuses that led to this recession. We didn't get a\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nsingle vote on the Republican side of the aisle--not one. They don't \nwant the government to exercise any power of oversight, to police the \nranks of those in the financial industry who are not dealing with this \nsituation responsibly. That is their position.\n  I happen to believe government has a legitimate role. When those \nbanks were about to fail, they loved government. They couldn't wait to \nget our money. They got the money and survived and then gave one \nanother bonuses. The government said: Now you have to clean up your \nact, and they said: Get out of the way. Government is nothing but a big \nold problem.\n  The American people know better. We want Wall Street and the big \nbanks to be held accountable. We never want to go down this bailout \nroad again, and I think--and I hope most Americans believe--that \noversight of these banks is absolutely essential to make sure we have \nmoney available and these banks are sound.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  The last point I will make relates to the health care issue. I see my \ncolleague from Colorado on the floor, and I am happy to yield to him in \njust a couple minutes.\n  The health care issue is one that is a frequent source of \nconversation among the political talking heads and elected officials \nhere in Washington. Recently, many on the other side of the aisle have \nbeen holding almost daily press conferences--one was reported today in \nthe Washington Post--where they get very worked up over the President's \nhealth care reform bill, which I was proud to support, and say it is \nthe reason for virtually every problem in America.\n  Let me tell my colleagues on both sides the reality. Having served on \nthe deficit commission, we cannot reduce the deficit and the rate of \ngrowth in our national debt without coming to grips with the cost of \nhealth care. Whether it is a family, a business or any level of \ngovernment, the cost of health care is breaking the bank. What we tried \nto do, and I think we will do, is to come up with a fair way to bring \ndown the rate of growth and the cost of health care. I am not naive \nenough to believe we are going to actually bring down health care costs \ndramatically. What we are trying to do is to slow that rate of growth, \nand that is something we can achieve.\n  I take a look around at what we are faced with when it comes to \nhealth care and the dilemmas we face, how many people before this \nhealth care reform bill had virtually no protection. One of the things \nwe did in health care reform, which I suppose those who want to repeal \nit want to get rid of, was to say they couldn't penalize a person or a \nfamily because of preexisting conditions. Children under the age of 18 \ncould not be denied on a family policy because of a preexisting \ncondition. Many parents, such as my own family, have lived through this \nand have known that if we couldn't get basic health insurance for our \nchild, it could jeopardize the quality of care that was available. We \nchanged that law. We said they cannot discriminate against children \nunder the age of 18 because of preexisting conditions. We are moving \ntoward eliminating that discrimination across the board. Is that \nunreasonable? I think it is realistic and humane and it is a good thing \nto do.\n  The second thing we did was to help senior citizens getting \nprescription drugs under Medicare who get stuck with something called \nthe doughnut hole. It is a gap in coverage of almost $2,000 a year that \nthey have to take out of their savings accounts to pay for expensive \nprescription drugs. We are closing that hole over a period of a number \nof years so seniors will have seamless coverage, start to finish. That \nis part of health care reform. Those who are calling for its repeal \nought to stand and say exactly that they want to get rid of that as \nwell.\n  We also provide coverage under the family health insurance plan for \nchildren up to the age of 26. It expands the reach of family health \ninsurance for recent high school and college graduates who may not have \na job. It is an important coverage factor that I am glad we included in \nthis bill.\n  There is more we need to do. But to walk away from health care \nreform, to walk away from efforts to preserve quality and reduce the \ncost in health care is a step in the wrong direction for the quality of \nlife of American families and for dealing with this deficit challenge \nwe face.\n\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nconsider joining us in offering amendments and modifications to the \nPresident's jobs act. What is absolutely unacceptable is to do nothing. \nUnfortunately, many of them believe that is exactly what we should do: \nDon't let government get involved in any respect when it comes to the \nunemployment across America. Whether it is unemployment benefits, \nhelping working families, giving incentives to small businesses to hire \nveterans and other people, putting money into infrastructure in \nAmerica--these are things we can and should do together as a nation to \nbring this economy forward and to reduce the unemployment we are \ncurrently facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval are not in order.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, if I had the time, I would contest a few \nthings my colleague from Illinois said, but I am not going to make a \npolitical speech; I am going to speak on the bill that is currently \nbefore the Senate which is the China currency bill.\n  So I rise to speak on the China currency bill. China's undervaluation \nof its currency is a serious problem. It is an issue I studied when I \nwas a member of the Senate Banking Committee and now as a member of the \nFinance Committee. Earlier this year, I also had an opportunity to \nvisit China with a number of my colleagues and learn more about this \nissue as we met with their government officials.\n  It is clear the efforts of the Chinese Government to peg its currency \nagainst the dollar give unfair benefits to the Chinese exporters at the \nexpense of U.S. manufacturers. The United States should take additional \naction to pressure their government to reevaluate Chinese currency.\n  However, this is not a new problem. China currency has been a \npriority for both President George W. Bush and President Obama. Through \na number of venues, including the Joint Commission on Commerce and \nTrade talks, our officials at all levels have raised this issue with \nlittle response. This experience shows that action by the United States \nalone is not enough. We know other major global trading powers have the \nsame concern, but we continue to act individually. Just this summer, \nthe German Government made a renewed attempt to gain more flexibility \nin China's currency. The full European Union has followed suit, but \nthey, too, have had little gain. But the United States and the European \nUnion are not the only ones concerned about China currency. A number of \nemerging economies, including both India and Brazil, have also made the \nsame plea. So the question I ask now is why are we considering a bill \nthat puts the United States in a position of going it alone?\n  That is one reason I am a cosponsor of the Hatch amendment No. 680. \nThis substitute amendment retains the designations included in the \nunderlying bill that define a ``fundamentally misaligned currency'' \nwhile giving direction to the administration to pursue action through \nmultilateral channels. The amendment also thinks forward by making the \nissue of currency misalignment a priority issue in both our current \ntrade negotiations and in future trade agreements. It is important that \nthe United States not act by itself when it comes to pressuring China \non this issue. I have found in my experience that when it comes to \neconomic policy in our globalized world, the multilateral approach is \nthe most successful. That is one reason I do not support imposing \nunilateral economic sanctions on any nations. I am hopeful the Senate \nwill have an opportunity to vote on and include the Hatch amendment in \nthis bill.\n  I also wish to speak about an amendment I am working on with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley. Given that this bill is about \nenforcement of trade obligations, we filed an amendment that would \nencourage our officials to counternotify those nations that have failed \nto report on the government subsidies that are provided to industries \nengaged in international trade and in competition with us. The World \nTrade Organization agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures \nestablishes base rules for when\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nmembers can provide subsidies. An important element of that agreement \nfor compliance is a measure that requires each country to disclose \nannually information about their subsidies. China agreed to these \nobligations in 2001. However, since joining the WTO 10 years ago, China \nhas only made its required notification once. That was in 2006, and it \nwas largely incomplete. The amendment we have offered requires the U.S. \nTrade Representative to use its authority under the WTO subsidies \nagreement to counternotify a nation that has failed to meet this \nobligation 2 years in a row. I am told the U.S. Trade Representative \nplans to act this afternoon by submitting information to the WTO that \nidentifies China's failure to comply with this requirement. I am \nhopeful this will lead to accurate and consistent reporting by those \ngovernments that continue to disregard their trade obligations.\n  This problem with reporting subsidies points to the larger issue we \nhave with China aside from currency misalignment. There are other \nsignificant Chinese policies that put the United States at an economic \ndisadvantage and deserve our attention. One such policy I wish to \nhighlight is China's policy of giving value-added tax--VAT--rebates to \nartificially promote exports.\n  On April 1, 2009, China reinstated a 9-percent rebate of its 17 \npercent VAT on soda ash exports, another instance of China manipulating \ncommercial outcomes through a government industrial policy. In 2009, \nduring the depths of the global economic crisis, China's soda ash \nexports increased 9 percent, while global demand for soda ash was in \nfree fall. That same year, U.S. exports of soda ash fell 19 percent. \nThis is just one of the countless examples where China's producers pay \nlittle attention to market conditions and instead are being driven by \nartificial incentives to export.\n  Continuation of such a policy puts U.S. jobs and the soda ash \nindustry at risk, which is why I have led an effort to have our \ngovernment press China for the elimination of the VAT rebate on soda \nash.\n  The U.S. natural soda ash industry employs over 3,000 workers in \nWyoming and California, another 100 dock workers in Portland, OR, as \nwell as railroad workers who help transport soda ash. Half of all \nworkers employed in the soda ash industry are dependent on exports for \ntheir jobs.\n  The U.S. soda ash industry is an export success story. For the first \ntime in 2010, the U.S. soda ash industry shipped more product to \noverseas markets than it did to domestic customers, and exports \ncontinue to grow in 2011. Domestic demand for soda ash is flat, so \ngrowth in the U.S. soda ash industry is entirely dependent on \nmaintaining and expanding its exports.\n\n  The United States is the most competitive soda ash producer in the \nworld, but it will continue to be confronted by China's trade-\ndistorting policies that put it at a competitive disadvantage. \nSpecifically, China's VAT rebate on exports reduces China's production \ncosts. It undermines U.S. soda ash exports in other markets. Moreover, \nChinese soda ash is produced through synthetic processes that are both \nextremely harmful to the environment and are energy intensive.\n  China's manipulation of its VAT rebate has been raised multiple times \nby Members of this Chamber, as well as our House colleagues. On May 31, \n2011, we asked Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Ron Kirk to keep this issue on its agenda with the \nChinese and fight for its elimination.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the text of the letter to Secretary Locke and Ambassador Kirk.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2011.\n     Hon. Gary Locke,\n     U.S. Secretary of Commerce,\n     Constitution Ave., NW,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Kirk,\n     U.S. Trade Representative\n     17th Street, NW.\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Locke and Ambassador Kirk: We are writing to \n     express our continued concerns about China's use of a Value-\n     Added Tax (VAT) rebate to promote its soda ash industry at \n     the expense of U.S. exports. For over two years, China has \n     provided its domestic manufacturers with an artificial \n     incentive to export through a 9% rebate of the 17% VAT. For a \n     number of reasons, we ask that the issue of the soda ash VAT \n     rebate be specifically included on the JCCT agenda this fall.\n       After suspending its VAT rebate for soda ash in July 2007, \n     China reinstated the soda ash rebate in April 2009 to \n     encourage its own exports during the global economic crisis. \n     China's state-supported soda ash industry is the largest in \n     the world and this policy is harmful to its international \n     competitors, particularly U.S. soda ash manufacturers. As you \n     may know, U.S. soda ash has a natural advantage over Chinese \n     soda ash, based on a manufacturing process that is much more \n     sustainable in terms of environmental protection and energy \n     use than the synthetic processes used in China. China's \n     manipulation of the VAT rebate to support its domestic soda \n     ash industry also has wider implications--not only is it \n     economically unjustified, it contravenes China's own \n     interests in shifting energy resources from more productive \n     and efficient industries.\n       We must focus on Chinese policies that are a direct threat \n     to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. The soda ash VAT rebate is one \n     such policy. Chinese exports compete directly with U.S. soda \n     ash exports in the Asia-Pacific market and beyond. Although \n     the VAT is just one part of China's overall industrial \n     policy, the soda ash VAT rebate is a distinct threat to U.S. \n     manufacturing in a sector where the United States enjoys a \n     natural competitive advantage. If we don't stand up for the \n     pillars of our export-based manufacturers like the soda ash \n     industry--and the U.S. workers employed throughout the soda \n     ash supply chain--we cannot seriously contend we are doing \n     everything we can to support U.S. exports.\n       We ask that the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade \n     Representative's Office ensure that the soda ash VAT rebate \n     is raised at the highest levels with Chinese officials at the \n     JCCT meetings this year. The message should be as clear as it \n     is convincing; namely, China should live up to its repeated \n     pledge to discourage the expansion of highly-polluting and \n     energy-intensive sectors such as its own soda ash industry. \n     Policies aimed at promoting soda ash exports, such as the VAT \n     rebate, are inconsistent with China's own stated goals and a \n     direct threat to U.S. interests.\n       We greatly appreciate your consideration of this request \n     and look forward to your response.\n         Michael B. Enzi, John Barrasso, M.D., David Wu, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Robert Menendez, Cynthia Lummis, Ron Wyden, \n           Jeff Merkley, James A. Himes, Frank Lautenberg.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. For over 2 years, China has provided its domestic \nmanufacturers with an artificial incentive to export through the 9-\npercent VAT rebate on soda ash. When this incentive is removed, a truly \ncompetitive market can be restored for global exports of soda ash. I \nlook forward to a lively discussion on this issue when the United \nStates and China meet for the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade \nministerials this fall.\n  I do not want to underestimate the importance of the China currency \nissue. However, this debate cannot overlook the significant trade \nimbalances caused by other Chinese Government policies that \ndisadvantage U.S. industries. If you ask our officials, they will not \nhesitate to say that the currency issue is just the tip of the iceberg. \nThere are countless tariffs, subsidies, and nontariff barriers that \nkeep the United States out of China at the cost of U.S. jobs. That is \nwhy I am disappointed my colleague, the majority leader, has not yet \nallowed Members to offer the amendments on trade and jobs they wish to \noffer.\n  Our economic policies with China extend far beyond the currency \nissue, and this bill should be the forum to raise and debate those \nconcerns. This bill has been sold as a jobs bill and a trade bill and, \ntherefore, should be open to amendments about jobs and trade. Allowing \namendments now is especially important since this is yet another bill \nbrought directly to the floor without the benefit of committee \nconsideration.\n  Our companies and exporters are among the best in the world, but it \nis tough for them to succeed when other nations allow competitors to \nignore the rules they have agreed to follow. Without a doubt, something \nneeds to be done about currency misalignment in China. However, for it \nto be successful, we have to take a holistic approach. I am hopeful the \nSenate will consider these ideas, including the Hatch amendment. If the \nUnited States continues to go it alone, we will continue to have the \nsame problems. We must consider legislation that not only authorizes \nU.S. action but encourages\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\nthe administration to pursue the currency issue with other nations that \nmay have the same concern.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I am here today to talk a little bit \nabout the state of our economy. I have spent the summer and early fall \ntraveling around the beautiful State of Colorado, having townhall \nmeetings and listening to people who mostly start the conversations by \nsaying: What is wrong with you people in Washington? Why can't you work \ntogether to actually get anything done there?\n  They are short of slogans these days, and they are desperate for us \nto turn this economy around. They know what the consequences have been \nof living in a country that for the first time in its history has had \nmedian family income falling, at a time when their cost of health \ninsurance has been skyrocketing, their cost of higher education is \ngoing through the roof.\n  I thought the Wall Street Journal captured this in a way that I have \nbeen unable to. In a very vivid way, on the front page a couple weeks \nago, there was an article that was entitled: ``As Middle Class Shrinks, \nP''--that is Procter & Gamble--``Aims High and Low.'' That article is \nabout one of the most iconic middle-class brands imaginable, Procter & \nGamble.\n  Ninety-eight percent of the households in this country have a product \nin their house that is produced by Procter & Gamble: Crest toothpaste, \nHead & Shoulders shampoo, Tide water detergent, Pampers diapers, Bounty \npaper towels. The list goes on: Duracell batteries, Mr. Clean, Pepto-\nBismol, Pringles potato chips--stuff that did not even exist before \nthere was a middle class in this country to buy it.\n  That is the great brand of Procter & Gamble, and it is still a great \nbrand. But this article is about how they are changing their business \nmodel to reflect the current economic realities and economic realities \nthey believe are actually going to persist for some time.\n  I will quote from the article, Madam President, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 12, 2011]\n\n             As Middle Class Shrinks, P Aims High and Low\n\n                            (By Ellen Byron)\n\n       For generations, Procter & Gamble Co.'s growth strategy was \n     focused on developing household staples for the vast American \n     middle class.\n       Now, P executives say many of its former middle-market \n     shoppers are trading down to lower-priced goods--widening the \n     pools of have and have-not consumers at the expense of the \n     middle.\n       That's forced P, which estimates it has at least one \n     product in 98% of American households, to fundamentally \n     change the way it develops and sells its goods. For the first \n     time in 38 years, for example, the company launched a new \n     dish soap in the U.S. at a bargain price.\n       P's roll out of Gain dish soap says a lot about the \n     health of the American middle class: The world's largest \n     maker of consumer products is now betting that the squeeze on \n     middle America will be long lasting.\n       ``It's required us to think differently about our product \n     portfolio and how to please the high-end and lower-end \n     markets,'' says Melanie Healey, group president of P's \n     North America business. ``That's frankly where a lot of the \n     growth is happening.''\n       In the wake of the worst recession in 50 years, there's \n     little doubt that the American middle class--the 40% of \n     households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $140,000 a \n     year--is in distress. Even before the recession, incomes of \n     American middle-class families weren't keeping up with \n     inflation, especially with the rising costs of what are \n     considered the essential ingredients of middle-class life--\n     college education, health care and housing. In 2009, the \n     income of the median family, the one smack in the middle of \n     the middle, was lower, adjusted for inflation, than in 1998, \n     the Census Bureau says.\n       The slumping stock market and collapse in housing prices \n     have also hit middle-class Americans. At the end of March, \n     Americans had $6.1 trillion in equity in their houses--the \n     value of the house minus mortgages--half the 2006 level, \n     according to the Federal Reserve. Economist Edward Wolff of \n     New York University estimates that the net worth--household \n     assets minus debts--of the middle fifth of American \n     households grew by 2.4% a year between 2001 and 2007 and \n     plunged by 26.2% in the following two years.\n       P isn't the only company adjusting its business. A wide \n     swath of American companies is convinced that the consumer \n     market is bifurcating into high and low ends and eroding in \n     the middle. They have begun to alter the way they research, \n     develop and market their products.\n       Food giant H.J. Heinz Co., for example, is developing more \n     products at lower price ranges. Luxury retailer Saks Inc. is \n     bolstering its high-end apparel and accessories because its \n     wealthiest customers--not those drawn to entry-level items--\n     are driving the chain's growth.\n       Citigroup calls the phenomenon the ``Consumer Hourglass \n     Theory'' and since 2009 has urged investors to focus on \n     companies best positioned to cater to the highest-income and \n     lowest-income consumers. It created an index of 25 companies, \n     including Estee Lauder Cos. and Saks at the top of the \n     hourglass and Family Dollar Stores Inc. and Kellogg Co. at \n     the bottom. The index posted a 56.5% return for investors \n     from its inception on Dec. 10, 2009, through Sept. 1, 2011. \n     Over the same period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \n     returned 11%.\n       ``Companies have thought that if you're in the middle, \n     you're safe,'' says Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig. ``But \n     that's not where the consumer is any more--the consumer \n     hourglass is more pronounced now than ever.''\n       Companies like Tiffany & Co., Coach Inc. and Neiman Marcus \n     Group Inc., which cater to the wealthy, racked up outsize \n     sales last Christmas and continue to post strong sales.\n       Tiffany says its lower-priced silver baubles, once a \n     favorite of middle-class shoppers craving a small token from \n     the storied jeweler, are now its weakest sellers in the U.S. \n     ``I think that there's probably more separation of affluence \n     in the U.S.,'' Tiffany Chief Operating Officer James \n     Fernandez said in June.\n       Firms catering to low-income consumers, such as Dollar \n     General Corp., also are posting gains, boosted by formerly \n     middle-class families facing shrunken budgets. Dollar stores \n     garnered steady sales increases in recent years, easily \n     outpacing mainstream counterparts like Target Corp. and Wal-\n     Mart Stores Inc., which typically are more expensive.\n       P's profits boomed with the increasing affluence of \n     middle-class households in the post-World War II economy. As \n     masses of housewives set up their new suburban homes, P \n     marketers pledged that Tide detergent delivered cleaner \n     clothes, Mr. Clean made floors shinier and Crest toothpaste \n     fought off more cavities. In the decades since, new features \n     like fragrances or ingredient and packaging enhancements kept \n     P's growth robust.\n       Despite its aggressive expansion around the world, P \n     still needs to win over a healthy percentage of the American \n     population, because the U.S. market remains its biggest and \n     most profitable. In the fiscal year ended June 30, the U.S. \n     delivered about 37% of P's $82.6 billion in annual sales \n     and an estimated 60% of its $11.8 billion in profit. P says \n     that Americans per capita spend about $96 a year on its \n     products, compared with around $4 in China.\n       During the early stages of the recession, P executives \n     defended its long-time approach of making best-in-class \n     products and charging a premium, expecting middle-class \n     Americans to pay up.\n       But cash-strapped shoppers, P learned, aren't as willing \n     to splurge on household staples with extra features. Droves \n     of consumers started switching to cheaper brands, slowing \n     P's sales and profit gains and denting its dominant market \n     share positions.\n       In late 2008, unit sales gains of P's cheaper brands \n     began outpacing its more expensive lines despite receiving \n     far less advertising. As the recession wore on, U.S. market-\n     share gains for P's cheaper Luvs diapers and Gain detergent \n     increased faster than its premium-priced Pampers and Tide \n     brands.\n       At the same time, lower-priced competitors nabbed market \n     share from some of P's biggest brands. P's dominant \n     fabric-softener sheets business, including its Bounce brand, \n     fell five percentage points to 60.2% of the market as lower-\n     priced options from Sun Products Corp. and private-label \n     brands picked up sales from the second quarter of 2008 \n     through May 2011, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis of \n     data from market-research firm SymphonyIRI.\n       P's grasp of the liquid laundry detergent category, led \n     by its iconic Tide brand, also posted a rare slip over the \n     same period as bargain-priced options from Sun and Church & \n     Dwight Co. gained momentum. Even the company's huge Gillette \n     refill razor market suffered, declining to 80.1% by May from \n     82.3% in the second-quarter of 2008, as Energizer Holdings \n     Inc.'s less-expensive Schick brand gained nearly three \n     points.\n       P began changing course in May 2009. After issuing a \n     sharply lower-than-expected earnings forecast for the \n     company's 2010 fiscal year, then-CEO A.G. Lafley said the \n     company would take a ``surgical'' approach to cutting prices \n     on some products and develop more lower-priced goods. ``You \n     have to see reality as it is,'' Mr. Lafley said.\n       When the company's 2009 fiscal year ended a month later, \n     P's sales had posted a rare drop, falling 3% to $76.7 \n     billion.\n       In August that year, P's newly appointed CEO, company \n     veteran Robert McDonald, accelerated the new approach of \n     developing products for high- and low-income consumers.\n       ``We're going to do this both by tiering our portfolio up \n     in terms of value as well as\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\n     tiering our portfolio down,'' Mr. McDonald said in September \n     2009.\n       To monitor the evolving American consumer market, P \n     executives study the Gini index, a widely accepted measure of \n     income inequality that ranges from zero, when everyone earns \n     the same amount, to one, when all income goes to only one \n     person. In 2009, the most recent calculation available, the \n     Gini coefficient totaled 0.468, a 20% rise in income \n     disparity over the past 40 years, according to the U.S. \n     Census Bureau.\n       ``We now have a Gini index similar to the Philippines and \n     Mexico--you'd never have imagined that,'' says Phyllis \n     Jackson, P's vice president of consumer market knowledge \n     for North America. ``I don't think we've typically thought \n     about America as a country with big income gaps to this \n     extent.''\n       Over the past two years, P has accelerated its research, \n     product-development and marketing approach to target the \n     newly divided American market.\n       Globally, P divides consumers into three income groups. \n     The highest-earning ``ones'' historically have been the \n     primary bracket P chased in the U.S. as they are the least \n     price sensitive and most swayed by claims of superior product \n     performance. But as the ``twos,'' or lower-income American \n     consumers, grew in size during the recession, P decided to \n     target them aggressively, too. P doesn't specifically \n     target the lowest-income ``threes'' in the U.S., since they \n     comprise a small percentage of the population and such \n     consumers are typically heavily subsidized by government aid.\n       At the high end, it launched its most-expensive skin-care \n     regimen, Olay Pro-X in 2009, which includes a starter kit \n     costing around $60. Previously, the Olay line had topped out \n     around $25. Last year, the company launched Gillette Fusion \n     ProGlide razors at a price of $10 to $12, a premium to \n     Gillette Fusion razors, which sell for $8 to $10, and \n     Gillette Mach3, priced at $8 to $9.\n       At the lower end, its new Gain dish soap, launched last \n     year, can sell for about half per ounce of the company's \n     premium Dawn Hand Renewal dish soap, which hit stores in late \n     2008.\n       Developing products that squarely target the high and low \n     is proving difficult for a company long accustomed to aiming \n     for a giant, mainstream group.\n       Conquering the high end is difficult because it usually \n     involves a smaller quantity of products.\n       ``We do big volumes of things really well,'' said Bruce \n     Brown, P's chief technology officer. ``Things that are \n     smaller quantities, with high appeal, we're learning how to \n     do that.''\n       Likewise, the cost challenges at the bottom of the pyramid \n     are also proving difficult, Mr. Brown said. Over the past two \n     years, P has increased its research of the growing ranks of \n     low-income American households.\n       ``This has been the most humbling aspect of our jobs,'' \n     says Ms. Jackson. ``The numbers of Middle America have been \n     shrinking because people have been getting hurt so badly \n     economically that they've been falling into lower income.''\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I quote:\n\n       P's profits boomed with the increasing affluence of \n     middle-class households in the post-World War II economy.\n\n  The story I was just telling.\n  The article starts out by saying:\n\n       For generations, Procter & Gamble Co.'s growth strategy was \n     focused on developing household staples for the vast American \n     middle class.\n       Now, P executives say many of its former middle-market \n     shoppers are trading down to lower-priced goods--widening the \n     pools of have and have-not consumers at the expense of the \n     middle. . . .\n       P isn't the only company adjusting its business. A wide \n     swath of American companies is convinced that the consumer \n     market is bifurcating into high and low ends and eroding in \n     the middle. They have begun to alter the way they research, \n     develop and market their products.\n\n  In other words, they have begun to alter their business plan with the \nassumption that the middle class is evaporating in this country and \nthat their growth markets are the very richest among us, on the one \nhand, and the very poorest among us, on the other hand.\n  Let me close on this part by reading near the end of this story:\n\n       To monitor the evolving American consumer market, P \n     executives study the Gini index, a widely accepted measure of \n     income equality that ranges from zero . . . to one. . . . In \n     2009, the most recent calculation available, [there was] a \n     20% rise in income disparity over the past 40 years. . . .\n\n  Here is the next quote:\n\n       ``We now have a Gini index similar to the Philippines and \n     Mexico--you'd never have imagined that,'' says Phyllis \n     Jackson, P's vice president of consumer market knowledge \n     for North America. ``I don't think we've typically thought \n     about America as a country with big income gaps to this \n     extent.''\n\n  I do not think that is the way we have thought about America either \nbecause that is not what America has been for generation after \ngeneration, decade after decade, going back to the founding of this \ncountry.\n  Why do I come to the floor to talk about this? It is because the \ndebate in this place is becoming more and more unmoored from the facts, \nand people need to be reminded, I think, here--not in Colorado--but \nhere about what the problem is we are actually trying to solve.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is our current economic challenge. The \ntop line is our productivity index, going back to 1992, that blue line. \nYou will notice it fell slightly during the recession, and then it took \noff again like a rocket. Why? Because firms all over the country were \nhaving to figure out how to do what they were doing, produce what they \nwere producing, with fewer people in order to survive in this \nrecession. The combination of competing in a global economic \nenvironment, which was not even present remotely in the way it is today \nin the 1980s, required us to be more productive. The technological \nrevolution this country has spawned and led has allowed us to become \nmore productive.\n  You can see from this green line--which is gross domestic product--\nour economy actually has started to come back. We are about two-thirds \nof the way back to where we were before this recession started. But \nwhat my families are feeling in Colorado and what the Presiding \nOfficer's families are probably feeling in Missouri is in these other \ntwo lines. This line represents median family income which, as I said \nearlier, continues to drop, for the first time in our country's \nhistory, in the last 20 years. What that means is people are earning \n$4,000 and $5,000 less in real income at the end of the decade than \nthey were at the beginning of the decade. Although I guess I should \npoint out here, as well, that during the time median family income was \nfalling, average family income went up, reflecting the widening gap \nbetween rich and poor in this country and reflecting a diminishing \nmiddle class.\n  This line is unemployment. It does not take a genius to figure out \nthat when the green line crosses again and our GDP is where it was \nbefore we even had this recession--and it will--we do not have an \nanswer for people who have been dislocated as a consequence of our \neconomy becoming more efficient and more productive. These jobs are \ngoing to be created not by legacy firms from the last century but by \nbusinesses that are going to be started tomorrow and the week after \nthat and the week after that.\n  Rather than having a partisan debate here in Washington, we should be \nhaving a bipartisan discussion about how to change our Tax Code and \nchange our regulatory code to make it easier--not harder--for small \nbusinesses to be created and to compete and to make sure we are \ncreating jobs here in the United States that are actually lifting \nmedian family income rather than driving it downward.\n  This is what has happened to manufacturing in the United States since \n2001. I invite anybody to look on our Web site if they want to look at \nthese charts themselves or use them in their own meetings. But this top \nline is our manufacturing output. You can see that has been rising. \nThis other line, going back from 2001 to today, is manufacturing \nemployment. Output rising; employment falling.\n  People in my State know we did not get here yesterday. This has been \nhappening to them for the last decade or so. They want us to be \nresponsive to that.\n  This is the median family income chart: In 1999, median family income \nwas roughly $53,000. In 2010, it was $49,000--a $4,000 drop in real \ndollars since 1999; a 7.1-percent decrease. People are coming to me and \nsaying: Michael--they may not know it is a 7.1-percent decrease, but \nthey know they are earning less. They know that 10 years ago when they \nset out to save for college for their 8-year-old, they were expecting \nto be earning more at the end of the decade. Now their kids are going \nto school, and they are saying: I can't afford it. Tuition has \nskyrocketed. I can't send my kid to the best school they got into. What \na waste.\n  I would ask you, Madam President, whether any of us think we can \nafford another decade like that at the beginning of this new century. \nIf we consume a fifth of the 21st century driving American middle-class \nincome down, we are going to have a very tough time recognizing \nourselves.\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\n  This next chart is something that is not noted by many, but I used to \nbe a school superintendent, so I have an interest in our education. \nThis chart shows unemployment during this recession based on \neducational attainment. The worst it ever got for folks with a college \ndegree in this country was 4.5 percent during this recession. For \npeople who had less than a high school diploma, it was 15 percent. For \npeople with a high school degree, it was around 12 percent.\n  Here is what else we have done over the last 10 years. This chart \nshows our poverty rate in this country.\n  This is why we have to move past the politics and into a substantive \nconversation about where we want to take this country as Republicans \nand Democrats together. These lines are people who are Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents, who are seeing their income driven down, \nwho are seeing their wealth destroyed, and expect us to at least be \nable to have a civil conversation about it on the floor of the Senate.\n  Did you know that poverty has increased by 46 percent since the year \n2000 in the United States of America? There are 46 million people in \nour country of 300-and-some million that live in poverty today. Thirty-\nfive percent of them are kids. Two percent of the children in the \nUnited States today are living in poverty. One-fifth of the children in \nour country are living in poverty.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this has not affected everybody the same in \nour economy. This is the average income growth for the top 1 percent of \nincome earners in the United States. This is the top 5 percent. This is \nthe top 10 percent. And it seems almost insane to describe it this way, \nbut the bottom 90 percent, 9 out of 10 income earners--9 out of 10 \nincome earners--this is what has happened to their income since 1967 in \nreal dollars, inflation-adjusted dollars. It has been absolutely stuck \nand flat at the bottom of this curve, all of which leads me to show the \nmost disturbing slide of all, which I know is hard to read. But let me \ntell you what it says--and you can find it on the Web site.\n  It says we have not seen this level of income inequality in the \nUnited States of America since 1928. That is the last time that the so-\ncalled bottom 90 percent of earners--9 out of 10 earners--earned \nroughly 45 percent of the income in the country. Here in 1928, and here \nin 2011. I do not think our democracy can sustain itself with another \ndecade or two of numbers such as this. We have to do better.\n  The bottom 90 percent of earners, as I mentioned a minute ago, are \nRepublicans and they are Democrats, they are Independent voters, and \nthey expect their government to work together. We cannot create their \njobs, but we can create the conditions under which we can create high-\npaying jobs in the United States that are lifting family incomes rather \nthan driving them down. That is what we should be debating in \nWashington.\n  Like you, Madam President, I have a deep concern about the fiscal \ncondition of the country. We have $1.5 trillion of deficit, and we have \n$15 trillion of debt, and we do not have the apparent will to address \nthat problem. We can address that problem. We should be adopting the \nkind of policies that were recommended by the bipartisan commission, \nBowles-Simpson, that together combines to take $4 trillion out of our \ndeficit situation over the next 10 years.\n  They did it by asking everybody to have a share in the sacrifice. We \nshould be debating that on the floor of the Senate. We should be \nsupporting the work that the Gang of 6 has tried to do, not just \nbecause it will help us with our fiscal situation, which is critical, \nbut because it will help us with our jobs situation.\n  There is $2.3 trillion of cash, by some estimates, sitting on the \nbalance sheets of America's corporations that is not being invested now \nbecause people are deeply worried that they cannot predict what \ninterest rate environment we are going to be in because we cannot get \nour fiscal house in order and because the government is financing its \ndebt on short-term paper, which easily could rise. Every rise in our \ninterest rate will add $1.3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 \nyears.\n  These are the facts. I have a list of what we could be doing today. I \nwill not dwell on it. We could be reforming and simplifying our Tax \nCode. We could be adopting a long-term research and development \nstrategy. We could be investing, as Republicans and Democrats have done \nfor decades if not centuries, in our infrastructure. We could bring our \npublic education system into the 21st century, which would matter a lot \nnot just to our middle-class kids but to kids living in poverty as \nwell.\n  Did you know that today, if you are a child born in poverty--whether \nyou are rural or urban, it does not matter--your chances of getting a \ncollege degree are 9 in 100--9 in 100--which means that the day you are \nborn, if you are among those 100 kids, out of the shoots 91 of you are \nconsigned to the margins of the democracy, the margins of our economy.\n  If we do not change the way we educate our kids, and even if we do \nnot care from their point of view what the implications of that are--\nand I deeply do care about that as the father of three little girls. I \nthink everybody should have an opportunity to graduate from high \nschool, go on to college and succeed. Even if you did not care from \nthat perspective, look at what happens if you do not have an education \nin the 21st-century economy. Look at the unemployment rates people are \nhaving to suffer through if they do not have a high school degree or a \ncollege degree compared to if they do have a degree. That is not going \nto change.\n  The last time we were creating jobs in this country we created \nroughly 5.3 million for people with a college degree, 3.5 million for \npeople with something north of a high school diploma. No new jobs for \npeople with a high school degree, and we lost jobs for high school \ndropouts.\n  So if you care about the strength and success of the American \neconomy, if you care about maintaining the mantle of the land of \nopportunity, if you care about the idea that the job of one generation \nis to put another generation into a position to succeed and contribute \nin the economy and the democracy, you need to care about what we are \ndoing with our education system.\n  We could be talking about that. We could be doing regulatory review \nto make sure we have a process to get rid of old regulations that do \nnot make sense and put in ones that do. I know in Colorado we have a \nhuge interest in ending our reliance on foreign oil. Everywhere I go \npeople talk about that. Everywhere I go people wonder whether it would \nnot be better to have an energy policy that created energy independence \nfor this country instead of having one--or a lack of one may be a \nbetter way of saying it--that forces us to shift billions of dollars a \nweek to the Persian Gulf for the privilege of buying their oil because \nwe do not have a policy.\n  We could be thinking about advanced manufacturing. We could be \neliminating the technology gap. We could be modernizing the FDA. There \nis no shortage of things we can do if we come together to do it.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon is here, so I will wrap up in 1 \nminute. But in order to be able to get to any of that, in order to get \nto any of that, we have to knock off the political games and actually \nstart working together around this place.\n  Two days ago there was an article in the Washington Post--I think it \nwas--that said that the United States Congress has a 14-percent \napproval rating, and the joke around here is, well, who in the world \nare those 14 percent who think we are doing a good job? But it is not a \njoke. This is serious. There is a reason our approval rating is in the \nbasement. It is because instead of working on the things that actually \nwould drive productivity in this country, would drive job creation in \nthis country, would most importantly drive median family income up \ninstead of down, we are fighting with each other.\n  I want to go back to Colorado and have an answer for the people in my \ntownhalls who could care less--could care less--whether I am a Democrat \nor I am a Republican and just want me to do my job. The ones who are \ndoing their jobs want me to do my job. The ones who do not have jobs \nwant me to do my job. They want all of us to do our jobs.\n  I know there are people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle that \nif given the chance will work together to do\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nthis. The last thing I will say is this, and then I will stop. The rest \nof the world is not waiting for us to get our act together. The rest of \nthe world is not waiting for us to decide whether we are going to have \nanother debate that leads to us blowing up the credit rating of the \nUnited States. They are not waiting for us to decide whether we want to \nsacrifice for the first time the full faith and credit of the United \nStates of America. They are not waiting for us to decide whether we are \ngoing to invest in 21st-century manufacturing.\n  My colleague from Ohio just showed up. He talked about that. They are \nnot waiting for us to decide whether we are going to let them own the \n21st-century energy economy. They are going right ahead, and so our \nfailure to act has consequences. I believe it is time for us to come \ntogether--even though we are in a political season, even though we have \na Presidential campaign--and do our work on behalf of the American \npeople and the people of my State of Colorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I just wanted \nto commend Senator Bennet for the outstanding work he is doing on the \nbudget issue, and particularly cite the fact of the cooperation of the \nSenator from Colorado and the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, which \nillustrates how important it is to try find some common ground. That is \nwhat I am going to be trying to do on the health care issue coming up. \nBut I wanted to commend the Senator from Colorado for his good work.\n  As the Senate focuses on the budget, and certainly the American \npeople hear the discussion about health care and particularly what is \ngoing on in the supercommittee, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout how there is an opportunity to come together in a bipartisan way, \nparticularly with older people, to show that it is possible for them to \nget more of the care they want, particularly care at home, for a price \nthat is lower for taxpayers, reduced costs for the taxpaying public.\n  This all came to light through an extremely important hearing that \nwas held in the Senate Finance Committee on which I serve. Chairman \nBaucus took the time to look at the care of those who are some of the \nneediest and most vulnerable in our country. They are the older people \nwho are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  In the fancy jargon of American health care, they are called the dual \neligibles. But I think anybody looking at the American health care \nsystem knows that these are some of those who are most vulnerable and \nmost harmed when they fall between the cracks in the health care \nsystem. The fact is, the ball game as it relates to Medicare--I know \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate has spent a lot of time on those \nbudget issues--is all about chronic disease. That is where the Medicare \ndollars go. It goes into the treatment of heart and stroke and \ndiabetes. That is where the money really goes.\n  Millions of those who suffer from these devastating illnesses are \nthose folks I am speaking about, the dual-eligible people who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Millions of them are eligible \nfor alternative services, particularly services at home. But right now, \na disproportionately large number of them get their care in the most \nexpensive kind of setting, a place where they do not want to be--the \nhospital and the hospital emergency room.\n  The fact is, all over the country--in the State of Ohio, in the State \nof Missouri--every single day these folks are going in ambulances to \nhospital emergency rooms. Often they end up having to go on a life \nflight, essentially in the air to these facilities. As of today, even \nthough we have more than 9 million of these individuals who are on both \nMedicare and Medicaid, according to Dr. Don Berwick at the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, only about 100,000 of them are being \ntaken care of at home.\n  So, of course, the Congress worked on the health reform issue, and it \nwas possible in that legislation to move to take a few thousand more, a \nfew thousand more than the 100,000 that are now being taken.\n  As Chairman Baucus highlighted just a few days ago, we ought to get \nserious about this and do a lot more because older people, if we come \nup with approaches that allow them to get cared for at home, will feel \nbetter about our health care system and better about the decisions that \nare being made here, and taxpayers are going to save money.\n  Anybody who questions whether this is possible ought to look at the \nlatest information that is coming from the Veterans' Administration. \nThey have 250 locations--locations all around the country--for the \nprogram they use called the Home-Based Primary Care Program. The only \ndifference between that VA program and essentially what is being done \non the Medicare and Medicaid side is that the VA patients are even \nsicker than those who have been treated in the Medicare and Medicaid \nstudies.\n  The latest information shows that caring for older veterans in the \nhome has reduced hospital stays by 62 percent, nursing home stays by 88 \npercent, and cost by 24 percent. Let's just for a moment focus on that \nnumber--a cost savings of 24 percent--while the older veteran gets more \nof what they want, which is to be at home for the care they need rather \nthan in these institutional settings, whether they are hospitals, \nhospital emergency rooms, what have you. We have new information, \nspecific, concrete information.\n  So that colleagues know, those who are specialists in this area at \nthe University of Pennsylvania who have looked particularly at the \nmodel that was recently included in the affordable care act have said \nthat if that model was fully implemented for caring for these \nindividuals at home, it is their judgment that it would be possible to \nsave in the vicinity of $30 billion a year.\n  These are enormous sums of money, and to be able to make those \nsavings while we say to older people in Missouri, in Oregon, and around \nthe country: You are going to get more of what you want, which is care \nat home, at a price lower than the alternative--that looks like a \npretty good opportunity.\n  As the supercommittee goes forward with its work, there are some \nquestions about whether they need additional legislative authority to \ndo their work. If they do, I think certainly the supercommittee, in \nconjunction with both the full Senate and the House, ought to give it \nto them. My own sense is that they probably don't need additional \nlegislative authority, but certainly there will be support in the \nSenate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators Baucus and \nHatch, both of whom have done very good work on this issue, to move \nlegislatively, whether it is in the supercommittee or through the full \nSenate, legislation that would allow us to dramatically expand this \nprogram.\n  I know the Senator from Minnesota cares a great deal about seniors \nand these issues. Just a little bit of history. As I sat in the Senate \nFinance Committee a few days ago listening to how we ought to have some \nmore pilot projects and some demonstrations and some studies, I thought \nabout the days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, about \nthree decades ago. I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks and \nall of that kind of thing. We were talking then in much the same way I \nheard the discussion going in the Senate Finance Committee--about \ndemonstrations and pilots and the like. To a very good person at the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Melanie Bella, and in \nconversations later with Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch, I basically \nsaid: We have to change this because if we don't, my prediction is that \n10 years or so from now, they will be back in the Senate Finance \nCommittee having pretty much the same discussion. They will be talking \nabout a few pilot projects, demonstrations, and a few more studies, and \nby that time, the number of those who are eligible for both Medicare \nand Medicaid will be lot more than the 9 million who are eligible \ntoday. It will be many times that, and we will have wasted many \nbillions of dollars more. So now is the time to do it.\n  I would like to close simply by picking up on a point Senator Bennet \nmade about trying to find common ground. This question of independence \nat home has strong bipartisan support. In the other body, the principal \nsponsor, Congressman Ed Markey, worked with\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\nChris Smith of New Jersey, Michael Burgess of Texas--two very strong \nconservatives--over the years, and in the Senate, I have been honored \nto have Senator Chambliss, Senator Burr, and a number of other \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle say that this makes sense both \nfor older people and for taxpayers.\n  In the next few days, Senators are going to hear from about 100 \nhealth care groups around the country making the case for the \nCongress--starting with the supercommittee, going through our work in \nthe Senate and the House--to get serious about dramatically expanding, \nmassively expanding the number of older people who are cared for at \nhome, where they want to be, which will result in savings to the \ntaxpayers at the same time.\n  This is something that should not be allowed to be delayed or put off \nany further. After decades of talking about how it makes sense and \nstudying it and having some pilot projects and some demonstration \nprojects, I think it is time when doctors come to the Senate \nPresident's office and patients come to the Senate President's office \nand say: I am very concerned about these cuts. I am convinced it is \ngoing to reduce access. The providers say: I am not going to be able to \nserve the same number of people. Older people, we know, are calling our \noffice saying they are frightened about how it is going to affect them.\n  It is time for us to be able to come together in the Senate in the \nkind of spirit Senator Bennet was talking about, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to say: Look, here is something that works. We know it \nworks; it was proven by Chairman Baucus's recent hearing. We now know, \nbased on the VA's important new study with respect to how you can care \nfor older people at home, that we have an opportunity to significantly \nexpand care for older people at home and generate significant budget \nsavings. It will be bipartisan. It is something that ought to be picked \nup by the supercommittee. It ought to be picked up by the full Senate \nand the full House, and we need to do it now.\n  If we don't do this now and if it is put off again, after Chairman \nBaucus's important hearings to once again open the door to major \nreform, as sure as night follows the day, Congresses 5, 10 years from \nnow will be debating the same thing. I don't think that is right.\n  Holding down health care costs doesn't have to mean benefit cuts or \ncuts to reimbursements. We have a chance, with this Independence at \nHome Program, to secure for older people more of the care they need in \nthe comfort of their own homes, and employers are actually rewarded \nwith shared savings for delivering the kind of quality care they have \nalways wanted to provide. These ideas, by the way, are voluntary. No \nolder person, no senior citizen is required to participate in it.\n  We are going to get around to every Senator's office the findings of \nthis new VA study. It comes from 250 locations in each State and DC. \nThere are cost savings of 24 percent, hospital stay reductions of 62 \npercent, and nursing home stay reductions of 88 percent. These are \ndocumented savings for older people who are even sicker than those who \nwould be served by programs outside the VA.\n  This is the time. We have talked about it long enough. If the \ngovernment needs additional legislative authority, it will be possible \nto give that through the supercommittee. I urge all of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to pick up on the \nstrong bipartisan support that exists for independence-at-home \nservices, particularly for those who are eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid. They are the most vulnerable in our society. Those \nindividuals and the programs they rely on, paid for by taxpayers, \ndeserve better. We now have the opportunity to ensure they get it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``Independence \nat Home: Better Health Care at Lower Cost.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Independence at Home--Better Health Care at Lower Cost\n\n       Holding down health costs doesn't have to mean benefit cuts \n     or cuts to reimbursement. With Independence at Home (IAH), \n     beneficiaries get more of what they need--in the comfort of \n     their own home--and providers receive shared savings as a \n     reward for delivering the kind of quality care they have \n     always wanted to provide. The beneficiary and provider get \n     more; the federal government pays less.\n       The IAH program is designed to allow America's seniors to \n     remain as independent as possible and avoid unnecessary \n     hospitalizations, ER visits and nursing home admissions.\n       Enrollment in an IAH program is completely voluntary, and \n     participating beneficiaries do not relinquish access to any \n     existing Medicare benefit or any practitioner or provider.\n       Primary care is available to beneficiaries in their homes \n     through ``housecalls'' by teams of health care professionals \n     tailored to the beneficiaries' chronic conditions.\n       The IAH program holds participating practitioners and \n     providers strictly accountable for (a) good outcomes, (b) \n     patient/caregiver satisfaction and (c) minimum savings to \n     Medicare of 5% annually.\n       IAH is Voluntary--IAH allows practitioners and providers \n     voluntarily to enter into 3-year agreements with HHS under \n     which they are held strictly accountable for (a) minimum \n     savings to Medicare each year of 5%, (b) improved patient \n     outcomes, and (c) patient/caregiver satisfaction. Eligible \n     beneficiaries voluntarily enroll in IAH programs and may \n     disenroll at any time for any reason. There is no mandate and \n     beneficiaries are not ``assigned.''\n       IAH Targets Cost Where They Are Highest--The Independence \n     at Home (IAH) program targets the 5%-25% of Medicare \n     beneficiaries with multiple chronic diseases like diabetes \n     and heart disease who account for 43% to 85% of Medicare \n     costs. IAH reduces Medicare's cost where they are the \n     highest, not by cutting reimbursement or coverage, but rather \n     by providing a new chronic care coordination service tailored \n     to the needs of Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic \n     diseases.\n       IAH Lowers the Cost of Care--IAH reduces costs by allowing \n     beneficiaries to remain independent at home and avoid \n     hospitalization, ER visits and nursing home admissions.\n       IAH Has Been Proven Effective--The Veterans Administration \n     (VA) has been providing Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) \n     programs since the early 1970s The VA's Home Based Primary \n     Care program operates in 250 locations in every state and \n     D.C. and has reduced hospital days by 62%, nursing home days \n     by 88%, and costs by 24%.\n       IAH Can Be Implemented Immediately--More than 100 health \n     care organizations across the country are ready to implement \n     the IAH program immediately.\n       IAH Has Bipartisan Support--The IAH demonstration received \n     unanimous bipartisan support when it was included in the \n     PPACA by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the \n     Senate Finance Committee.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I was pleased that earlier today the \nSenate voted to move forward with the China currency legislation that \nhas been worked on for so many years by Senators Schumer and Graham, \nand I am pleased to join with them. I supported similar legislation in \n2005. I will say a couple things as our Members evaluate what they will \ndo on final passage.\n  I believe in trade. I believe in good trade, and most trade is good \ntrade. Countries do need to compete with the production in other \ncountries. If you have a trade partner, normally both partners, through \na relationship, benefit. In a treaty, trade, or business relationship, \nif one party to that relationship is being damaged by that \nrelationship, then they have to confront the problem and fix it or \nwithdraw from the relationship. That is just the way life is.\n  I see that some of my free market friends--and I have a lot of them--\non trade issues are religious about it. It is a religion with them. \nThey don't want to analyze whether the trading agreement advantages the \nUnited States or the other party; they just want to say: If it is a \ntrade agreement, be for it. Anything that promotes trade is good, and \npeace will break out in the world.\n  Well, that is not right, and that is not what I think conservatives \nbelieve. I am a conservative--a conservative who believes in reality. \nConservatism is a cast of mind, not an ideology. It is an approach to \ncomplex issues. As my friend Bob Tyrrell at the American Spectator \nsaid, it is an approach to issues, a cast of mind.\n  How do you approach this matter? We are getting hurt in this \nrelationship. Every editorial I have seen--even those groups who are \nspecifically advocating against this legislation contend and \nacknowledge that the United States is being disadvantaged by this \ncurrency manipulation. They all acknowledge that. When you acknowledge \nthat, you acknowledge that we\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nare losing jobs and losing manufacturing in this country as a result, \nnot of competition, but of unfair competition.\n  Let's be in contact with reality. The People's Republic of China is \nstate-dominated. Those companies are not free to do as they normally \nwould in the United States. It is a state-dominated thing. Every agenda \ncarried out by China--by their companies even--tends to be driven by \nexpanding the national interest of China.\n  That is the way they think and that is the way they operate. Their \ntheory of trade is mercantilist. They believe in maximizing their \nexports, minimizing their imports, and accumulating wealth.\n  Some of our friends here say: Oh, it is all right. The products that \nare sold at Walmart are from China and, all right, yes, we closed a \nfactory in the United States. But don't worry, Mother can buy her \nsneakers or her children's clothes cheaper because it is imported. \nDon't worry about it. Manufacturing is not that important, they have \ntold us.\n  We have seen that in the writings around the Nation from some of our \ngreat economic minds. But I don't believe that is true. I do not \nbelieve this Nation can be a strong, vibrant force in the world without \na manufacturing sector.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Schulz, the CEO of ThyssenKrupp, a \nsteel company in Germany. He just retired. He is 70 and a very \nimpressive man. He was investing in my home State of Alabama, and he \nsaid publicly and to me privately, with great passion, you have to have \na renaissance of manufacturing. He said: Germany was criticized for \nattempting to hold on to its manufacturing base in Europe, people \nsaying they were not part of the modern economy--the service economy. \nBut he said: We did more than most of the Europeans to maintain our \nmanufacturing base, and we are now the healthiest economy in Europe.\n  We have to have a manufacturing base. Wealth is sent abroad every \ntime we purchase imported products. The deficit with China last year \nwas $273 billion. This year it will be the largest in history--$300 \nbillion. There has never been a trading relationship result in deficits \nas large as those in the history of the world. China is the second \nlargest economy in the world. China is growing rapidly. They have been \ndoing this for a decade.\n  Let me say I celebrate prosperity in China. I would like to see \nprosperity in all the nations of the world, and they will benefit the \nUnited States, not harm us, if China is prosperous. But if their \nprosperity is driven by disadvantaging the United States to their \nadvantage, as the currency process does, then that is a different \nstory. It is not a fair competition and it is not helpful to the United \nStates.\n  We are told this will not hurt us, that we can move to a service \neconomy, that we don't have to have manufacturing, and the doctrine of \ncomparative advantage is such that if a product can be manufactured \ncheaper in China, so be it. We will put the American businesses out of \nbusiness. Let them close their doors.\n  As a conservative, I am not comfortable with that and let me say why. \nFirst, this creates too rapid a dislocation in our economy, causing too \nmuch damage societally from rapid unemployment and closing of \nmanufacturing in our country. Secondly, we now know with certainty that \nthe manipulation of currency--the 30-percent or 25-percent difference--\nis resulting in unfair competition with American businesses and causing \nthe closing down of businesses.\n  We have a chance to rebound, I am convinced, in manufacturing. \nChina's salaries are going up. Salaries around the world are going up. \nChina's utilities and energy costs are higher than ours. Their \nadvantages are not so great as they were a few years ago, and we are \nbecoming more sophisticated. Our businesses are lean and competitive \nnow. I think we have a real chance to get back into the game but not if \nwe have a 25- to 30-percent currency differential, where when we sell a \nproduct to China it costs 25 percent more than the competing Chinese \nproduction would, and when they sell to our country they have a 25-\npercent advantage over our manufacturers. When margins are as close as \nthey are in the world economy today, that is too large. Any unfairness \nis too large. So I would contend we have to act. Thirdly, there is \ndamage being done to the middle class in our country, and a large part \nof it is arising out of unfair trade practices. We have to be aware \nthat millions of Americans are hurting. Maybe the wife, maybe the \nhusband has lost his or her job and is now unemployed, and families are \nstruggling to get by. Wages are not going up. In fact, wages have \ntrended down just a little bit. Unemployment is not going down. It is \nmaybe going up now for the last several months. Inflation is on the \nscene.\n  If the wages aren't going up, the number of people employed isn't \ngoing up, we get into a situation in which we can't see economic growth \noccur. There is not extra money to go to the store or market to buy \nthings. As one businessman told me, one of the great marketing chains \nin the United States--Walmart: People don't have the money to come to \nthe store to buy anything. If a person doesn't have a job, they don't \nhave the money to buy anything.\n  So this is a serious economic problem we are facing. I have come to \nthe conclusion we can no longer borrow money to spend today to try to \ncreate a sugar high and jump-start our economy. That didn't work \nbefore. We don't have the money and the debt is already too great. We \nneed to look for ways to create American jobs now without costing the \nU.S. Treasury or raising taxes on an already weak economy. This is one \nof those things we can do. Senators Schumer, Brown, Graham, and I \nagree, in a bipartisan way, this is a way to create jobs without \nharming our economy, without raising the debt of America. It is a \nbipartisan act to create greater employment by simply eliminating an \nunfairness that is hammering American manufacturers and American \nworkers.\n  Some say if we insist on this, China will be offended. First, China \nis a great nation. They have the second largest economy in the whole \nworld. They are bellicose. They attack us aggressively. We don't hide \nunder the table when they say something bad about the United States, do \nwe? Neither are they going to hide under the table if the Senate, the \nCongress says they have to get their currency correct. Great nations \ndon't wither and crawl away.\n  I was looking at an article in Forbes magazine, written by Mr. Gordon \nChang, who talked about this question posed by Chris Chocola, the \npresident of the Club for Growth, who opposes this legislation. Mr. \nChocola asked this: ``What do they say to arguments that starting a \ntrade war with China would kill jobs, not create them?''\n  In other words, Mr. Chocola is saying, if we start a trade war, we \nare going to lose jobs. First of all, Mr. Chocola's hands are not so \nclean in this issue. When he was in the House of Representatives a few \nyears ago, he introduced a bill--the China Act--that would have imposed \ntariffs on China if it tried to manipulate its currency, according to \nhis press release at the time. I guess he has changed his mind. We all \nhave a right to change our minds. But I will just say I am not too \nimpressed with that argument, and I would note that Mr. Chang, in his \ncomments about it, made a very good point.\n\n  Writing in Forbes, he says:\n\n       Chocola is correct that a trade war with China would kill \n     jobs--but most of them would be in China.\n\n  That is absolutely so. A trade war will not occur, in my opinion. But \nif we had a trade war, Mr. Chocola says it would hurt jobs in the \nUnited States. But Chang continues:\n\n       How do we know this? Last year, the United States ran a \n     deficit in trade in goods with that country of $273.1 \n     billion. In trade wars, it is the surplus countries--\n     countries that depend on exports--that get hurt. Americans \n     know this because we were the powerhouse exporter in the \n     1930s when nations fought a tariff war.\n\n  That was when the Depression hit and trade froze after tariffs and \nother actions and we were hurt the most because we were exporting \ngoods. In this case, China would be hurt the most. Mr. Chang goes on to \nnote how large China's economy is and its dependence on exports to the \nUnited States. He says:\n\n       And this is a pretty good indication that Beijing, although \n     it will undoubtedly huff and puff and might engage in minor \n     retaliation, will not escalate the fight. China cannot afford \n     more unemployment.\n\n  Mr. Chang quotes Premier Wen Jiabao as saying, if you change this\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\ncurrency, ``countless Chinese workers become unemployed.''\n  What does that say? The Premier of China is saying, if we have a fair \ncurrency rate, the Chinese would lose jobs. Somebody is going to gain \nthose jobs--maybe it will be in Dayton or maybe it will be in \nBirmingham or Mobile.\n  As Mr. Chang says, and this puts it on the line:\n\n       If China manipulates its currency to gain a trade \n     advantage, then Premier Wen is seeking to put American \n     workers on the bread line.\n\n  Not Chinese workers on the bread line. Quoting the article further:\n\n       So Donald Trump hit the mark when he tweeted last week that \n     ``China is stealing our jobs.''\n\n  I am not here trying to condemn China. I am here saying we have \nfailed to aggressively defend our legitimate national interests, and we \nneed to do that. I believe this legislation puts us on that path.\n  I believe in trade. I expect to support the Colombian trade bill as \nit comes forward. I think it serves our national interest. The \nPanamanian trade bill serves our national interest and will help us be \nmore profitable. I believe the trade agreement we have negotiated with \nSouth Korea is also in our national interest and will help us. But this \ndeal needs to be fixed. It is time to stop it. It has gone on too long.\n  It is great to see my colleague, Senator Brown. I know he will be \nready to talk as we move forward to final passage, but let me \ncongratulate Senator Brown and Senator Schumer and others who have \nworked on the bill. I believe it is a reasonable piece of legislation, \nand it provides exits if something dangerous were to occur. It gives \ndiscretion to the President to delay, even stop, actions that might \noccur under this process if it is damaging to the United States, and it \ngives Congress a chance to be involved in that process.\n  This is the right way to do it. If someone has some better ideas, \nmaybe we can improve the bill. But fundamentally, I think it is a good \npiece of legislation that will do the job, and I am proud to be a part \nof this bipartisan effort that has moved this legislation that will \nhelp create American jobs without expanding our debt.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to speak at this watershed moment \nin the U.S.-China relationship. This is a relationship that will affect \nour children's future. And how we manage this relationship now will \nhelp determine the long-term strength of our Nation.\n  Warren Buffett has an answer for anyone who questions America's \nfuture.\n  As he said earlier this year:\n\n       The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important \n     factor that is certain: Human potential is far from \n     exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that \n     potential--a system that has worked wonders for over two \n     centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and \n     even a Civil War--remains alive and effective . . . Now, as \n     in 1776, 1861, 1932 and 1941, America's best days lie ahead.\n\n  I agree.\n  America has the world's best universities, a tradition of brilliant \nentrepreneurship, and the drive and ingenuity of our people.\n  We gave the world the light bulb, the airplane, the Polio vaccine, \nthe personal computer, and the Internet. We have been the world's \nengine of innovation for more than a century.\n  But we cannot rest on our laurels. We can and must rise to the \nchallenge of China. This is a challenge I recognized long ago. That is \nwhy I led the effort to grant permanent normal trade relations to \nChina, so we could begin to get China to play by the rules.\n  That is also why I have traveled to China eight different times, to \nstress to their leaders the importance of playing by those rules.\n  China has grown explosively during that time period. It is now the \nsecond-largest economy in the world. And it continues to expand.\n  China's growth presents real opportunities for American entrepreneurs \nand workers. Over the last decade, our exports to China have increased \nby close to 500 percent. That is eight times faster than the growth of \nour exports to the rest of the world. China is now the third-largest \nmarket in the world for U.S. exports. And it is the number one market \nfor U.S. agricultural exports.\n  But we should not blind ourselves to the very real challenges that \nChina also poses to American entrepreneurs and workers. Too often, \nChina seeks an unfair advantage in international trade, including by \nmanipulating the value of its currency.\n  In my most recent trip to China last November, I met with Vice \nPresident Xi Jinping and other top leaders. We discussed a broad range \nof issues.\n  On currency, my message was clear: China needed to allow its currency \nto appreciate more quickly to market levels. If not, the U.S. Congress \nlikely would take up--and pass--currency legislation.\n  Since my trip, China has only allowed its currency to appreciate by 3 \npercent. The Chinese government continues to intervene to keep its \ncurrency significantly below its real market value. That is why I \nintend to support this bill.\n  I did not come to this decision lightly. I have never favored \nunilateral approaches. But the time has come to take action.\n  And the United States needs a thoughtful China policy that takes \naction on other fronts as well. The currency issue is only one of many \nproblems facing American companies in China.\n  The problem of intellectual property theft in China is enormous. To \ncite but one example, an astounding 80 percent of the software \ninstalled on Chinese computers is pirated. That represents an enormous \nlost opportunity for U.S. software companies, who lead the world in \ninnovation.\n  And China bars many of our exports from entering its market at all. \nChina shuts out American beef exports entirely. And it imposes barriers \nthat effectively prevent the entry of U.S. companies into its banking, \ninsurance, and telecommunications sectors.\n  So while this bill addresses an important piece of the puzzle, it is \nnot enough for China to appreciate its currency. China can and must \ntake action to address these other problems as well.\n  Ultimately, though, America's future as a great economic power will \nnot be dictated by what China does. It will be dictated by what we do. \nIt is about us.\n  It is about the principles that made America great. It is about our \nfreedom, our justice, our democracy, and the will, creativity, and \nendurance of our people. And it is about what we must do to get our own \nhouse in order so that we can continue to compete and win on the global \nstage.\n  We must focus on policies and initiatives that encourage American \nentrepreneurship.\n  We must nurture and protect American innovation, both at home and \nabroad. That is why I introduced a bill to strengthen the research and \ndevelopment tax credit and make it permanent.\n  We also must reform our Tax Code to unleash new investment and make \ncollege more accessible. That is why I have been holding a series of \nFinance Committee hearings to pave the way for tax reform.\n  And we must work together to open export markets around the world. \nThat's why I strongly support the pending free trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  We took an important step last month to pave the way for these trade \nagreements when we renewed trade adjustment assistance with a strong \nbipartisan vote. It is now time to approve the trade agreements \nthemselves so that American entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and \nranchers can unlock the potential of these key export markets.\n  So as we debate this bill, let us not forget that the currency issue \nis only one of many challenges in our relationship with China. Let us \nalso be mindful of our larger challenges both at home and abroad. And \nlet us continue to nurture American entrepreneurship here at home so \nthat we remain the world's engine of innovation.\n  As long as we do so, we can be sure that, as always, America's best \ndays lie ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 14 million Americans are currently \nunemployed. The American people are resilient, strong and hard-working. \nIf they are given a fair shot, they will succeed. Unfortunately, as the \nworld keeps getting flatter, as our global economy grows, Americans are \nnot always given a fair shot.\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n  Last year the United States had a $273 billion trade deficit with \nChina. That means the U.S. imports more goods from China than China \nimports from the U.S.--$273 billion more. This is because Chinese goods \nare cheaper. Why? Because China undervalues it currency.\n  Madam President, 2.8 million jobs have been lost to China since 2001. \n1.9 million of them are manufacturing jobs. And 117,000 jobs were in \nIllinois. Congress needs to help restore the strength of domestic \nmanufacturing and bring jobs back to the United States.\n  In 2001 China joined the WTO and agreed to play by the rules. China \nagreed to be on a level playing field with other countries, to employ \nfair trade practices. That means no export subsidies and no product \ndumping. China agreed to those terms, but it hasn't always acted in \naccordance with them.\n  China is breaking the rule undervaluing its currency. China \nundervalues it currency by anywhere from 15 percent to 50 percent--\ndepending on the methodology used. When the Yuan--China's currency--is \nlow compares to the dollar, Chinese products are cheap while U.S. \nproducts are expensive. So Americans buy cheap goods made in China, but \nthe Chinese do not buy goods made in America, made more expensive by \ntheir currency manipulation. How is that fair to U.S. and American \nworkers?\n  According to a recent report, if China revalued its currency, we \nwould see U.S. GDP increase by $287.7 billion, creation of 2.25 million \nU.S. jobs, and a lowering of the U.S. budget deficit by $71.4 billion.\n  We don't shy away from competition in America. We play fair because \nwe know that we can compete with any other country in a fair fight. \nThis bill marks an important step toward job creation and restoring the \nstrength of America's economy in a globalized world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I appreciate very much Senator \nSessions' comments, and even more I appreciate his work on this \nlegislation. He was one of a couple of real key players in this \nlegislation passing because he did such a good job of explaining to \ncolleagues why this is a plus for American manufacturing and a plus for \njob growth in our country.\n  I think about his comments, and the major opposition to this bill has \nbeen an accusation or a contention from opponents--whether from some \nMembers of the Senate or the House or some newspapers or economists--\nwho say this would result in a trade war.\n  Fundamentally, as Senator Sessions' comments indicate, the Chinese \nare not going to initiate a trade war against their largest customer. \nWe buy one-third of Chinese exports. Of all the hundreds of billions of \ndollars of exports they do around the world, one-third comes to the \nUnited States of America.\n  Pretend you are in business for yourself and you have a customer who \nbuys one-third of your products, and they do something to make you mad. \nAre you going to declare war on them? No. You are going to sit down and \nfigure out how to make it work.\n  We can never predict the future on darned near anything with \ncertainty, whether it is the Minnesota Twins finishing in last place \nthis year, Madam President--which I never would have predicted because \nthey were a good team in previous years--or whether it is trade law or \nthe economy. But we knew that as soon as we passed this, two things \nwould happen.\n  One is that the Chinese--in this case it was the People's Bank of \nChina, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I think, and the Ministry of \nCommerce--would immediately squawk: Trade war, trade war, trade war. \nUnfortunately, some others in this body and the newspapers mimicked \nthat, but it wasn't going to result in that.\n  The other thing we could pretty certainly predict based on history is \nthat the Chinese, after this strong vote--which we got, thanks in large \npart to Senator Sessions--of 62 votes earlier today, are probably going \nto let their currency appreciate a little bit because they know we are \ncalling their bluff. But for sure it doesn't make sense for them to \ninitiate trade wars. They may fight on some individual issues. They may \nfight on some products that were made in Ohio or Alabama and fight back \none issue at a time, and we will go to the WTO, the World Trade \nOrganization, and have at it in a legal way, and we will win most of \nthem because they are gaming the system. We might lose one of our \nmanufacturers, but we know in the end it will work out.\n  That is why Senator Sessions is dead right that this is right and \nthat it is going to create jobs in our country. We have seen the trade \ndeficit increase, and increase almost three times what it was when this \nstarted 10 years ago. We are going to be in a much better place--not \ntomorrow or the next day, but next year, if we can get this through the \nHouse of Representatives--I am not assuming we will get this passed \ntoday; I think we will here--if we get it to the House of \nRepresentatives, overwhelming support, 60 Republican cosponsors, 150 \nDemocratic cosponsors, something like that--they will want to move the \nbill in the House.\n  The President and the Republican leadership in the House aren't quite \nwhere Senator Sessions and I are, but public pressure will get to them, \nand we expect this bill to get to the President's desk. I think he will \nsign it in the end, and I think it is good for Alabama, good for Ohio, \nand good for the other 48 States.\n  American manufacturing is what built this country. You really only \ncreate wealth through mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. The \nPresiding Officer's home State of Minnesota has done all of those very \nwell over the years--mining where she grew up, and agriculture, which \nis huge and which is why she is on the Agriculture Committee, as I am. \nAnd manufacturing; Minnesota has done a lot of manufacturing.\n  In my home State of Ohio, we are third in the country in \nmanufacturing output, behind only Texas, twice our size, and \nCalifornia, three times our size. So we know how to produce. We just \nwant a level playing field to do it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Daily Digest clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask that I be able to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               CLASS Act\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \none of the dirty little secrets around here, and that is the ticking \ntime bomb that is right under our noses and that, until recently, had \nbeen virtually ignored until some recent activity in Congress and at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services brought the program into \nthe spotlight. That time bomb is the CLASS Act.\n  It is a long-term care entitlement program created by the health care \nreform law. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal described the inclusion \nof the CLASS program in the health care law as the definition of \ninsanity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \narticle from the Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 4, 2011]\n\n                       The Definition of Insanity\n\n       Why no one wants to repeal a program that everyone knows is \n     a fraud.\n       The Obama health-care plan passed 18 months ago, and its \n     cynicism still manages to astonish. Witness the spectacle \n     surrounding one of its flagship new entitlements, which is \n     eliciting some remarkable concessions from its drafters.\n       The Health and Human Services Department recently shut down \n     a government insurance program for long-term care, known by \n     the acronym Class. HHS also released a statement claiming \n     that reports that HHS is shutting down Class are ``not \n     accurate.'' All HHS did was suspend Class policy planning, \n     told Senate Democrats to zero out Class funding for 2012, \n     reassigned Class's career staffers to other projects and \n     pink-slipped the program's chief actuary. Other than that, \n     it's full-speed ahead.\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\n       HHS is denying what everyone knows to be true because \n     everyone also knows that the Class entitlement was not merely \n     created to crowd out private insurance for home health aides \n     and the like. Class was added to the bill because it was \n     among the budget gimmicks that Democrats needed to create the \n     illusion that trillions of dollars of new spending would \n     somehow reduce the deficit.\n       Benefits in the Class program, which was supposed to start \n     up next year, are rigged by an unusual five-year vesting \n     period. So the people who sign up begin paying premiums \n     immediately--money that Democrats planned to spend \n     immediately on other things, as if the back-loaded payments \n     to Class beneficiaries would never come due. The $86 billion \n     or so that would have built up between 2012 and 2021 with the \n     five-year lead is supposed to help finance the rest of \n     ObamaCare. The Class program would go broke sometime in the \n     next decade, but that would be somebody else's problem.\n       Opponents warned about this during the reform debate, and \n     people on HHS's lower rungs were telling their political \n     superiors the same thing as early as mid-2009, according to \n     emails that a joint House-Senate Republican investigation \n     uncovered.\n       In one 2009 note, chief Medicare actuary Richard Foster--a \n     martyr to fiscal honesty in the health-care debate--wrote \n     that ``Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to \n     believe that this program would collapse in short order and \n     require significant Federal subsidies to continue.'' He \n     suggested that Class would end in an ``insurance death \n     spiral'' because the coverage would only be attractive to \n     sicker people who will need costly services. It could only be \n     solvent if 230 million Americans enrolled, which is more than \n     the current U.S. workforce.\n       An HHS Office of Health Reform official, Meena Seshamani, \n     rejected Mr. Foster's critique because ``per CBO it is \n     actuarially sound.'' But of course CBO only scores what is \n     presented to it, no matter how unrealistic. Despite this \n     false reassurance, later even one HHS political appointee \n     took up Mr. Foster's alarms, writing that Class ``seems like \n     a recipe for disaster to me.''\n       In February of this year, Health and Human Services \n     Secretary Kathleen Sebelius finally admitted the obvious, \n     testifying at a Congressional hearing that, gee whiz, Class \n     is ``totally unsustainable'' as written. By then Class had \n     become a political target of vulnerable Senate Democrats \n     looking to shore up their fiscal bona fides, despite voting \n     for it when they voted for ObamaCare.\n       Bowing to this political need, Mrs. Sebelius has repeatedly \n     promised to use her administrative discretion to massage \n     Class's finances until it is solvent. But given that the \n     office doing that work has now been disbanded, this evidently \n     proved impossible, as the critics claimed all along.\n       All of this would seem to make repealing Class an easy vote \n     for Congress, but, this being Washington, it isn't. Since the \n     CBO says Class's front-loaded collections cut the deficit to \n     the tune of that $86 billion, HHS has to pretend that the \n     program is still alive to preserve these phantom savings.\n       Some Republicans are also nervous about repealing Class \n     because, under CBO's perverse scoring, they'll be adding $86 \n     billion to the deficit. Others would prefer not to repeal any \n     of ObamaCare until they repeal all of it, on grounds that \n     some of it might survive if the worst parts go first.\n       So an unaffordable entitlement that will be a perpetual \n     drain on taxpayers may continue to exist because of a make-\n     believe budget gimmick that everyone now admits is bogus. \n     Congress can't reduce real future liabilities because it \n     would mean reducing fake current savings.\n       This is literally insane. It's rare to get a political \n     opening to dismantle any entitlement, much less one as large \n     as Class. House Republicans ought to vote to repeal it as \n     soon as possible as an act of fiscal hygiene, forcing Senate \n     Democrats to vote on it and President Obama to confront (even \n     if he won't acknowledge) the fraud he signed into law.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the editorial highlights a point that I \nhave been making since I first offered an amendment to strip the CLASS \nprogram from the health care reform bill back in December of 2009. The \ninclusion of the CLASS program is perhaps one of the most brazen budget \ntricks used by the majority in the health care reform bill. As the Wall \nStreet Journal says:\n\n       CLASS was added to the bill because it was among the budget \n     gimmicks that Democrats needed to create the illusion that \n     trillions of dollars of new spending would somehow reduce the \n     deficit.\n\n  Due to the 5-year vesting period required by the CLASS program, \npremiums will be coming in long before benefits must be paid. That pot \nof money somehow is simultaneously used to reduce the deficit and pay \nfor other programs within the health care reform law.\n  When it is clear to Americans that the money is not there to pay \nbenefits to beneficiaries, this administration will be long gone, and \ntaxpayers are going to be left holding the bag. It is, at best, \ndisingenuous the way the Democrats have promised individuals who \nparticipate in the CLASS programs that their premiums paid into the \nCLASS system will be available to pay out future benefits.\n  When I asked Secretary Sebelius about this program earlier this year \nin a Senate Finance Committee hearing, she called the program ``totally \nunsustainable.''\n  But HHS continued to push forward toward implementation, asserting \nthat they have the authority to make changes in the program.\n  Given the inherent questions in the fiscal sustainability of the \nCLASS Act, I cochaired a bicameral group of Senators and \nRepresentatives, along with Representative Rehberg and Representative \nUpton from the House of Representatives, that investigated the behind-\nthe-scenes story of the CLASS Act. We released the findings of our \ninvestigation last month in a report entitled ``CLASS' Untold Story: \nTaxpayers, Employers, and States on the Hook for Flawed Entitlement \nProgram.'' I commend it to my colleagues. This report can be found by \nvisiting my Web site, http://thune.senate.gov.\n  We found astonishing statements from within the Department of Health \nand Human Services that show the lengths to which the administration \nDemocrats knew this program was on a crash course but proceeded anyway, \nstatements such as, this program is ``a recipe for disaster'' with \n``terminal problems.''\n  The e-mails also show that the independent Chief Actuary for CMS \nsounded the first warning in May of 2009. The Chief Actuary is a \nnonpartisan official who estimates the long-term financial effects of \ncurrent law and proposed legislation. In May 2009, he wrote to other \nHHS officials, some of whom were working directly with Senate \nDemocrats, saying, ``At first glance this proposal doesn't look \nworkable.'' The Chief Actuary said a back-of-the-envelope analysis \nshowed that the program would have to enroll more than 230 million \npeople--more than the number of working adults in the United States--to \nbe financially feasible.\n  A few months later, the Chief Actuary was more assertive in his \ncomments. In July of 2009, after reviewing the latest information from \nSenate Democrats, he wrote HHS officials:\n\n       Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe \n     that this program would collapse in short order and require \n     significant Federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  Unfortunately, Democrats here in the Senate needed the political win \nmore than they needed to hear the truth, so they pushed forward and \nincluded the CLASS Act based off of illusory savings coming in the form \nof incoming premiums from the paychecks of hard-working Americans--\nincidentally, some of whom may never consent to program participation.\n  Late last month, there was another interesting development that \noccurred. The Actuary tasked with designing the CLASS Program announced \nhe was leaving his position at Health and Human Services and that the \nCLASS office was closing. HHS denied closing the CLASS office and said \nthey are still evaluating this program, but in a blog post on \nhealthcare.gov, HHS announced they will be releasing a report on CLASS \nsometime this month. I believe this report will indicate that this \nprogram does not have the fiscal muster to move forward, but it is \npossible that HHS may try to hide that information.\n  If this Congress is truly concerned about long-term deficits, this \nprogram should be at the top of the list of programs to repeal. This \nprogram may not cost taxpayers money in the short term as the premiums \nare coming in, but eventually it will require an ongoing bailout from \ntaxpayers to the tune of billions of dollars.\n  I filed an amendment to the current legislation that is before us to \nrepeal the CLASS Act. It probably will not get a vote today, but I hope \nthat sometime in the days ahead the Senate will weigh in and exercise \nsome common sense and do what we should have done a long time ago; that \nis, strike and eliminate this program so we do not have to deal with \nthis massive timebomb that is ticking out there, waiting for future \ngenerations of Americans who are going to be stuck with the huge \ndeficits that will occur when the inevitable happens. It is pretty \nclear that it is only a matter of time, as I submitted from the \nstatements that were made by the Actuary at HHS\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\nand statements made by the Congressional Budget Office at the time.\n  There are all kinds of anecdotal evidence out there and all kinds of \nempirical evidence out there that suggests this is a program which is \nheaded for fiscal disaster. It should not have been included as a pay-\nfor in the health reform bill. That is why it was included, because it \nshowed some short-term revenues. But the long-term costs, like many of \nthe programs we funded here in the past, have a long tail on them, and \nthe American taxpayer is going to be stuck on the hook for a long time \ninto the future.\n  I hope we will have the good sense here in the Senate to repeal this \nprogram before it becomes the fiscal nightmare and fiscal disaster I \nthink everybody has predicted it would be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the \nCurrency Exchange Rate Oversight Act of 2011. Before I get into the \nbill, I want to say this is not an easy vote for me. It is a difficult \nvote because, beginning in 1979, I developed a relationship as mayor of \nSan Francisco with China. Over these 30-plus years, I have seen China \nmake the greatest changes of virtually any large country in the world. \nI know China has wanted to reach out, and the United States has reached \nout. On the Pacific Coast we have developed a century of trade which \nlong ago overtook the Atlantic Coast. This trade between Asia and this \ncountry is, indeed, large and prized.\n  During that time, I have had occasion to have meetings with the \nformer President of China, the former Premier of China, and the latest \nForeign Minister on the subject of currency. I have urged each to let \nthe renminbi float freely.\n  In every conversation, they have indicated that Beijing is aware of \nthe situation and the need to allow the renminbi to respond to market \nforces, and there has been some progress. From July 2005 to July of \n2008, the renminbi appreciated by 21 percent against the dollar, and \nsince 2010 it has risen by an additional 7 percent. Unfortunately, \naction on this matter has not been sufficient, and China continues to \nresist a free-floating currency.\n  My last conversation with a major government official took place last \nFriday evening in San Francisco. On Saturday, I pulled out my \nbinoculars. Our home is situated on a hill, and it overlooks San \nFrancisco Bay. I watched the big cargo ships pulling out of the Port of \nOakland going through the Golden Gate. I watched five of them, and I \nsaw they were half loaded. Half-loaded cargo ships leaving the ports of \nAmerica, going to Asia and particularly China, have become more and \nmore a part of daily routine. Most are loaded with scrap paper, but \nequal trade is missing. We import huge amounts of goods from China, and \nthe same amount--with the exception of some high-valued goods--does not \ngo back to China.\n  I believe if we are going to have this great trading basin on the \nPacific Ocean, everybody has to play by the same rules. In my view, \nthis bill is not about putting sanctions on China. It is not about \nimposing retaliatory tariffs. It is about sending a clear message to \nBeijing that we are serious about the need to let the renminbi respond \nfully to market forces.\n  Let me point out that China is not specifically mentioned in this \nbill. The aim is to address misaligned exchange rates whenever we find \nthem. This does not talk about manipulation of rates.\n  The bill has three fundamental purposes. First, it requires Treasury \nto report to Congress which currencies are fundamentally misaligned--\nnot manipulated, but misaligned--including those currencies that \nrequire priority action.\n  Secondly, the legislation provides a mechanism for the Commerce \nDepartment at the request of a U.S. industry to investigate whether an \nundervalued currency constitutes a subsidy subject to retaliatory \ntariffs.\n  Finally, the bill triggers certain penalties. If a priority country \nfails to realign its currency immediately upon designation, additional \nconsequences take effect after 90 and 360 days subject to a \nPresidential waiver.\n  What does this all mean? What it means is that for the first time we \nare going to monitor exchange rates and determine whether any currency \nis misaligned. If that currency, in fact, is misaligned, then the bill \ntriggers a period of time to remedy that misalignment. If it is not \nremedied within 3 months, it provides additional action. Again, all of \nthis is subject to a Presidential waiver.\n  In effect, what you have is the Senate of the United States speaking \nout and saying enough is enough. The time has come to let the renminbi \nfloat freely, just as the dollar floats freely, and we take the upside \nalong with the downside. If that is the case, then you have an equal \nand fair trading community. If it is not the case, you have a downward \nsloping trading community.\n  The penalties include a prohibition on OPIC, the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, loans; increasing antidumping duties on imports \nfrom countries with undervalued currencies; a prohibition on Federal \nprocurement; opposition to any new financing from multilateral banks.\n  There is little doubt that the renminbi is undervalued. The Chinese \nleadership understands it, the Chinese people understand it, and the \nAmerican people understand it.\n  In April 2011, in a study by William Cline and John Williamson at the \nPeterson Institute for International Economics, it was argued that the \nrenminbi is undervalued by approximately 28.5 percent. Other studies \nprovide different estimates, but the conclusion that the renminbi is \nundervalued is constant in virtually every study that has been done. \nThis gives Chinese goods a steep advantage over U.S. goods. It results \nin a loss of U.S. jobs, and it results in my putting on my binoculars \nand watching huge cargo ships leave the large port of Oakland going \nunder the Golden Gate Bridge only half full. When it is half full, it \nis usually waste paper.\n  You can only take so much of this. In my own way, I have been \nimportuning the Chinese for over a decade. They are always polite, they \nalways say, yes, they understand, but they also say, China has to take \nsteps as China can take steps. Well, the United States is now at a \npivotal point. In the great State of California, our unemployment rate \nis over 12 percent, and the half-empty cargo ships have to be filled up \nif we are going to have a fair trading community. As I look at it, \nletting the renminbi float free is what is necessary to do this.\n  In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in September of \n2010, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner argued this:\n\n       The undervalued renminbi helps China's export sector and \n     means imports are more expensive in China than they otherwise \n     would be . . . It encourages outsourcing of production and \n     jobs from the United States. And it makes it more difficult \n     for goods and services produced by American workers to \n     compete with Chinese-made goods and services in China, the \n     United States, and third countries.\n\n  Every economic report agrees with our Treasury Secretary's \nconclusion. History indicates that is correct. Just using one's eyes \nindicates that is happening. Indeed, cheaper Chinese goods lead to \nbigger trade deficits with the United States, and that leads to fewer \nU.S. jobs.\n  Here's another report by economist Robert Scott of the Economic \nPolicy Institute, and he found that between 2001 and 2010, the trade \ndeficit with China cost the United States 2.8 million jobs, of which \n1.9 million were in manufacturing. Nothing makes up for it. We have \ngained in education jobs, health care jobs, but they are minuscule in \ncomparison with the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n  The report also argues that this trade deficit has been compounded by \nChina's decision to keep the renminbi artificially low, essentially \nsubsidizing Chinese exports at the expense of their American \ncompetitors. Regardless of whether the number of job losses is as high \nas the Economic Policy Institute\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nestimates, or as I have just said, at a time when we have got this \nnational unemployment rate at almost 10 percent and 12 percent in \nCalifornia, we have to use every tool at our disposal to put Americans \nback to work. That means, quite simply stated, that the Senate can no \nlonger afford to ignore the devastation of the manufacturing sector in \nthis country.\n  A July 2009 article from the Harvard Business Review by Gary Pisano \nand Willy Shih argues that the decline in manufacturing will negatively \nimpact our status as a leader in innovation. I agree that in order for \nthe United States to address these ills and promote economic growth, we \nhave got to reclaim our leadership in research, development, and high-\ntech manufacturing. In order to do so, we have to address the \nundervaluation of the renminbi. A market-based exchange rate between \nthe renminbi and the dollar is not going to solve all of our problems, \nand nobody should believe it will, but it will create a level playing \nfield. Trading communities cannot long exist on an unlevel trading \nfield.\n  So this is very important for America at this time.\n  In a sense--and I don't like to say this, but in a sense--the \nlegislation is a ``shot across the bow.'' It gives the Treasury \nDepartment and the Commerce Department clear authority to take actions \nagainst undervalued currencies wherever they may occur, and \nparticularly for high priority currencies. But it is also important \nthat this bill is not merely about imposing penalties. It is very well \ndrafted, in my view, and I read it cover to cover. It mandates \nconsultations with priority countries, the International Monetary Fund, \nand key trading partners. In other words, it continues to place an \nemphasis on dialogue and diplomacy.\n  The bill provides another tool for U.S. companies that have been \naffected by cheaper Chinese imports due to an undervalued renminbi. It \nmakes it clear that Congress has the authority to investigate whether \nan undervalued currency is a subsidy subject to countervailing duties, \nand it provides two well-known methodologies to determine the value of \nthe benefit conferred on exports by an undervalued currency.\n  Let me be clear. This bill does not mandate any countervailing \ntariffs due to an undervalued currency. It simply restates that \nCommerce has the authority to investigate whether such duties are \nappropriate if a domestic company provides the proper documentation.\n  Over the past 30 years, in visit after visit, I have seen how \ndialogue and cooperation have solidified ties between the United States \nand China, and Sino-American cooperation is very important. I watched \nthe process becoming the foundation for what I believe is our most \nimportant bilateral relationship. Indeed, in my view, this relationship \ncan positively impact the security and economic well-being of both \ncountries. As such, when addressing disputes that may arise between \nWashington and Beijing, I believe it is in the interests of both \nnations to use diplomacy and negotiation to find commonsense solutions.\n  Yet, on this matter, I believe the time has come. We are past the \npolite talks where people say ``I realize, I know, I understand,'' and \nnot much happens. In the last 10 years, it looked as if China were \ngoing to take action, and then China has retrenched on that action. So \nI believe we must send a clear signal to China that it has to move \nfaster to a market-based exchange rate.\n  I know China doesn't like this. I know it has serious concerns about \nthe bill. I understand that many U.S. companies and national \norganizations that do business in China are concerned about the impact \nthis bill will have on our bilateral economic relationship. But I also \nknow over the 20-year period I have been following the currencies of \nboth countries, the improvement is small, and the impact on the United \nStates has been great.\n  So as a friend of China and a strong supporter of United States-China \nties, I hope this vote will demonstrate our deep concern. I hope it \nwill give the administration the leverage it needs to encourage Beijing \nto work with us and our partners in the international community to \nbring the renminbi into alignment with market forces. I do not say this \nin a hostile way. I say it in friendship and with hope that there is a \nfuture where trading between China and the United States can be on \nequal terms.\n  I also wish to salute the authors of this legislation because I think \nthey have done a very good job. Senator Brown, who is on the floor, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Graham, and others have put forward, I think, \na carefully worded bill which carries with it the real opportunity for \nchange between the trading relationships of our two great countries. So \nI thank them, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:45 \ntonight, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to motions to suspend \nrule XXII with respect to the following amendments: McConnell No. 735, \ndealing with the jobs act; Coburn No. 670, dealing with foreign aid; \nPaul No. 678, Federal funding audit; Barrasso No. 672, cement; Hatch \nNo. 680, currency alternative; Cornyn No. 677, fighter planes to \nTaiwan; and DeMint No. 689, right to work; that upon disposition of the \nmotions to suspend, the pending amendments be withdrawn; that there be \nno other amendments, points of order or motions in order other than \nbudget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that the \nbill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill; finally, that the time until 6:45 be equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to make sure I understand the amendment lineup. \nThe majority leader has substituted, I would say to my friend, or has \nadded a Paul amendment, and it is my understanding Senator Paul is \nwilling to stand down on that for the time being and offer it on some \nother occasion. The Senator has added in place of that----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to that. On the list we \nhave, there were other amendments for Vitter, Brown, and Johanns. It is \nmy understanding we have accepted a vote on all those, except those \nthree. So that is a pretty good batting average.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I am still trying to get this \ncorrect. Let me just ask my friend, the majority leader, did his list \ninclude Coburn No. 670 on foreign aid?\n  Mr. REID. It included Coburn No. 670 on foreign aid, yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It included Barrasso 672 on cement regs?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it did.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It included Hatch 680 On China?\n  Mr. REID. The minority leader is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It included DeMint No. 689 on right to work?\n  Mr. REID. That is true. So I will go over this once again, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It included McConnell No. 735 on stimulus?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Cornyn 677 on Taiwan?\n  Mr. REID. Yes; that is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the majority leader has substituted from the list I \ngave him a Paul amendment--the number of which I don't have----\n  Mr. REID. 678.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Instead of the Johanns amendment on farm dust.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Mr. President, as I have said, the list we were given \non the motions to waive that have been filed, we did not include on our \nlist Vitter, Brown or Johanns.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to try to modify the \nmajority leader's list, not to expand the number because we agree on \nseven. But the list I submitted to the majority leader included the \nJohanns amendment No. 692 on farm dust, instead of\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\nthe Paul amendment, the number of which I do not have.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can't. We have tried, and I can't get \nconsent from my side on that. So I can't do it.\n  But I have offered seven. The one Paul is taken off, and I am glad to \nhear that, but we will be glad to do his. We have offered seven, but it \nis not the seven the minority leader wants.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All I would say to my friend, the majority leader, is \nthat we would sort of like to be able to pick our amendments and not \nhave him pick them. We have worked hard to narrow down to a list of \nseven. Senator Paul graciously decided he would step aside for the \nmoment, and we had included the Johanns amendment on farm dust.\n  I would remind everyone the minority has not been able to offer any \namendments prior to cloture, and now we are left with motions to \nsuspend, at a 67-vote threshold, and all we are asking for is the right \nto pick our own amendments.\n  I appreciate the majority leader agreeing to seven. That is the \nnumber we had finally settled on. But I do think it would be fair to \nlet the minority pick its amendments. We had hundreds of amendments \nthat people would have liked to have had. We worked very hard to get it \nto a list of seven. I don't think it is unreasonable, not having any \namendments prior to cloture, to at least be able to prioritize our \nseven.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, two things: First of all, the Hatch \namendment, that has always been offerable. We would have voted on that, \nand everyone within the sound of my voice should know that.\n  We agreed to that--that he should be able to offer that amendment. We \nalso talked about other amendments that could have been offered. We did \nnot stop the amendments from being offered. My friend the Republican \nleader filled up the slot that was available, and he didn't want to \ntake it down. We were willing, even though they were up there, to move \nother amendments. He didn't want to do that, for reasons I don't \nunderstand, but that is the way it was.\n  We have agreed to seven nongermane, nonrelevant amendments, and I \nthink that is fair. I have worked a good share of this afternoon trying \nto clear some of these other amendments. We have gotten permission from \nthe Democratic Senators to have votes on these matters I have listed. I \ncannot get consent on the Johanns amendment. I cannot get consent on \nthe Brown amendment. I cannot get consent on the Vitter amendment. I \ncan't do that. I have tried. I can't get it done. So these are the ones \nI can get.\n  On the Paul amendment, in my last conversation with the Republican \nleader he told me that Paul wasn't offered, and I appreciate that. But \nthat is where we are. We could have six votes. We could complete this \nvery quickly. I don't like this process, but I am going to go along \nwith it. But that is my consent agreement. I can't do any more.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I might say to my friend, I may be confused from a \nparliamentary point of view, but, technically, I would ask the \nParliamentarian, through the Chair, if it requires consent to offer \nmotions to suspend at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. There is a unanimous consent pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Republican leader would restate the \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. At the end of cloture, would it require consent to \noffer motions to suspend?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once an amendment slot is available, the \nmotion to suspend is in order.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say, again, all we are asking is the \nopportunity to prioritize the seven that the minority would like to \noffer.\n  At the end of cloture, as I just heard the Parliamentarian say, we \nwould be entitled to offer it anyway. We are trying to cooperate and \nget these motions lined up in a way that would give everybody an \nopportunity to vote shortly.\n  I just would say to my friend the majority leader, it doesn't seem to \nme unreasonable for the minority to be able to pick the minority's \namendments. It was challenging enough for us to filter our way through \nthe hundreds that my Members would have liked to have offered to get \ndown to seven. It was particularly challenging since they were not \nallowed to offer any amendments prior to cloture on the bill, which \nwould be the normal process around here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there an objection to my consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent is pending. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Tuesday, 79 Senators moved to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this bill, the China currency \nmanipulation legislation. After the Senate decided it wanted to \nconsider this bill, I spoke with the Republican leader about how the \nSenate could agree to consider a reasonable number of relevant \namendments. The Republican leader responded with a patently nongermane \namendment. That action pretty much froze the amendment process.\n  Notwithstanding that impasse, earlier today 62 Senators moved to \ninvoke cloture on this bill. Manifestly, this is a measure that a \nsupermajority of Senators wish to pass.\n  Now, since the Senate amended rule XXII in 1979, cloture has been a \nprocess to bring Senate consideration to a close. The fundamental \nnature of cloture is to make consideration of the pending measure \nfinite.\n  The terms of rule XXII provide that the question is this, and I \nquote:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be \n     brought to a close.\n\n  Indeed, late this morning, the Republican leader stated, and I also \nquote what my friend the Republican leader said:\n\n       If 60 Senators are in favor of bringing a matter to a \n     conclusion, it will be brought to conclusion. That's just \n     what happened a few minutes ago.\n\n  So I repeat, that is what the Republican leader said.\n  Now, notwithstanding the clear nature of the cloture rule to provide \nfor finite consideration of a measure, a practice has begun in this \nCongress that has undermined the cloture rule. The practice has risen \nof Senators filing multiple motions to suspend the rules for the \nconsideration of further amendments.\n  So on this measure, the Republican Senators have filed nine motions \nto suspend the rules to consider further amendments. But the same logic \nthat allows for nine such motions could lead to the consideration of 99 \nsuch amendments. The logical extension of allowing for the \nconsideration of further amendments, notwithstanding cloture, leads to \na consideration of a potentially unending series of amendments. The \nlogical extension of this practice is to lead to a potentially endless \nvote-arama at the end of cloture.\n  This potential for filibuster by amendment is exactly the \ncircumstance that the Senate sought to end by its 1979 amendments. \nPlainly, Mr. President, this practice has gotten out of hand.\n  I see on the Senate floor the junior Senator from the State of \nOregon. He and a number of other Senators worked very hard at the \nbeginning of this Congress to kind of change what was going on around \nhere, to make things move more quickly, to make things move more \nfairly. There was a lot of talk about we are going to try to move \nthings along, we are not going to hold up motions to proceed, and all \nthat. But that hasn't worked too well.\n  I say to my friend through the Chair, the Senator from Oregon, this \nis another example of how the rules have been abused this Congress. \nThis didn't happen--it happened rarely last Congress, but this is \nstandard procedure now, again, in an effort to avoid the rules.\n  This practice has gotten way out of hand. So notwithstanding this \nabuse, this morning I once again offered to work together with the \nRepublican leader to come to a reasonable number of motions to suspend. \nThe Republican leader and I discussed--we had a list of nine or ten \nmotions to suspend on which he sought votes. I note that\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\nwould be more amendments than the motions already filed by Senators, \nbut in good faith I counteroffered that I would be willing to schedule \nvotes on seven of these Republican motions to suspend.\n  That was reasonable, I thought. The Republican leader rejected that \noffer. That is what has led us to where we are now. Unless the Senate \nvotes to change its precedents today, we will be faced with a \npotentially endless series of motions to suspend the rules after the \nSenate has voted overwhelmingly to bring consideration to a close, and \nthat is a result that a functioning democracy cannot tolerate.\n  I, Mr. President, withdraw my amendment No. 695.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n  Motion to Suspend Rule XXII, Paragraph No. 2, Including Germaneness \n Requirements, For The Purpose of Proposing and Considering Amendment \n                                No. 670\n\n  Mr. REID. I call up the motion to suspend rule XXII, including \ngermaneness requirements, filed yesterday by Senator Coburn for the \npurpose of proposing and considering amendment No. 670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Coburn, moves \n     to suspend rule XXII, paragraph No. 2, including germaneness \n     requirements, for the purpose of proposing and considering \n     amendment No. 670.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the motion to \nsuspend is a dilatory motion under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not sustained.\n  Mr. REID. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and request the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may make a brief observation. Listening carefully \nto the majority leader, he is suggesting the specter of filibustering \nby amendment when, in fact, we had already agreed to seven.\n  Having agreed to seven, it strikes me as very difficult to argue that \nwe are establishing some precedent for filibustering by amendment \nbecause he and I had agreed to seven. The only place this ran aground \nwas the majority leader trying to pick all seven of the minority's \namendments.\n  So what we have is that no amendments have been considered other than \nthose of a technical nature offered by the majority leader in order to \nfill up the tree. That was prior to cloture. So what is about to happen \nis that the majority is trying to set a new precedent on how the Senate \noperates.\n  For the record, my preference would have been to consider amendments \non both sides under a regular process, which we could have done earlier \nthis week. Instead, we have been locked out, and in a few moments the \nrules of the Senate will be effectively changed to lock out the \nminority party even more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are \n51. The decision of the Chair does not stand as the judgment of the \nSenate. Therefore, the point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there are some hurt feelings here, \nperhaps on both sides, because this hasn't been easy for me, either, \nbut let's not dwell on that. But I want the record to reflect that the \nfact that we have to do things sometimes that are difficult doesn't \nmean Senator McConnell and I have any problems with each other. I want \nto make sure the record is clear in that regard.\n  We will discuss later how we are going to move forward on other \nthings. But here is my suggestion, unless someone has some objection. \nThe time for cloture running out on this is sometime tomorrow \nafternoon. I don't know the exact time. I think it would be to \neveryone's interest that we would vote on this on Tuesday when we come \nback. We have a judge we could vote on who is already settled. We could \nvote on final passage on this, and then we will vote on the jobs bill \nthat is up.\n  Then what we are going to do is that night we will work to have an \nagreement that is arranged, because we don't have the time worked out \non this, as to how much time. Under the rule, there is 60 hours. We are \nnot going to use 60 hours on these three trade agreements. But everyone \nshould understand we are going to finish the trade agreements on \nWednesday. If that means people want to spend 20 hours debating one of \nthem, they may have to spend all night Tuesday doing that, because we \nhave some things here that we have made commitments to do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What I hear the majority leader saying is we are going \nto vote on the trade agreements on Wednesday. Is that what my friend is \nsaying?\n  Mr. REID. That is what I said.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That means the President of South Korea will have the \nopportunity to address the joint session on Thursday, having, \nhopefully, seen the United States approve these long-awaited trade \nagreements.\n  Mr. REID. So unless someone has some objection, we will leave here \nfor the evening and the staff will work out a proper unanimous consent \nagreement that I will announce at some subsequent time after conferring \nwith the Republican leader.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, has a unanimous consent request been \npropounded, or was the majority leader simply stating that we would \nproceed to vote on Tuesday unless there was objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. What I said is that--my friend from Mississippi is right. \nUnless someone has an objection, we will set things up to vote Tuesday \nevening; otherwise, we would have to vote tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, if I could reserve the right to object, \nand I may or may not object but----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent at this time.\n  Mr. WICKER. I wish to be recognized to speak then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader still has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to vitiate the quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. If the \nSenator wishes to speak, I don't want to prevent him from speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I move to vitiate the quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I move to vitiate the quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  As I understand the rules, each Senator is entitled to 1 hour to \nspeak postcloture if they care to. It is my understanding that Senators \nCorker, Wicker, and Vitter wish to speak postcloture. It would be \nbetter for everyone here--and if they want to speak for an hour, that \nis fine; I have no place to go--but if we could all have an idea as to \nhow long Senator Corker, Senator Wicker, and Senator Vitter wish to \nspeak, it may help us better manage what is going on here.\n  So if I could direct this question through the Chair to my friend, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me.\n  I really do not want to speak. Here is what I want to happen. I think \nMembers on both sides of the aisle believe this institution has \ndegraded into a place that is no longer a place of any deliberation at \nall. I would like for you and the minority leader to explain to us so \nthat we have one story here in public as to what has happened this week \nto lead us to the place that we are. That is all I am asking. That is \nall I want to know. Explain how the greatest deliberative body, on a \nbill that many would say was a messaging bill in the first place, ended \nup having no amendments, and we are in this place that we are right \nnow. I would just like to understand that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from \nTennessee and others who wish to listen, we moved to this legislation, \nthe China currency, with a heavy vote. We had 79 Senators who wished to \nproceed to that. Once we were on the bill, I partially filled the tree.\n  Why did I do that? I have found over the last Congress and 9 months \nthat when I try to have an open amendment process, it is a road to \nnowhere. It just has not worked. We have not been able to effectuate a \nsingle bill being passed that way. Regardless of whether that is right \nor wrong, that is what I did.\n  Senator McConnell wanted to offer an amendment on the President's \njobs bill. That, in effect, tied us down because he was unwilling to \nlet us move to any other amendments. I was willing to move to other \namendments. Specifically, everyone who was involved in this process \nthought that Senator Hatch was entitled to an amendment because his was \nclearly germane and relevant. But without going into ``he said, he \nsaid,'' the fact is no amendments were offered, even though I was happy \nto have some amendments offered.\n  Now, what has happened over the last 9 months is that--and even this \nwent on last year, where we learned about this--when cloture was \ninvoked, Senators--it was led by Senator DeMint, and then Senator \nCoburn picked up on this quickly--as soon as cloture was invoked, \nmotions to suspend the rules were filed.\n  Now, as I have said today, that was done in this instance. I know my \nRepublican friends say: The reason we did that is because we could not \noffer amendments on the underlying bill. I disagree with that. I think \npeople could have offered amendments. But we were at the point where we \nwere. We had 9 or 10 motions to suspend the rules. I worked all day, \nmuch of the time later this afternoon with Senator McConnell, trying to \ncome up with a list of those motions to suspend. I had to get the \napproval of my caucus to move to all those amendments. I could not do \nit. I could not. I, in effect, made a number of my Senators very \nunhappy by moving to amendments that are extremely difficult.\n  The only amendment I am aware of that is germane to what we are \nworking on is Senator Hatch's amendment. The rest of them are not \ngermane. They may be good amendments, great message amendments, causing \na lot of pain over here, but I agreed to do seven of the nine. Senator \nMcConnell said he needed at least one more. I could not get one more.\n  So what procedurally took place is this: I believe, as I indicated in \nmy opening statement, that rule XXII dealing with cloture says that \nwhen cloture is invoked, it is finite--it is finite; it ends debate on \nthat issue unless there are amendments that have been filed that can be \ndealt with during the 30 hours. There were not any in this instance.\n  So I have been here quite a while, and one of the most unpleasant \nthings I have had to deal with over the years has been the vote-arama \nwhen we do the budget thing. We have had 60, 70, 80, 120 amendments \nfiled. Under this procedure that has recently been adopted, by the \nminority in this instance, there is no limit to how many amendments \ncould be filed. Today there were 9 or 10.\n  This has to come to an end. This is not a way to legislate. That is \nwhy the motion to overrule the ruling of the Chair--that is why I made \nthat. I think this is something that was discussed in great detail at \nthe beginning of this Congress. I have a number of Senators on my side \nwho believe very strongly, as my friend from Tennessee has just \ndescribed, that the Senate has become a place where it is very \ndifficult to debate anything. So Senator Merkley and Senator Udall, \njoined by others, wanted to change the rules.\n  At that time, we believed, and the Parliamentarian and all the law \nthat we were familiar with said, a simple majority could change the \nrules dramatically as to how it relates to filibuster and all other \nthings. I felt that certain changes were important and maybe we should \nease into this. That is why we are not reading the amendments now, as \nwe used to be forced to do on occasion, and we had a gentleman's \nagreement motions to proceed would be not opposed generally, and I \nwould not fill the tree all the time.\n  As a result of that, Senators Merkley and Udall, much to their \nconsternation because I did not join with a majority of my caucus, \nopposed what they did because I was hopeful that we could get back to \ndoing some legislating that we had done in the past.\n  Now, I feel very comfortable that what we are doing and what we did \ntoday is the right thing to do. My staff, this morning, when I talked \nabout doing this--the first thing they said to me: Well, what if you \nare in the minority?\n  Let me tell everybody within the sound of my voice, if I were in the \nminority, I would not do this. I think it is dilatory and wrong, just \nas I have said when we were in the now famous debate dealing with the \njudges issue that we had, the nuclear option. I said if I were in a \nposition to exert what I felt was the nuclear option on judges, I would \nnot do it. And I would not. I think we have to do a better job of \nlegislating under the rules.\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\n  So even though perhaps Senator Merkley and Senator Udall were \ndisappointed in my advocacy to not massively change these rules, I went \nalong hoping things would work out better. What just took place is an \neffort to try to expedite what goes on around here. Am I 100 percent \nsure that I am right? No. But I feel pretty comfortable with what we \nhave done. There has to be some end to these dilatory tactics to stop \nthings. Cloture means end; it is over with.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor still.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like to also give my version, if I may, to the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend, the Republican leader, to respond to \nany questions that the Senator from Tennessee may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Let me, for the benefit of our colleagues, \nexplain what, in fact, happened. It is not complicated.\n  It was pretty clear, whether you liked this bill or did not, it was \ngoing to pass. You could tell that by cloture on the motion to proceed \nwith a very large majority. So I do not think my good friend the \nmajority leader had to worry about whether his bill was ultimately \ngoing to pass. The question was whether there were going to be any \namendments at any point to the bill. And my conference made a \ndecision--actually against my best advice--to go on and invoke cloture \non the bill after we had no amendments. The reason we had no amendments \nis because the majority leader used a device we have all become too \nfamiliar with called filling the tree, thereby allowing no amendments \nhe does not approve. And he said that we are open for amendments, but \nwhat he means is this: We are open for any amendment I approve. So he \nfilled the tree and, prior to cloture on the bill, controlled whether \nany amendments would be allowed and chose not to allow any, as a \npractical matter. So against my best advice, my conference decided to \ninvoke cloture on the bill. So we were moving to approving the bill \nwith no expression whatsoever.\n\n  So we have in the postcloture environment the motion to suspend, \nwhich has not been abused by this minority--not been abused by this \nminority. The majority leader, in effect, has overruled the Chair with \na simple majority vote and established the precedent that even one \nsingle motion to suspend--even one--is dilatory, changing the rules of \nthe Senate. And if you look back at his bill, what we have had, in \neffect, is no amendments before cloture, no motions to suspend after \ncloture, no expression on the part of the minority at all.\n  I do not know why anybody should act as though they were offended by \nnongermane amendments. This is the Senate. We do not have any rules of \ngermaneness. No, we do not. Any subject on any bill can be offered as \nan amendment. We all know that.\n  The fundamental problem here is that the majority never likes to take \nvotes. That is the core problem. And I can remember, when I was the \nwhip in the majority, saying to my members over and over again, when \nthey were whining about casting votes they did not want to vote, that \nthe price of being in the majority is that you have to take bad votes \nbecause in the Senate, the minority is entitled to be heard--not \nentitled to win but entitled to be heard. So that is the core problem.\n  I would say to my friend the majority leader--and this is nothing \npersonal about him; I like him, and we deal with each other every day--\nwe are fundamentally turning the Senate into the House: no amendments \nbefore cloture, no motions to suspend after cloture, and the minority \nis out of business. And it is particularly bad on a bill that has the \nsupport of over 60 Members, as this one did. If you are not among those \n60, you are out of luck.\n  Now, look, this is a bad mistake. The way you get business done in \nthe Senate is to be prepared to take bad votes. At some point, if 60 \nMembers of the Senate want a bill to pass, it will pass. If 60 Members \nof the Senate do not want a bill to pass, it will not pass. It is more \ntime consuming. I assume that is why a lot of people ran for the Senate \ninstead of the House--because they wanted to be able to express \nthemselves. This is a free-wheeling body, and everybody is better off \nwhen we operate that way. Everybody is, whether you are in the majority \nor the minority, because today's minority may be tomorrow's majority, \nand the country is better off to have at least one place where there is \nextended debate and where you have to reach a supermajority to do \nthings.\n  So I would say to my good friend the majority leader that I \nunderstand his frustration. But you were going to win on this bill. You \ndid not need to jam us. You should not jam us on any bill, but on this \nbill you were going to win. Now, some of us think we were wasting our \ntime because, as the Senator from Tennessee said, this was not going to \nbecome law anyway, and we are sitting around here when we ought to be \npassing trade bills.\n  The President has asked us to vote on his jobs bill. I wanted to give \nhim an opportunity to have his vote the other day. You guys did not \neven want to vote on what the President was asking us to vote on \nwithout any changes. But you can prevent that, and you did.\n  Look, let's not change this place. America does not need less debate, \nit needs more debate. And when 60 Members of the Senate decide to pass \nsomething, it will pass.\n  I think we made a big mistake tonight. As soon as we all kind of cool \noff and think about it over the weekend, I hope we will undo what we \ndid tonight because it is not in the best interests of this institution \nor the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate should function like the Senate. \nI acknowledge that. But we have major pieces of legislation that have \nbeen brought down as a result of not being able to have finality of \nthat legislation, unending amendments that are not germane or relevant. \nThe small business innovation bill that had passed in past years \neasily, we had the Economic Development Administration bill that passed \neasily in the past, job-creating bills on which we had an open \namendment process--they were simply stopped.\n  There are rules of germaneness in the Senate. There are rules of \ngermaneness in the Senate. Let's think about these amendments that I \nagreed to. There are others I did not agree to, but there are \namendments that I agreed we should have a vote on, not that I wanted to \nhave a vote on them because they had nothing to do with the underlying \nbill--nothing. There are rules of germaneness that that should be the \ncase. DeMint amendment, right to work; Cornyn amendment, fighter planes \nto Taiwan--we already had a vote on that, but we agreed to have another \none; Hatch amendment--that one is relevant and it is germane; Barrasso \namendment, cement--not so; Paul, Federal funding; Coburn, foreign aid; \nMcConnell, jobs act.\n  Part of cloture is enforcing germaneness. That is what it is all \nabout. We are happy to do germane amendments. But the fact is, the \nRepublican leader himself decided not to have amendments on this bill. \nI agreed to amendments on the bill prior to cloture. Everybody probably \ndoes not know that; they should because that is the way it is.\n  So we have to make the Senate a better place, and I think a better \nplace is to do what was done tonight, to get rid of these dilatory \namendments. I mean, we would be happy if poor Senator Bingaman could \nget some bills out of the Energy Committee. We could do something on \ncement. If we could get some bills out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, we could maybe look at foreign aid.\n  These things are dilatory and only unnecessary, in an effort to \ndivert from what we are really trying to do here; that is, legislate.\n  So the issue is this: I believe what we did at the beginning of this \nCongress was the right thing to do, but as the weeks and months have \nrolled on, wasting months of our time on a CR that was done--on a \nseries of CRs--1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks--to fund the government until \nOctober, a few days ago--what a waste of time. We have\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nspent months--months--on raising the debt ceiling, making it nearly if \nnot impossible to legislate on other matters. And when we get a chance \nto legislate, we should not be held up by these dilatory matters.\n  I am willing to legislate. I have taken a lot of hard votes in my \ncareer, and I would have been willing to vote on these. But there has \nto be an end to this.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make sure we understand. There are not any \nrules of germaneness precloture in the Senate. There are not any. Any \namendment can be offered on any subject. And that has been one of the \ngreat frustrations of every majority down through the years. We all \nknow that. So my friend the majority leader, in order to prevent the \nvotes on unpleasant amendments, fills up the tree and decides himself \nthat he is going to confine the amendments to those that are either \ngermane--relevant--or, put another way, of his choosing, whatever you \nwant to allow.\n  My friend keeps talking about wasting time. Well, wasting time to him \nmight not be wasting time to us. We might not think that offering an \namendment on something we think is important for the country is a waste \nof the Senate's time.\n  So who gets to decide who is wasting time around here? None of us. \nNone of us have that authority to decide who is wasting time. But the \nway you make things happen is you get 60 votes at some point, and you \nmove a matter to conclusion, and the best way to do that is to have an \nopen amendment process. That is the way this place used to operate.\n  I have been here a while. I know this is not the way it has always \nhappened. This is not the way we always operated. And we did get things \naccomplished, not by trying to strangle everybody and shut everybody up \nbut by allowing the process to work. And when the Senate gets tired of \nthe process, 60 people shut it down, and you move to conclusion. That \nis how you move something ahead, not by preventing the voices.\n  I mean, we have sat around here 2 days in quorum calls. Have you all \nnoticed that? We could have been voting on amendments. Sitting around \nin quorum calls--talk about a waste of time.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to respond to this. I don't know the exact \nnumber now, but almost 30 judges are waiting to be approved, people who \nare waiting to change their lives, doing their patriotic duty, public \nservice. I can't file cloture on all of those. There are 29 of them.\n  We have been stymied here in this Congress in getting things done--\nholding up nominations for judges, holding up nominations--some people \nhave been on the Executive Calendar for a long, long time. It is \nunfair. That is what is going on around here.\n  So we can do all of the make-believe that my friend the Republican \nleader is talking about, about what great things should happen around \nhere. Well, I will tell you a few things that should happen: We should \nbe able to move matters through here that have been happening since the \nbeginning of this country--nominations, for example. We can't do that \nbecause my friend the Republican leader, as candid as he was, said his \nNo. 1 goal is to defeat President Obama. That is what has been going on \nfor 9 months here, and this issue relating to these dilatory tactics on \nthese motions to suspend the rules is just part of that game that is \nbeing played. Let's get back--I agree. I agree. Let's get back to \nlegislating as we did before the mantra around here was ``Defeat \nObama.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I pose this question, and as I look around \nthis floor, with the exception of Senator Inouye, my dear friend from \nHawaii, nobody has served in this body longer than I have--on the \ncurrent membership--nobody. I keep hearing this talk about 60 votes. \nMost votes you win by 51 votes, and this constant mantra of 60 votes, \n60 votes--this is some new invention, I tell my friends, based on my \nsense of history.\n  So my question to the majority leader, whether we were here with a \nDemocratic majority or a Republican majority, does he remember a time \nwhen judges who were confirmed unanimously--every single Republican, \nevery single Democrat voting for them out of committee--would then sit \non the calendar for 3, 4, 5, sometimes 6 months because there was not \nan agreement to vote on them without a 60-vote supermajority? I cannot \nremember it at any time in 37 years. I do not know if the majority \nleader can recall such a time.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Vermont has been here longer than I have, \nbut he is absolutely right.\n  I would also add this: that the Republican leader said--and I think \nthis says it all--today, as an extemporaneous remark from his position \nhere where he is now standing, and I quote:\n\n       If 60 Senators are in favor of bringing a matter to \n     conclusion, it will be brought to a conclusion.\n\n  That is what happened a few minutes ago, and that is what cloture is \nall about. That is what cloture is all about.\n  I believe in cloture. As I have indicated several times earlier, I \nwas not in favor of changing the rules relating to cloture as some of \nmy colleagues did. But I think this is a step forward. It will make \nthis process work a lot better.\n  I want to yield for a question to my friend from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding. I \nwill not take long.\n  I have been in the Senate 4 years now, and I think my colleagues know \nI do not come down to the floor and spout a lot of hot air. But I have \nto be heard tonight.\n  I will agree with my friend the majority leader on one thing: This is \nno way to legislate. He said those words a few moments ago, and I \nagree.\n  We have become accustomed to a procedure, and I have disagreed with \nthat procedure, but it has been the regular order during the time I \nhave been here; that is, the usual practice is a bill is brought to the \nfloor, and the majority leader immediately offers every amendment that \ncan possibly be offered in a parliamentary way, thus filling the \namendment tree and preventing other Senators from offering amendments.\n  Then cloture is filed and we don't have an opportunity to have a full \nhearing. I am told this has not always been the practice, but we have \nbeen accustomed to that practice.\n  What happened tonight is far different from that. I think that is why \nmy friend from Tennessee propounded the question to the majority \nleader. We had a bill--and it may be a messaging bill, but if it were \npassed, it would be a significant piece of legislation. I think both \nsides acknowledge that. No amendments were allowed precloture and no \namendments have been allowed postcloture. The majority leader, this \nvery day, after the cloture vote assured the Senate that we would be \noperating under an open process. He said those words. Not only that--\nand perhaps the majority leader, when I finish in a moment or two, \ncould correct me--I believe I heard the majority leader say we would be \nallowed to offer motions to suspend the rules on a number of \namendments, and debate would be allowed.\n  What occurred was that Senator Coburn offered his motion to suspend \nthe rule on his amendment. We assumed we would be able to do this on at \nleast a few amendments. But the very first amendment that was offered, \nthe majority leader suggested to the Chair, and made the point of order \nto the Chair, that it was dilatory--one amendment. That was deemed \ndilatory by the majority leader, and the Parliamentarian correctly \ninstructed the Chair to overrule that suggestion by the majority \nleader, upholding the precedent of the Senate. And one by one, \nDemocratic Members of this body had to march down and vote to overrule \nthe Parliamentarian of this Senate for the very purpose of shutting \ndown the chance to offer one single amendment, when the majority leader \nwell knew he had the votes to win. But our rules have, I thought, been \ndesigned--and I think our society is designed this way--around the \nconcept that the minority has an opportunity to be protected; the \nminority has an\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\nopportunity to be heard in this body, of all bodies.\n  What we have done tonight--unless we can remove that--is we have \nchanged the rules of the Senate on a messaging bill, on a matter that \nthe majority leader had the votes on. That is my objection. That is why \nI am so disturbed about the overreaction and heavyhandedness of this \nmove.\n  This is not a matter of supporting the leader on one bill that he \nwants to get us out of town on. This is precedent. Unless we can change \nit, we have forever changed the right of the majority to be heard \npostcloture. I am saddened about that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, amendments could have been \noffered precloture. My friend said he thought we were going to be able \nto offer some amendments postcloture with their motions to suspend the \nrules. That is what I said would happen, and I agreed to that--seven \namendments. People are saying, you choose the amendments. I didn't \nchoose the amendments. They came up with these amendments. These are \nthe ones they gave me. I was supposed to select which ones, and that is \nwhat I did. I could not get agreement on some of these amendments. I \nhave explained that previously.\n  Also, everyone should recognize that motions to suspend the rules are \nstill available; they are just not available postcloture. Rule XXII \nprovides:\n\n       Is it the sense of the Senate that debate shall be brought \n     to a close?\n\n  That is what it says. That rule has been in existence for a long \ntime. I am sorry my friend is disappointed, but I think the playbook he \nis reading from is not accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi is \naccurate. Until the vote we had just a few moments ago, motions to \nsuspend postcloture were appropriate. No longer are they appropriate \nbecause, as my friend from Mississippi pointed out, we have in effect \nchanged the rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for taking the time to \nexplain from his perspective what has happened. I guess what I want to \nunderstand is, when amendments are offered, why don't we just go ahead \nand vote on them? If it is standard procedure----\n  Mr. REID. Can the Senator start over? I was preoccupied.\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, I thank the leader for taking the time to \nexplain from his perspective. Here is what I don't understand. We had a \ncloture motion to proceed on Monday. It is Thursday night. We have had \nno votes on anything other than a cloture vote. I guess what I would \nlove to understand is, why don't we just immediately begin voting on \namendments? We could have been done with this bill yesterday. Instead, \neverybody cools their heels, waits around, while some negotiation takes \nplace--sort of a self-appointed rules committee. And at the end, \nsomething like this happens.\n  I wish to understand from the leader's perspective why we don't just \nvote on amendments? We could have been done yesterday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will try to respond to my friend. People \naround here are talking as if this is something that never has happened \nbefore. This has happened--I don't remember all the times since I have \nbeen in the Senate that the Chair--as brilliant as our Parliamentarian \nis, and the Chair does its best to distinguish what the Parliamentarian \nwants, but he is not always sustained. I have been involved in a number \nof those examples. So it isn't as if this never happened before.\n  We did it with the understanding that what is going on here is \ndilatory, and that is what the majority felt.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in the form of a question to the majority \nleader and also the Republican leader--we are all frustrated. The \nSenator from Tennessee and I talked about that frustration at the \nbeginning of the session, and it hasn't worked terribly well to try to \nstraighten this out. You are frustrated, and we can talk about the \nspecifics here.\n  The one point I make is that the majority leader, isn't it true, \noffered on the floor yesterday to allow amendments on this bill? And \nthe only amendment that was sent to us was the amendment to have a vote \non the President's budget, is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But it was not widely known on this side. The majority \nleader had offered amendments on this bill. The question I ask is \nthis--and I will make a statement and lead up to a question. You are \nfrustrated because you feel the tree is filled all the time and you \ncannot make amendments. But we are frustrated because the 60-vote \nrule--which has always been used here--is now used routinely, which \nnever has been done before. Judges--district court judges--I have been \nhere in the Senate 13 years, and I was in the House 18 years and \nfollowed the Senate and cared about judges. It never happened before. \nRoutine appointees--assistant secretaries of this, deputy secretaries \nof that--60 votes. And on bill after bill after bill, the procedure of \nthis place works that somebody has to object. That is why you file \ncloture; otherwise, we could proceed.\n  In the past, the motion to proceed was not routinely blocked. And \nalmost every single bill--important bills, obviously--and nobody thinks \nthe health care bill should have passed by 51 votes. But on minor \nbills--we had a filibuster on technical corrections to the \nTransportation bill, where 287 was written down by mistake instead of \n387. It was filibustered--60 votes. So our defense is to fill the tree.\n  But what we ought to try to do here--and, as I said, the Senator from \nTennessee and I futilely tried earlier this year to maybe calm things \ndown--is to maybe use this flashpoint to try to come together and work \nthat out again. Maybe the minority would not routinely filibuster \neverything--appointments, judges, minor bills--and can save it for the \nmajor bills. In return--and I agree with the minority leader that the \ndeal around this place is the majority sets the agenda and the minority \ngets to offer amendments. That has been the rule since I got here and \none of the reasons--he is correct, I say to my friend from Kentucky--\nwhy I left the House to run for the Senate.\n\n  But it has gotten to the extreme. While my colleagues on the other \nside would say it got to the extreme because we always fill the tree, \nwe would say it got to the extreme because you filibuster everything \nand require 60 votes on everything--we only have 53, we know that--\nincluding judges, appointments, and minor bills. If we are going to \nbring this place back to order, if we are going to bring this place \nback to a place where we can legislate, both sides have to back off, \nand we are going to have to figure out how to do that, which we haven't \ndone adequately yet.\n  One other point before I ask my question. The Senator from West \nVirginia had a few of us on his boat this week. A number of the \nfreshmen Senators from the other side of the aisle were on the boat, as \nI was. We began to talk, and they were asking, why is this place so \nmixed up? I explained that some of the greatest joys I have had in the \nSenate and the House were conference committees, and offering \namendments, and things such as that. We all said, together, why can't \nwe get back to that?\n  Let me say that it is not simply filling the tree and preventing \namendments that caused this problem. It is routinely requiring 60 votes \nbefore the Senate can get a drink of water.\n  My question to the majority leader is this: Would he be willing--we \nneed a little bit of a cooling-off period--to sit down with the \nminority leader and others in an effort to try to figure out how we can \nget back to somewhat more of a regular order in regard to what I said?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say this to my friend and others \nlistening. I want everybody to understand a little bit of the \nfrustration I have. We all went through the battle on the FEMA bill. \nEveryone remembers that. People in the dark bowels of this building \nsomeplace typed that bill up. They made a mistake and had a comma in \nthe wrong place--a comma. I asked consent, because that was a technical \ncorrection, to get that corrected. There were press releases out \nalready from my Republican friends: We are not going to agree to any \nconsents on anything. You talk about frustration--there is plenty of it \nto go around.\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\n  I want to try to end this on a high note. I love this institution. I \nhave devoted most of my life here in this building--not only as a long-\ntime Member of the House and Senate, but I lived here while going to \nlaw school. I worked in this building. I was a cop here. I love this \nbuilding and this institution. I don't want to do anything to denigrate \nthe institution. Maybe there is blame to go around, and I think there \nprobably is. But frustration builds upon frustration and, as a result \nof that, we have situations such as this.\n  So here is my suggestion. I think just as we had a cooling off \nperiod, as we indicated that we would on that FEMA CR--we had a cooling \noff period, and the Republican leader and I agreed that would be the \nright thing to do, and we then came back and worked something out. We \ndid it very quickly. It wasn't to everybody's satisfaction. I had \npeople upset and he had people upset, but we did that. So it would be \nmy suggestion to do as I originally suggested. I think we should go \nahead and do final passage on this matter on Tuesday night. Do the \njudge first, then vote on the jobs bill. Then we will deal with the \ntrade stuff.\n  I am happy to not only sit down with the Republican leader, but I am \nsure we can all cinch up our belts and, as they say in the Old and New \nTestament, gird up our loins and try to do a better job of how we try \nto get along. I have talked to the Republican leader only briefly about \nthis, but I had a discussion with my leadership today, and one of the \nthings I was going to announce--and so here it is--one of the things I \nwant to do is have a joint caucus. I want to have one with Democratic \nSenators and Republican Senators. At that time we can all talk about \nsome of the frustrations we all have.\n  I wanted to do that the first week we got back after the last recess. \nAll my people don't know about this, and certainly I haven't finalized \nthis with the Republican leader, but I think that would be a good step \nforward; that Senator McConnell and I could be there in front of \neverybody together, questions could be asked, statements could be made, \nand we could see if that would let a little air out of the tires.\n  I will be happy--next time we get cloture on an event sometime in the \nfuture--to sit down and find out what, if anything, we should do \npostcloture on matters relating to people who are frustrated.\n  So that is my statement, Mr. President. I am not asking consent on \nanything, but I would hope we could all leave, and Senator McConnell \nand I would direct the staff to come up with something, an arrangement \ncomparable to what I just suggested.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will have no more votes, and I have \nconfirmed that with the Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6320-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Rev. Fred Lee \nShuttlesworth, an American civil rights hero who lived much of his \nadult life in Cincinnati who passed away this week at the age of 89. I \ncome to the floor in support of a resolution with Senator Portman, my \ncolleague from Cincinnati, where Reverend Shuttlesworth lived for many \nyears, and also from Senator Shelby and Senator Sessions, both \nrepresenting Alabama, where Reverend Shuttlesworth lived his earliest \nseveral decades and then the end of his life.\n  Much is known about his life--the beatings, the bombings, the arrests \nand protests. He was born in 1922 in Alabama. He was a truckdriver who \nstudied theology at night. He became an ordained minister in his \ntwenties. By the 1950s, in his thirties, he was the pastor of Bethel \nBaptist Church in Birmingham, the pulpit from which he became the \npowerful, fiery, outspoken leader against racial discrimination and \ninjustice.\n  When the Alabama NAACP was banned in the State, Reverend \nShuttlesworth established the Alabama Christian Movement for Human \nRights. Churches held weekly meetings, membership grew month by month--\nin large part because of Reverend Shuttlesworth's leadership skills--\nand the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights became the mass \nmovement for Blacks in the South.\n  He fought Birmingham's racism in the courtroom, bringing suits to \ndesegregate public recreation facilities. He protested segregation of \nbuses in Birmingham. He was beaten with chains and brass knuckles when \nhe tried to enroll his children in a Birmingham school, even though he \nwas, of course, a taxpayer. He would lead Freedom Riders to safety--a \ncritical voice imploring Attorney General Robert Kennedy and President \nJohn F. Kennedy to get the Federal Government to show leadership as \nFreedom Riders were jailed and attacked. Reverend Shuttlesworth was \noften jailed and later left bruised and bloodied from firehoses and \npolice dogs, the brutal force of Bull Connor's lynch mob. His life and \nhis family were threatened by Connor's ignorant hostility--or \nindifference more often than hostility.\n  His words:\n\n       They would call me SOB, and they didn't mean ``sweet old \n     boy. . . . '' [T]he first time I saw brass knuckles was when \n     they struck me . . . they missed me with dynamite because God \n     made me dynamite.\n\n  So his direct action campaigned continued. He mobilized students to \nboycott merchants with Jim Crow signs in their storefronts. He worked \nand he marched with Dr. King, affiliating the Alabama Christian \nMovement for Human Rights with the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, organizing bus boycotts and sit-ins and marches and acts of \ncivil disobedience. He persuaded Dr. King to bring the civil rights \nmovement to Birmingham, where Dr. King would write his famous ``Letter \nfrom a Birmingham Jail.'' In the letter, Dr. King writes of the \nnecessity of Reverend Shuttlesworth's direct action campaign, fighting \n``broken promises'' and ``blasted hopes.'' The two words ``broken'' and \n``blasted'' meant so much to them personally because both were attacked \nso frequently.\n  In September 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed, \nmurdering four little girls, and the movement's grief and responsive \nresiliency helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  The next year, he helped organize the historic march from Selma to \nMontgomery, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, to fight voting \ndiscrimination in Alabama and across the South, galvanizing meeting \nafter meeting with his fiery words. He soon arrived in Cincinnati, \ncoming across the Ohio River, as pastor of the Greater New Light \nBaptist Church in Avondale.\n  He trained Freedom Riders in nearby Oxford, OH, at the Western Campus \nfor Women then, now affiliated or absorbed by Miami of Ohio, one of our \ngreat State universities. He trained those Freedom Riders, thousands of \nactivists who would travel south to register Black voters.\n  Reverend Shuttlesworth fought for racial equality in Cincinnati \nschools, in city councils and police departments, empowering low-income \nfamilies through education, jobs, and housing for decades to come.\n  I would like to read from and ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the editorial from the Cincinnati Inquirer from October \n5, 2011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I would like to share a couple of words from the \nCincinnati Inquirer. This is the beautifully written Cincinnati \nInquirer editorial about Reverend Shuttlesworth:\n\n       He once told the Tampa Tribune it helped to have a ``little \n     divine insanity--that's when you're willing to suffer and die \n     for something.''\n\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\n\n  They also wrote:\n\n       Perhaps nowhere is his ultimate triumph more evident than \n     in the renaming of the Birmingham airport to the Birmingham-\n     Shuttlesworth International Airport--a public tribute in a \n     city where once a Ku Klux Klan member who was a police \n     officer warned him to get out of town as fast as he could.\n\n  Needless to say, the airport was named after Reverend Shuttlesworth, \nnot after the KKK police officer.\n  It was an honor to get to know Reverend Shuttlesworth and to learn \nfrom him. In 1998, I first met this historic figure of the civil rights \nmovement--unknown to far too many people--in Selma, AL, during a \npilgrimage with Congressman John Lewis, who was beaten perhaps more \nthan anybody in the civil rights movement. It was an opportunity to \nspend some time with Reverend Shuttlesworth in Selma in the late 1990s.\n  I visited his church in 2006. I heard him preach, and then, at his \nretirement party a while after that--not too many years ago--I heard \nhim preach again and got the chance to get a tour at his retirement \nparty, a tour of the small museum in his modest church celebrating his \nlife but more set up to honor and commemorate the civil rights movement \nin the most personal kind of way. It is impossible for me to really \ndescribe the feelings I had as he talked to a small group--Connie, my \nwife, and me--a small group of us as we toured this very small museum \nin a room at the church. It was just packed with all kinds of mementoes \nand commemorations of the civil rights movement and Reverend \nShuttlesworth's fight in those days in Alabama. From those pictures and \nhis memory, you learn not just about a man's life but about our \nNation's history.\n  The passage of the most basic civil rights laws would not have \noccurred without his vision and fortitude. We honor his legacy in his \npassing, but we are also charged with upholding a sacred duty to take \nhis lead, and that is because progress in our Nation is never easy. \nPassage of voting rights or civil rights was not the result of one \nman's great speech in Washington or one famous march across the Edmund \nPettus Bridge.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Shuttlesworth `Truly a Man of Courage, Conviction and Integrity'\n\n              Cincinnati Enquirer Editorial, Oct. 5, 2011\n\n       In 1955, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was a young pastor in \n     Birmingham, Ala., preaching sermons on equality and working \n     in his segregated city on the issues before him, such as \n     adding street lights to African-American neighborhoods.\n       But after he petitioned the Birmingham City Council to hire \n     African-American police officers, a larger calling took hold \n     of him.\n       He saw his role as helping to lift African Americans--and \n     the rest of his countrymen--from another sort of darkness: \n     that of racial bigotry.\n       He became a restless, outspoken advocate for integration, a \n     co-founder of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human \n     Rights, and a leader of the Civil Rights movement.\n       His death Wednesday in Birmingham left a sense of national \n     loss, strongly felt in Cincinnati, where he spent most of his \n     adulthood and served as pastor of two churches.\n       We feel that sense of loss, recognize the depth of his \n     accomplishment and give thanks for the example he set.\n       In Birmingham and Cincinnati, the eloquent Rev. \n     Shuttlesworth appealed to moral conscience and championed \n     everyday causes. He sat at lunch counters with young \n     protesters in Birmingham, held ``wade-ins'' at segregated \n     beaches in St. Augustine, Fla., and later in life established \n     the Shuttlesworth Housing Foundation to help low-income \n     Cincinnatians afford a home.\n       He was focused, undeterrable, bold. He challenged \n     Birmingham's white power structure at every turn. He refused \n     to flinch at bombings of his church and home. He urged civil \n     rights leaders to be more assertive, labeling the 1963 \n     campaign to desegregate Birmingham ``Project C''--for \n     confrontational.\n       He once told the Tampa Tribune it helped to have ``a little \n     divine insanity--that's when you're willing to suffer and die \n     for something.''\n       But instead of becoming a martyr, the Rev. Shuttlesworth \n     lived to become one of the movement's elder statesmen.\n       The sound of his name alone revived memories of Freedom \n     Riders and police fire hoses, of the relentless drive of \n     young civil rights leaders and the stubborn resistance of the \n     Old South. Perhaps nowhere is his ultimate triumph more \n     evident than in the renaming of the Birmingham airport to the \n     Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport--a public \n     tribute in a city where once a Ku Klux Klan member who was \n     also a police officer warned him to get out of town as fast \n     as he could.\n       He replied that he didn't run. And, in Birmingham and \n     Cincinnati, he never did. And he never stopped.\n       As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote to him, ``May \n     God strengthen your spirit and uplift your heart that even \n     your accusers will be forced to admit that truly you are a \n     man of courage, conviction and integrity.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. The fight for women's rights and fair pay and \nprotections for the disabled, none of those fights were easy, yet in \nthe last few years, we celebrated the 90th anniversary of the 19th \namendment, the 75th anniversary of Social Security, the 45th \nanniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the 20th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  What have we done here this year? How will we show the march toward \njustice is the mark of our Nation's progress? We do so by marching with \nhis spirit rather than standing in his shadow.\n  Dr. King said of Reverend Shuttlesworth, he ``proved to his people \nthat he would not ask anyone to go where he was not willing to lead.'' \nThat is a testament to his courage.\n  Four years ago, then a candidate for President, Senator Obama \nescorted a wheelchair-bound Reverend Shuttlesworth across the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma. It was symbolic. It showed yet again Reverend \nShuttlesworth leading us across another bridge.\n  On behalf of a grateful State, Ohio, and in partnership with Senator \nPortman from Ohio, Senator Shelby from Alabama, and Senator Sessions \nfrom Alabama, I offer my deepest condolences to the Shuttlesworth \nfamily and to all of his friends and to all of his loved ones.\n  Mr. President, I will offer this resolution, and I think we will be \nlooking at it later today, offered by Senators Portman, Sessions, \nShelby, and myself. I will ask for passage later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6321-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6321-S6322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GARY BERMEOSOLO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Gary Bermeosolo \nwho is retiring from his position as Administrator at the Nevada State \nVeterans Home in Boulder City. Gary dedicated more than 40 years of his \nlife to serving our Nation's veterans and he touched many lives in the \nprocess. Nevada has been very fortunate to have a man like Gary working \nfor our veterans, and I am privileged to recognize his accomplishments \ntoday.\n  After returning from service in the U.S. Navy, Gary began his career \nin Idaho. For more than 20 years, Gary worked as the director of \nVeterans Services in that State. The Idaho Statesman awarded Gary with \nthe Distinguished Citizen's award. He was also invited as the Honor \nMarshall for the Fourth of July Parade in Boise.\n  Before my friend Chuck Fulkerson decided to retire from the Nevada \nOffice of Veterans Services, he recruited Gary to come to Nevada. Gary \ntook a position as the administrator of the Nevada State Veterans Home. \nThis wasn't an easy task, and the new facility was facing many \nsignificant challenges. Gary worked diligently to address the concerns \nof the Veterans Affairs Administration and ensure that Nevada's \nfacility complied with Federal regulations. Since Gary's arrival, the \nNevada Veterans Home has provided first-class healthcare to Nevada's \nveterans and their family members. After a troubled start, the Nevada \nState Veterans home was recognized as one of the top 100 nursing homes \nin the Nation. That accomplishment would never have occurred without \nGary's leadership and his dedicated staff.\n  Gary's commitment to service is evident in nearly all of Gary's \npursuits. Not only did Nevada's veterans benefit from Gary's creative \nproblem solving, but he also spearheaded improvements in Veteran care \nthrough his work with the National Association of State Veterans Homes. \nAs a legislative officer, a regional director, and as the president of \nthe organization, Gary used the lessons he learned in Nevada to help \nveterans throughout the Nation. Just last year, Gary testified before a \nHouse of Representatives Subcommittee in support of increased \nflexibility in Federal payments for State veterans homes. The lives of \nmany veterans have been directly impacted by Gary's tireless \nlegislative advocacy for improved care.\n  The mission of the Nevada State Veterans Home is Caring for America's \nHeroes. No one has embodied that spirit\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nof service better than Gary Bermeosolo. Over the past decade, I have \nhad the opportunity to work with Gary on many occasions. He has been a \npleasure to work with. I have always been impressed by Gary's ability \nto innovate and find solutions for our Nevada veterans.\n  Even in retirement, I am confident that Gary will continue to be a \ntireless advocate for those who have worn the uniform. On behalf of all \nNevadans and all Americans, I am proud to thank Gary for his service to \nthis Nation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6322-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN W.

John served his country for 28 years, from 1943 to 1971, \nas one of our country's very first Navy SEALs.\n  John moved to Burnside, KY with his family when he was a boy in 1936. \nDuring World War II John was chosen to be part of a class of 141 that \nproduced the first 27 Navy SEALs from underwater demolition teams. \nDuring the war, John was in command of a 45-foot intercoastal patrol \nboat that navigated the harbor and coast of Guam in the Western \nPacific.\n  SEAL training for John consisted of 16 weeks of basic training, with \n6 weeks of underwater swimming school. In addition, John recalls \nparachuting from 30,000 feet during jump school--his team was capable \nof jumping from up to 43,000 feet but he never had to jump from that \naltitude.\n  John is very proud of his service to his country and claims the Navy \nmade him tough. Being a Navy SEAL instilled in John the courage to feel \nlike he can accomplish anything, a trait he takes great pride in. \nJohn's formal education ended after he finished the 8th grade, however, \nhe believes he received a real education about how to succeed in life \nfrom the Navy.\n  John W. Dearmon is a true American hero and patriot who is an \ninspiration to the great people of Kentucky. In fact, when asked if he \never thought about quitting during his arduous assignment, he \nresponded, ``No! Absolutely not! I'm an old Kentucky farm boy. I'm \ngung-ho. I never thought about quitting.''\n  John devoted his life to protecting the liberty and freedom our great \ncountry was founded upon, and I commend him for his bravery and honor. \nThe Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal recently published an article \nto honor John's life and accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal, Aug. 13, 2011]\n\n    Life of a SEAL: John Dearmon Was One of Original 27 Elite Forces\n\n                            (By Bill Mardis)\n\n       ``It felt great! I would love to have been with them . . . \n     I started and they finished it for me!''\n       A Pulaski County man can feel heartbeats of the U.S. Navy \n     SEALs as they moved in and killed terrorist mastermind Osama \n     Bin Laden in a firefight. John W. Dearmon knows their \n     thoughts, their toughness and resolve. He was one of the \n     original SEALs. In his mind, he will always be a SEAL.\n       Dearmon was in a class of 141 during early World War II \n     that produced the first 27 SEALs. ``In my class, we ended up \n     with 27 SEALs, originating from underwater demolition teams. \n     The class was too tough for 114. They didn't make it. They \n     dropped out.''\n       ``I didn't join, I was picked. They picked the best men . . \n     . I was one of them. I was proud to be a part,'' Dearmon \n     said.\n       Dearmon cringed in sorrow a few days ago when a helicopter \n     crashed in eastern Afghanistan and killed 22 Navy SEALs who \n     were being flown in to assist an Army Rangers unit pinned \n     down by enemy fire. The United States Navy's Sea, Air and \n     Land Teams, commonly known as Navy SEALs, are the U.S. Navy's \n     principal operation force and a part of the Naval Warfare \n     Command.\n       SEALs are tough hombres. Few there are who can qualify.\n       ``It just doesn't get any tougher. It's really tough. You \n     don't make it if you don't have endurance,'' said Dearmon. \n     ``Basic underwater demolition training . . . that's the hard \n     part, getting through that.'' ``Basic training lasts 16 \n     weeks, and there are six weeks in underwater swimming \n     school.''\n       ``Did you ever think about quitting?''\n       ``No! Absolutely not! I'm an old Kentucky farm boy. I'm \n     gung ho. I never thought about quitting.''\n       ``Were you ever scared?''\n       ``Well, I really don't know how to answer that. I was \n     anxious a few times.''\n       Dearmon was in command of a 45-foot intercoastal patrol \n     boat, patrolling the harbor and intercoastal areas around \n     Guam in the western Pacific. The boat carried eight depth \n     charges, anti-submarine warfare weapons intended to destroy \n     or cripple a target submarine by the shock of exploding near \n     it.\n       ``We dropped depth charges,'' recalled Dearmon. ``I never \n     knowingly got results, but more than likely we did (get \n     results),'' he mused. Dearmon was quick to point out that he \n     never engaged in hand-to-hand combat as did the SEALs who \n     killed Bin Laden.\n       Dearmon parachuted from 30,000 feet. ``We could jump from \n     up to 43,000 feet, but I never jumped that high.'' Dearmon \n     pointed out that equipment available to his first unit of \n     SEALs is ``like a caveman'' to what they have today. ``The \n     electronic equipment, it's so advanced.''\n       ``You're still tough,'' a reporter suggested to the young-\n     looking 87-year-old.\n       ``I still think I'm tough . . . at least for a little \n     while,'' he grinned. Despite his age, Dearmon said he is in \n     relatively good health and ``. . . I can take care of \n     myself.''\n       His wife, the former Margaret Louise Bray, died July 21. \n     They were married 57 years. ``I was devastated (when she \n     died) but I'm getting so I can get along. I'm able to get \n     around.''\n       He goes out for coffee with a group of friends every \n     Thursday morning. It was a friend, Jim Cundiff, who called \n     the Commonwealth Journal and asked: ``Do you know that one of \n     the original Navy SEALs lives in Pulaski County?''\n       The suggestion led to a meeting with Dearmon and a story \n     appropriate for the times, when Navy SEALs are again in the \n     news.\n       Dearmon, a native of Tennessee, moved to Burnside with his \n     family in 1936. He left in 1940, working with the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps (CCC). He joined the Navy in June 1943 and \n     served 28 years, retiring in 1971.\n       ``Would he do it all over again?''\n       I loved every minute I was in the Navy. I'm proud of my \n     life. I didn't have much (formal) education. I finished the \n     8th grade . . . but in the Navy I got a real education. I \n     feel like I can do anything. I built this house (at 125 East \n     Summit Drive, Somerset) in 1972. I had never built anything \n     before, but I got a `How To' manual and went to work.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6322-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6322-S6323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JENNY BOWLING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndevoted mother, parent, and fixture of the Colony Elementary School \nlunchroom staff, Ms. Jenny Bowling of Laurel County, KY. Jenny's love \nfor cooking and sharing great food with people led to a long and \nfulfilling 38-year career as a cook and lunchroom manager at Colony \nElementary.\n  Jenny began her career as a lunchroom cook in May of 1959 so that she \ncould be close to her three children, who were enrolled at Colony \nElementary at the time. She grew close to the teachers and other school \nstaff over the years. She also served as the lunchroom manager. This \nincluded cooking as well as running the cafeteria, keeping payroll \nrecords and processing the free lunch forms.\n  In addition, Jenny was an avid volunteer within the school. Jenny was \na member of the PTO and rarely missed a meeting. The value and \nimportance of school involvement to Jenny was irreplaceable, a \ntradition that is still very much alive within her today--Jenny still \nvolunteers every year at Colony Elementary's annual Thanksgiving \ncelebration by assisting in the lunchroom preparation of the \ntraditional turkey and stuffing meals. Jenny passionately served the \nchildren and staff of Colony Elementary for almost four decades before \nshe retired in 1997.\n  Ms. Jenny Bowling's lifetime commitment to serving Colony Elementary \nwith smiles and home-style meals is truly admirable and an inspiration \nto the citizens of our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel \nEcho published an article highlighting and thanking Jenny for her \nservice to the people of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, 2011]\n\n Homestyle Traditions: Jenny Bowling Keeps Cafeteria Recipes Alive in \n                          Her Kitchen at Home\n\n                          (By Magen McCrarey)\n\n       In May 1959, Jenny Bowling pulled a hairnet over her soft \n     locks to prepare for 38 years working within school \n     cafeterias.\n       ``At the time we peeled our own potatoes,'' Bowling \n     recalled.\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n       Today, she observes that lunch is just not made like it \n     used to be with instant boxed potatoes, nutritional charts to \n     follow and new regulations. Bowling reminisced about the days \n     she spent at Colony Elementary School with fellow cooks, Ada \n     Clay and Thelma Lincks, and soon after, Opal Nicholson and \n     Maggie Wilkerson, rolling out dough for yeast rolls, mixing \n     cornmeal and flour for cornbread and putting their own \n     personal touch on recipes.\n       Working at Colony in western Laurel County was ideal for \n     Bowling, being a short distance away from her home while her \n     three children were enrolled in classrooms just down the hall \n     from the lunchroom.\n       Over the years, Bowling became close to the school staff \n     and to the teachers especially. Her time was not always spent \n     with her hands in the dough; she kept records of payroll, \n     processed the free lunch forms and ensured that the cafeteria \n     ran smoothly in her position as lunchroom manager.\n       ``People who weren't in the lunchroom had no idea the \n     bookwork involved,'' she said.\n       Children at the school who could not afford to pay for \n     their lunch would be hired as help for the cafeteria, Bowling \n     said, to help serve food, and, on occasion, wash dishes in \n     exchange for payment.\n       Bowling made only $25 a week to help with the bills, while \n     her husband, Oscar, was out on the road driving a truck to \n     help support the four. Her youngest son at the time, Larry, \n     had not started school yet and so $10 of her pay was handed \n     to a babysitter.\n       Being involved with the school was very important to \n     Bowling. As an avid PTO volunteer and member, she rarely \n     missed a meeting. School involvement is still something she \n     continues to value, even now that her children have graduated \n     and have children of their own.\n       ``My oldest, Charlotte, is 60 years old,'' she noted.\n       Bowling continues to volunteer at Colony Elementary's \n     annual Thanksgiving celebration. Bowling assists in the \n     lunchroom preparations for the traditional turkey and \n     stuffing feast, although she's still adjusting to the new way \n     of doing things which usually involves using up-to-date \n     machines for mass meal production.\n       ``The equipment is so new and different,'' she commented.\n       Instead of children dropping pocket change and crumpled \n     dollar bills for the lunchroom staff to count and pencil in, \n     computers are now used to calculate change and handle \n     payments.\n       ``The last year I was there they started using computers,'' \n     Bowling said. She retired in 1997.\n       Even though the old homestyle recipes are no longer \n     prepared at the school's cafeteria, Bowling still keeps the \n     recipes alive in her own kitchen. Every Sunday, Bowling cooks \n     for her family.\n       ``I love to cook if people like to eat.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6323-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Petty Officer 1st Class Caleb A.

However, he aspired to be the best-of-the-best and, \nin November 2006, graduated from SEAL qualification training and became \na member of Naval Special Warfare Group Two. Caleb has been described \nby his commander as a cherished teammate and a gifted SEAL operator. \nThis is certainly illustrated by the numerous awards and decorations he \namassed during his short time in the service, including the Bronze Star \nwith Valor, Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, \nExpert Rifle ribbon and Expert Pistol ribbon. Before deploying to \nAfghanistan this past March, Caleb had deployed to Iraq in 2009.\n  Not only was Caleb a dedicated combat veteran, he was a loving \nhusband, father, and son. His father, Reverend Larry Nelson, remembers \nhis son as a go-getter and a truly good person. His friends and \nneighbors tell a similar tale. Karen Wagner, Caleb's neighbor, \nremembers him as a wonderful kid who was always willing to help out, \neven if it came down to mundane things such as cleaning out the \ngutters.\n  Caleb Nelson's life came to a cruel end when his vehicle hit an \nimprovised explosive devise while his SEAL team was conducting mounted \ncombat reconnaissance patrols. I pray that Caleb's family and friends \nfind strength during this trying time and my condolences go out to \nthem. Caleb's service and sacrifice, his heroism and selflessness will \nremain an inspiration for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6323-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAIWAN'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nTaiwan as it prepares to celebrate its National Day on Monday. Double \nTen Day, as it is known, marks the anniversary of the uprising on \nOctober 10, 1911, that led to the collapse of imperial rule in China. \nThis year's commemoration takes on special meaning as Taiwan celebrates \nthe 100th anniversary of this historic day.\n  Over the years, we have seen Taiwan make a successful transition to \ndemocracy, holding elections and peacefully transferring power. As we \nlook back on the achievements of the past century, we also look forward \nto a bright future for Taiwan. Taiwan is a valued ally of the United \nStates. The United States has enjoyed a close friendship with Taiwan \nfor many years, and I will continue working to strengthen this \nrelationship.\n  I wish the people of Taiwan sincere congratulations and best wishes \non the 100th anniversary of their National Day.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to the approach of a very special day in the history of our \nfriend and partner, the Republic of China--ROC--on Taiwan. On October \n10, 1911--precisely 100 years ago--the Republic of China was founded, \nand since then has celebrated October 10 as its National Day.\n  Over the course of this century, the Republic of China has been a \nfirm friend of the United States--from World War II to the Cold War, up \nto the present day. More recently, the ROC on Taiwan has emerged as one \nof the great success stories of the past century--a free market \ndemocracy that is a model for the entire region.\n  I believe that it is especially appropriate to note this anniversary \non the Senate floor because of the unique and important role that the \nU.S. Congress has played in supporting the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, by \nvirtue of the Taiwan Relations Act. Unique among all of our \ninternational partnerships, the TRA established in law America's \ncommitment to support the people of Taiwan as they seek a safe and \nsecure place in the world.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to wish the people of Taiwan my \ncongratulations on this auspicious anniversary, and hope my colleagues \nwill join me in celebrating a very special National Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6323-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6323-S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion that I \nbegan Monday with the majority leader, Senator Reid, on the need to \nbring the national defense authorization bill to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Since our colloquy Monday, Senator Reid has sent a letter to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin, and me. I \nwould like to have a copy of the letter printed in the Record.\n  In the letter, Senator Reid lays out his concerns about some of the \ndetainee provisions that were included in the Defense authorization \nbill as a result of a bipartisan compromise between Chairman Levin, \nmyself, and Senator Graham, and cosponsored by a large, bipartisan \ngroup of members of the Armed Services Committee. In fact, this \ncompromise was so bipartisan that after extensive debate on many \namendments and a number of votes during markup by the committee using \nthe regular order of the Senate, the resulting package of detainee \nprovisions was adopted and made part of the bill by an overwhelming \nvote of 25 to 1.\n  Now, I understand that the White House has some objections to these \ndetainee provisions that were adopted by the Armed Services Committee, \nand Senator Reid has essentially endorsed the White House position. In \ndoing so, he is blocking the Defense authorization bill from coming to \nthe floor, using his authority as majority leader to control the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  As I said Monday, I do not think that opposition to this particular \nprovision outweighs the importance of this legislation to our national \nsecurity mission, our troops, and their families. I stated on the floor \nMonday that I would work with Senator Levin and the administration to \ntry to resolve their concerns about the detainee provisions in the \nbill. I stand by that commitment. But for the record, I want to address \nsome of the issues raised by the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n  The majority leader quotes White House Deputy National Security \nAdviser John Brennan from a recent speech he made at Harvard saying, \n``Our counterterrorism professionals would be compelled to hold all \nterrorists in military custody, casting aside our most effective and \ntime-tested tool for bringing suspected terrorists to justice--our \nfederal courts.''\n  This statement is simply and completely untrue. It is a total \nmischaracterization of section 1032 of the bill.\n  The section of the bill dealing with military custody was extensively \ndebated in committee and reflects the bipartisan compromise reached on \nall the detainee provisions. Section 1032 does not extend to all \nterrorists.\n  It applies, as Chairman Levin made clear in a public statement on \nTuesday, only to members of al-Qaida and its affiliates, like al-Qaida \nin the Arabian Peninsula which launched the December 2009 attempt to \nbomb a civilian airliner over Detroit and which subsequently attempted \nan attack on the United States by using parcel bombs this time last \nyear. And it only applies to members of al-Qaida and its affiliates who \nare captured in a very narrow set of circumstances: those captured \nattacking the United States or its coalition allies or attempting or \nplanning such an attack.\n  This narrow focus is far from Mr. Brennan's claim that military \ncustody would be required for all terrorists. That is simply wrong. It \ngrossly distorts the scope of the provision.\n  The focus on al-Qaida and its affiliates was intentional. Al-Qaida is \nand has been for the last 10 years the focus of the Authorization for \nthe Use of Military Force, AUMF, that Congress passed overwhelmingly \nafter the attack on our country on September 11, 2001. We are at war \nwith al-Qaida and its affiliates. The President has said so plainly.\n  In fact, it was just days ago that the Obama administration used the \nfact that we are at war with al-Qaida to kill an American citizen, \nAnwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen. That was a decision I fully support. Awlaki \nhad become a leading operational planner for what administration \nofficials now regard as the branch of al-Qaida that poses the most \nsignificant threat to the United States.\n  The inconsistency in Mr. Brennan's position and, to the extent he \nspeaks for the White House, the administration's national security \npolicy as a whole is that this administration asserts the right--\ncorrectly, in my view--to kill a member of al-Qaida or its affiliates \nthrough use of military force but would deny that the same individual \nshould be held in military custody if captured. Instead, following Mr. \nBrennan's point of view, if we capture an al-Qaida terrorist in the \nvery act of carrying out an attack on our homeland or U.S. interests \nelsewhere, we should revert to law enforcement methods and hold that \nal-Qaida terrorist under civilian law enforcement standards.\n  By insisting that law enforcement custody rather than military \ncustody should apply, the administration has to contend with the \nrequirement to provide Miranda warnings to criminal suspects and the \nFederal rules that require presentment before a Federal magistrate \nwithin a short period of time after arrest, normally within 24 to 48 \nhours, for a criminal suspect to be informed of the charges against \nthem and to be assigned a lawyer.\n  I would also note that the detainee provision that Mr. Brennan and \nthe majority leader now complain of contains a national security waiver \nthat can be exercised to transfer even members of al-Qaida or its \naffiliates into civilian law enforcement custody if that is warranted \nby the circumstances and deemed the appropriate course of action.\n  I strongly believe the language adopted by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is reasonable, fair, and most importantly constitutional. \nHowever, as I just stated, I will work with Chairman Levin and the \nadministration to remedy any deficiencies in the language. However, I \nbelieve the administration must now present to the Senate and the Armed \nServices Committee its specific concerns. Absent this, I would hope the \nmajority leader would move to this important legislation and let the \nSenate implement its prescribed duties.\n  I look forward to hearing from the majority leader and the \nadministration so that the Senate may move forward on this vital and \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: I am writing \n     to follow up on our conversations regarding the detainee \n     provisions (Sections 1031-1036) included in the Armed \n     Services Committee's reported version of the Fiscal Year 2012 \n     National Defense Authorization Act.\n       As a whole, I strongly support the legislation your \n     Committee has reported. Despite the widely varying views of \n     the members on your committee on many critical issues, you \n     have worked together to craft a bipartisan bill that once \n     again will ensure strong and sustained support for the men \n     and women that sacrifice so much in defense of our nation.\n       However, as you know, I do not intend to bring this bill to \n     the floor until concerns regarding the bill's detainee \n     provisions are resolved. The Obama Administration and several \n     of our Senate colleagues have expressed serious concerns \n     about the implications of the detainee provisions included in \n     the legislation, particularly the authorization of indefinite \n     detention in Section 1031, the requirement for mandatory \n     military custody of terrorism suspects in Section 1032, and \n     the stringent restrictions on transfer of detainees in \n     Section 1033. As Deputy National Security Advisor John \n     Brennan stated in a recent speech:\n       [S]ome--including some legislative proposals in Congress--\n     are demanding that we pursue a radically different strategy. \n     Under that approach, we would never be able to turn the page \n     on Guantanamo. Our counterterrorism professionals would be \n     compelled to hold all captured terrorists in military \n     custody, casting aside our most effective and time-tested \n     tool for bringing suspected terrorists to justice--our \n     federal courts. . . . In sum, this approach would impose \n     unprecedented restrictions on the ability of experienced \n     professionals to combat terrorism, injecting legal and \n     operational uncertainty into what is already enormously \n     complicated work.\n       I share the concerns about these provisions. I strongly \n     believe that we must maintain the capability and flexibility \n     to effectively apply the full range of tools at our disposal \n     to combat terrorism. This includes the use of our criminal \n     justice system, which has accumulated an impressive record of \n     success in bringing terrorists to justice.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations, I have \nstrongly supported funding to protect U.S. interests around the world.\n  I am also fortunate to have Senator Lindsey Graham as a ranking \nmember, who, like Senators Judd Gregg and Mitch McConnell before him, \nis a strong supporter of these programs. We recognize, as does the \nPentagon, that military power alone is not sufficient to protect our \nsecurity. In fact, sending Americans into harm's way should be an \nabsolute last resort. We also need to invest in international diplomacy \nand development.\n  Foreign aid today is an oft-maligned term that is widely \nmisunderstood. It is viewed by many as a form of charity or a luxury we \ncan do without, or as a sizable part of the Federal budget. It is none \nof those things.\n  This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. It is about whether the \nUnited States is going to remain the global leader it has been since \nWorld War Two. Three weeks ago, President George W. Bush said:\n\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\n\n       One of the lessons of September 11th . . . is that what \n     happens overseas matters here at home We face an enemy that \n     can only recruit when they find hopeless people, and there is \n     nothing more hopeless to a child who loses a mom or dad to \n     AIDS to watch the wealthy nations of the world sit back and \n     do nothing.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was equally blunt about \nthe stakes involved. She said:\n\n       We don't have an option to retire, to take a sabbatical \n     from leadership in the international community and the world. \n     If we do, one of 2 things will happen. There will be chaos, \n     because without leadership there will be chaos in the \n     international community, and that is dangerous. But it's \n     quite possible, that if we don't lead, somebody else will. \n     And perhaps it will be someone who does not share our values \n     of compassion, the rights of the individual, of liberty, and \n     freedom.\n\n  I could not agree more, and I hope other Senators appreciate what is \nat stake. Just as past generations rallied to meet the formidable \nchallenges of the Great Depression, the Nazis, and the Cold War, we \nwill bear responsibility if we fail to meet the challenges of today.\n  The budget for diplomacy and development includes funding for our \nembassies and consulates that assist the millions of Americans who \ntravel, study, work and serve overseas.\n  It pays our contributions to U.N. peacekeeping missions that do not \nrequire the costly deployment of U.S. troops, UNICEF, the World Health \nOrganization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the operations of \nour NATO security pact, aid for refugees who have fled wars or natural \ndisasters, and to prevent the spread of AIDS, the Asian Flu, and other \ncontagious diseases that threaten Americans and people everywhere.\n  There are many other programs that promote U.S. exports, support \ndemocratic elections, combat poverty, and help build alliances with \ncountries whose support we need in countering terrorism, thwart drug \ntrafficking, protect the environment, and stop cross-border crime.\n  We do this and a lot more with less than 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget, yet it is a crucial investment in our national security.\n  It also is no wonder that other countries--our allies and our \ncompetitors--are spending more each year to project their influence \naround the world, and to compete in the global marketplace. Great \nBritain's conservative government is on a path to increase its \ninternational development assistance to .7 percent of its national \nbudget, compared to .2 percent for the United States. Yet the \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives proposes to slash \nfunding for these programs to pre-2008 levels.\n  Our leadership is being challenged unlike at any time since the Cold \nWar. In Latin America, which is a larger market for U.S. exports than \nany other region except the European Union, our market share is \nshrinking while China's is growing. It is the same story everywhere.\n  There is simply no substitute for U.S. global leadership. The world \nis changing, and we cannot afford to retrench or to succumb to \nisolationism. Funding that enables us to engage with our allies, \ncompetitors, and adversaries, while an easy political target, helps us \nto meet growing threats to our struggling economy and our national \nsecurity.\n  I strongly support this budget and have fought to protect it for \nyears. I also know there are competing needs and that we have to \neliminate waste.\n  We need to support what works, and stop funding what does not. Too \noften, government bureaucracies continue funding programs that fail, \nand that needs to stop. Billions of dollars provided to high priced \ncontractors and consultants for poorly conceived, wildly extravagant, \nunsustainable efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan have been wasted \nor stolen. This has further damaged the public's opinion of foreign \naid.\n  The bill that I and Senator Graham recommended to the Appropriations \nCommittee on September 21 and that was reported by a bipartisan vote of \n28-2 is $6 billion below the President's budget request. It scales back \nmost Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development \noperations and programs and will force them to significantly curtail \nplanned expenditures.\n  But the House bill cuts far deeper, and these are the cuts that \nPresident Bush and Secretary Rice warned about. There are unmistakable \nsigns that our global influence is already eroding. It is not \npreordained that the United States will remain the world's dominant \npower. As former Secretary Rice said, ``if we don't lead, somebody else \nwill.''\n  I doubt there is a single Member of Congress who, if asked, would say \nthey don't care if the United States becomes a second or third rate \npower. They expect the United States to lead, to build alliances, to \nhelp American companies compete successfully, and to protect the \ninterests and security of its citizens.\n  You can't have it both ways. You can't expect others to follow if you \ncan't lead, and you can't lead if you don't pay your way. This budget \nis a fraction of the Federal budget, yet it is a far cry from what this \ncountry should be investing.\n  We need to wake up, to stop acting like these investments don't \nmatter, that the State Department isn't important, that the United \nNations isn't important, that what happens in Brazil, Russia, the \nPhilippines, Somalia, or other countries doesn't matter, and that \nglobal threats to the environment, public health and safety will \nsomehow be solved by others.\n  Our budget for foreign operations already has gone through deep \nbudget cuts, with more to come. But the American people deserve to be \ntold that slashing, disproportionate cuts to these programs would have \nno appreciable impact on the deficit, and it would end up costing our \ncountry far more in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6325-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6325-S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    2011 DAVIDSON INSTITUTE FELLOWS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I have the great honor and \npleasure to recognize this year's Fellows for the Davidson Institute \nfor Talent Development. This year, 18 young people under the age of 18 \nhave been awarded scholarships of $50,000, $25,000, or $10,000 for \nhaving demonstrated superior ability and achievement and having \ncompleted a significant piece of work in the areas of science, music, \nliterature, mathematics, or technology. I would like to take this time \nto introduce each of these scholars and the various projects they have \nundertaken.\n  In the area of science, we have eight young students with remarkable \nprojects that have contributed to scientific progress. Among this group \nof scholars is Shalini Ramanan. A 17-year-old young woman from \nRichland, WA, Shalini Ramanan worked with a natural dietary component \nof the spice turmeric called BC to test its effectiveness in treating \ncardiovascular diseases. Through cell migration assays and western blot \ntechniques, she discovered that BC inhibited platelet-derived growth \nfactor (PDGF)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell migration and \nsignaling. Using bioinformatics, she identified target genes connected \nwith signaling pathways. PDGF-stimulated cell-migration and \nproliferation are key pathological events in a variety of diseases \nincluding atherosclerosis and cancer. Her studies may help design and \ncharacterize novel drug molecules with clinical applications.\n  A 17-year-old young man from Mahopac, NY, Jayanth Krishnan developed \nan approach to infer regulatory mechanisms governing changes in gene \nexpression and identified possible proteins that induce cancer. By \ncreating a web interface that could predict transcription factors for \ndis-regulated genes, and mathematical models using MATLAB, he was able \nto predict proteins that are correlated with certain cancer families. \nUsing this information, he calculated several combinations of drugs, \nfor 60 different cancers, that have the potential to counteract the \ninducing agents and better guide therapeutics.\n  Lucy Wang, a 17-year-old young woman from Garnet Valley, PA, \ndeveloped a predictive model to detect adolescent depression with an \noverall correct classification of 83.66 percent. Untreated depression \nis the No. 1 cause of suicide and the third leading cause of death \namong teenagers. Using factor analysis and logistic regression, she \nfocused on quantifying variables that may lead to adolescent \ndepression, including student self-reported experiences and \ndemographics. Lucy's model\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nwill offer a robust instrument for school psychologists to evaluate the \nrisk of future depression.\n  A 17-year-old young man from Houston, TX, Sunil Pai constructed an \ninexpensive, nanotechnology-based system to determine quantum energies \nof superoxide. By examining oxygen in the liquid phase instead of the \ngas phase, his potentiostat system can determine the quantum structure \nfor the electron attachment reaction of oxygen to superoxide. The \ndetermination of oxygen's physical properties is essential to fully \nunderstanding the role oxygen and many free radicals have in cell \nprocesses. This experimentation method may establish other molecular \nproperties that will offer new insights into biological and \nenvironmental processes.\n  Caleb Kumar, a 15-year-old young man from Blaine, MN, developed an \nalgorithm that automates the diagnosis of bladder cancer. Bladder \ncancer is on the rise with more than 71,000 new cases in 2009. By first \nidentifying indicative bladder cancer cellular characteristics, Caleb \nprogrammed morphometric algorithms to quantitatively examine the \nbladder cell images, and then engineered a Java neural network that \ndifferentiates cancerous cells from normal cells based on shape, color \nand curvature. Caleb's software is accurate, quick and inexpensive \ncompared to current methods, and has the potential to provide faster, \ncheaper and more precise diagnoses of cytological diseases.\n  A 17-year-old young man from Bloomfield Hills, MI, Siddhartha Jena \ndemonstrated that the immediate effect of elevated cholesterol is \ndysfunction of active water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide transport by \nthe red blood cells. Using a spectrofluorometer and Zeta Sizer, he \nshowed that exposure of red blood cells to two compounds: ONO-RS-082 \nand glyburide, results in an amelioration of cholesterol's detrimental \neffects. Results from his work broaden the understanding of one of the \nmost significant health risks facing our society, and the possible \nmechanism for its future treatment and management.\n  Benjamin Clark, a 15-year-old young man from Lancaster, PA, \ndetermined the frequency at which M stars form close binary star \nsystems using spectroscopic data from over 39,000 M dwarf stars. Using \nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS, Benjamin designed a methodology to \nuse the extremely large, but low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio \ndatabase, to calculate the close binary fraction. Star formation has \nlong been an open question in astrophysics and this data can be used to \ntest theories of how this process occurs.\n  A 16-year-old young woman from Lancaster, PA, Marian Bechtel designed \na seismo-acoustic method for detecting landmines. Approximately 70 \nmillion landmines plague 80 countries worldwide, claiming one victim \nevery 22 minutes. With Marian's method, two high-sensitivity, non-\ncontact microphones are swept above buried landmines that resonate in \nresponse to a remote seismic source. The recorded sound is noise-\ncancelled in real-time, creating a characteristic, audible null in the \nnoise-cancelled waveform that isolates the mine's location. This \nefficient and inexpensive method could make important contributions to \nhumanitarian demining.\n  Raja Selvakumar, a 15-year-old young man from Alpharetta, GA, \ndeveloped the gastro microbial fuel cell, GMFC. Based on the microbial \nfuel cell, the GMFC generates electricity using gastrobacteria, to be \nused to power capsular nanobots. Current lithium ion batteries in \nbiomedical capsular nanobots are not able to sustain power for long \nperiods of time; the GMFC has the potential to solve this problem. The \nGMFC-powered capsular nanobot can play an important role in treating \ngastrointestinal diseases through intracellular diagnosis and surgery.\n  In the area of mathematics, there are three young people who I would \nlike to recognize at this time. Matthew Bauerle, a 16-year-old young \nman from Fenton, MI, outlined how the Newton direction can be computed \nby solving a weighted linear least squares problem. When fitting a \nmodel to data, such as a line to a set of points, the least squares \nmethod is currently the most popular technique. Matthew's work focused \non minimizing the L1 norm of the error which is the sum of the absolute \nvalues of the individual errors. Matthew's work has potential in the \nmedical imaging and scanning fields, as well as facial recognition and \nfluid dynamics simulations.\n  A 16-year-old young woman from Carmel, IN, Rebecca Chen studied a \ngeneralized version of the Yang-Baxter equation. The Yang-Baxter \nequation provides a systematic method for discovering braid group \nrepresentations, important in topology and quantum information science. \nUsing algebraic computations and computer numerical checking, she \nclassified three families of 8x8 matrix solutions to the generalized \nYang-Baxter equation. These solutions provide a way to generate \nbraiding quantum gates needed in quantum computing, and contribute to \nthe ongoing effort to build a large-scale quantum computer, bringing \nadvances in fields as far ranging as materials sciences and \ncryptography.\n  Anirudh Prabhu, a 16-year-old young man from West Lafayette, IN, \nestablished the first nontrivial analytic lower bounds for odd perfect \nnumbers. The search for odd perfect numbers is one of the oldest \nunsolved problems in mathematics. Many upper bounds for odd perfect \nnumbers are established, however, no nontrivial analytic lower bounds \nhad been reported prior to Anirudh's work. By narrowing the gap between \nanalytic upper and lower bounds, his work suggests an approach for \nproving the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers and could contribute to \ndata encryption technology.\n  Two remarkable young people received awards for their technology \nprojects. A 16-year-old young man from Columbia, SC, Arjun Aggarwal \ncreated GNut-III, an anthropometric interactive robot with vision, \nintelligence and speech. He found the lack of an economically efficient \nand functional human robot has prohibited researchers from continuing \nto expand the field of robotics. To counter this, the GNut-III is \neconomically efficient and functional for testing robotic algorithms. \nIn addition to the GNut-III, Arjun has outlined a scattered open source \ncommunity to work on a standardized platform that could transform \nrobotics in the same way it has transformed computing.\n  A 16-year-old young woman from Rochester, MN, Cheenar Banerjee \ndeveloped a method for emotion detection by computers. It remains a \nchallenge for computers to recognize and respond correctly to the \nemotional states of an interactive user. After removing some facial \ndetail by converting facial images to black-and-white sketches, Cheenar \nused fractal analyses to differentiate among emotions using the fractal \ndimensions. This process has the potential to be simpler, cheaper and \nmore effective than current techniques of emotion detection by \ncomputers.\n  In the area of music, I would like to recognize three more scholars. \nA 14-year-old young woman from Seattle, WA, Simone Porter, in her \nviolin portfolio, Performance as Soundtrack of Process and Identity, \nexamines the progression of performance preparation, from the \ndevelopment of technique and interpretation, to the emergence of a \nprofessional identity. This process led her to comprehend the \ntransformative, inspirational and transcendent potency music possesses. \nThrough performance, Simone believes music has the potential to aid our \nsociety, and help achieve a kinder, more tolerant attitude toward \nourselves and our natural environment. Simone was a featured performer \non PBS' ``From the Top at Carnegie Hall.''\n  A 16-year-old young woman from Gates Mills, OH, Arianna Korting, in \nher portfolio, Celebration of Life through the Piano, showcased Haydn, \nGinastera and Liszt. Through the piano, she hopes to bring audiences \ninto the lives of the great composers to experience their humor, \ntenderness and brilliance. She believes music has the power to \ntransform space and time because it has been a constant presence even \nthrough the most difficult moments in history. Arianna has been \nfeatured on NPR's ``From the Top,'' and started The Animato Project, an \ninteractive program of classical music for elementary school children.\n  Reylon Yount, a 16-year-old young man from San Francisco, CA, created \na yangqin, or Chinese hammered dulcimer, portfolio that has contributed\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nto the preservation of Chinese music, to the introduction of Chinese \nmusic to people in the United States, and to the overall \ninterconnection of the music world. His work attempts to take people \npast the conventional shapes and forms of Western music, helping them \nappreciate the universality of art. He hopes that such cross-cultural \nmusic will build a deeper connection between the East and West, and \ninspire people to love all music.\n  And finally, I would like to introduce Bonnie Nortz, a 17-year old \nyoung woman with superior achievement in the area of literature. \nBonnie's portfolio, Run and Run and Run, explores relationships, \nidentity, materialism, oppression and emotion, and covers topics as \nbroad as tourism, grammar, dreams, cartography, winter and even pre-\ncalculus. Her goal was to find the extraordinary in the mundane, the \npure in the imperfect, and to describe that moment of awakening when \neverything is just the way it should be. Bonnie hopes to teach others \nhow to go through life with an everlasting energy and curiosity and to \nappreciate the fantastic emotional and intellectual complexity that \ncomprises our human existence.\n  I have long said that America's gifted and talented students possess \nremarkable potential for our great Nation. These 18 young individuals \nhave demonstrated more than potential. They have already made \nsignificant contributions to their fields and our society in their \nshort lives and one can scarcely begin to imagine how much they will \ncontribute to their fields and society in the years to come, thanks in \nno small part to the encouragement of the Davidson Institute as well as \ntheir, family, friends, and mentors. These young men and women are an \ninspiration and a reminder that if we fully support our most talented \nyoung people, we can look forward to a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6327-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING MILLS AND MILLS LAW OFFICE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Mills and Mills \nLaw Office, a small family-owned law firm that has provided vital legal \nservices to the people of western Maine for 100 years.\n  The Mills family name has long been synonymous with the Farmington \narea. Sumner Mills began a small law firm there in May of 1911, after \nmoving his family from the coastal town of Stonington, where he had \npreviously opened a small law practice in 1904. Throughout the years, \nMills and Mills has offered its customers a wide range of legal \nservices, and at present primarily focuses on estate planning, business \nissues, and real estate. The company has previously offered fire and \ncasualty insurance. The firm currently has nine staff members, \nincluding Paul Mills, the grandson of the founder, who joined the firm \nin 1977 and is now a senior attorney.\n  On August 26, 150 members of the Farmington community gathered at the \nlaw office to celebrate its 100th anniversary. The date was selected \nbecause it marked what would have been the 100th birthday of Peter \nMills, Sumner's son and longtime attorney at Mills and Mills. Attendees \nreminisced about the law firm's storied history, and the event provided \nan opportunity to look forward to the office's future of helping the \nresidents of western Maine.\n  Today, I also recognize the longstanding commitment and vast \ncontributions of the Mills family to public service in the State of \nMaine. Peter, who joined Mills and Mills in 1940, was a member of the \nMaine House of Representatives for three terms, as well as the State \nsenate for two terms. He also served as a municipal court judge, and \nwas later U.S. attorney for Maine for 16 years under three Presidents. \nHis father had been a State legislator in Hancock County before moving \nto Farmington.\n  Many of Peter's children have gone on to follow in their father's and \ngrandfather's footsteps. Janet Mills served in the Maine House of \nRepresentatives, and later became our State's first female attorney \ngeneral. Peter Mills III, a former State senator from Somerset County \nand twice a candidate for Governor, now serves as executive director of \nthe Maine Turnpike Authority. And Doctor Dora Anne Mills is the former \ndirector of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Three generations of the Mills family have worked tirelessly to serve \nthe community in Franklin County and throughout western Maine. With a \npassion for the law and a dedication to public service, the Mills \nfamily has left an indelible mark on Maine history. Mills and Mills \nremains a tribute to the critical work begun 100 years ago by Sumner \nMills. I thank the entire Mills family for all of their efforts, and \nwish them and everyone at Mills and Mills success in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6327-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1343.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish a nanotechnology regulatory science program; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Cardin to \nintroduce the Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011 which will \nauthorize a program of regulatory science by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration on nanotechnology-based medical and health products.\n  Nanotechnology holds great promise to revolutionize the development \nof new medicines, drug delivery, and orthopedic implants while holding \ndown the cost of health care. However, Congress and the FDA must assure \nthe public that nanotechnology-based products are both safe and \nefficacious. The Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011 will \nenable the FDA to properly study how nanomaterials are absorbed by the \nhuman body, how nanomaterials designed to carry cancer fighting drugs \ntarget and kill tumors, and how nanoscale texturing of bone implants \ncan make a stronger joint and reduce the threat of infection.\n  Nanotechnology, or the manipulation of material at dimensions between \n1 and 100 nanometers, is a challenging scientific area. To put this \nsize scale in perspective, a human hair is 80,000 nanometers thick.\n  Nanomaterials have different chemical, physical, electrical and \nbiological characteristics than when used as larger, bulk materials. \nFor example, nanoscale silver has exhibited unique antibacterial \nproperties for treating infections and wounds. Nanomaterials have a \nmuch larger ratio of surface area to mass than ordinary materials do. \nIt is at the surface of materials that biological and chemical \nreactions take place and so we would expect nanomaterials to be more \nreactive than bulk materials.\n  The novel characteristics of nanomaterials mean that risk assessments \ndeveloped for ordinary materials may be of limited use in determining \nthe health and public safety of products based on nanotechnology.\n  The FDA needs the tools and resources to assure the public that \nnanotechnology-based medical and health products are safe and \neffective. The development of a regulatory framework for the use of \nnanomaterials in drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, sunscreens and food \nadditives must be based on scientific knowledge and data about each \nspecific technology and product. Without a robust regulatory science \nframework there is no way to know what data to collect. More than a \ndozen material characteristics have been suggested even for relatively \nsimple nanomaterials. Without better scientific knowledge of \nnanomaterials and their behavior in the human body, we do not know what \ndata to collect and examine.\n  In 2007, the FDA Nanotechnology Task Force published a report \nanalyzing the FDA's scientific program and regulatory authority for \naddressing nanotechnology in drugs, medical devices, biologics, and \nfood supplements. A general finding of the report is that nanoscale \nmaterials present regulatory challenges similar to those posed by \nproducts using other emerging technologies. However, these challenges \nmay be magnified because nanotechnology can be used to make almost any \nFDA-regulated product. Also, at the nanoscale, the properties of a \nmaterial relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the FDA-regulated \nproducts might change.\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\n  The Task Force recommended that the FDA focus on improving its \nscientific knowledge of nanotechnology to help ensure the agency's \nregulatory effectiveness, particularly with regard to products not \nsubject to premarket authorization requirements.\n  The FDA has already reviewed and approved some nanotechnology-based \nproducts. In the coming years, they expect a significant increase in \nthe use of nanomaterials in drugs, devices, biologics, cosmetics, food, \nand over-the-counter products. This will require the FDA to devote more \nof its regulatory attention to nanotechnology based products.\n  The FDA has already begun to devote some resources to the \nunderstanding of the human health effects and safety of nanotechnology. \nThe FDA has established a Nanotechnology Core Facility at the National \nCenter for Toxicological Research in Jefferson Arkansas. In August, \nArkansas Governor Beebe and FDA Commissioner Hamburg signed a \nmemorandum understanding creating a Virtual Center of Excellence in \nregulatory science pertaining to nanotechnology. Under the agreement, \nthe state's five research universities--the University of Arkansas, \nFayetteville; the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock; the University of Arkansas at \nPine Bluff, and Arkansas State University--will work with the NCTR to \nestablish a nanotechnology collaborative research program dealing \nspecifically with toxicity. In addition, UAMS will offer a Master's \ndegree and a certification program in regulatory science.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about two areas where nanotechnology is \nalready being applied to health care, the early detection of cancer and \nmultifunctional therapeutics.\n  The early detection of cancer can result in significant improvement \nin human health care and reduction in cost. Nanotechnology offers \nimportant new tools for detection where existing and more conventional \ntechnologies may be reaching their limits. The present obstacle to \nearly detection of cancer lies in the inability of existing tools to \ndetect these molecular level changes directly during early phases in \nthe genesis of a cancer. Nanotechnology can provide smart contrast \nagents and tools for real time imaging of a single cell and tissues at \nthe nanoscale.\n  Nanotechnology promises a host of minimally-invasive diagnostic \ntechniques and much research is aimed at ultra-sensitive labeling and \ndetection technologies. In the in vitro area, nanotechnology can help \ndefine cancers by molecular signatures denoting processes that reflect \nfundamental changes in cells and tissues that lead to cancer. Already, \ninvestigators have developed novel nanoscale in vitro techniques that \ncan analyze genomic variations across different tumor types and \ndistinguish normal from malignant cells.\n  In the in vivo area, one of the most pressing needs in clinical \noncology is for imaging agents that can identify tumors that are far \nsmaller than is possible with today's technology. Achieving this level \nof sensitivity requires better targeting of imaging agents and \ngeneration of a larger imaging signal, both of which nanoscale devices \nare capable of accomplishing.\n  Perhaps the greatest near-term impact of multifunctional therapeutic \ncompounds will come in the area of tumor targeting and cancer \ntherapies. Nanotechnology can be used to develop new methods of drug \ndelivery that better target selected tissues and cells, and to improve \non the efficiency of drug activity in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Drug \ndelivery applications will provide a solution to solubility problems, \nas well as offer intracellular delivery possibilities.\n  The introduction of nanotechnology to multifunctional therapeutics is \nat an early stage of development. The delivery of nanoscale \nmultifunctional therapeutics could permit very precise site specific \ntargeting of cancer cells. More sophisticated ``smart'' systems for \ndrug delivery still have to be developed that sense and respond to \nspecific chemical agents and are tailored to each patient. \nMultifunctional therapeutic devices need to be developed that \nsimultaneously detect, diagnose, treat and monitor response to the \ntherapy. For example, various nanomaterials can be made to link with a \ndrug, a targeting molecule and an imaging agent to seek out cancers and \nrelease their payload when required.\n  In conclusion, the Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011 will \nprovide the FDA the authority necessary to scientifically study the \nsafety and effectiveness of nanotechnology-based drugs, delivery \nsystems, medical devices, orthopedic implants, cosmetics, and food \nadditives regulated by the agency. This bill is a sound investment on \nthe promise of nanotechnology to improve human health and reduce costs \nin the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 28 and 10, United States Code, to \nallow for certiorari review of certain cases denied relief or review by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nEqual Justice for Our Military Act of 2011. The act would eliminate \ninequities in current law by allowing court-martialed servicemembers \nwho face dismissal, discharge or confinement for a year or more to seek \nreview by the United States Supreme Court.\n  In our civilian courts today, all persons convicted of a crime, if \nthey lose on appeal, have a right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court \nfor discretionary review. Even enemy combatants have the right to \ndirect appellate review in the Supreme Court.\n  In contrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this \nsame right. Our military personnel have a limited right to appeal to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. They can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court only \nif the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, CAAF, actually \nconducts a review of their case or grants a petition for extraordinary \nrelief. In other words, if the CAAF refuses to take their case, or \ndenies their extraordinary relief petition, the servicemember has no \nright to further review in the Supreme Court.\n  For fiscal years 2008 through 2010, the CAAF denied a total of 2230 \npetitions for review. The CAAF also averages about 20 denials of \nextraordinary relief petitions every year. Taken together, this means \nthat there are more than 750 court-martial decisions per year in which \nservicemembers are denied the opportunity to seek certiorari from the \nSupreme Court.\n  In addition to this disparity between our civilian and military court \nsystems, there is another disparity within the military court system \nitself. The government may petition the Supreme Court for review of \nadverse court-martial rulings in any case where the charges are severe \nenough to make a punitive discharge possible. But servicemembers do not \nhave the same rights to petition the Supreme Court that the military \nprosecutors on the other side of the aisle have.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a simple one, which would correct \nthese inequities. It would allow servicemembers whose appeals are \ndenied review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or who \nwere denied extraordinary relief, the opportunity to seek review of \nthose decisions by writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  While this legislation would provide a fairer legal process for \nservicemembers, it would not unduly burden the military or the Supreme \nCourt. As noted in the 2010 House Judiciary Committee Report on the \nlegislation, the expanded Supreme Court review of court-martial \ndecisions authorized by the legislation would result in only about 80-\n120 additional petitions for certiorari each year. Additionally, the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that the increased workload \nfor Department of Defense attorneys and Supreme Court clerks would cost \nless than $1 million each year.\n  Every day, our U.S. service personnel place their lives on the line \nin defense of American rights. It is unacceptable for us to continue to \nroutinely deprive our men and women in uniform of one of those rights--\nthe ability to petition their Nation's highest court for direct relief. \nIt is a right given to common criminals in our civilian courts, to the \nGovernment, and even to some of the terrorists who we hope to prosecute \nas war criminals.\n  It is long past time we give them the same rights as the American \ncitizens they fight, and sometimes die, to protect. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation to give equal justice \nto our U.S. servicemembers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1664\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Justice for Our \n     Military Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                   THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1259 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``or denied'' after \n     ``granted''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``or denied'' after \n     ``granted''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Title 10.--Section 867a(a) of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking ``The Supreme Court may not \n     review by a writ of certiorari under this section any action \n     of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in refusing to \n     grant a petition for review.''.\n       (2) Time for application for writ of certiorari.--Section \n     2101(g) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(g) The time for application for a writ of certiorari to \n     review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Armed Forces, or the decision of a Court of Criminal \n     Appeals that the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed \n     Forces refuses to grant a petition to review, shall be as \n     prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require certain standards and enforcement \nprovisions to prevent child abuse and neglect in residential programs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce this bill \ntoday. This legislation will play a critical role in ensuring the \nsafety of our Nation's youth who especially deserve to be safe and \ncared for when they are trying to get better in a residential treatment \nfacility. This bill is a companion to The Stop Child Abuse in \nResidential Programs for Teens Act, which was introduced in the House \ntoday by Representative George Miller. I commend Representative Miller \nfor his commitment to this important issue.\n  The emotional and mental well-being of our Nation's youth is of \nparamount importance. In recent years, the prevalence of child abuse in \nresidential facilities has jeopardized the livelihood of our nation's \nnext generation. In 2005, The Government Accountability Office reported \nover 1,500 incidences of abuse and neglect by facility staff in 34 \nStates. These incidences included shocking cases in which youth were \ndenied food and water or held in stress positions for extended periods \nof time. In 2006, 28 States reported at least one death in a \nresidential facility. This includes my State of Iowa and this is simply \nunacceptable. These deaths were a result of accidents or suicides that, \nin some instances, may have been caused by a lack of supervision or \nneglect. In 2009, 1,770 children and youth died from maltreatment, \nwhich in some cases, may be attributed to the inexperienced staff \nmembers who lack the proper training or qualifications to serve in \ntheir roles.\n  This legislation will make significant strides in improving the \nquality of care in residential program facilities. This bill will make \nimprovements in four key areas that will ensure that our children and \nyouth our safe. First, it includes new national standards that will \nprevent residential facilities from physically, mentally, or sexually \nabusing children in their care. Second, this bill increases \ntransparency on qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of all \ncurrent staff members. Third, it increases restrictions that will hold \nresidential programs accountable for violating the law. Lastly, this \nbill allows states the opportunity to step in to protect teens in \nresidential programs.\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge the youth who have lost their \nlives while in the care of a residential treatment facility and their \nparents and families. No child should be forced to suffer abuse, \nneglect, injury, or even death while they are trying to better \nthemselves in a residential program.\n  I would also like to mention those who have worked so hard on my \nstaff. I would like to thank Dan Smith and Pam Smith, who do a great \njob shepherding the undertakings of our committee. I would like to \nthank Bethany Little, David Johns, Ashley Eden and Michael Gamel-\nMcCormick of my staff.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners \nor operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or \nadaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the \nhydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Water \nInfrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2011 along with my \ncolleagues, Majority Leader Reid and Senator Boxer. This legislation \nwill allow local communities to improve their water infrastructure in \nthe face of changing hydrological conditions.\n  Improving our water infrastructure is a major challenge to my \nconstituents living in Maryland and to all Americans. It is no secret \nthat America's current water infrastructure systems are in poor \ncondition. Our water and wastewater systems have been given a D-, the \nlowest possible grade. In the United States, close to 250,000 water \nmains wasting 1.7 trillion gallons of water break each year.\n  Unfortunately, Marylanders have experienced this crisis first hand. \nIn July of this year, a water main break in Cumberland, Maryland, \ncaused close to $300,000 in damage to a local, family-owned business. \nLast January, a Prince George's County water main break shut down a \nportion of the Capital Beltway, closed local businesses and schools, \nand required 400,000 residents to boil their drinking water to ensure \nits safety.\n  The EPA has estimated that traditional necessary repairs and \nreplacement costs over the next twenty years will cost over $600 \nbillion.\n  We, as a Congress, have stepped up in the past to assist communities \nin fixing aging water infrastructure systems. The Safe Water Drinking \nAct Amendments of 1996 established the Drinking Water State Revolving \nFund. The fund helps public water systems finance infrastructure \nprojects needed to comply with Federal safe drinking water regulations.\n  But we need to do more. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told Congress \nthat adapting to changing hydrological conditions is a ``significant \nissue'' that water and waste water systems must address soon. These \nhydrological changes will likely result in ``too little water in some \nplaces, too much water in other places, and degraded water quality'' in \nother areas across the country.\n  According to a recent study by the National Association of Clean \nWater Agencies and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, the \ncosts in dealing with this new recognized problem could approach $1 \ntrillion through 2050.\n  The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to \nhelp local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water \ninfrastructure systems to meet these hydrological changes. The bill \ndirects the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and \nSustainability, WIRS, program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water \nsystems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country \nwill be able to compete for federal matching funds, funds which in turn \nwill help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats.\n  Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure \nsystems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water \nsupply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant \nmore than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation \nbetween local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try \nto award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible.\n  A healthy water infrastructure is as important to America's economy \nas paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has \nbeen shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has \nfound that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross \nDomestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of \nCommerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of \neconomic output in other industries. Every job created in local water \nand sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the \nnational economy.\n  This legislation would create jobs throughout the economy today, \nwhile helping water and wastewater systems make improvements to keep \nwater clean and safe for tomorrow. I believe that by investing in water \ninfrastructure, we can make progress for the American people on both \njobs and clean, safe water.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation in the \nSenate that would prohibit the use of racial profiling by Federal, \nState, or local law enforcement agencies. The End Racial Profiling Act, \nERPA, had been introduced in previous Congresses by former Senator Russ \nFeingold of Wisconsin and I am proud to follow his example. I want to \nthank Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, Gillibrand, Kerry, Lautenberg, \nLevin, Menendez, Mikulski, and Stabenow for joining me as original co-\nsponsors of this legislation.\n  Racial profiling is ineffective. The more resources that are spent \ninvestigating individuals solely because of their race or religion, the \nfewer resources are being directed at suspects actually demonstrating \nillegal behavior. Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff stated in \nresponse to questions about the December 2001 bomb attempt by Richard \nReid that ``the problem is that the profile many people think they have \nof what a terrorist is doesn't fit the reality . . . and in fact, one \nof the things the enemy does is to deliberately recruit people who are \nWestern in background or in appearance, so that they can slip by people \nwho might be stereotyping.''\n  Racial profiling diverts scarce resources from real law enforcement. \nIn my own state of Maryland, in the 1990's, the ACLU brought a class-\naction lawsuit against the Maryland State Police for illegally \ntargeting African-American motorists for stops and searches along \nMaryland's highways. The parties ultimately entered into a federal \ncourt consent decree in 2003 in which they made a joint statement that \nemphasized in part ``the need to treat motorists of all races with \nrespect, dignity, and fairness under the\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\nlaw is fundamental to good police work and a just society. The parties \nagree that racial profiling is unlawful and undermines public safety by \nalienating communities ``\n  Racial profiling demonizes entire communities and perpetuates \nnegative stereotypes based on an individual's race, ethnicity, or \nreligion. Earlier this year, I spoke out on the Senate floor and in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to share my thoughts on the hearings held in \nthe House of Representatives entitled ``The Extent of Radicalization in \nthe American Muslim Community and that Community's Response'' chaired \nby Congressman Peter King. This hearing served only to fan flames of \nfear and division. This spectacle crossed the line and chipped away at \nthe religious freedoms and civil liberties we hold so dearly. \nRadicalization may be the appropriate subject of a Congressional \nhearing but not when it is limited to one religion. When that is done, \nit sends the wrong message to the public and casts a religion with \nunfounded suspicions.\n  I agree with Attorney General Holder's remarks to the American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Committee, where he stated that ``in this nation, \nsecurity and liberty are--at their best--partners, not enemies, in \nensuring safety and opportunity for all . . . I've spoken to Arab-\nAmericans who feel that they have not been afforded the full rights--\nor, just as important, the full responsibilities--of their citizenship. \nThey tell me that, too often, it feels like `us versus them.' That is \nintolerable . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the \nsupreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to empower, not \nexclude . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can leave a lasting scar on \ncommunities and individuals. And it is, quite simply, bad policing--\nwhatever city, whatever state.''\n  Using racial profiling makes it less likely that certain affected \ncommunities will voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement and \ncommunity policing efforts. Minorities living and working in these \ncommunities may also feel discouraged from travelling freely, and it \ncorrodes the public's trust in government.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the End Racial Profiling Act, would \nbuild on Department of Justice's current ``Guidance Regarding the Use \nof Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies'' issued in 2003. This \nofficial DOJ guidance certainly was a step forward, but it does not \nhave adequate provisions for data collection and enforcement for state \nand local agencies. The DOJ guidance also does not have the force of \nlaw.\n  ERPA would prohibit the use of racial profiling by Federal, State, or \nlocal law enforcement agencies. The bill clearly defines racial \nprofiling to include race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion as \nprotected classes. It requires training of law enforcement officers to \nensure that they understand the law and its prohibitions. It creates \nprocedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving complaints about \nracial profiling. It would apply equally to Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement, which creates consistent standards at all levels of \ngovernment.\n  The vast majority of our law enforcement officials that put their \nlives on the line every day handle their jobs with professionalism, \ndiligence, and fidelity to the rule of law. However, Congress and the \nJustice Department can still take further steps to prohibit racial \nprofiling and root out its use. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1673. A bill to establish the Office of Agriculture Inspection \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security, which shall be headed by \nthe Assistant Commissioner for Agriculture Inspection, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Safeguarding \nAmerican Agriculture Act of 2011, with Senator Feinstein.\n  With the recent ten-year anniversary of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, it is appropriate to reflect on the significant changes our \ncountry has undertaken to strengthen our homeland defenses. We must \nexamine how well we are protecting the American people and our way of \nlife today, and, where vulnerabilities remain, take decisive action to \nbolster our defenses. The act we introduce today does just this, by \nseeking to strengthen our Nation's agricultural import and entry \ninspection functions to better safeguard American agriculture and \nnatural resources against foreign pests and disease.\n  Invasive species arrive at U.S. ports of entry every day, often \nhidden in the wooden crates, pallets, and shipping containers used to \ntransport agricultural cargo, or concealed in the imported goods \nthemselves. Failure to detect and intercept these non-native pests and \ndiseases imposes serious economic and social costs on all Americans.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that foreign pests and \ndisease already cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars \nannually in lower crop values, eradication programs, emergency payments \nto farmers, and increased costs for food and other natural resources. \nThe invasive asian stink bug, for example, is ravaging mid-Atlantic \ncrops, often destroying significant portions of apple, peach, \nblackberry, raspberry, strawberry, tomato, pepper, sweet corn, and \nsoybean harvests. The bug continues to spread despite ongoing Federal, \nState, and local eradication efforts. Invasive species threaten our \ncompetitiveness in international trade when trading partners decide to \nstop importing U.S. agricultural products due to the presence of an \ninvasive pest or disease. For example, Japan continues to ban the \nimportation of fresh potatoes from Idaho due to a 2006 outbreak of \nPotato Cyst Nematode in the State. A research team comprised of \nbiologists and economists from U.S. and Canadian universities and the \nU.S. Forest Service published a study last month finding that invasive \nwood-boring pests, such as the emerald ash borer and the asian \nlonghorned beetle, cost homeowners an estimated $830 million a year in \nlost property values and cost local governments an estimated $1.7 \nbillion a year as a result of damaged trees and woodlands. Worst of \nall, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the \naccidental or deliberate introduction of a foreign disease, such as \navian influenza or foot-and-mouth disease, would likely result in \ncatastrophic economic losses for our Nation and take lives.\n  In light of the current and potential staggering economic costs of \ninvasive species--which fall on businesses, taxpayers, and local \ngovernments that have no way to avoid the harm it is clear that \nfocusing on prevention, specifically improving agricultural import and \nentry inspection operations at our ports of entry, is a very cost-\neffective strategy.\n  Of course, economic costs are just one aspect of the severe \nconsequences that can result from foreign pests and disease slipping \nthrough our ports. In my home State of Hawai'i, which is home to more \nendangered species per square mile than any other area on the planet, \ninvasive species and disease could permanently devastate our fragile \necosystem. In many regions of the country, invasive species threaten \nnative fish prized by fisherman, and destroy wetlands that support \nwaterfowl hunting. Even an important part of our American tradition and \npastime, baseball, is at stake. For the past 127 years in Kentucky, \nLouisville Slugger, the world's largest and oldest maker of baseball \nbats, has manufactured high quality baseball bats from northern white \nash trees harvested in Pennsylvania and New York. However, the company \nis very concerned that the destructive emerald ash borer beetle, which \nhas already destroyed millions of ash trees in several States, \nincluding Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, could \nlead to the extinction of northern white ash trees, preventing \nLouisville Slugger from providing future generations with the company's \nfamous ash bats.\n  Following the attacks of September 11, Congress passed the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, which unified Federal customs, immigration, and \nagriculture inspection officers under the new U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security. The decision to transfer frontline agricultural \nimport and entry inspection functions from the Department of \nAgriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, \ninto the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\nProtection, or CBP, was a controversial decision.\n  I have long been concerned that the transfer resulted in significant \ndisruptions to the agriculture mission and undermined the effectiveness \nof agricultural inspections. Other Members of Congress have expressed \nsimilar concerns, and there have even been efforts to remove \nagricultural inspection responsibilities from the Department of \nHomeland Security and return them to the Department of Agriculture.\n  While I understand these sentiments, as Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Oversight of Government Management, I understand that such drastic \nreorganizations are often costly and disruptive. In light of our \nNation's fiscal challenges, I have concluded it is most efficient and \neffective to focus on strengthening the agricultural inspection mission \nwithin CBP, which in recent years, has made meaningful progress in \nstabilizing the agency's agricultural import and entry inspection \noperations.\n  The Safeguarding American Agriculture Act seeks to build upon these \ngains and fully achieve important measures of success identified in the \nJune 2007 Report of the APHIS-CBP Joint Task Force on Improved \nAgriculture Inspection, which stated ``Success will be accomplished \nwhen the agriculture function within CBP is positioned prominently \nthroughout the organization. The potential introduction of plant and \nanimal pest and diseases will be regarded with the same fervor as all \nother mission areas within CBP.''\n  The Act would enhance the priority of, and accountability for, the \nagriculture mission by establishing within CBP an Office of Agriculture \nInspection led by an Assistant Commissioner responsible for improving \nagricultural inspections across the Nation. This provision would \nimprove efficiency and coordination by unifying agriculture policy \ndevelopment with agriculture operations. An agricultural chain of \ncommand that extends from the Assistant Commissioner for Agriculture \nInspection to frontline agriculture specialists at the ports would also \neffectively address a key issue the task force identified in its 2007 \nreport: ``Management and leadership infrastructure supporting the \nagriculture mission in CBP should be staffed and empowered at levels \nequivalent to other functional mission areas in CBP.''\n  Under the present organizational structure, the Deputy Executive \nDirector for CBP's office of Agriculture Operational Oversight within \nthe office of Agriculture Programs and Trade Liaison, which falls under \nthe Office of Field Operations, is responsible for improving oversight \nof the agricultural mission across all CBP field offices by ensuring a \nmore consistent application of agriculture inspection policy. However, \nthe Deputy Executive Director lacks operational authority over the \nagriculture mission. Moreover, the dissemination and implementation of \nagricultural policy at the ports is ultimately at the discretion of CBP \nOfficers who typically do not have agriculture expertise and are \nprimarily focused on the critical mission of preventing terrorists and \nterrorist weapons from entering the country.\n  To maintain a highly skilled and motivated agriculture specialist \nworkforce, the Act would require CBP to create a comprehensive \nagriculture specialist career track that identifies appropriate career \npaths and ensures that agriculture specialists receive the training, \nexperience, and assignments necessary for successful career. The bill \nalso would require CBP to develop plans to improve agriculture \nspecialist recruitment and retention and to make sure agriculture \nspecialists have the necessary equipment and resources to effectively \ncarry out their mission.\n  To strengthen critical working relationships and promote interagency \nexperience, the Act would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security \nand the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an interagency rotation \nprogram for CBP and APHIS personnel.\n  Taken together, the enhancements contained in the Safeguarding \nAmerican Agriculture Act of 2011 would elevate the stature of the \nagriculture mission in CBP to match the magnitude of the challenge \nposed by invasive pests and disease. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve teacher quality, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act to foster the development of highly skilled and effective \neducators.\n  We are working towards reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act--ESEA--this Congress for the first time since 2001. One \nof my highest priorities for reauthorization is to build the capacity \nof our Nation's schools to enhance the effectiveness of teachers, \nprincipals, school librarians, and other school leaders.\n  Decades of research have demonstrated that improving educator and \nprincipal quality as well as greater family involvement are the keys to \nraising student achievement and turning around struggling schools. To \nstrengthen teaching and school leadership, the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act would amend Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA, to provide targeted assistance to schools to \ndevelop and support effective teachers, school librarians, principals, \nand school leaders through implementation of comprehensive induction, \nprofessional development, and evaluation systems.\n  Every year across the country thousands of teachers leave the \nprofession--many within their first years of teaching. A report by the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future has estimated that \nthe nationwide cost of replacing public school teachers who have \ndropped out of the profession is $7.3 billion annually.\n  Fortunately, we have some proven strategies to support teachers that \nwill keep them in our schools. Evidence has shown that providing new \nteachers with comprehensive mentoring and support during their two \nyears reduces teacher attrition by as much as half and increases \nstudent learning gains. The Effective Teaching and Leading Act would \nhelp schools implement the key elements of effective multi-year \nmentoring and induction for beginning teachers.\n  The bill also significantly revises ESEA's current definition of \n``professional development'' to foster an ongoing culture of teacher, \nprincipal, school librarian, and staff collaboration throughout \nschools. All too often current professional development still consists \nof isolated, check-the-box activities instead of helping educators \nengage in sustained professional learning that is regularly evaluated \nfor its impact on classroom practice and student achievement. Effective \nprofessional development is collaborative, job-embedded, and data-\ndriven.\n  It is also clear that evaluation systems have an important role to \nplay in teacher and principal development. Through Race to the Top and \nother initiatives many states and school systems are focusing on \nreforming their evaluation systems. When evaluation is done right, it \nprovides teachers and principals with individualized ongoing feedback \non their strengths and weaknesses and offers a path to improvement. The \nEffective Teaching and Leading Act would require school districts to \nestablish rigorous, fair, and transparent evaluation systems that use \nmultiple measures, including growth in student achievement.\n  Principals and school leaders also have a critical role to play in \nleading school improvement efforts and managing a collaborative culture \nof ongoing professional learning and development. Research has shown \nthat leadership is second only to classroom instruction among school-\nrelated factors that influence student outcomes. As such, this bill \nwould provide ongoing high-quality professional development to \nprincipals and school leaders, including multi-year induction and \nmentoring for new administrators.\n  Recognizing the importance of creating career advancement and \nleadership opportunities for teachers, the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act supports opportunities for teachers to serve as mentors, \ninstructional coaches, or master teachers, or take on increased \nresponsibility for professional development, curriculum, or school \nimprovement activities and calls for significant and sustainable \nstipends for teachers that take on these new roles and \nresponsibilities.\n  The bill also addresses working conditions that are so critical for \neffective teaching. Under the legislation, districts would conduct \nsurveys of the working and learning conditions educators face so this \ndata could be used to better target investments and support.\n  Improving teaching and school leadership is not simply a matter of \nsorting the good teachers and principals from the bad. What is needed \nis a comprehensive and integrated approach that supports new teachers \nand leaders as they enter the profession; provides on-going \nprofessional development that helps them improve and their students to \nachieve; and that fairly assesses performance and provides feedback for \nimprovement. This is the approach taken by the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act.\n  I worked with a range of education organizations in developing this \nbill, including the American Federation of Teachers; American \nAssociation of Colleges for Teacher Education; Association for \nSupervision and Curriculum Development; National Association of \nElementary School Principals; National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals; National Board for Professional Teaching Standards; \nLearning Forward; and the New Teacher Center. I thank them for their \ninput and support for the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Effective Teaching and Leading \nAct and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1674\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Effective Teaching and \n     Leading Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Teacher quality is the single most important in-school \n     factor influencing student learning and achievement.\n       (2) A report by William L. Sanders and June C. Rivers \n     showed that if 2 average 8-year-old students were given \n     different teachers, 1 of them a high performer, the other a \n     low performer, the students' performance diverged by more \n     than 50 percentile points within 3 years.\n       (3) A similar study by Heather Jordan, Robert Mendro, and \n     Dash Weerasinghe showed that the performance gap between \n     students assigned 3 effective teachers in a row, and those \n     assigned 3 ineffective teachers in a row, was 49 percentile \n     points.\n       (4) In Boston, research has shown that students placed with \n     high-performing mathematics teachers made substantial gains, \n     while students placed with the least effective teachers \n     regressed and their mathematics scores decreased.\n       (5) McKinsey & Company found that studies that take into \n     account all of the available evidence on teacher \n     effectiveness suggest that students placed with high-\n     performing teachers will progress 3 times as fast as those \n     placed with low-performing teachers.\n       (6) A 2003 study by Richard Ingersoll found that new \n     teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, face such \n     challenging working conditions that nearly one-half leave the \n     profession within their first 5 years, one-third leave within \n     their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end of their \n     first year.\n       (7) A report by the National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future estimated that the nationwide cost of \n     replacing public school teachers who have dropped out of the \n     profession is $7,300,000,000 annually.\n       (8) A randomized controlled trial of comprehensive teacher \n     induction, sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences \n     found that beginning teachers who received 2 years of \n     induction support produced greater student learning gains as \n     a result, the equivalent of a student moving from the 50th to \n     58th percentile in mathematics achievement and from the 50th \n     to 54th percentile in reading achievement.\n       (9) Research by Thomas Smith, Richard Ingersoll, Michael \n     Strong, Anthony Villar, and\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\n     Jonah Rockoff has shown that comprehensive mentoring and \n     induction reduces teacher attrition by as much as one-half \n     and strengthens new teacher effectiveness.\n       (10) A recent School Redesign Network at Stanford \n     University and National Staff Development Council report by \n     Linda Darling-Hammond, Ruth Chung Wei, Alethea Andree, Nikole \n     Richardson, and Stelios Orphanos found that--\n       (A) a set of programs that offered substantial contact \n     hours of professional development (ranging from 30 to 100 \n     hours in total) spread over 6 to 12 months showed a positive \n     and significant effect on student achievement gains; and\n       (B) intensive professional development, especially when it \n     includes applications of knowledge to teachers' planning and \n     instruction, has a greater chance of influencing teacher \n     practices, and in turn, leading to gains in student learning, \n     and such intensive professional development has shown a \n     positive and significant effect on student achievement gains, \n     in some cases by approximately 21 percentile points.\n       (11) Teachers can acquire and use new knowledge and skills \n     in their instruction when provided with adequate \n     opportunities to learn, according to ``Student Achievement \n     Through Staff Development'' published by ASCD, which found \n     that more than 90 percent of participants attained skill \n     proficiency if it includes theory presentation, \n     demonstration, practice, and peer coaching.\n       (12) Recent reports from the Center for American Progress, \n     Education Sector, Hope Street Group, and the New Teacher \n     Project have collectively demonstrated the significant flaws \n     in current teacher evaluation and implementation, and the \n     necessity for redesigning these systems and linking such \n     evaluation to individualized feedback and substantive \n     targeted support in order to ensure effective teaching.\n       (13) Research by Kenneth Leithwood, Karen Seashore Louis, \n     Stephen Anderson, and Kyla Wahlstrom found that--\n       (A) leadership is second only to classroom instruction \n     among school-related factors that influence student outcomes; \n     and\n       (B) direct and indirect leadership effects account for \n     about one-quarter of total school effects on student \n     learning.\n       (14) Research by Charles Clotfelter, Helen Ladd, Kenneth \n     Leithwood, Anthony Milanowski, and the New Teacher Center has \n     shown that the quality of working conditions, particularly \n     supportive school leadership, impacts student academic \n     achievement and teacher recruitment, retention, and \n     effectiveness.\n       (15) Since 1965, more than 60 education and library studies \n     have produced clear evidence that school libraries staffed by \n     qualified librarians have a positive impact on student \n     academic achievement, with a recent analysis of reading \n     scores from 2004-2009 showing that fewer librarians \n     translated to lower performance, or a slower rise in scores, \n     on standardized tests.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to build \n     capacity for developing effective teachers and principals in \n     our Nation's schools through--\n       (1) the redesign of teacher and principal evaluation and \n     assessment systems;\n       (2) comprehensive, high-quality, rigorous, multi-year \n     induction and mentoring programs for beginning teachers, \n     principals, and other school leaders;\n       (3) systematic, sustained, and coherent professional \n     development for all teachers that is team-based and job-\n     embedded;\n       (4) systematic, sustained, and coherent professional \n     development for school principals, other school leaders, \n     school librarians, paraprofessionals, and other staff; and\n       (5) increased teacher leadership opportunities, including \n     compensation for teacher leaders who take on new roles in \n     providing school-based professional development, mentoring, \n     rigorous evaluation, and instructional coaching.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A joint resolution limiting the issuance of a letter of \noffer with respect to a certain proposed sale of defense articles and \ndefense services to the Kingdom of Bahrain; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Congressional \nJoint Resolution to prevent the sale of $53 million worth of arms to \nthe Government of Bahrain.\n  As I witness the series of extraordinary events that are sweeping \nacross the Arab world, I am reminded of our own history, and America's \nstruggle that led to the ideas that are enshrined in our Constitution. \nFreedom of speech. Freedom of religion. The right of people to \npeaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of \ngrievances. The Arab Spring, reminds us that these freedoms are indeed \nuniversally sought.\n  The United States should stick up for individuals seeking such \nfreedoms. not reward those who violently suppress such aspirations.\n  Selling weapons to the Government of Bahrain right now is about as \nbackwards as a teacher giving the playground bully a pair of brass \nknuckles instead of putting him in detention. When the rulers of \nBahrain are committing human right abuses against peaceful protesters, \nshould we really be rewarding this type of behavior?\n  First, some context. Protests erupted in Bahrain on the heels of \nprotests in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, as part of what is being \ncalled the Arab Spring. For many years the Shiite majority of Bahrain \nhas been ruled by a Sunni royal family that has excluded most Shiites \nfrom political power and economic opportunity. When the people of \nBahrain went to the streets to protest, the government responded with \ncrushing force. Police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, killing \nseven and seriously wounding hundreds. Protestors and dissident leaders \nwere rounded up and arrested.\n  It is estimated that 30 people have been killed by government \nsecurity forces since the start of these largely peaceful protests. \nGovernment agencies also fired more than 2,500 people suspected of \nsympathizing with the protestors and their democratic demands. A \nspecial military court was established by decree and has convicted over \n100 people on dubious grounds.\n  Recently, 20 doctors who were caught treating wounded protestors were \nsentenced to prison terms as long as 15 years. One of the doctors said \nshe was tortured and threatened with rape while in custody. In \nexplaining the reason for her offense, the doctor said ``My only crime \nis I did my job; I helped people.'' Amnesty International has pointed \nout that an increasing number of cases involving civilians arrested are \nnow being primarily tried in military court, without due process.\n  Human Rights Watch also reports that four people have died in \ncustody. Their suspected cause of death is torture, and medical \nneglect. Leading political opposition figures who are demanding \ndemocratic reforms have been sentenced, in some cases, to life in \nprison, solely for their role in organizing peaceful protests.\n  Life in prison just for trying to hold their government \ndemocratically accountable. Just because they want the same \nopportunities as their Sunni neighbors. Just because they want to \npetition their government for a redress of grievances. I read these \nreports and I ask myself what our own constitutional framers would have \nto say about such actions.\n  So what's the Administration's response to Bahrain's actions? What's \nour government's response to these human rights violations? Well, Mr. \nPresident, the Administration has publicly called for an end to the \nviolence. Secretary Clinton has said that the murder of unarmed \nprotesters must stop.\n  However, at the same time, the Administration formally notified \nCongress on September 14 of its plans to sell the ruling regime of \nBahrain 44 Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, over \n200 anti-tank missiles and 50 bunker buster missiles, 48 missile \nlaunchers, spare parts, support and test equipment, personnel training \nand training equipment, technical and logistics support services, among \nother things, all for 53 million dollars. The State Department also \nnotified Congress that it is preparing to send $15.5 million in Foreign \nMilitary Financing to Bahrain.\n  Like I said we are giving the bully brass knuckles--and then some.\n  Should our country really reward a regime that has stifled its \ncitizen's freedom of speech; a regime that has openly fired on \npeacefully assembled protestors; a regime who has tortured doctors for \nsimply treating their fellow citizens?\n  I cannot support this sale while these abuses continue. That is why \nI, along with my colleague Congressman McGovern in the House of \nRepresentatives, am introducing this Congressional joint resolution. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in sending a message to Bahrain that we \nwill not reward human rights abuses.\n  To quote from the President's address to the United Nations General \nAssembly last month: ``Something is happening in our world. The way \nthings have been is not the way they will be. The humiliating grip of \ncorruption and tyranny is being pried open. Technology is putting power \nin the hands of the people. The youth are delivering a powerful rebuke \nto dictatorship, and rejecting the lie that some races, religions and \nethnicities do not desire democracy.'' Well it is clear that the people \nof Bahrain desire greater democracy and opportunity and we should not \nbe rewarding their oppressors with an arms sale at this time. \nColleagues, please join me in cosponsoring this Congressional joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas the Kingdom of Bahrain is a party to several \n     international human rights instruments, including the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted \n     December 16, 1966, and entered into force March 23, 1976, and \n     the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York December \n     10, 1984;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain had made several notable \n     human rights reforms during the 2000s;\n       Whereas, despite those reforms, significant human rights \n     concerns remained in early 2011, including the alleged \n     mistreatment of detained persons and the discrimination \n     against certain Bahraini citizens in the political, economic, \n     and professional spheres of Bahrain;\n       Whereas this discrimination has included the banning of \n     particular religious groups from holding specific government \n     positions, including the military and security services, \n     without reasonable justification;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of protesters in the Kingdom \n     of Bahrain have significantly intensified their calls for \n     government reform and respect for human rights starting in \n     February 2011;\n       Whereas independent observers, including the Department of \n     State, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, Amnesty \n     International, and Freedom House, found that the majority of \n     protesters have been peaceful in their demands, and that acts \n     of violence by protesters have been rare;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has systematically \n     suppressed the protests through a wide range of acts \n     constituting serious and grave violations of human rights;\n       Whereas, according to the Project of Middle East Democracy, \n     at least 32 people have been killed by the Government of \n     Bahrain's security forces since February 2011;\n       Whereas at least three deaths occurred while the \n     individuals were in detention, according to the Ministry of \n     Interior of the Government of Bahrain;\n       Whereas there have been credible reports from Human Rights \n     Watch, Human Rights\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\n     First, Physicians for Human Rights, and the Bahrain Center \n     for Human Rights of severe mistreatment of detainees, \n     including acts rising to the level of torture;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has investigated and \n     prosecuted individuals who were only peacefully exercising \n     their rights to freedom of expression, political opinion, and \n     assembly;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has continued to \n     prosecute civilians, including medical professionals, in \n     military-security courts;\n       Whereas cases continued to be tried in the military-\n     security courts despite promises by the Government of Bahrain \n     to transfer those cases to civilian venues;\n       Whereas the military-security courts' procedures and \n     actions severely limited due process rights or complied with \n     due process formally rather than substantively;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain's recent promises to have \n     civilian courts hear the appeals from military-security \n     courts are insufficient to rectify the due process violations \n     that occurred at the trial stage;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has moved quickly to \n     prosecute and sentence political opponents to lengthy prison \n     terms, while at the same time slowly investigating, or \n     failing to investigate at all, government and security \n     officials who appear to have committed or assisted in human \n     rights violations against political opponents;\n       Whereas Physicians for Human Rights has documented that the \n     Government of Bahrain's security forces have targeted medical \n     personnel by abducting medical workers, abusing patients, \n     intimidating wounded protesters from accessing medical \n     treatment, and sentencing medical professionals to lengthy \n     prison terms in the military-security courts for protesting \n     the government's interference in treating injured protesters;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has destroyed more than \n     40 Shi'a mosques and religious sites throughout Bahrain since \n     February 2011;\n       Whereas Bahrain's legislative lower house, the Council of \n     Representatives (Majlis an-nuwab) is constituted of \n     disproportionately drawn districts that violates the \n     principle of equal suffrage for Bahraini citizens, \n     particularly the Shi'a community;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain employed tactics of \n     retribution against perceived political opponents, dismissing \n     more than 2,500 workers, academics, medics, and other \n     professionals from their places of employment;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has violated \n     international labor standards through the dismissals of the \n     aforementioned citizens;\n       Whereas the Department of Labor has received an official \n     complaint regarding the failure of the Government of Bahrain \n     to live up to its commitments with respect to workers' rights \n     under its Free Trade Agreement with the United States;\n       Whereas the state-run media of Bahrain have gone beyond \n     legitimate criticism of political opponents towards \n     explicitly and implicitly threatening the physical safety and \n     integrity of those opponents specifically and the Shi'a \n     community generally, creating greater animosity amongst the \n     entire population and making reconciliation of all Bahraini \n     citizens more difficult;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has expelled \n     international journalists and stopped issuing visas to \n     journalists on grounds that do not appear to be justified by \n     legitimate safety or security concerns;\n       Whereas the Department of State included Bahrain among a \n     list of countries necessitating additional human rights \n     scrutiny in a June 15, 2011, submission to the United Nations \n     Human Rights Council;\n       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has taken limited \n     positive measures in recent months, including agreeing to \n     allow the establishment of the Bahrain Independent Commission \n     of Inquiry (BICI) composed of well-renowned international \n     human rights experts who are authorized to investigate human \n     rights violations and recommend measures for accountability;\n       Whereas the BICI human rights report is due to be submitted \n     to the Government of Bahrain on October 30, 2011;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense notified Congress on \n     September 14, 2011, of a proposed military arms sale to \n     Bahrain worth approximately $53,000,000;\n       Whereas the Department of State notified Congress on \n     September 13, 2011, of a proposed obligation of Foreign \n     Military Funds in the amount of $15,461,000 for the upgrading \n     and maintenance of certain military equipment;\n       Whereas other military allies of the United States, \n     including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Belgium, \n     have suspended or limited certain licenses and arms sales to \n     Bahrain since February 2011;\n       Whereas evidence gathered from protesters by the Bahrain \n     Center for Human Rights indicated that tear gas canisters \n     used against peaceful protesters contained markings which \n     showed they were manufactured in the United States; and\n       Whereas providing military equipment and provisions for \n     upgrades to a government that commits human rights violations \n     and that has undertaken insufficient measures to seek reform \n     and accountability is at odds with United States foreign \n     policy goals of promoting democracy, human rights, \n     accountability, and stability: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 288\n\n       Whereas in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican \n     Island;\n       Whereas in 2011, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the premier \n     system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the world, \n     and has grown to more than 150,000,000 acres, 553 national \n     wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management districts in \n     every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the Nation, and these protected lands offer a variety of \n     recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas more than 370 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and more than 350 units of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, \n     averaging more than 2,500,000 hunting visits and more than \n     7,100,000 fishing visits;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     28,200,000 wildlife observation visits annually;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate $4 in economic activity;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     approximately 45,700,000 visits every year, generating nearly \n     $1,700,000,000 and 27,000 jobs in local economies;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas since 1934, more than $750,000,000 in funds, from \n     the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to outdoor enthusiasts, \n     has enabled the purchase or lease of more than 5,300,000 \n     acres of waterfowl habitat in the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System;\n       Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect \n     imperiled species, and of the more than 1,300 federally \n     listed threatened and endangered species in the United \n     States, 280 species are found on units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas 39,000 volunteers and more than 220 national \n     wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute nearly \n     1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 665 full-time \n     employees, and provide an important link with local \n     communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas because there are national wildlife refuges located \n     in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge located \n     within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in the \n     United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, and \n     engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held \n     festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek \n     stakeholder input on the implementation of the \n     recommendations in the document entitled ``Conserving the \n     Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', which is \n     an update to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service for the future of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 9, 2011, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service;\n       Whereas in 2011, the designation of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States and would serve to raise \n     awareness about the importance of wildlife and the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System and to celebrate the myriad \n     recreational opportunities available to enjoy this network of \n     protected lands: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 9, 2011, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife Refuge \n     Week with appropriate events and activities;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for future generations;\n       (5) identifies the significance of national wildlife \n     refuges in advancing the traditions of wildlife observation, \n     photography, environmental education, and interpretation;\n       (6) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems, as well as compatible uses;\n       (7) acknowledges the role of national wildlife refuges in \n     conserving waterfowl and waterfowl habitat pursuant to the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755, chapter 128);\n       (8) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife \n     conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       (9) expresses the intent of the Senate--\n       (A) to continue working to conserve wildlife; and\n       (B) to manage the National Wildlife Refuge System for \n     current and future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6349-1", "month":

Res. 290\n\n       Whereas Jumpstart, a national early education organization, \n     is working to ensure that all children in the United States \n     enter school prepared to succeed;\n       Whereas, year-round, Jumpstart recruits and trains college \n     students and community members to serve preschool children in \n     low-income neighborhoods, helping them to develop the key \n     language and literacy skills necessary to succeed in school \n     and in life;\n       Whereas, since 1993, Jumpstart has engaged more than 20,000 \n     adults in service to more than 90,000 young children in \n     communities across the United States;\n       Whereas Jumpstart's Read for the Record, presented in \n     partnership with the Pearson Foundation, is a national \n     campaign that mobilizes adults and children in an effort to \n     close the early education achievement gap in the United \n     States by setting a reading world record;\n       Whereas the goals of the campaign are to raise awareness in \n     the United States of the importance of early education, \n     provide books to children in low-income households through \n     donations and sponsorship, and celebrate the commencement of \n     Jumpstart's program year;\n       Whereas October 6, 2011, would be an appropriate date to \n     designate as ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'' because \n     it is the date Jumpstart aims to set the world record for the \n     largest shared reading experience; and\n       Whereas Jumpstart hopes to engage more than 2,100,000 \n     children in reading Anna Dewdney's ``Llama Llama Red Pajama'' \n     during this record-breaking celebration of reading, service, \n     and fun, all in support of preschool children in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of October 6, 2011, as \n     ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'';\n       (2) commends Jumpstart's Read for the Record in its sixth \n     year;\n       (3) encourages adults, including grandparents, parents, \n     teachers, and college students--\n       (A) to join children in creating the world's largest shared \n     reading experience; and\n       (B) to show their support for early literacy and \n     Jumpstart's early education programming for young children in \n     low-income communities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to Jumpstart, one of the \n     leading nonprofit organizations in the United States in the \n     field of early education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/06/senate-section/article/S6350-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 736.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 201.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 201) expressing the regret of the \n     Senate for the passage of discriminatory laws against the \n     Chinese in America, including the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, beginning more than 140 years ago, Congress \nenacted a series of racist and discriminatory laws directed \nspecifically at persons of Chinese descent. Collectively known as the \nChinese Exclusion Laws, these laws remained in force for more than 60 \nyears, and were repealed only as a matter of wartime expediency during \nWorld War II. These laws conflicted directly with the fundamental \nprinciples of equality and justice upon which our Nation was founded. \nIt is long past time for Congress to affirmatively reject the ignorance \nand hate that spurred passage of those laws.\n  S. Res. 201 reflects the Senate's regret for the passage of those \nunjust laws, but also affirms our commitment to ensuring that such \npolicies never become law again. I commend the individuals and \norganizations that have advocated for this important resolution.\n  The Chinese Exclusion Laws reflected a climate of intolerance and \nxenophobia that viewed immigrants of Chinese descent as inferior and \nincapable of assimilating as loyal Americans. Fueled in large part by \nan economic crisis and fears that Chinese immigrants would take jobs \naway from other workers, the hostility against Chinese immigrants \nsometimes turned violent. Through a number of state laws and ordinances \nin many Western states and several questionable court rulings, Chinese \nimmigrants were systematically deprived of fundamental civil rights and \nprivileges, rights that should be guaranteed to all by our \nConstitution.\n  Eventually, political pressure led Congress to prohibit the \nimmigration of all Chinese persons into the United States. The Chinese \nExclusion Act of 1882 explicitly banned Chinese immigrants from \nentering the United States for 10 years, and this ban was renewed and \nultimately made permanent by Congress through subsequent enactments. In \npassing these laws, Congress failed to adhere to our Nation's basic \nfounding principles that all are created equal, and that all persons \ndeserve basic human and civil rights. Instead, Congress allowed fear \nand ignorance to drive our Nation's immigration policy and, for the \nfirst time, to exclude from our country a single group of people based \nsolely on their race.\n  That was wrong. Ours in a Nation of immigrants and of equality and \nthese laws offended both of those fundamental precepts of America.\n  While Congress was right to repeal the Chinese Exclusions Laws in \n1943, it is important to note that Congress was motivated primarily by \nthe fear that the Japanese would use the racist laws as part of its \npropaganda campaign to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its Chinese \nallies. The repeal of the Chinese Exclusions Laws was not accompanied \nby any genuine sense of regret for the decades of discriminatory \npolicies, or any proclamation by the Congress that it would guard in \nthe future against the type of racism and xenophobia that allowed such \nlaws to pass in the first place. Instead, the exclusion laws were \nsimply supplanted by application of strict race-based quotas that \nremained in place for more than 20 years. Let us not forget that at the \nsame time that Congress was repealing the Chinese Exclusion Laws, the \nU.S. Government was imprisoning thousands of loyal Americans of \nJapanese descent in internment camps throughout the West. Thus, the \nrepeal of the exclusion laws in 1943 can hardly be viewed as a genuine \nacknowledgement by Congress of the racist nature of its actions. In \norder to close the book on this series of unjust laws, I urge support \nof this resolution to express the Senate's regret, albeit belatedly, \nfor these shameful pieces of legislation.\n  Going forward, this resolution also reaffirms our commitment to the \nprinciples of equality and justice upon which our Nation was founded. I \nwas disappointed that, at the insistence of some anonymous Republicans, \nthe resolution is being stripped by amendment of any reference to the \nConstitution of the United States. That is inexplicable to me. No one \nhas anyone come forward to take responsibility for this change. It is \nbeing done in the shadows, without accountability. I believe that the \nChinese Exclusion Laws were incompatible with the spirit, and indeed \nthe text, of our Constitution, our fundamental charter. I challenge \nwhoever felt it necessary to remove the original reference in our \nresolution to the affront to the Constitution to come forward and \nexplain why they were blocking this resolution unless that change was \nmade.\n  Contrary to the claims in the 1880s that Chinese immigrants looked, \nacted, and sounded too different--too foreign--to ever become loyal \nAmericans, we have all witnessed the incredible contributions that \nChinese Americans have made to our country. America has come a long way \nsince the days of the Chinese Exclusion Laws. I hope that we all \nappreciate how our Nation's diversity makes America better and \nstronger.\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have supported the \nnominations and recognized the service of many Americans of Chinese \ndescent serving as attorneys and judges throughout the country, such as \nformer Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Bill Lann Lee, and \nFederal Judges Denny Chin, Edmond Chang, Ed Chen, and Dolly Gee. I am \nalso mindful of the service of the late Thomas Tang, a Chinese American \ntrailblazer on the Federal judiciary.\n  I hope that passage of S. Res. 201 will mark a step in the Senate's \nprogress toward greater commitment to protecting the civil and \nconstitutional rights of all Americans, regardless of race or \nethnicity. Unfortunately, in these tough economic times, it is not \ndifficult to hear echoes of the intolerance that led to the Chinese \nExclusion Laws in some of the rhetoric of recent immigration debates. \nCongress should not legislate out of fear and intolerance, and we must \nnot allow laws like the Chinese Exclusions Laws ever to pass again.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Brown of Massachusetts \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the resolution, as \namended, be agreed to; the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DISCLAIMER.\n\n       Nothing in this resolution may be construed--\n       (1) to authorize or support any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) to serve as a settlement of any claim against the \n     United States.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 201), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas many Chinese came to the United States in the 19th \n     and 20th centuries, as did people from other countries, in \n     search of the opportunity to create a better life for \n     themselves and their families;\n       Whereas the contributions of persons of Chinese descent in \n     the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, \n     fishing, and canning industries were critical to establishing \n     the foundations for economic growth in the Nation, \n     particularly in the western United States;\n       Whereas United States industrialists recruited thousands of \n     Chinese workers to assist in the construction of the Nation's \n     first major national transportation infrastructure, the \n     Transcontinental Railroad;\n       Whereas Chinese laborers, who made up the majority of the \n     western portion of the railroad workforce, faced grueling \n     hours and extremely harsh conditions in order to lay hundreds \n     of miles of track and were paid substandard wages;\n       Whereas without the tremendous efforts and technical \n     contributions of these Chinese immigrants, the completion of \n     this vital national infrastructure would have been seriously \n     impeded;\n       Whereas from the middle of the 19th century through the \n     early 20th century, Chinese immigrants faced racial ostracism \n     and violent assaults, including--\n       (1) the 1887 Snake River Massacre in Oregon, at which 31 \n     Chinese miners were killed; and\n       (2) numerous other incidents, including attacks on Chinese \n     immigrants in Rock Springs, San Francisco, Tacoma, and Los \n     Angeles;\n       Whereas the United States instigated the negotiation of the \n     Burlingame Treaty, ratified by the Senate on October 19, \n     1868, which permitted the free movement of the Chinese people \n     to, from, and within the United States and accorded to China \n     the status of ``most favored nation'';\n       Whereas before consenting to the ratification of the \n     Burlingame Treaty, the Senate required that the Treaty would \n     not permit Chinese immigrants in the United States to be \n     naturalized United States citizens;\n       Whereas on July 14, 1870, Congress approved An Act to Amend \n     the Naturalization Laws and to Punish Crimes against the \n     Same, and for other Purposes, and during consideration of \n     such Act, the Senate expressly rejected an amendment to allow \n     Chinese immigrants to naturalize;\n       Whereas Chinese immigrants were subject to the overzealous \n     implementation of the Page Act of 1875 (18 Stat. 477), \n     which--\n       (1) ostensibly barred the importation of women from \n     ``China, Japan, or any Oriental country'' for purposes of \n     prostitution;\n       (2) was disproportionately enforced against Chinese women, \n     effectively preventing the formation of Chinese families in \n     the United States and limiting the number of native-born \n     Chinese citizens;\n       Whereas, on February 15, 1879, the Senate passed ``the \n     Fifteen Passenger Bill,'' which would have limited the number \n     of Chinese passengers permitted on any ship coming to the \n     United States to 15, with proponents of the bill expressing \n     that the Chinese were ``an indigestible element in our midst \n     . . . without any adaptability to become citizens'';\n       Whereas, on March 1, 1879, President Hayes vetoed the \n     Fifteen Passenger Bill as being incompatible with the \n     Burlingame Treaty, which declared that ``Chinese subjects \n     visiting or residing in the United States, shall enjoy the \n     same privileges . . . in respect to travel or residence, as \n     may there be enjoyed by the citizens and subjects of the most \n     favored nation'';\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the veto of the Fifteen \n     Passenger Bill, President Hayes initiated the renegotiation \n     of the Burlingame Treaty, requesting that the Chinese \n     government consent to restrictions on the immigration of \n     Chinese persons to the United States;\n       Whereas these negotiations culminated in the Angell Treaty, \n     ratified by the Senate on May 9, 1881, which--\n       (1) allowed the United States to suspend, but not to \n     prohibit, the immigration of Chinese laborers;\n       (2) declared that ``Chinese laborers who are now in the \n     United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own \n     free will''; and\n       (3) reaffirmed that Chinese persons possessed ``all the \n     rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are \n     accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored \n     nation'';\n       Whereas, on March 9, 1882, the Senate passed the first \n     Chinese Exclusion Act, which purported to implement the \n     Angell Treaty but instead excluded for 20 years both skilled \n     and unskilled Chinese laborers, rejected an amendment that \n     would have permitted the naturalization of Chinese persons, \n     and instead expressly denied Chinese persons the right to be \n     naturalized as American citizens;\n       Whereas, on April 4, 1882, President Chester A. Arthur \n     vetoed the first Chinese Exclusion Act as being incompatible \n     with the terms and spirit of the Angell Treaty;\n       Whereas, on May 6, 1882, Congress passed the second Chinese \n     Exclusion Act, which--\n       (1) prohibited skilled and unskilled Chinese laborers from \n     entering the United States for 10 years;\n       (2) was the first Federal law that excluded a single group \n     of people on the basis of race; and\n       (3) required certain Chinese laborers already legally \n     present in the United States who later wished to reenter to \n     obtain ``certificates of return'', an unprecedented \n     requirement that applied only to Chinese residents;\n       Whereas in response to reports that courts were bestowing \n     United States citizenship on persons of Chinese descent, the \n     Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 explicitly prohibited all State \n     and Federal courts from naturalizing Chinese persons;\n       Whereas the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 underscored the \n     belief of some Senators at that time that--\n       (1) the Chinese people were unfit to be naturalized;\n       (2) the social characteristics of the Chinese were \n     ``revolting'';\n       (3) Chinese immigrants were ``like parasites''; and\n       (4) the United States ``is under God a country of \n     Caucasians, a country of white men, a country to be governed \n     by white men'';\n       Whereas, on July 3, 1884, notwithstanding United States \n     treaty obligations with China and other nations, Congress \n     broadened the scope of the Chinese Exclusion Act--\n       (1) to apply to all persons of Chinese descent, ``whether \n     subjects of China or any other foreign power''; and\n       (2) to provide more stringent requirements restricting \n     Chinese immigration;\n       Whereas, on October 1, 1888, the Scott Act was enacted into \n     law, which--\n       (1) prohibited all Chinese laborers who would choose or had \n     chosen to leave the United States from reentering;\n       (2) cancelled all previously issued ``certificates of \n     return'', which prevented approximately 20,000 Chinese \n     laborers abroad, including 600 individuals who were en route \n     to the United States, from returning to their families or \n     their homes; and\n       (3) was later determined by the Supreme Court to have \n     abrogated the Angell Treaty;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 1892, the Geary Act was enacted into \n     law, which--\n       (1) extended the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years;\n       (2) required all Chinese persons in the United States, but \n     no other race of people, to register with the Federal \n     Government in order to obtain ``certificates of residence''; \n     and\n       (3) denied Chinese immigrants the right to be released on \n     bail upon application for a writ of habeas corpus;\n       Whereas on an explicitly racial basis, the Geary Act deemed \n     the testimony of Chinese persons, including American citizens \n     of Chinese descent, per se insufficient to establish the \n     residency of a Chinese person subject to deportation, \n     mandating that such residence\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\n     be established through the testimony of ``at least one \n     credible white witness'';\n       Whereas in the 1894 Gresham-Yang Treaty, the Chinese \n     government consented to a prohibition of Chinese immigration \n     and the enforcement of the Geary Act in exchange for the \n     readmission of previous Chinese residents;\n       Whereas in 1898, the United States--\n       (1) annexed Hawaii;\n       (2) took control of the Philippines; and\n       (3) excluded thousands of racially Chinese residents of \n     Hawaii and of the Philippines from entering the United States \n     mainland;\n       Whereas on April 29, 1902, Congress--\n       (1) indefinitely extended all laws regulating and \n     restricting Chinese immigration and residence; and\n       (2) expressly applied such laws to United States insular \n     territories, including the Philippines;\n       Whereas in 1904, after the Chinese government exercised its \n     unilateral right to withdraw from the Gresham-Yang Treaty, \n     Congress permanently extended, ``without modification, \n     limitation, or condition'', all restrictions on Chinese \n     immigration and naturalization, making the Chinese the only \n     racial group explicitly singled out for immigration exclusion \n     and permanently ineligible for American citizenship;\n       Whereas between 1910 and 1940, the Angel Island Immigration \n     Station implemented the Chinese exclusion laws by--\n       (1) confining Chinese persons for up to nearly 2 years;\n       (2) interrogating Chinese persons; and\n       (3) providing a model for similar immigration stations at \n     other locations on the Pacific coast and in Hawaii;\n       Whereas each of the congressional debates concerning issues \n     of Chinese civil rights, naturalization, and immigration \n     involved intensely racial rhetoric, with many Members of \n     Congress claiming that all persons of Chinese descent were--\n       (1) unworthy of American citizenship;\n       (2) incapable of assimilation into American society; and\n       (3) dangerous to the political and social integrity of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the express discrimination in these Federal \n     statutes politically and racially stigmatized Chinese \n     immigration into the United States, enshrining in law the \n     exclusion of the Chinese from the political process and the \n     promise of American freedom;\n       Whereas wartime enemy forces used the anti-Chinese \n     legislation passed in Congress as evidence of American racism \n     against the Chinese, attempting to undermine the Chinese-\n     American alliance and allied military efforts;\n       Whereas, in 1943, at the urging of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt, and over 60 years after the enactment of the first \n     discriminatory laws against Chinese immigrants, Congress--\n       (1) repealed previously enacted anti-Chinese legislation; \n     and\n       (2) permitted Chinese immigrants to become naturalized \n     United States citizens;\n       Whereas despite facing decades of systematic, pervasive, \n     and sustained discrimination, Chinese immigrants and Chinese-\n     Americans persevered and have continued to play a significant \n     role in the growth and success of the United States;\n       Whereas 6 decades of Federal legislation deliberately \n     targeting Chinese by race--\n       (1) restricted the capacity of generations of individuals \n     and families to openly pursue the American dream without \n     fear; and\n       (2) fostered an atmosphere of racial discrimination that \n     deeply prejudiced the civil rights of Chinese immigrants;\n       Whereas diversity is one of our Nation's greatest \n     strengths, and, while this Nation was founded on the \n     principle that all persons are created equal, the laws \n     enacted by Congress in the late 19th and early 20th centuries \n     that restricted the political and civil rights of persons of \n     Chinese descent violated that principle;\n       Whereas although an acknowledgment of the Senate's actions \n     that contributed to discrimination against persons of Chinese \n     descent will not erase the past, such an expression will \n     acknowledge and illuminate the injustices in our national \n     experience and help to build a better and stronger Nation;\n       Whereas the Senate recognizes the importance of addressing \n     this unique framework of discriminatory laws in order to \n     educate the public and future generations regarding the \n     impact of these laws on Chinese and other Asian persons and \n     their implications to all Americans; and\n       Whereas the Senate deeply regrets the enactment of the \n     Chinese Exclusion Act and related discriminatory laws that--\n       (1) resulted in the persecution and political alienation of \n     persons of Chinese descent;\n       (2) unfairly limited their civil rights;\n       (3) legitimized racial discrimination; and\n       (4) induced trauma that persists within the Chinese \n     community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND EXPRESSION OF REGRET.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that this framework of anti-Chinese \n     legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, is \n     incompatible with the basic founding principles recognized in \n     the Declaration of Independence that all persons are created \n     equal;\n       (2) deeply regrets passing 6 decades of legislation \n     directly targeting the Chinese people for physical and \n     political exclusion and the wrongs committed against Chinese \n     and American citizens of Chinese descent who suffered under \n     these discriminatory laws; and\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to preserving the same civil \n     rights and constitutional protections for people of Chinese \n     or other Asian descent in the United States accorded to all \n     others, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 288\n\nDesignating the week beginning October 9, 2011, as ``National Wildlife \n                             Refuge Week''\n\n       Whereas in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican \n     Island;\n       Whereas in 2011, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the premier \n     system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the world, \n     and has grown to more than 150,000,000 acres, 553 national \n     wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management districts in \n     every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the Nation, and these protected lands offer a variety of \n     recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas more than 370 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and more than 350 units of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, \n     averaging more than 2,500,000 hunting visits and more than \n     7,100,000 fishing visits;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     28,200,000 wildlife observation visits annually;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate $4 in economic activity;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     approximately 45,700,000 visits every year, generating nearly \n     $1,700,000,000 and 27,000 jobs in local economies;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas since 1934, more than $750,000,000 in funds, from \n     the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to outdoor enthusiasts, \n     has enabled the purchase or lease of more than 5,300,000 \n     acres of waterfowl habitat in the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System;\n       Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect \n     imperiled species, and of the more than 1,300 federally \n     listed threatened and endangered species in the United \n     States, 280 species are found on units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas 39,000 volunteers and more than 220 national \n     wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute nearly \n     1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 665 full-time \n     employees, and provide an important link with local \n     communities;\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas because there are national wildlife refuges located \n     in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge located \n     within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in the \n     United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, and \n     engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held \n     festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek \n     stakeholder input on the implementation of the \n     recommendations in the document entitled ``Conserving the \n     Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', which is \n     an update to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service for the future of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 9, 2011, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service;\n       Whereas in 2011, the designation of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States and would serve to raise \n     awareness about the importance of wildlife and the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System and to celebrate the myriad \n     recreational opportunities available to enjoy this network of \n     protected lands: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 9, 2011, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife Refuge \n     Week with appropriate events and activities;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for
