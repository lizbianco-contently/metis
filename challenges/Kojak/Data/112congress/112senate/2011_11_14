Mr. President, last week something wonderful and unusual \nhappened here in the Senate: We passed a worthy piece of legislation \nwith a nearly unanimous vote. On the eve of Veterans Day, we honored \nthis Nation's service men and women by passing bipartisan legislation \nto spur hiring of this country's nearly 900,000 out-of-work veterans. \nTwo hundred fifty thousand of these unemployed veterans became members \nof the Armed Services because of the global fight on terror basically \nin the last 10 years. I trust our action last week meant as much, or \nmore, than our words of thanks and praise for these dedicated men and \nwomen who serve us so well. But the Senate has much more work to do \nthis work period, this week and into next week, if necessary. I hope \nthat same spirit of cooperation will hold during this next few days. \nThe Senate has much more work to be done, as I have indicated, because \nwe have work that is essential to the functioning of our government.\n  As we continue to focus on the efforts to create jobs and get our \neconomy moving again, we must also pass appropriations bills, which is \npart of our yearly responsibility. This week, we will consider an \nappropriations package that includes Energy and Water, Financial \nServices, and State and Foreign Operations. We need cooperation to move \nthis important piece of legislation. The legislative tree will not be \nfilled, but we need to agree on the way forward. We need to have some \nresponsible way to move forward on these amendments. We are not going \nto have another situation such as we had a few weeks ago, where we \nworked until early in the morning--not that the long hours hurt, but we \nhad hundreds of amendments and we had no way of moving through those \nwithout having a lot of votes, some of which were totally unnecessary.\n  We have the continuing resolution we must do before the end of this \nwork period. Although I know there will be some strident debate over \namendments to both the appropriations bill and the Defense \nauthorization bill we have to do, we have to work together if we are \ngoing to move forward on the Nation's business.\n  Last month, the Senate passed a bipartisan minibus that included \nAgriculture, Commerce-State-Justice, Transportation, and Housing and \nUrban Development. Those appropriations bills were essential, and we \nwere able to complete that. That experience proved that, with \ncooperation, the Senate can work through the normal appropriations \nprocess, but it does take cooperation.\n  The Senate will consider the conference report on that minibus this \nweek. That conference report will include another short-term continuing\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nresolution that will take us through December 16, which will give \nCongress the time it needs to complete important work--passing \nappropriations bills.\n  This week we will also confirm a number of judges who are crucial to \nhelp ease the backlog in our Nation's jam-packed courts. We have the \nsupercommittee which is functioning. All 12 members are trying to come \nup with some reasonable way forward to do something about the debt.\n  So we have the supercommittee, we have the Defense authorization \nbill, we have the appropriations bill, we have a conference report, and \nwe have the deadline that is facing us. We have to get all this work \ndone by this weekend. If not, then we get it done before Thanksgiving, \nwhich is a week from Thursday. So as you can see, the Senate has a \nsubstantial amount of work to complete in the 10 days before \nThanksgiving. I want to be clear that we are going to work up until the \nlast moment before the holiday, if that is what it takes, to get these \nimportant tasks done. With cooperation, we can get it all done this \nweek. But we have a lot to do, and I understand that, but I do hope we \ncan work together to complete this country's necessary work.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I failed to note that Senators Feinstein and \nAlexander, the managers of this appropriations bill we have, are going \nto be here on the floor this afternoon to give their opening \nstatements. So if Senators have amendments, they should talk to the two \nmanagers of the bill. I think that works much better than firing up \namendments and hoping some of them stick.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise in support \nof the fiscal year 2012 energy and water development appropriations \nbill with my ranking member, the distinguished Senator Alexander, with \nwhom I have had the great pleasure of working. I want to say this up \nfront: It has been a pleasure to work with this particular ranking \nmember. He is respected, he is credible, he is direct, and he is \nreasonable, which I have learned is an endangered species around here. \nSo I very much appreciate that.\n  This Energy and Water bill has an allocation of $31.625 billion, \nwhich is $57 million or .1 percent below last year's enacted levels and \nnearly $3 billion or 9.4 percent below the President's request. The \n$31.625 billion is split between security and nonsecurity funding, \nconsistent with the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act \nestablished caps on discretionary spending over 10 years, with separate \ncaps for security and nonsecurity spending. Now, this becomes relevant, \nas I will explain.\n  The security allocation for energy and water is $11.05 billion. The \n$11.05 billion funds only four programs under the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, called NNSA: nuclear weapons, \nnonproliferation, naval reactors, and the Office of the Administrator.\n  I would like to point out right up front that funding for the NNSA \nmakes up a growing portion of this bill. Last year the NNSA made up 30 \npercent of the total allocation. This year it has increased to 35 \npercent. In addition, because of the Budget Control Act, a firewall is \ncreated between security and nonsecurity funding so we cannot transfer \nfunding back and forth. No funding from the NNSA can be used to fund \nenergy and water projects, and no funds from energy and water can be \nused to fund the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n  While funding increases for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration to help advance national security priorities, it comes \nat the expense of water and energy projects in the rest of our bill. \nOur nonsecurity allocation, which funds the Corps of Engineers, the \nBureau of Reclamation under the Department of the Interior, and the \nDepartment of Energy, is $20.575 billion. While our security allocation \ngrew by $528 million or 5 percent, the nonsecurity allocation is $584 \nmillion or 2.8 percent less than for fiscal year 2011 and $3.5 billion \nor 17 percent less than for fiscal year 2010. So we can see the crunch \nthat is put on one part of the budget and the other part of our \nappropriations bill has actually expanded.\n  As I mentioned, the security allocation is $11.05 billion, which is \nan increase of $528 million or 5 percent over fiscal year 2011. This is \nan increase of $1.163 billion or close to 12 percent for the security \nportion of this appropriations bill over fiscal year 2010.\n  To clarify, NNSA is responsible for three primary national security \nmissions: first, maintaining the safety, security, and reliability of \nthe Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile; second, responsibility for \nreducing the threat of nuclear terrorism through nonproliferation \nprograms; and third, it designs and builds nuclear reactors for safe \nand effective nuclear propulsion for aircraft carriers and submarines \nin the U.S. Navy.\n  Taking into account competing funding priorities for national \nsecurity activities, I think this bill strikes as good a balance as it \ncan between funding for nuclear weapons modernization and reducing the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation. The Nuclear Weapons Program under the \nbill would see an increase of $294 million or 4.2 percent above fiscal \nyear 2011. With $7.2 billion, the NNSA, which is the agency of concern, \nwill be able to meet the highest priorities of the Nuclear Posture \nReview and modernization activities discussed during negotiations of \nthe New START Treaty.\n  These are three primary activities:\n  First, funds will continue for life extension programs for the W76 \nsubmarine-launched warhead, the B61 bomb, and the W78 intercontinental \nballistic missile warhead.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  Second, funds allow for completing design work for two aging nuclear \nfacilities that may need to be replaced to meet modern safety \nstandards--one for handling plutonium at Los Alamos National Lab and \nthe other for uranium at the Y-12 facility in Tennessee.\n  Third, funds will maintain the science, technology, and engineering \nbase to continue assessing the safety, security, and reliability of the \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  The nonproliferation program would see an increase of $109 million or \n4.7 percent above fiscal year 2011. NNSA would stay on track to meet \nits goals to secure and remove the most vulnerable nuclear materials \nfrom around the world by the end of 2013. These are materials that \ncould be used by terrorists to build nuclear devices. The United States \nhas already removed 3,086 kilograms of highly enriched uranium--120 \nnuclear weapons' worth of material--from dozens of countries.\n  NNSA would also be able to continue deploying portal monitors at \nseaports and border crossings to detect nuclear smuggling and help \ncountries increase security at nuclear facilities. The United States \nhas installed radiation detection equipment at more than 399 sites \nacross the world.\n  Finally, the security allocation will be used to fund the naval \nreactors program that provides propulsion for the country's submarines \nand aircraft carriers. An increase of $141 million or 14.6 percent \nabove fiscal year 2011 is directed to help design a nuclear reactor \nthat will last 40 years for ballistic missile submarines, the most \nsurvivable leg of our nuclear deterrent.\n  Turning to nonsecurity funding, as I mentioned earlier, our \nallocation is $20.575 billion--$584 million or 2.8 percent less than \nfiscal year 2011. With this significant decrease in funding, the bill \nfocuses its limited nonsecurity funding on the highest priorities: \ncritical water infrastructure projects and accelerating energy \ntechnology.\n  Let me speak for a moment about water infrastructure. The Corps of \nEngineers would receive $4.864 billion. That is an increase of $7 \nmillion or one-tenth of 1 percent, above fiscal year 2011 and $291 \nmillion or 5.9 percent above the President's request. Here is why. I \nstrongly believe the Corps of Engineers is responsible for such a wide \narray of projects--building, maintaining, repairing locks, levees, \ndams, dredging for waterway navigation. Devastating floods and \nhurricanes in the last few months that have damaged many communities \nacross the United States are a stark reminder of why Corps of Engineers \ninfrastructure projects remain such a high congressional priority.\n  With a ban on congressionally directed projects--or, as they are not \nso fondly called, earmarks--Congress cannot direct needed funding to \nprojects that may have been overlooked by the administration or to \naddress emerging needs after the President's budget submission. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2012 budget request did not include more than \n100 studies and projects for navigation, flood control, and \nenvironmental restoration that the administration included in the \nfiscal year 2011 work plan. Without funding in 2012, these studies and \nprojects will likely be suspended.\n  I think that is important to keep in mind. While our bill does not \nfund any new projects, our bill provides $291 million above the \nPresident's request to support these ongoing studies and projects for \nthe Corps that were either unfunded or underfunded in the President's \nbudget request.\n  The bill also provides the Department of the Interior $1.067 billion, \nwhich is $27 million or 2\\1/2\\ percent less than fiscal year 2011 but \nstill $16 million or 1.4 percent more than the President's request. \nFunding for the Department of Interior includes the Bureau of \nReclamation, which is responsible for oversight and operation of water \nprojects related to irrigation, water supply, and hydroelectric power \ngeneration in the 17 Western States.\n  Finally, the bill provides $1.045 billion in disaster relief \nfunding--and I wish to speak about that--this is on top of our base \nallocation--to repair damaged Corps of Engineers owned, operated, or \nfixed infrastructure from flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers and other natural disasters.\n  This level of funding covers damages the Corps identified when the \ncommittee reported this bill. As I mentioned during committee markup, \nwe know this amount is insufficient based on the number and severity of \nnatural disasters that have occurred this year. The Corps has updated \ntheir disaster needs. We will be working throughout the floor process \nto ensure that increased funding to address disaster recovery needs is \nprovided. I think both the ranking member and I, our subcommittee, and \nthe Appropriations Committee as a whole understand that responding to \nthese disaster needs is of the highest priority.\n  Regarding clean energy, the bill provides stable funding to support \nscience, technology, and engineering programs to advance clean energy \ntechnologies. It provides the Office of Science $4.84 billion, the same \nas in 2011. The Office of Science conducts basic research in physics, \nchemistry, and biology to improve our understanding of energy and \nmatter. New discoveries will advance energy technologies. Our bill \nfocuses the limited resources of the Office of Science toward the \nhighest priorities, which include material support, developing the next \ngeneration of biofuels, and maintaining the leadership of the United \nStates in high-performance computing.\n\n  Our bill continues to fund three hubs, which are research centers \nmade up of scientists and engineers from the national labs, \nuniversities, and private industry to address a specific energy \nchallenge. The three hubs focus on developing fuels that can be \nproduced directly from sunlight, improving energy efficiency of \nexisting buildings, and using modeling and simulation tools to improve \nthe operation of nuclear reactors.\n  Our bill also funds a new hub, the fourth hub, to improve batteries \nfor electric vehicles and for storage of wind, solar, and other \nintermittent power sources--something which the ranking member was very \nmuch interested in and which I was very pleased to agree to.\n  In addition to the Office of Science, the bill also provides $250 \nmillion for ARPA-E, an increase of $70 million, or 39 percent. ARPA-E \nfunds new and innovative energy technologies that would significantly \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce carbon emissions.\n  ARPA-E's goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of new technology and \nthen find a private company to commercialize the technology. As a sign \nof early success in attracting private investment, last year ARPA-E \nawarded a startup company $750,000 to demonstrate its new innovative \ntechnology related to energy storage. An early demonstration of this \nstartup's new technology has already attracted $12 million in private \ninvestment to help commercialize it. I think that is good news.\n  While the government continues to invest in innovative energy \ntechnologies, nuclear energy continues to provide 20 percent of the \nNation's electricity, but it is 70 percent of its carbon-free \nelectricity. This, to me, is a stunning figure, that it is 20 percent \nof all power but 70 percent of carbon-free power.\n  Currently, nuclear energy will continue to be an important source of \nenergy for us in the future. However, I deeply believe that before we \nexpand nuclear power in the United States, we must address our spent \nfuel situation in order to limit the government's liability from its \nfailure to take this waste.\n  Today, high-level nuclear spent fuels are stored at 74 locations most \ndirectly adjacent to an active reactor. The fuel remains in either \nspent fuel pools or dry casks meant to be temporary but, in reality, \nhas been stored permanently. There is simply no place to put it.\n  Today, to date, the U.S. Government has paid out $1 billion to the \nnuclear industry because of its failure to take custody of this fuel as \nrequired by law. Few people know this. This liability will grow to \n$15.4 billion by 2020 and another $500 million for each year of delay \nafter 2020.\n  My distinguished ranking member, we simply have to get cracking and \nfind either regional repositories or a central waste repository where \nnuclear waste can be stored essentially forever. The United States is \nresponsible for 65,000 tons of spent fuel at these 74\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nsites. This is enough material to cover one football field 20-feet \ndeep. And our liability continues to grow. According to the blue ribbon \ncommission, if no nuclear reactors are built and the existing fleet of \n104 reactors operate until the end of their licenses, the total \ninventory of spent fuel by 2050 would be 150,000 metric tons.\n  That is 2\\1/2\\ times as much as we have now. The current absence of a \nspent fuel policy and repository to store spent nuclear fuel is \nunacceptable and unsustainable. For these reasons, this bill takes the \nfirst step in requiring the Department of Energy to create a strategy \nfor spent fuel storage, including options for consolidating and storing \nspent fuel at one or more regional sites.\n  With regard to funding for the nuclear energy program, the bill \nprovides $584 million, which is a reduction of $142 million, or 24 \npercent, available funding that will focus more on safety and the back \nend of the nuclear fuel cycle. For example, the bill provides $52 \nmillion--that is an increase of $12 million from 2011--to accelerate \ndevelopment of new cladding materials for nuclear fuel that reduce the \nlikelihood of meltdowns and hydrogen explosions, which were observed at \nFukishima.\n  I believe as more becomes available about what actually happened at \nFukishima and the aftereffects of Fukishima, cladding material is going \nto become much more significant.\n  In closing, I again thank my colleague and ranking member, Senator \nAlexander, for working with me in a cooperative and constructive manner \nto draft this bill. I believe we have developed a well-balanced and \nresponsible bill that addresses the water, infrastructure, energy, and \nnational security needs of this Nation.\n  I hope every Senator can support the bill, and I hope we can conclude \nfloor action in a timely manner.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished ranking member.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from California. She is a delight \nto work with. Without disparaging any other Member of the Senate, it is \nnice to work with former mayors or county executives or even Governors \nbecause we are accustomed to making decisions and talking directly and \ncoming to a result. That is what we are able to do. Even when we \ndisagree--which we sometimes do--Senator Feinstein and I are able to \nkeep working on these issues and still try to come to a result. So it \nis a real privilege to work with Senator Feinstein. I thank her for her \ncourtesy and diligence.\n  Last week we spent an hour and a half on a very small part of this \nbudget--actually, not even part of the budget but a related matter--\nmaking sure we understood all sides of the issues. I don't think in the \nwhole hour and a half there was ever a Republican or Democratic \ncomment. We were trying to find out the right thing to do for our \ncountry, which I think is the goal of each of us.\n  There is no need to repeat what the chairman said and said very \naccurately. I will summarize and comment on a few of the points. I will \nhighlight the areas of agreement, which are, for the most part, a \ncouple of areas where we have different points of view which we are \nstill working on. She emphasized--and I thought it was important to \nemphasize--that except for disaster spending, this Energy and Water \nbill is slightly below the spending levels of last year. When we add in \ndisaster funding, which I will talk about in a minute, it is above that \nlevel.\n  There is no mandatory spending in the bill. Sometimes our bills get \ncomplicated by what we call automatic or mandatory spending. If it is \nincluded within an appropriations bill. Some of us wonder why, since we \ncannot do anything to change it in the appropriations process, but it \nis there. There is not any of that here. As the Senator emphasized, our \nbill is divided into two major parts--the security part or the defense \npart, and the nonsecurity part or the nondefense part. The security \npart is up; we are spending more. The reason for that is, in the first \nplace, we asked the leaders of the committee to reallocate some money \ntoward our subcommittee so we could try to, as much as we could, live \nup to our commitment to fund nuclear weapons modernization, an \nimportant issue that came up when the Senate ratified the new START \ntreaty.\n  In other words, the new START treaty was about limiting the number of \nnuclear weapons here and in Russia, making sure we could inspect what \nthe Russians are doing and, at the same time, we wanted to make sure \nwhat we have left works. This is about making sure what we have works. \nWe made a commitment to try to go to certain levels. We are moving in \nthat direction. We have not gotten there yet, but that is one reason, \nperhaps the main reason, we spend more on the security part.\n  On the nonsecurity part, as the Senator said, except for disaster \nspending, it is down. We are spending 3 percent less than we did \nbefore. I want to say a word about disaster funding. In the Budget \nControl Act, in August, a subject of great debate around here--one of \nthe things done was to create a formula over the last 10 years that \ndetermines how much money we may be able to spend on disasters. The \nthought was that disaster spending, like other emergency spending, was \ngetting out of control, and we need to think about it. Obviously, \nwhenever there is a flood, hurricane, or other terrible disaster, we \nrush to help. But that is real money too, and it has to come from \nsomewhere. This formula that was created says that during this fiscal \nyear--the one about a month and a half old--that we may spend about \n$11.3 billion based on spending over the last 10 years. After that, we \nwill have to reduce spending somewhere if we are going to spend more on \ndisasters.\n  With respect to disaster relief, our bill is part of that. It is in \nthe Corps of Engineers. We moved quickly in our subcommittee and in the \nAppropriations Committee to deal with the epic flooding the Senator \ndescribed on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers this past year, which, \nin some cases, exceeded the flood heights of the massive 1927 and 1933 \nfloods.\n  To give an idea of how unusual these floods were, at our meeting of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee 3 weeks ago, 14 Senators in \nboth parties came to the committee to say to the authorizing \ncommittee--the EPW Committee--we needed to do more to deal with the \nfloods--14 Senators. I have never seen that many Senators testify \nbefore a committee before on behalf of any subject. That is how much we \nare concerned about it, and that is how much people in the areas \naffected are concerned about it.\n  In the Appropriations Committee, we had a discussion about how much \nof that disaster funding to fund. We recommended $1.04 billion. There \nwas an amendment by the Senator from Missouri that said it needs to be \nmore because we know it will be more than that. We said, in a \nbipartisan way--I remember the chairman and ranking member said we \ndon't have the estimates definite yet from the Corps of Engineers or \nfrom FEMA, so we are only going to fund those areas that are declared \nto be Presidential disasters, No. 1, and where we have definite \nestimates, No. 2. When we have more definite estimates of additional \ndamage, we will recommend the funding.\n  We defeated the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri with \nthe promise that as real damage estimates come in, they will be met. \nWell, the Senator and I will be offering an amendment to address this \nincrease. I want my colleagues to be aware of this because, \nparticularly on our side of the aisle, we have had a good deal of \ndiscussion about funding for disasters.\n  In the amendment we will be offering, part of the money fits within \nthe formula we agreed to in the Budget Control Act. About $550 million \nwill not, and we will have to find some other place in the budget to \nreduce spending in order to properly fund this disaster spending. I \ndoubt if there is any Senator who would not want to fund that because \nthis is spending to be prepared for the next disaster. This will be \nmoney for preparedness, sandbags. I can guarantee, if the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers flood next year, and sandbags are not available \nbecause we could not find the money somewhere else, there will be 28 \nSenators at the next meeting of the EPW Committee, not just 14.\n  So this is an urgent request. We are suggesting a way to reduce \nspending. So with the disaster funding, the only\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\nthing that drives our total recommendations above last year's spending, \nwe are, No. 1, staying within the cap created by the Budget Control \nCommittee; and, No. 2, for the amount of money for the sandbags and \nother preparedness, we are going to recommend a way to reduce spending \nsomewhere else in order to be prepared for the next flood.\n  With respect to the security allocation, Senator Feinstein mentioned \nthat one part of our budget has to do with national security and \nanother has to do with nonsecurity. Most people, when they think of \nenergy, don't think of the national security parts. It is among the \nmost important national defense requirements we have. As she said, it \nincludes modernizing all of our nuclear weapons to make sure they work. \nIt includes trying to make sure they don't spread around the world. \nThat stands up at the top--those two items--of our national defense \nposture.\n  There was a letter that came from Members of the House of \nRepresentatives that seemed to be critical of the Senate for using \n``defense money given to water-related projects.'' I want to clear that \nup. There must have been some confusion on the other side of the \nCapitol because under the rules of the Budget Control Committee, we \ncannot use defense money for water projects, period. That is against \nthe rules. Not only did we not do it, we could not do it if we wanted \nto. In fact, we came up with $100 million more for nuclear weapons \nmodernization than the House did.\n  So perhaps the House letter was sent to the wrong address. It should \nhave been sent on that side of the Capitol and not sent to the Senate. \nWe understand very well we should not be using defense money for water \nprojects or water project money for defense money. We have not done \nthat. We are not allowed to do that. We cannot cut weapons to fund \nwater projects.\n  Now, as I said earlier, as Senator Feinstein and I and Senators \nCochran and Inouye all said, we would support the President's request \nfor appropriate funding for nuclear weapons modernization, which is why \nSenator Feinstein and I asked our ranking member and chairman to \nallocate more money to the security side of our budget, and they did \nthat.\n  As a result of that, security spending for weapons activities is up 5 \npercent--$100 million more than the House was able to provide for \nEnergy and Water appropriations.\n  It is the single largest percentage increase compared to all \nappropriations subcommittees with security spending in the budget. But \nit is still $400 million less than the President's full request and \n$400 million less than I would like to see spent on nuclear weapons \nmodernization. I am concerned about that.\n  I am committed to continue to work with the full committee, the \nHouse, and the administration to come as close as we possibly can to \nthe President's number on nuclear weapons modernization. I want to make \nit clear that we have bent over backward to make it a top priority--or \nthe top priority to begin with--and have had good cooperation from the \nsenior members of our committee.\n  Senator Feinstein has worked hard to put this bill together in a fair \nand accommodating manner. She mentioned the Office of Science and \ntalked about clean energy. Recently, I was at one of our National \nLaboratories, Sandia in New Mexico. The Director of Science there \nreminded me that almost every major physical and biological invention \nof any importance in the United States since World War II has been \nfunded by government-sponsored research--almost all through our 17 or \n18 National Laboratories or our 50 or 60 top research universities. \nThese are our real secret weapons for job growth. It was out of the \nlaboratories and out of this kind of government research that came the \nInternet, the Human Genome Project, nuclear power itself--whether it is \nnuclear weapons or the 104 civilian reactors or the 104 reactors that \nrun our Navy ships--and stealth technology came of this. It is hard to \nthink of any major invention or discovery in physical or biological \nsciences that didn't have some government-sponsored research. So when \nwe talk about spending the same amount of money this year that we did \nlast year for the Office of Science, we are talking about a major \neffort of any jobs bill that the Senate could possibly pass.\n\n  If we are talking about jobs growth, this is a very big, important \npart of it. Low taxes is a part of it, fewer regulations, the right \nnational labor relations policies are a part, but any progrowth plan \nfor the United States has to include government-sponsored research. No \nother country in the world has anything like our 18 laboratories or our \n50 or 60 top research universities. If we want a high standard of \nliving--you know, we still produce about 25 percent of all the money in \nthe world--we would do well to invest every spare dollar we have there, \nas long as it is wisely spent. So as long as we are cutting over here, \nI am all for that. I don't want to see a situation where we have \nrunaway entitlement spending and as a result of that we squeeze the \ninventions that give us the job growth we need.\n  I made a speech at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2008 where I \nsuggested we have a new Manhattan project for clean energy \nindependence, focusing on electric cars and trucks, carbon capture, \nsolar power, nuclear waste, advanced biofuels, green building fusion. I \nam a big supporter of research as an appropriate role for the Federal \nGovernment, and we will talk more, as we have time over the next 2 \ndays, I hope, about the wisdom of the proper priorities in spending. I \nwould say yes to more for research and no to more for subsidies.\n  The New York Times had a big article on Saturday where it talked \nabout rich subsidies powering solar and wind projects, and these are \nfor companies that can pay us back. These are extravagant subsidies, \nwhich I think are completely unnecessary, particularly at a budget time \nsuch as this. If we have any extra dollars, let's put them into the \nsecret weapons at the research universities and the national \nlaboratories and tackle the big challenges, such as the 500-mile \nbattery for cars or finding a solar panel that is so cheap it is $1 per \nkilowatt installed.\n  I agree with Senator Feinstein that Dr. Chu is on the right track \nwith his energy remarks. I was suggesting in my remarks that we pick \nthese grand challenges, such as used nuclear fuel, as one--what to do \nwith it, where do we dispose of the waste. Dr. Chu is doing that, with \nbatteries, with solar, with others, and I think it is a good way to \nconcentrate the focus of the Federal Government and the Energy \nDepartment to solve the problems of rising gasoline prices, electricity \nprices, and do it in a way that helps clean the air.\n  During our debate, I hope we have a chance to talk about more for \nresearch and less for permanent subsidies in the energy area, and I \nhope we have a way to talk about restraining entitlement spending so we \ncan have sufficient funds to fund our secret weapons that have produced \nalmost every major biological and physical discovery since World War \nII. We have broad support for that here. We passed the America COMPETES \nAct in 2007 which set a path for funding for sciences. We had 35 \nDemocrats and 35 Republicans as cosponsors of that bill. It was \nintroduced by the Democratic leader and the Republican leader, and when \nwe changed parties after an election, it was introduced by the \nRepublican leader and the Democratic leader. So we have bipartisan \nsupport for that. We need to make sure it is part of the debate.\n  The Corps of Engineers, the Senator talked about. Those are critical \nideas. Those are the areas she and I agree on. I will spend a moment, \nif I may, on some areas where we have some more work to do before we \nhave an agreement. One is in the area of nuclear power. Here is what I \nagree with her about nuclear power. One is that it is a remarkable \nstatistic that 20 percent of our electricity is produced by one of our \ngreatest inventions--nuclear power--and that it is 70 percent of our \nelectricity without carbon but also without nitrogen or sulfur or \nmercury pollution.\n  We had a big debate here in the Senate last week about clean air. \nWell, if all of our power were nuclear power, as almost all of it is in \nFrance, we wouldn't have a clean air debate because our powerplants \nwouldn't be producing any mercury or producing any nitrogen or sulfur \noxides as well as carbon. So nuclear is a remarkable advantage for the \nUnited States and one which we should continue to take advantage of.\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\n  I am disappointed we do not fund in this bill the first steps of a \nseveral-year program to jump-start the small nuclear reactor program. \nThis is not just our idea. France, Russia, Brazil, and other countries \naround the world are working on this. There are 60 countries that want \nto introduce nuclear energy onto their grid for the first time. We have \nthe phenomenon like South Korea building a nuclear powerplant for the \nUnited Arab Emirates. So if we don't do it, that doesn't mean no one \nwill do it; it just means we will be at the back of the line with an \ninvention we invented and that today produces 20 percent of our \nelectricity and 70 percent of our clean electricity.\n  Now, the ``it'' we are talking about are these smaller reactors. We \nalready produce a lot of small reactors for the more than 100 Navy \nvessels, but they are of a little different kind. But small reactors \nthat might be 100 to 300 megawatts would be cheaper, they would be made \nin the United States, and they could be put together like LEGO blocks \nwould. They could be hauled back and forth from wherever they were \nproduced to different places. They might be especially useful on a \nmilitary base or around a national laboratory, where you don't need \n1,200 new megawatts of electricity. And they might be better for an \ninvestor-owned utility to buy, because they would only have to spend \none-fourth or one-fifth or one-sixth as much money. The big reactors we \nnow build are $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion or more. \nQuite a big number. So the President and Dr. Chu have recommended we \nmove ahead with the small reactor program. The House of Representatives \nagrees, I agree, and we are trying to work a way out here where we can \njoin that parade--in fact, lead the parade.\n\n  I think the way to do it is to take seriously Senator Feinstein's \nconcern about used nuclear fuel. She is exactly right, we have \nblindfolds on our eyes if we think it is responsible for us to move \nahead producing so much nuclear power--even if it is just a football \nfield 20 feet deep--without a permanent place to put the spent fuel. It \nis safe to keep it there, in my opinion. And not just mine. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and Secretary Chu, the President's Nobel prize-\nwinning Energy Secretary, say it is safe for 100 years. But what that \nsays to me is that it is safe while we figure out the right way to \ndispose of it. I am convinced our scientists can figure out an even \nbetter way of disposing of it than France does, for example, which \nreprocesses nuclear fuel and then stores it there. I suspect we will be \nable, in the next 10 or 15 years, to figure out a way to recycle, reuse \nnuclear fuel, and reduce the waste by 95 percent. But we will still \nneed a permanent place to store it.\n  What I am committed to do, working with Senator Feinstein--and I am \ndelighted she has this intense level of interest--and Senators Bingaman \nand Murkowski, the ranking members of the Energy Committee, is trying \nto create an inexorable process toward a result on finding a proper \nplace to store used nuclear fuel. I hope we can do that within a year. \nThat doesn't mean we will have all the decisions made, but it means we \ncould have, I believe, a process established that will produce a \nresult.\n  I am hoping at the same time we can move ahead with small nuclear \nreactors, because by 2020, the idea is we would only have two or three. \nAnd between now and then, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would need \nthis help in creating the proper license and approving the design and \nworking through all the things one has to do. It is going to have to do \nthat anyway, because someone will bring one over from Korea or France \nor Russia or Brazil and they will apply for a license in the United \nStates and we will be using their reactors instead of ours.\n  Another area of disagreement is there are some provisions in the \nbill, which I won't go into at great length, but I don't think they \nbelong in an appropriations bill, with all respect. They are based on \nseveral recommendations of the 90-day commission created by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. Since our bill was reported, the NRC has taken \nseveral steps to prioritize their recommendations.\n  Of the five representations that are in language in our bill, the \nCommission only considered one to be of that urgent a priority. It is \ngoing to do the rest of them in the regular order of things. I think we \nshould let our experts do their job. Perhaps this calls attention to \nthe importance of it, but I would rather let the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission do its job and us to concentrate our efforts on finding a \nplace to put used nuclear fuel.\n  One other area I suspect within the next few days we will have a \ndiscussion about is the subsidy cost for renewable energy projects, but \nI think I will delay that until we have an opportunity to discuss it on \nthe floor, and to have some discussions about the loan guarantee \nprogram, which hasn't worked as intended. The loan guarantee program \nwas supposed to help put a priority on certain forms of energy and loan \nmonies to companies that could pay it back, not to companies that \ncouldn't pay it back. Apparently, that has been an issue.\n  There is also a provision in the bill about requiring grantees of the \nDepartment of Energy to change lightbulbs in their factories if they do \nnot meet the standards for the new lightbulbs. This will be costly, it \nis inconsistent with current law, and I hope we can remove it as the \nbill moves forward.\n  In a bill this large and this important, I think Chairman Feinstein \nand other members of the subcommittee and the full committee have come \nup with a good result, a result about which there is a consensus \nbetween us, with very few areas of disagreement, a result that is below \nlast year's spending level, except for disaster spending, and a result \nthat gives a special emphasis to nuclear weapons modernization that we \nare committed to and that the President asked for and that does better \nthan the House number but still doesn't reach, I will acknowledge, \nwhere I had hoped we could go.\n  It has been a great privilege to work with Chairman Feinstein. I like \nthe idea that we have an appropriations bill on the floor. This is the \nbasic work of government. We ought to do this before we do anything \nelse. If we can't have an appropriations bill to fund the basic work of \ngovernment, people might say, can you do anything at all? So we have \ndone our part, we have the bill here, and I thank the majority leader \nfor bringing it up. I hope our colleagues will give us the chance to \nmove forward the bill this week, to bring their amendments to the \nfloor, debate on them, have a final vote, and pass it into law and do \nsomething we can be proud of.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator. Once \nagain, it has been a great pleasure to work with him. I do think we \nhave a lot of this bill in common, but we do have some points of \ndifference, and I want to say a little bit about my point of \ndifference.\n  I very much want to leave a world for my grandchildren where there is \nnot danger from nuclear weapons or nuclear fuels, and today I don't \nbelieve I can say we have achieved that. The ranking member was \ncorrect, the head of the NRC did testify in his view the hot rods were \nsafe for 100 years in those spent fuel pools. Well, you know, there \nwere problems with spent fuel pools at Fukushima. I think, as life goes \non, we are going to see more of that.\n  We know cladding has to be improved. We know that, perhaps, the \ndesign basis of a new nuclear reactor has to meet events which are not \nnecessarily predicted. Who would have thought a 47-foot tsunami would \nhit Fukushima? But it happened.\n  I am in California. We are in the ring of fire. Sure enough, there \nhave been earthquakes in the southern tip of South America, in Asia, in \nChristchurch, New Zealand, going right around. These have been very \nlarge earthquakes, approaching 9, and the concern is, what happens \nnext. So I think safety is a very real problem, and I think as we \nappropriate monies we should be concerned with safety.\n  Spent fuel pools were designed to harbor hot rods for a relatively \nshort period of time. The rods can be moved 5 to 7 years out, and then \nthey are generally moved into passive storage and the dry casks. The \ndry casks, it was thought, would be transported to repositories--either \npermanent repositories or repositories on a regional basis--under the \nsupervision of the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\n  I always felt that affecting that was an extraordinary challenge for \nus and particularly when I learned we were being fined an egregious \namount of money because we can't do that every year. So my view is, we \nhave to get cracking and move that on, and the five things we have in \nthe bill I think all take us to a much safer place with respect to \nnuclear activities.\n  With respect to the small modular nuclear reactors, what they are is \nessentially less than 300 megawatts modular small actors. I understand \nthere are still problems with the cladding. But what was asked for was \n$192 million, not alone but a proposal to essentially subsidize up to \n50 percent of the licensing costs of financial and technically viable \ncorporations. These aren't small corporations; they are big \ncorporations, and the Department would have to pick two winners for the \nsubsidy. That would leave at least five American companies out. This is \na restricted bid. It doesn't include everybody. It includes only one \nkind of reactor--light water reactor. Who knows. Maybe others of the \nfive are as viable.\n  So firms not receiving assistance would be substantially \ndisadvantaged. The likely winners include these companies: Babcock and \nWilcox, I have nothing against them, 2010 revenues exceeding $2.6 \nbillion--can't they afford their own licensing certification fees?--and \nWestinghouse, owned by the Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, which has $64 \nbillion in assets and more than 200,000 employees.\n  In other sectors, we don't invest Federal dollars to help profitable \nprivate companies obtain safety licenses. We don't help Ford comply \nwith crash test regulations, nor do we pay for Boeing to obtain FAA \ncertification. So before we commit these moneys, we should seriously \nevaluate whether any company would change its decision about pursuing a \nlicense because of this.\n  So I am kind of at a different point in looking at subsidies. I think \nmost subsidies by the Federal Government should just go, wherever they \nare--oil, gas, nuclear, ag, you name it--at a time when we should not \nbe subsidizing private industry.\n  There is also a fundamental contradiction in the nuclear industry's \nargument for funding small modular reactor licensing. On one hand, the \nindustry argues that the market will be enormous, and we can't afford \nto fall behind international competitors. On the other hand, these same \nindustry experts argue they will not develop and license a product \nunless government pays them to apply for an NRC license. They argue \nthat the United States must provide each firm with more than $200 \nmillion to motivate them to pursue this business.\n  The bottom line, the small modular reactor cannot be both a massive \neconomic opportunity, with the potential to change the way we power our \neconomy, and an opportunity that industry will not pursue unless the \ngovernment pays them to do that.\n  So I have real questions about funding this item. We will have more \nto say about it as this goes on. I know it is popular. If there were a \nspent fuel policy, if we knew we were going to go for regional \nrepositories, that there was some limit to the storage of fuel at a \nsite--74 sites now, and with advanced modular reactors this is more \nbecause many people think the only way this can be cost competitive is \nyou have to group these two together. So in a given site, you would \nhave five or six small reactors, but you would have the same spent fuel \nproblem. It seems to me we need a place to put spent fuel. I am not \nopposed to nuclear if we can properly take care of its waste.\n  I wanted to respond when my distinguished ranking member raised this. \nWe have had one meeting with the chairman of the Energy Committee, the \nranking member of the Energy Committee, Senator Alexander, and myself \nto discuss how to proceed toward a nuclear storage policy. I think we \nneed to continue this. We are going to ask the Secretary in to talk \nwith us in December, and Senator Alexander has been great in doing \nthis--put forward a little agenda of how to proceed toward this so I \nknow he is, in fact, in good faith suggesting it, and I do. He has \nalways been a straight shooter.\n  But it is just very hard for me to go ahead and say, OK, we are going \nto promote a whole new class of nuclear reactors when we don't have a \nplace to dispose of hot spent fuels that will be hot and dangerous for \nliterally hundreds of years. If we can move fast, I am all for it.\n  I know the Senator wants to respond, and I welcome the debate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I am not going to respond at \ngreat length because I want to eventually find us in agreement about \nthis, but I appreciate it. Your points are very important and very good \npoints.\n  On safety and nuclear power, I think it is always important to start \noff by pointing out that a nuclear reactor is a big, complex operation \nand obviously there is some risk to it. But nuclear power has the best \nsafety record of any form of energy production in the United States. \nThere has never been a death in connection with any 1 of our 104 \ncivilian reactors. There hasn't been one with the more than 100 Navy \nreactors where we have sailors actually living on top of reactors. We \nhave all heard about Three Mile Island, which is the most important \nnuclear accident we have had in the United States, but no one was even \nhurt in Three Mile Island.\n  I see the Senator from Pennsylvania is presiding today. When I say \nthat to people around the country, they say: What do you mean no one \nwas hurt at Three Mile Island? No one was hurt. There have been tests \non families who lived around there, and no one was even hurt either \nfrom any kind of explosion or from radioactivity at a later time.\n  So we always have to look for better ways to be safe, but we have \nthat safe record. We do have the Chairman of the NRC saying this used \nfuel is stored safely for 100 years, and we have our scientists telling \nus in 10 or 15 years we can find a way to recycle. Within that time, we \nought to find a place to put it. We have a place to put it if we could \ngo ahead with Yucca Mountain, but that has been stopped for a variety \nof reasons, some of them political. Let us say they are all principled. \nBut for whatever reason, it is stuck.\n  The other thing I would say is, there is a certain urgency about \nthis. As the Senator said, 20 percent of our electricity is nuclear \npower, 70 percent of our clean energy. What if we didn't have that 20 \npercent? We don't have to look far to see. In Japan they have shut down \ntemporarily enough of their reactors as a result of Fukushima to be \nwithout 20 percent of their electricity. What have they been doing? \nTheir car manufacturers have been working on the weekends. That is 5 \nmillion workers in Japan. Temperatures are turned to 82 during the \nsummer heat; 22,000 people have been brought into the hospitals from \nheat stroke. The Emperor and Empress are wandering around the Imperial \nPalace with candlesticks and flashlights.\n  We don't want the United States of America like that. This is an \nimportant part of our ability to create jobs and to have lots of low-\ncost electricity. We use 25 percent of all the energy in the world in \nthe United States.\n  As far as subsidies go, after we get through finding a place to put \nused nuclear fuel, maybe this is the second area on which the Senator \nfrom California and I can work which would be to do something about \nenergy subsidies. Estimates are the Federal Government probably spends \nabout $20 billion a year on energy subsidies of one kind or another.\n  The Energy Information Administration did a study 3 years ago on \nwhere that money goes, and this is where it goes: Subsidies for wind \ndwarf everything else. It is not Big Oil, it is big wind, $18.82 per \nmegawatt hour subsidy for wind turbines; $3.67 for solar; $1.36 for \nlandfill gas; 67 cents per megawatt hour for hydroelectric; 18 cents \nfor biomass; 12 cents for coal; and almost 0 for nuclear.\n  It is often cited the insurance program the nuclear powerplants have \nas a subsidy. It is a Federal law that never has cost the taxpayer a \npenny. It simply requires all the nuclear operators to put in, I \nbelieve, $11 billion or $12 billion per reactor in case there is an \nincident. They all share in the result, which might be a pretty good \nway to do with oil producers that are drilling in the gulf, make them \nall worry about each other's plant and not just their own. So I believe \nnuclear power is safe.\n  As far as subsidies go, I would like to move some of those subsidies \ninto the energy research column and maybe into the reduce the debt \ncolumn.\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nNew York Times article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 11, 2011]\n\n            A Gold Rush of Subsidies in Clean Energy Search\n\n                  (By Eric Lipton and Clifford Krauss)\n\n       Washington.--Halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, \n     on a former cattle ranch and gypsum mine, NRG Energy is \n     building an engineering marvel: a compound of nearly a \n     million solar panels that will produce enough electricity to \n     power about 100,000 homes.\n       The project is also a marvel in another, less obvious way: \n     Taxpayers and ratepayers are providing subsidies worth almost \n     as much as the entire $1.6 billion cost of the project. \n     Similar subsidy packages have been given to 15 other solar- \n     and wind-power electric plants since 2009.\n       The government support--which includes loan guarantees, \n     cash grants and contracts that require electric customers to \n     pay higher rates--largely eliminated the risk to the private \n     investors and almost guaranteed them large profits for years \n     to come. The beneficiaries include financial firms like \n     Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, conglomerates like General \n     Electric, utilities like Exelon and NRG--even Google.\n       A great deal of attention has been focused on Solyndra, a \n     start-up that received $528 million in federal loans to \n     develop cutting-edge solar technology before it went \n     bankrupt, but nearly 90 percent of the $16 billion in clean-\n     energy loans guaranteed by the federal government since 2009 \n     went to subsidize these lower-risk power plants, which in \n     many cases were backed by big companies with vast resources.\n       When the Obama administration and Congress expanded the \n     clean-energy incentives in 2009, a gold-rush mentality took \n     over.\n       As NRG's chief executive, David W. Crane, put it to Wall \n     Street analysts early this year, the government's largess was \n     a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and ``we intend to do as \n     much of this business as we can get our hands on.'' NRG, \n     along with partners, ultimately secured $5.2 billion in \n     federal loan guarantees plus hundreds of millions in other \n     subsidies for four large solar projects.\n       ``I have never seen anything that I have had to do in my 20 \n     years in the power industry that involved less risk than \n     these projects,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It is just \n     filling the desert with panels.''\n       From 2007 to 2010, federal subsidies jumped to $14.7 \n     billion from $5.1 billion, according to a recent study.\n       Most of the surge came from the economic stimulus bill, \n     which was passed in 2009 and financed an Energy Department \n     loan guarantee program and a separate Treasury Department \n     grant program that were promoted as important in creating \n     green jobs.\n       States like California sweetened the pot by offering their \n     own tax breaks and by approving long-term power-purchase \n     contracts that, while promoting clean energy, will also \n     require ratepayers to pay billions of dollars more for \n     electricity for as long as two decades. The federal loan \n     guarantee program expired on Sept. 30. The Treasury grant \n     program is scheduled to expire at the end of December, \n     although the energy industry is lobbying Congress to extend \n     it. But other subsidies will remain.\n       The windfall for the industry over the last three years \n     raises questions of whether the Obama administration and \n     state governments went too far in their support of solar and \n     wind power projects, some of which would have been built \n     anyway, according to the companies involved.\n       Obama administration officials argue that the incentives, \n     which began on a large scale late in the Bush administration \n     but were expanded by the stimulus legislation, make economic \n     and environmental sense. Beyond the short-term increase in \n     construction hiring, they say, the cleaner air and lower \n     carbon emissions will benefit the country for decades.\n       ``Subsidies and government support have been part of many \n     key industries in U.S. history--railroads, oil, gas and coal, \n     aviation,'' said Damien LaVera, an Energy Department \n     spokesman.\n\n\n                              A Case Study\n\n       NRG's California Valley Solar Ranch project is a case study \n     in the banquet of government subsidies available to the \n     owners of a renewable-energy plant.\n       The first subsidy is for construction. The plant is \n     expected to cost $1.6 billion to build, with key components \n     made by SunPower at factories in California and Asia. In late \n     September, the Energy Department agreed to guarantee a $1.2 \n     billion construction loan, with the Treasury Department \n     lending the money at an exceptionally low interest rate of \n     about 3.5 percent, compared with the 7 percent that \n     executives said they would otherwise have had to pay.\n       That support alone is worth about $205 million to NRG over \n     the life of the loan, according to an analysis performed for \n     The New York Times by Booz & Company, a strategic consulting \n     firm that regularly performs such studies for private \n     investors.\n       When construction is complete, NRG is eligible to receive a \n     $430 million check from the Treasury Department--part of a \n     change made in 2009 that allows clean-energy projects to \n     receive 30 percent of their cost as a cash grant upfront \n     instead of taking other tax breaks gradually over several \n     years.\n       Californians are also making a big contribution. Under a \n     state law passed to encourage the construction of more solar \n     projects, NRG will not have to pay property taxes to San Luis \n     Obispo County on its solar panels, saving it an estimated $14 \n     million a year.\n       Assisted by another state law, which mandates that \n     California utilities buy 33 percent of their power from \n     clean-energy sources by 2020, the project's developers struck \n     lucrative contracts with the local utility, Pacific Gas & \n     Electric, to buy the plant's power for 25 years.\n       P.G.& E., and ultimately its electric customers, will pay \n     NRG $150 to $180 a megawatt-hour, according to a person \n     familiar with the project, who asked not to be identified \n     because the price information was confidential. At the time \n     the contract was awarded, that was about 50 percent more than \n     the expected market cost of electricity in California from a \n     newly built gas-powered plant, state officials said.\n       While neither state regulators nor the companies will \n     divulge all the details, the extra cost to ratepayers amounts \n     to a $462 million subsidy, according to Booz, which \n     calculated the present value of the higher rates over the \n     life of the contracts.\n       Additional depreciation tax breaks for renewable energy \n     plants could save the company an additional $110 million, \n     according to Christopher Dann, the Booz analyst who examined \n     the project.\n       The total value of all those subsidies in today's dollars \n     is about $1.4 billion, leading to an expected rate of return \n     of 25 percent for the project's equity investors, according \n     to Booz.\n       Mr. Crane of NRG disputed the Booz estimate, saying that \n     the company's return on equity was ``in the midteens.''\n       NRG, which initially is investing about $400 million of its \n     own money in the project, expects to get all of its equity \n     back in two to five years, according to a statement it made \n     in August to Wall Street analysts.\n       By 2015, NRG expects to be earning at least $300 million a \n     year in profits from all of its solar projects combined, \n     making these investments some of the more lucrative pieces in \n     its sprawling portfolio, which includes dozens of power \n     plants fueled by coal, natural gas and oil.\n       NRG is not the only company gobbling up subsidies. At least \n     10 of the 16 solar or wind electricity generation projects \n     that secured Energy Department loan guarantees intend to also \n     take the Treasury Department grant, and all but two of the \n     projects have long-term agreements to sell almost all of \n     their power, according to a survey of the companies by The \n     Times.\n       These projects, in almost all cases, benefit from \n     legislation that has been passed in about 30 states that \n     pushes local utility companies to buy a significant share of \n     their power from renewable sources, like solar or wind power. \n     These mandates often have resulted in contracts with above-\n     market rates for the project developers, and a guarantee of a \n     steady revenue stream.\n       ``It is like building a hotel, where you know in advance \n     you are going to have 100 percent room occupancy for 25 \n     years,'' said Kevin Smith, chief executive of SolarReserve. \n     His Nevada solar project has secured a 25-year power-purchase \n     agreement with the state's largest utility and a $737 million \n     Energy Department loan guarantee and is on track to receive a \n     $200 million Treasury grant.\n       Because the purchase mandates can drive up electricity \n     rates significantly, some states, including New Jersey and \n     Colorado, are considering softening the requirements on \n     utilities.\n       Brookfield Asset Management, a giant Canadian investment \n     firm, will receive so many subsidies for a New Hampshire wind \n     farm that they are worth 46 percent to 80 percent of the $229 \n     million price of the project, when measured in today's \n     dollars, according to analyses for The Times performed by \n     Booz and two other two industry financial experts. (The wide \n     range reflects a disagreement between the experts on the \n     future price of electricity in New Hampshire.)\n       Richard Legault, the chief executive of Brookfield \n     Renewable Power, the division that oversees the Granite \n     Reliable project in New Hampshire, declined to discuss his \n     profit expectations in detail, but said the project might not \n     have happened without government assistance.\n       ``When everything has come together, it is a good \n     investment for Brookfield, it is no doubt,'' Mr. Legault \n     said. ``We are quite happy with it.'' (Brookfield is also the \n     owner of the small park in Manhattan that is home to the \n     Occupy Wall Street protesters.)\n       Even companies whose business has little to do with energy \n     or finance, like the Internet giant Google, benefit from the \n     public subsidies. Google has invested in several renewable \n     energy projects, including a giant solar plant in the \n     California desert and a wind farm in Oregon, in part to get \n     federal tax breaks that it can use to offset its profits from \n     Web advertising.\n       Industry executives and other supporters of the subsidies \n     say that the public money was vital to the projects, in part \n     because financing for renewable energy projects dried up \n     during the recession. They also note that more traditional \n     energy sectors, like oil and natural gas, get heavy subsidies \n     of their own. For example, in the 2010 fiscal year, the oil \n     and gas producers got federal tax breaks of $2.7 billion, \n     according to an analysis by the Energy Information \n     Administration.\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n       ``These programs just level the playing field for what oil \n     and gas and nuclear industries have enjoyed for the last 50 \n     years,'' said Rhone Resch, president of Solar Energy \n     Industries Association. ``Do you have to provide more policy \n     support and funding initially? Absolutely. But the result is \n     more energy security, clean energy and domestic jobs.''\n       Michael E. Webber, associate director of the Center for \n     International Energy and Environmental Policy at the \n     University of Texas, Austin, said renewable energy subsidies \n     were a worthy investment. ``It is a form of corporate welfare \n     that is consistent with other social goals like job creation, \n     clean air and boosting a domestic source of energy,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                           Overflowing Breaks\n\n       Obama administration officials said the subsidies were \n     intended to help renewable-energy plants that were jumbo-\n     sized or used innovative technology, both potential obstacles \n     to getting private financing. But even proponents of the \n     subsidies say the administration may have gone overboard.\n       Concerns that the government was being too generous reached \n     all the way to President Obama. In an October 2010 memo \n     prepared for the president, Lawrence H. Summers, then his top \n     economic adviser; Carol M. Browner, then his adviser on \n     energy matters; and Ronald A. Klain, then the vice \n     president's chief of staff, expressed discomfort with the \n     ``double dipping'' that was starting to take place. They said \n     investors had little ``skin in the game.''\n       Officials involved in reviewing the loan applications said \n     that Treasury Department officials pressed the Energy \n     Department to respond to these concerns.\n       Officials at both agencies declined to discuss the \n     anticipated financial returns of the clean-energy projects \n     the federal government has agreed to guarantee, saying the \n     information was confidential.\n       But Energy Department officials said they had carefully \n     evaluated every project to try to calculate how much money \n     the developers and investors stood to make. ``They were \n     rejected, if they looked too rich or too risky,'' Mr. LaVera, \n     the Energy Department spokesman said.\n       In at least one instance--NRG's Agua Caliente solar project \n     in Yuma County, Ariz.--the Energy Department demanded that \n     the company agree not to apply for a Treasury grant it was \n     legally entitled to receive. The government was concerned the \n     extra subsidy would result in excessive profit, NRG \n     executives confirmed.\n       In other cases, the agency required that companies use most \n     of the Treasury grants that they would get when construction \n     was complete to pay down part of the government-guaranteed \n     construction loans instead of cashing out the equity \n     investors.\n       ``The private sector really has more skin in the game than \n     the public realizes,'' said Andy Katell, a spokesman for GE \n     Energy Financial Services, which like Goldman Sachs, Morgan \n     Stanley and other financial firms has large investments in \n     several of these projects.\n       But there is no doubt that the deals are lucrative for the \n     companies involved.\n       G.E., for example, lobbied Congress in 2009 to help expand \n     the subsidy programs, and it now profits from every aspect of \n     the boom in renewable-power plant construction.\n       It is also an investor in one solar and one wind project \n     that have secured about $2 billion in federal loan guarantees \n     and expects to collect nearly $1 billion in Treasury grants. \n     The company has also won hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     contracts to sell its turbines to wind plants built with \n     public subsidies.\n       Mr. Katell said G.E. and other companies were simply \n     ``playing ball'' under the rules set by Congress and the \n     Obama administration to promote the industry. ``It is good \n     for the country, and good for our company,'' he said.\n       Satya Kumar, an analyst at Credit Suisse who specializes in \n     renewable energy companies, said there was no question the \n     country would see real benefits from the surge in renewable \n     energy projects.\n       ``But the industry could have done a lot more solar for a \n     lot less price, in terms of subsidy,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I was reading in the New York Times on Saturday: Rich \nsubsidies powering solar and wind projects; big rise in company aid; \ncompanies are virtually assured of profits. This is the New York Times. \nThis isn't the conservative Washington, DC, Journal saying this. It is \na very thorough article that talks about something I have been \nconcerned about for a long time. It said:\n\n       Taxpayers and ratepayers are providing subsidies worth \n     almost as much as the entire $1.6 billion cost of a solar \n     plant halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco on a \n     former cattle ranch.\n\n  It quotes the head of NRG, a very substantial company, saying:\n\n       I have never seen anything that I have had to do in my 20 \n     years in the power industry that involved less risk than \n     these projects. It is just filling the desert with panels.\n       From 2007 to 2010, Federal subsidies jumped to $14.7 \n     billion from $5.1 billion, according to a recent study.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  My own research shows, the Joint Tax Committee said that over the \nnext 10 years taxpayer funding for wind--which our energy secretary \ntestified is a mature technology--will cost the taxpayers $26 billion \nover the next 10 years. Wouldn't that money be better spent on energy \nresearch for clean energy, for finding ways to deal with used nuclear \nfuel, for getting a 500-mile battery, for getting an installed dollar \nkilowatt or reducing the debt at a time when we are borrowing 40 cents \nof every $1 we spend?\n  So I am absolutely committed to working with Senator Feinstein on \nfinding a way to deal with the problem of used nuclear fuel. We \nurgently need to do that. We are fortunate it is safe where it is while \nwe do that, and I hope we can find a way to agree that over the next \nfew years we can move ahead so we at least get started on small modular \nreactors.\n  I am also willing to work with the chairman or anyone else, any other \nSenator who is willing to take a good, hard look at energy substitutes \nof all kinds and say, OK, let's take look at our own positions on that, \nespecially in light of the budget deficit, and let's take that money \nand put some of it into energy research so we can get up to where we \nneed to be and use the rest of it to reduce the debt.\n  So this is a good discussion and one I look forward to continuing, \nand I am delighted to have a chance to continue it with someone I \nrespect as much as the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I wish to thank the distinguished ranking \nmember. I believe that completes the opening statements on the bill.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator is on the floor. So if it is \nagreeable with Senator Alexander, we can yield at this time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I didn't come to interrupt opening \nstatements. I guess they are completed. I do have a point that is \ndirectly related to this particular appropriations bill which I would \nlike to discuss, and I am going to offer to put forward an amendment as \na consequence of this.\n  I am glad the chairwoman and the ranking member are here so I can put \nthis on the Record, and they are familiar with what I am going to do.\n  This is a matter that is important both to my State of Indiana and, I \nbelieve, the Federal Government's involvement in subsidizing or loan \nguarantees or other support for various energy development projects.\n  All of us, I think, are concerned over the situation with Solyndra, \nwhere a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy to \nconstruct a solar panel manufacturing facility has now gone bust, and \nthe taxpayer is on the hook for over $\\1/2\\ billion of loan guarantee \nand money that is lost to the taxpayer. That money likely will never be \nrepaid. However, my concern goes beyond Solyndra. I didn't come here to \ntalk about Solyndra. But there is a similar situation that may be \noccurring and I want to raise this issue because it goes, again, to \ndecisions that are being made by the Department's energy renewal \noffices relative to loans to private entities and loan guarantees to \nprivate entities.\n  This particular situation involves the Advanced Technology Vehicles \nManufacturing, or ATVM, Loan Program. Some of those loans are going to \nwhat may turn out to be viable improvements in our ability to lighten \nvehicles, to increase mileage, to provide for alternative sources of \nfuel. I think that is still up in the air and still to be determined. \nBut this particular program I want to talk about involves a program \nthat I am not sure fits within the proper category. Earlier this year \nthe Department issued a nearly three-quarters--$730 million--\nconditional loan commitment to Severstal North America under the ATVM \nprogram. Let me read from the Department's press release.\n\n       The funding will support the modernization of [Severstal's] \n     existing facilities in Dearborn, MI, in addition to the \n     design, manufacture and construction of new facilities to \n     produce the next generation of automotive advanced high-\n     strength steel. The Severstal project has the potential to \n     significantly increase the supply of this advanced high \n     strength steel in North America as demand continues to grow \n     for fuel efficient vehicles.\n\n  Continuing the release:\n\n       An increased supply for this breakthrough technology steel \n     will help U.S. automotive\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\n     manufacturers meet the pending and future design, weight and \n     safety requirements of advanced technology vehicles. \n     Severstal estimates the project will generate over 2,500 \n     construction jobs and over 260 permanent manufacturing jobs.\n\n  That is the end of the Department's press release.\n  The Department of Energy makes it sound as though this loan to \nSeverstal will promote a completely new breakthrough technology. The \nproblem is, this simply is not true. In fact, six companies already \nmanufacture the advanced high-strength steel that Severstal is seeking \nto receive a loan to help produce. Three of those companies have \nproduction facilities in my home State of Indiana: Arcelor Mittal, \nSteel Dynamics, and U.S. Steel.\n  Evidence shows that the market for this type of steel is strong and \nrobust in the United States, with multiple producers already \nmanufacturing these high-technology products. In fact, I am told that \nthis high-strength steel has been manufactured in the United States \nsince the 1980s, and the current capacity for this steel actually \nsurpasses current demand. All of this information should be available \nto the Energy Department for their consideration as to whether they \nshould go forward with this loan, but the Department spokesperson is \nquoted as saying that advanced high-strength steel is ``in short \nsupply.''\n  This begs the question as to whether the administration has seriously \nconducted any type of market analysis before deciding to award this \nloan. Did the Department research what advanced high-strength steel \nproducts are already in the marketplace and whether a taxpayer loan was \neven needed? Based on the Department's public comments it seems \nunlikely that the administration made any estimates of current and \nfuture capacity in the United States for the production of this steel \nor talked to any steel producers outside of Severstal.\n  I think a legitimate question is: What is the impact of this loan? \nShould it be finalized? Subsidizing Severstal to produce a product \nalready being manufactured would undercut competitors because \nSeverstal, of course, will have lower costs due to the nearly $\\3/4\\ \nbillion loan guarantee.\n  There is also no job creation here that fits the description of what \nthe Department indicated would be the case with new jobs. Given the \nstate of supply and demand, any new jobs created at Severstal would \ncome at a cost to other producers, creating, at best, a net zero job \ngain. That means job losses in Indiana and Pennsylvania where the high-\nstrength steel already is manufactured.\n  Moreover, the Department claims that ``over 2,500 construction jobs'' \nwould be created by the issuance of the loan. That claim is dubious at \nbest, since most of the plant construction is already manufactured. \nMoreover, the Department claims that Severstal's own documents claim \nthat two of the three required lines will be finished by December 2011. \nOnly an annealing line valued at one-third of the amount of the loan is \nawaiting final approval, and the Department's own Web site states, \n``Loans will not be available on a retroactive basis.''\n  Here we have a situation where the Department's own release and \njustification of the loan states a number of construction jobs to be \nput in place when the construction is virtually finished. Second, when \nmost of the completion includes, with one exception, what only amounts \nto one-third of the loan that is being asked for, it makes you wonder \nwhy the loan is two-thirds greater than that.\n  We have to ask the question, is it proper to give a company nearly \n$\\3/4\\ billion for facilities that have already been built and for \nproduction of a product that is already manufactured and in excess \nsupply in the United States--particularly for two States that are \nimpacted by this, the State of Indiana and the State of Pennsylvania? \nHere we are back in a situation where the Federal Government is picking \nwinners and losers in a fully functioning and growing product market.\n  Based on these concerns, I sent a letter to the Department of Energy \nSecretary Chu in August, seeking answers to a number of these questions \nI have been raising. Unfortunately the Department sent back a very \nnonresponsive reply that did not address any of my concerns.\n  As a result, I believe it is necessary to call on the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Energy to investigate the Severstal loan \nand report back to Congress his findings. American taxpayers deserve to \nknow what is happening with our tax dollars and the hardworking \nemployees of other steel companies manufacturing the same steel deserve \nto know why the Department of Energy is attempting to undercut their \njob security by subsidizing a competitor.\n\n  Today I am introducing an amendment to the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill that would direct the Energy Department's inspector \ngeneral to submit a report to Congress on the conditional loan \nagreement currently in place to Severstal. Such a report by the \ninspector general can help clarify why or why not this conditional loan \nto Severstal should be granted. The Department needs to be more \ntransparent and forthcoming with how it is using taxpayers' dollars. We \nneed to learn lessons from the disaster that is Solyndra and the cost \nto the taxpayer. The last thing the Department of Energy, this \nadministration, or this Congress needs to do is to authorize a nearly \n$\\3/4\\ billion loan for a product that is already being manufactured by \ndomestic steel suppliers and is not needed. We need that determination. \nThat is why I am offering this amendment.\n  Mr. President, if time permits, I wish also to step aside from the \ncurrent topic to briefly discuss another matter. I do not want to \nexceed the time limitation that might be in place. It appears I can go \nforward with that without a problem.\n  Mr. President, I also want to discuss the subject of a vote last week \nby UNESCO, the United Nations Education and Scientific Cultural \nOrganization, to grant membership to the Palestinian Authority even \nthough it is not a recognized country. UNESCO should not have the \nauthority to do so, but through a vote in the United Nations it did \njust that. The United States has been an on-and-off supporter of \nUNESCO. There has been a lot of controversy with UNESCO over its lack \nof effectiveness and the cost to the taxpayer. It has resulted in \nquestions as to whether we should continue funding that organization. \nWe currently support that.\n  This action that has been taken to admit the Palestinian Authority as \na member state is, I submit, completely misguided and deeply damaging. \nUNESCO's decision has further dimmed prospects for a negotiated peace \nin the Middle East. My fear is that this step--which the Palestinians \nmistakenly regard as a success--will encourage them to press for \nmembership in other U.N. bodies as well. Doing so will harm Israel, \nharm the Palestinians' own interests, harm the U.N. agencies involved, \nand harm our own national interests. As a consequence of this, the \nUnited States is obligated under law to terminate all funding for \nUNESCO and any other U.N. body that admits the Palestinian Authority. \nPublic law 101-246, which passed in 1990, states that: ``no funds \nauthorized to be appropriated by this Act or any other Act shall be \navailable for the United Nations or any specialized agency thereof \nwhich accords the Palestinian Liberation Organization [the PLO] the \nsame standing as member states.''\n  That is the law. That is what has been enacted through votes in this \nbody and signed by Presidents of the United States. In 1994, Congress \npassed Public Law 103-236, which prohibits ``voluntary or assessed \ncontribution to any affiliated organization of the United Nations which \ngrants full membership as a state to any organization or group that \ndoes not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood,'' \nwhich the PLO does not have. The Senate, on a vote codifying these \nlaws--or reaffirming them, I should say--passed this legislation 92 to \n8, indicating that this clearly should be a noncontroversial and \nnonpartisan issue, clearly, a 92-to-8 vote.\n  The reason I am speaking here today is despite our legal obligation \nto suspend funding as a result of UNESCO's latest action, there has \nbeen some speculation that it may be possible to find alternative ways \nto financially support U.N. agencies such as UNESCO that have taken \nthis step of admitting the Palestinians as a member. That\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\nwould be a total mistake. I want to reiterate the fact that it would be \na violation of the law.\n  Therefore, I come to the floor today to introduce a bill that serves \nas an emphatic restatement of that law, making its consequences more \ncertain.\n  Furthermore, I am introducing this language as an amendment to the \ncurrent appropriations bill, that will clarify that no taxpayer dollars \ncan be used to fund UNESCO. We must slam the door on any speculation of \nany kind of backdoor financial support for the United Nations agencies \nthat grant membership to Palestine. This bill is exactly that. There is \nno reason why this purposeful reinstatement of existing law should not \nhave bipartisan support. The threat to prospects for negotiated, just, \nand lasting peace that is posed by this recent Palestinian tactic is \nmore tangible now than in the past. Our determination to discourage \nsuch a dangerous tactic should be stronger than ever.\n\n  I ask that my colleagues join in support of this legislation that \nmakes it clear to UNESCO, the United Nations, Israel, the Palestinian \nAuthority, and clear to the rest of the world that the United States \nwill not tolerate attempts to admit the Palestinian Authority and \nundercut negotiated peace efforts in the Middle East.\n  I am hoping we will have a vote on this to once again reaffirm our \ndetermined commitment to live by the laws we have passed and to not \nallow an agency of the United Nations or any part of the United Nations \nbe used to grant statesmanship and nationhood to an entity that has not \nqualified for that. I hope this reaffirmation will also put to rest any \nspeculation or any attempts to circumvent the laws that exist on the \nbooks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter concerning section 18 of the America Invents Act, \nsent to me and others by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC September 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Kyl, Schumer, Leahy and Grassley: I am \n     writing to discuss further the importance of the transitional \n     program for business method patents as included in H.R. 1249, \n     the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. As you know, this \n     provision enables the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \n     (`USPTO') to correct egregious errors that were made in the \n     granting of a wide range of business method patents.\n       Business methods were generally not patentable in the \n     United States before the late 1990s, and generally are not \n     patentable elsewhere in the world. The Federal Circuit, \n     however, created this new class of patents in its 1998 State \n     Street decision. In its 2010 decision in Bilski v. Kappos, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court clamped down on the patenting of \n     business methods and other patents of poor quality. It is \n     likely that many or most of the business method patents that \n     were issued after State Street are now invalid under Bilski.\n       There really is no sense in allowing expensive litigation \n     over patents that are no longer valid in light of the Supreme \n     Court's clarification of the law. The new transitional \n     program included in the House bill creates an inexpensive and \n     speedy alternative to litigation--allowing parties to resolve \n     these disputes more efficiently rather than spending millions \n     of dollars in litigation costs. In the process, the \n     proceeding will also prevent nuisance litigation settlements.\n       Moreover, the new administrative proceeding allows business \n     method patents to be reviewed by the experts at the USPTO \n     under the correct (Bilski) standard. To use this proceeding, \n     a challenger must make an up-front showing to the USPTO of \n     evidence that the business method patent is more likely than \n     not invalid. This is a high standard. Only the worst patents, \n     which probably never should have been issued, will be \n     eligible for review in this proceeding.\n       This program provides the Patent Office with a fast, \n     precise vehicle to review low-quality business method \n     patents, which the Supreme Court has acknowledged are often \n     abstract and overly broad.\n       Specifically, the bill's provision applies to patents that \n     describe a series of steps used to conduct every-day business \n     applications in the financial products and retail services \n     sectors. These are patents that can be and have been asserted \n     against all types of businesses--from community banks and \n     credit unions to retailers and businesses of all sizes and \n     from all industries.\n       The provision is, indeed, limited to patents that are non-\n     technological in nature (i.e., business methods) and that \n     involve a process or related apparatus used in the practice, \n     administration, or management of a financial product or \n     service. The program's exception for ``technological \n     inventions'' precludes review of patents for inventions based \n     on application of the natural sciences or related engineering \n     or inventions in computer operations. And by requiring that \n     the covered patents be applicable to a financial product or \n     service, the proceeding in the House bill ensures that the \n     patents eligible for review will generally include only those \n     that have some business or commercial orientation.\n       Nothing in the bill, however, limits use of the proceeding \n     to one industry; rather, it applies to non-technological \n     patents that can apply to financial products or services. Any \n     business that sells or purchases goods or services \n     ``practices'' or ``administers'' a financial service by \n     conducting such transactions. Most business-method patents \n     are fairly plastic in nature and could apply to a whole host \n     of business activities. See 157 Cong. Rec. 1363, 1365 (daily \n     ed. March 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Schumer) (``To meet \n     this requirement, the patent need not recite a specific \n     financial product or service. Rather the patent claims must \n     only be broad enough to cover a financial product or \n     service.''). To be sure, the fact that a patent has been \n     asserted against a financial institution with respect to \n     products or processes that are unique to such institutions \n     will be a fairly clear indicator that the patent applies to a \n     ``financial product or service,'' and should provide guidance \n     to the USPTO in administering the program. See 157 Cong. Rec. \n     1368, 1379 (daily ed. March 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n       The transitional program can be used to review patents for \n     ``a method or a corresponding apparatus.'' The distinction \n     between a ``process'' and a ``machine'' (two of the terms \n     used in section 101 of the patent code to define what is \n     patentable) is not a firm one, and many inventions can be \n     characterized either way. A ``corresponding apparatus'' for a \n     business method would include, for example, a computer that \n     was programmed to carry out the business process. Wary of the \n     stigma that attaches to business-method patents, many \n     applicants try to obscure the nature of these patents by \n     characterizing a computer that has been programmed to execute \n     the process as the invention, and thus asserting that the \n     process is really a ``machine'' or a ``system.''\n       The program's definition of ``covered business-method \n     patent'' includes a ``corresponding apparatus'' in order to \n     prevent such obvious evasions. Any other approach would \n     elevate claim-drafting form over invention substance. \n     Finally, any ``apparatus'' that is subject to review under \n     the program would need to be used to implement or effect a \n     business method. Legitimate inventions in technological \n     fields will not be subject to review under this program.\n       The transitional program also extends to privies of parties \n     charged with infringement. This was done specifically to \n     prevent downstream customers or users from being dragged into \n     frivolous litigation over suspect or improperly granted \n     patents. H.R. 1249 also extends the time frame for the \n     transitional program. This change is important to prevent \n     patent trolls from waiting out the program. This issue of \n     folks ``lying in wait'' may actually be a significant \n     argument for extending or making permanent this program in \n     the future. Similarly, the program's definition was expanded \n     in H.R. 1249 so that it is not limited to class 705 patents. \n     This change is key to the program's success, because many \n     business method patents are assigned to classes other than \n     705, and it makes no sense to exclude them because of the \n     quirks of USPTO's classification regime.\n       This program is not tied to one industry or sector of the \n     economy--it affects everyone. The provision as developed in \n     the Senate and later perfected in the House will ensure that \n     the vast majority of non-technological business method \n     patents will be eligible for review under this program. As \n     the USPTO had a presumption to grant many of these erroneous \n     patents, they should now have a presumption to allow most \n     non-technological\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\n     business method patents that have a commercial nexus into \n     this new program for review. This program was designed to be \n     construed as broadly as possible and as USPTO develops \n     regulations to administer the program that must remain the \n     goal.\n       The strength of our patent system relies on not simply the \n     mechanical granting of a patent, but the granting of strong \n     patents, ones that are truly novel and non-obvious \n     inventions, that are true innovations and not the product of \n     legal gamesmanship. This provision is an integral component \n     of H.R. 1249 and will not only help correct past mistakes but \n     ensure a stronger U.S. patent system going forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lamar Smith,\n                             Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7414-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARGE THOMAS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I honor Marge Thomas, who is \nretiring as the president and chief executive officer of Goodwill \nIndustries of the Chesapeake. Ms. Thomas began her career with Goodwill \nin Milwaukee in 1974 and rose to become the first woman executive in \nthe enterprise to win a national Goodwill Industries leadership award, \nto go along with Outstanding Management and Distinguished Career \nAwards.\n  Ms. Thomas took over Goodwill Industries of the Chesapeake in 1994 \nand transformed the agency into one of Baltimore's largest nonprofit \norganizations during her nearly 18-year tenure. When she joined \nGoodwill Chesapeake in 1994, the agency served 453 people, operated 17 \nstores, and had total revenues of $8 million. Today, it serves more \nthan 17,000 people, and the organization has expanded to include nine \ntraining sites and 26 retail stores, and it has government contracts \nthroughout the greater Baltimore region and the Eastern Shore. Total \nrevenues have grown to $40 million, with nearly $30 million generated \nthrough the agency's retail operations. Her accomplishments include \nexpanding Goodwill services to provide a variety of training and \nemployment needs for individuals who have mental and physical \ndisabilities, including those needing public assistance, and those who \nhave criminal backgrounds or face other employment challenges.\n  Congress would do well to learn from Ms. Thomas, who has found ways \nduring these trying economic times to create jobs, train employees, and \nincrease revenues. She has offered a helping hand and, more important, \nhope to many people struggling to climb onto the first rung of the \neconomic ladder. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Ms. Thomas \nfor a job well done; for her lifelong commitment to public service and \nfor her many outstanding contributions in helping the less fortunate \namong us. She has made a positive difference in so many people's lives. \nI know her future plans include some travel, attending some classes at \nAnne Arundel Community College, and serving as a mentor to women \nnonprofit executives. Please join me in sending best wishes to Marge \nThomas for a happy, productive, and well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7414-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TERIGI ROSSI\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to join the \nMassachusetts relatives and friends of Massachusetts native son Terigi \nRossi in celebrating 15 remarkable years as a police officer in Dallas, \nTX, the last 10 as a member of that city's elite SWAT Team.\n  The name Terigi Rossi may be familiar to television viewers. Officer \nRossi was featured in ``Dallas SWAT,'' a reality television series on \nthe A Network that followed members of the Dallas SWAT Team in 2006-\n2007. The TV cameras captured the gritty, life-on-the-line experiences \nof Officer Rossi and his fellow SWAT Team members, but they also \nfollowed them home, showing the family life of officers whose lives are \nalways in danger but who always put family first.\n  In Officer Rossi's case, viewer had an intimate view of a man who \nwith his fellow officer is called out to capture a bank robbery suspect \nbarricaded inside a garage, or responding to another call, trying to \nstop a suspected drug dealer from destroying evidence. But when the \nwork day is done, the cameras followed Officer Rossi through training \nfor an amateur boxing match, then back home where he cooks chicken \ncutlets for dinner with his wife Grace and their two sons, 15-year-old \nAntonio and 11-year-old Terigi. Then, it is off to his part time job as \na security guard to supplement the family income.\n  As a prosecutor in Middlesex County in the 1970s, I worked with \nhundreds of police officers. And it was clear how much we ask of these \nofficers. They are required to be many things to many people--minister, \nsocial worker, keeper of the peace, the lawman with the courage to face \nthe armed suspects at great personal risk. And since the late 1960s, \nsome of the best of these lawmen have been recruited into elite \ntactical units to perform dangerous and high-risk operations--lawmen \nlike Terigi Rossi.\n  Terigi Rossi grew up on Harley Avenue in the city of Everett, MA. He \ngraduated from Malden Catholic High School where, not surprisingly, \nthis 6-foot 230-pound athlete was a lineman on the football team, \nplaying offense and defense. He graduated from Suffolk University where \nhe was recruited by the city of Dallas to serve on their police force, \none of the largest in the Nation, with 2,977 sworn officers and 556 \ncivilians.\n  And I have to say--Massachusetts's loss was Texas's gain, because \nTerigi Rossi would have been a great addition to any police force in \nour State. Just look at the 15 years this always-on-the-go officer has \nspent on the Dallas police force, including 10 years with the city's \nalways-ready-to-go 50-member SWAT Team as a specialist in gas and \nchemical weaponry.\n  Officer Rossi's family and friends back home in Massachusetts, \nparticularly my friend Tom Ciulla, are justifiably proud of his record \nof public service. I join them in celebrating not only his 15 years in \na police uniform but also his 10 years in the armor of the Dallas SWAT \nTeam. And I send thanks to Grace, Antonio and Terigi for their support \nof Officer Rossi. They know as well as any that law enforcement \nofficers are never off duty. They protect the public any time and any \nplace that the peace is threatened. And we should give them all they \nhelp they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7414-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7414-S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE BRUCE Q. MORIN\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I express my thanks and \ncongratulations to a son and servant of my State of Rhode Island. Bruce \nQ. Morin, associate judge of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation \nCourt, has recently retired after a long career in public service.\n  I first had the pleasure of getting to know Judge Morin in the early \n1990s, when I was a policy adviser to then-Rhode Island Governor Bruce \nSundlun. At the time, the Rhode Island worker's compensation system was \nbroken and on the verge of insolvency. Costs had risen to unbearable \nlevels. Insurers were departing the Rhode Island system. The problem \nseemed politically intractable. And worst of all, the means of \nproviding adequate support to injured workers in Rhode Island was in \ndanger.\n  Well, working together we completely overhauled the system. A central \ncomponent of the overhaul was the creation of Rhode Island's Workers' \nCompensation Court, specifically designed to hear and decide all \ndisputes between an injured employee and an employer relating to \nworkers' compensation benefits. Governor Sundlun appointed Bruce Morin \nto the court in 1991, the year it was created, and he has dutifully and \nhonorably served both the state of Rhode Island and the citizens who \nhave come before his bench for 20 years.\n  Today, the Rhode Island workers' compensation system stands as a \nnational model. Rhode Island has been able to permanently reduce costs, \nstabilize the workers' compensation market, eliminate fraud, protect \ninjured workers, and save Rhode Island businesses hundreds of millions \nof dollars. Rhode Island's system now has the lowest average medical \ncost per employee per year in the entire country.\n  We owe a great measure of that success to Judge Morin, Chief Judge \nHealey, former Chief Judge Arrigan, and the rest of the court for \nimplementation of the law in the best interests of the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  From his days serving his country, both with the Judge Advocate \nGeneral\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nCorps of the U.S. Naval Reserve and as an instructor at the Naval \nJustice School in Newport; to his time as a member of the Rhode Island \nState senate; to his distinguished tenure on the Workers' Compensation \nCourt, Bruce Morin has been a lifelong public servant.\n  After a long and successful career in Rhode Island, I know Judge \nMorin is looking forward to an enjoyable retirement, more hours on the \nlinks, and more time to share with his two wonderful children Jeffrey \nand Amy. I congratulate him on his many accomplishments and wish him \ngreat luck and happiness in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7415-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7415-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7415-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate announced that on today, November 14, \n2011, she had presented to the President of the United States the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1280.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (referred to \n     in this preamble as ``COPD''), also known as chronic \n     bronchitis and emphysema, is the third leading cause of death \n     in the United States and is the only 1 of the top 5 causes of \n     death with a rising prevalence and death rate;\n       Whereas COPD is a chronic and progressive disease that \n     affects over 24,000,000 people in the United States, \\1/2\\ of \n     whom have not been properly diagnosed;\n       Whereas COPD claims the lives of more than 120,000 people \n     of the United States each year, with a person dying every 4 \n     minutes from COPD;\n       Whereas COPD is considered to be the second leading cause \n     of disability in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2011 COPD cost the United States approximately \n     $49,900,000,000 per year;\n       Whereas the major risk factor for COPD is smoking and other \n     risk factors include exposure to air pollution, industrial \n     irritants, and burned biomass fuels;\n       Whereas COPD can also result from genetic conditions, such \n     as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency;\n       Whereas many patients suffering with COPD are not diagnosed \n     until they have reached an advanced stage of COPD;\n       Whereas a diagnostic test for COPD, known as spirometry, is \n     available for office use, allowing early diagnosis of COPD;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health, Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs play a critical role in advancing the \n     prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately a cure for \n     COPD;\n       Whereas primary care physicians are in a key position to \n     provide optimal care to patients with COPD and need to be \n     trained to diagnose and treat the disease;\n       Whereas individuals with COPD who are able to receive \n     education from allied health professionals, such as \n     respiratory therapists, have better health outcomes;\n       Whereas appropriately treating COPD with medication and \n     health management can reduce hospital readmissions and costly \n     exacerbations; and\n       Whereas increased public awareness, screening, early \n     detection, and treatment of COPD are crucial in the \n     prevention or slowing the progression of lung disease and can \n     lead to reduced costs and better quality of life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2011 as ``COPD Awareness Month'';\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to become \n     more informed about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``COPD'') and get screened \n     if they are at risk; and\n       (3) encourages further partnership between the Federal \n     government and private entities to enhance patient education \n     about COPD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7416-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 945.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (referred to \n     in this preamble as ``COPD''), also known as chronic \n     bronchitis and emphysema, is the third leading cause of death \n     in the United States and is the only 1 of the top 5 causes of \n     death with a rising prevalence and death rate;\n       Whereas COPD is a chronic and progressive disease that \n     affects over 24,000,000 people in the United States, \\1/2\\ of \n     whom have not been properly diagnosed;\n       Whereas COPD claims the lives of more than 120,000 people \n     of the United States each year, with a person dying every 4 \n     minutes from COPD;\n       Whereas COPD is considered to be the second leading cause \n     of disability in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2011 COPD cost the United States approximately \n     $49,900,000,000 per year;\n       Whereas the major risk factor for COPD is smoking and other \n     risk factors include exposure to air pollution, industrial \n     irritants, and burned biomass fuels;\n       Whereas COPD can also result from genetic conditions, such \n     as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency;\n       Whereas many patients suffering with COPD are not diagnosed \n     until they have reached an advanced stage of COPD;\n       Whereas a diagnostic test for COPD, known as spirometry, is \n     available for office use, allowing early diagnosis of COPD;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health, Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs play a critical role in advancing the \n     prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately a cure for \n     COPD;\n       Whereas primary care physicians are in a key position to \n     provide optimal care to patients with COPD and need to be \n     trained to diagnose and treat the disease;\n       Whereas individuals with COPD who are able to receive \n     education from allied health professionals, such as \n     respiratory therapists, have better health outcomes;\n       Whereas appropriately treating COPD with medication and \n     health management can reduce hospital readmissions and costly \n     exacerbations; and\n       Whereas increased public awareness, screening, early \n     detection, and treatment of COPD are crucial in the \n     prevention or slowing the progression of lung disease and can \n     lead to reduced costs and better quality of life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2011 as ``COPD Awareness Month'';\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to become \n     more informed about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``COPD'') and get screened \n     if they are at risk; and\n       (3) encourages further partnership between the Federal \n     government and private entities to enhance patient education \n     about COPD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7418-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 112-4\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, \nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing, done at the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in Rome, \nItaly, on November 22, 2009 (the ``Agreement''). I also transmit, for \nthe information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State \nwith respect to the Agreement.\n  The Agreement established, for the first time at the global level, \nlegally binding minimum standards for port states to control port \naccess by foreign fishing vessels, as well as by foreign transport and \nsupply ships that support fishing vessels. The Agreement also \nencourages Parties to apply similar measures to their own vessels. \nInvolved Federal agencies and stakeholders strongly support the \nAgreement. The Agreement establishes practical provisions to prevent \nfish from illegal, unreported, and unregulated fisheries from entering \nthe stream of commerce. If widely ratified and properly implemented, \nthe Agreement will thereby serve as a valuable tool in combating \nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing worldwide.\n  The legislation necessary to implement the Agreement will be \nsubmitted separately to the Congress. I recommend that the Senate give \nearly and favorable consideration to this Agreement and give its advice \nand consent to ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, November 14, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/14/senate-section/article/S7418-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
