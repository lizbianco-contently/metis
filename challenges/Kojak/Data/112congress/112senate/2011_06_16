Mr. President, I am happy to see the Republicans opening up \nto what Democrats have been saying all along--that cutting wasteful \nsubsidies to Big Oil should be on the table if we are going to reduce \nthe deficit. Yesterday, my friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, \nsaid he would consider ending taxpayer subsidies for oil companies \nmaking record profits. I congratulate my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee. Democrats agree. Handouts such as these to companies \nthat made $36 billion in the first quarter of this year alone must be \npart of the discussion if we are going to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  As we decide where to cut, we will need to make some tough choices, \nbut not every choice has to be difficult. If we are serious about \nreducing spending, ending tens of billions in taxpayer giveaways to big \noil companies shouldn't be one of the difficult decisions we have to \nmake.\n  When the other side says the alternative is to end Medicare, slash \nMedicaid, and put millions of seniors at risk, the choice is that much \nclearer. We cannot take with one hand from those who can least afford \nit and give with the other hand to those who can. Before we end \nMedicare as we know it or eliminate Medicaid funding for nursing homes, \nas the Republicans have proposed, we should cut wasteful spending. \nDuring the course of a year, one in five Americans will be on Medicaid. \nThe cuts the Republicans propose will affect real people--the elderly \nman in the nursing home, for example; the child missing her yearly \ncheckup, as an example; the pregnant woman, as an example, whose baby \ndepends on proper prenatal care; or the person with a disability, for \nexample, who is able to live alone thanks to the helping hand Medicaid \nprovides. These cuts will affect everyone else too. Cutting Medicaid \nsimply shifts costs; it doesn't lower costs. Each patient who doesn't \nget the care he or she needs from a doctor today will get it tomorrow \nat three times the price in an emergency room, and we will all foot \nthat bill.\n  The American people have spoken loudly and clearly. They do not want \nto balance the budget on the backs of seniors, children, or the \ndisabled. I am glad to see at least one of my Republican colleagues \ncourageously breaking from the pack.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair now announce whatever the business of \nthe day is.\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3852-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, noting there is no one on the floor, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nduring the quorum the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Ethanol \nSubsidy and Tariff Repeal Act, which Senator Coburn and I are offering \nas an amendment to pending legislation. The other cosponsors on this \namendment are Senator Webb and Senator Collins. This is identical to a \nbill that we have submitted. On that bill there are more cosponsors. \nThey are Coburn, Cardin, Webb, Corker, Lieberman, Collins, Shaheen, \nBurr, Risch, and Toomey.\n  I want to have the record straight that this amendment is in response \nto a bill which we have crafted. On Tuesday the Senate voted on the \nproposal but unfortunately we saw a process battle, which I spoke to on \nthe floor, which I think overwhelmed, in some respects, the debate. \nThat is not the case today. There are ongoing negotiations to see if it \nis possible to put together a solution which can bring all sides \ntogether on this amendment that we will be voting on at 2 o'clock. Thus \nfar we do not have an agreement. However, at least one of our \ncosponsors of this has said to me--this is Senator Webb--that he would \nvery much appreciate a straight up-or-down vote on Coburn-Feinstein so \nwe know exactly where the Senate stands. It is still possible, even \nafter that cloture vote, if we can reach a successful conclusion to the \nnegotiation that we could have another vote and change that.\n  Today, this is the first vote that the Senate has taken based on the \nmerits of repealing the ethanol subsidy and tariff. In a nutshell, let \nme give the reasons. I know of no other product in the United States \nthat has a triple crown of benefits: It is a mandate: oil companies \nmust buy this ethanol; there is a subsidy: oil companies are paid for \nbuying this substance; and this substance known as corn ethanol is \nprotected by a protective tariff which prevents other nations, such as \nBrazil, from importing ethanol which actually has more beneficial \nenvironmental effects.\n  As a matter of fact, corn ethanol is the least environmentally \nproficient form of ethanol. Everything else is better than corn; \ncellulosic is better, algae is better, and sugar is better. The bottom \nline is we have a triple crown of subsidy, mandate, and protective \ntariff on the least effective, least environmentally sound ethanol \nthere is.\n  More importantly, corn ethanol is now used to such an extent that it \nis having a major impact on food commodity prices and in particular on \nfeed prices. This is particularly true in the poultry industry. I will \nget to that in a few minutes.\n  I do want to thank Senators Klobuchar and Thune for good-faith \nefforts to try to reach a compromise. As part of this compromise, at \nleast from my point of view, a substantial amount of the revenue must \nbe used to reduce the debt and deficit in addition to eliminating \nwasteful ethanol subsidies and tariffs. These negotiations have been \nongoing since Tuesday. We have not yet reached an agreement. The vote \nat 2 o'clock will not end these talks. I am perfectly willing to \ncontinue to talk but I do think it is important that we have a clean \nup-or-down vote on the Coburn-Feinstein amendment.\n  The issue at hand is a simple issue. The subsidy given to these oil \ncompanies costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year and the tariff \nactually has the effect of making us more dependent on foreign oil. Let \nme explain. In 2005, the ethanol subsidy cost taxpayers $1.5 billion. \nThis year that number is nearly $6 billion. In just 6 years it has gone \nfrom a cost of $1.5 billion to a cost of nearly $6 billion. There is a \nreason for it, and I will get to that in a moment, but since 2005, the \ntotal cost of this subsidy has been $22.6 billion.\n  Here is the increase every year: $1.5 billion in 2005; 2006, $2.6 \nbillion; 2007, $3.3 billion; 2008, $4.4 billion; 2009, $5.2 billion; \n2010, $5.7 billion; and the all-time high in these last 2 years of $5.7 \nbillion.\n  However, it continues to rise. The proposal that has been made for an \nextension to 2015, by some, would cost another $31 billion.\n  Let me be clear. The subsidy is wasteful and duplicative. It does \nvery little to promote the use of ethanol which oil companies already \nmust use under current law. The renewable fuels standard dictates oil \ncompanies use 14 billion gallons of biofuels this year, 20.5 billion \ngallons by 2015, to 36 billion gallons by 2022.\n  These volumes, by law, increase every year. It more than doubles by \n2022. It is that doubling in volume that will ultimately cost us; we \nare currently paying oil companies to follow this law.\n  Let me speak briefly about the tariff. The 54-cent-per-gallon tariff \non ethanol imports makes our Nation more dependent on foreign oil. The \ntariff acts as a trade barrier, placing clean sugarcane ethanol imports \nfrom friendly nations at a competitive disadvantage to\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\noil imports from OPEC. This discourages imports of low-carbon ethanol \nfrom our allies and leads to more oil and gasoline imports from OPEC \ncountries, which enter the United States tariff free. So you have a \nhigh tariff on ethanol imports but a very low tariff on oil. Sugarcane \nethanol, one of the lowest carbon fuels that is widely available, \nsuffers from this tariff.\n  This tariff makes no sense and it should be repealed. I believe that \nthere is very strong consensus in this body on the tariff issue. The \nEthanol Subsidy and Tariff Repeal Act repeals the 45-cent-per-gallon \nethanol blending subsidy known as the volumetric ethanol excise tax \ncredit on July 1. The 54-cent-per-gallon ethanol tariff is also \nrepealed beginning on July 1. Two parts of the three-part triple crown \nof government support are covered in our bill.\n  The third part of the triple crown is that refineries are already \nrequired to use ethanol under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The subsidy \npays them to use that mandated ethanol, and ethanol, again, is \nprotected from competition by a very high import tariff.\n  I think we need to address this quickly because the effects are \nharmful and the costs are great. At highest risk are increased costs \nfor feed, corn, and other food. Today, 39 percent of the U.S. corn crop \nis used to produce ethanol, according to the Congressional Research \nService. Well over a third of the corn crop is used to produce ethanol. \nCorn futures reached a record $7.99 a bushel last week, this is an \nincrease of 140 percent over 12 months.\n  In this graph you can see the rise, from $2 in 2005 to $3 in 2006, \ngoing up over 2007, 2008 to over $4, beginning to come down slightly in \n2009, continues down in 2010, and then in 2010 to 2011, and 2011 to \n2012, it has shot up to well over $6. This is devastating, to poultry \nfarms all over the country. This is devastating to cattle and this is \ndevastating to food commodity prices. These prices will continue to go \nup if we let these subsidies continue. The annual average price of corn \nhas risen 225 percent since 2006. So from 2005 to today, there has been \na 225-percent increase in corn prices. Does anybody think that is good \nfor this Nation? Is it good for farmers who depend on corn feed? I \ndon't think so.\n\n  Let me give you some examples. The annual feed cost for Foster Farms \ntripled over the past year, increasing costs by more than $200 million. \nThat is greater than the firm's largest ever annual profit. Zacky \nFarms, which is a large farm, has lost $35 million over the last 3 \nyears due to increased corn costs.\n  I want to read to you for a moment a summary of the impacts on Zacky \nFarms. Here is the background. Zacky Farms is a family-owned, \nvertically integrated producer of quality turkey products for consumers \nin the retail and food service markets. The company is 55 years old but \nhas roots in supplying poultry products to consumers that reach back \nall the way to 1928, representing three generations of commitment to \nthe business. Zacky currently employs over 1,000 and supplies \napproximately 2 percent of the turkey consumed in the United States.\n  During the past 3-plus years, the growing use of corn for ethanol has \nbeen nothing less than devastating on Zacky Farms. Why? The cost of \nturkey feed represent about 60 percent of the final price of turkey \nproducts that consumers buy in stores. Corn is roughly 50 percent of \nthe turkey feed formulation, making corn one-third of the cost of a \nturkey. Soybean meal, usually the second largest ingredient in turkey \nfeed, competes for the same acreage as corn, and consequently the \npricing of soybean meal often moves in tandem with corn. The government \nis sitting on acres and paying farmers not to plant soybeans, thereby \nencouraging costs to rise. I didn't know that. We are paying farmers \nnot to plant soybeans. Recent reports show that since 1990, there are \nessentially no new acres available. Ethanol use of corn is therefore \ndriving up other turkey feed ingredient prices also.\n  The increasing use of corn in ethanol--now nearly 40 percent of the \nNation's corn supply--has been a major factor in driving the price of \ncorn from $2 a bushel, to $4 a bushel, to $6 a bushel, and currently \n$7.75 a bushel. That is what Zacky is currently paying. This dramatic \nincrease has all occurred since the fourth quarter of 2006. The turkey \nindustry has been unable to pass these cost increases along fast enough \nto maintain profitability.\n  We were in the caucus on Tuesday, and we heard one Senator talk about \nhow a farm has actually collapsed because of these prices in his State, \nand a second Senator reiterated his deep concern about what is \nhappening to the poultry interest in his State. So this is not just \nFoster Farms and Zacky Farms, which happen to be in California, it is \nall over.\n  They then go into the impact of corn for ethanol on employees, \nsuppliers, customers, consumers, and family ownership, and they say \nthey have suffered significant losses during the past 3 years, and it \nhas been estimated to be as much as $35 million in losses from 2008, \n2009, and 2010, and their banking relationships have been shattered \nafter 60 years of banking. Bank of America told the company to find \nanother bank.\n  In 2008, the company was forced to implement across-the-board salary \nfreezes and other measures to help control these costs. Turkey prices \nhave jumped dramatically and will continue to increase--in other words, \nthe market is becoming such that turkey is going to become an \nendangered species, particularly in a down market. And they stopped \npromotions, such as the free Thanksgiving turkey with the purchase of a \ncertain dollar amount. It goes on and on. This is a very serious issue.\n  Let me give you another one. Paul Cameron is a commercial cattle \nfeeder from the Imperial Valley. He says:\n\n       My company employs 32 hard-working men and women. Many of \n     these employees are second and third generation to the \n     livestock business. Our cattle rely primarily on Midwestern \n     grown corn as their primary source for grain.\n\n  This is the conflict here:\n\n       This year 41 percent of our Nation's corn crop will be used \n     up by a heavily subsidized ethanol industry. In a year where \n     nationally our grain inventories have already been reduced by \n     adverse weather, corn has risen in price by 140 percent. \n     Because of this, any chance of profitability in all protein \n     industries has vanished.\n       The cattle inventory in our own operation is being reduced \n     and we have begun the process of laying off many of our \n     employees. Coming from a county with 27.9 percent \n     unemployment (April EDD), these good, hard-working people \n     will be relegated to trying to find jobs where there are \n     none. These are the very people that take great pride in the \n     fact that they not only feed a Nation, but also feed the \n     world.\n\n  This is what these subsidies are doing. This is actual testimony read \nverbatim.\n  I have a letters from the American Meat Institute, California \nDairies, National Chicken Council, National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, National Meat Association, National Pork Producers \nCouncil, and the National Turkey Federation essentially saying the same \nthing:\n\n       Corn-based ethanol has distorted the corn market, and \n     stretched corn supplies to the point production costs have \n     increased significantly. Additionally, the current import \n     tariff on foreign sources of ethanol harms United States \n     consumers by retarding the development of a robust and \n     sustainable biofuels market.\n\n  That is a direct quote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis testimony following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Then there is a very long list in a letter to \nSenators Reid and McConnell from a couple dozen agencies, both \nagricultural and environmental, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record that letter as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Also, from the Western United Dairymen \nAssociation and from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do this not because I want to run through it all \nbut because I think it is evidentiary testimony to what is happening as \na result of what is very bad and egregious public policy. At a time of \ndebt and deficit,\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nwhere we are looking to find a compromise solution, which is going to \nbe very difficult. If we reach one, it will have a dramatic impact on \nthis Nation. To continue a program which has the potential to cost tens \nof billions of dollars makes no sense to me at all.\n  This summer, experts are predicting a mass slaughter of hogs. The \nUSDA predicts that U.S. corn reserves will sink to their lowest level \nsince the mid-1990s this summer, and rising food prices are \ncontributing to global poverty and instability. So we are faced with a \nvote today that is very simple. The vote says: End this trifecta of \nsubsidy, mandate, and protective tariff. It says: Do not wait for it to \nexpire at the end of the year, but do it as of July 1. If we do it as \nof July 1, we will produce approximately $2.7 billion to the Treasury \nto ameliorate debt and deficit. I think this is an easy $2.7 billion to \nsave.\n  Now, someone might say: Well, what are you doing to all of the \nproducers of ethanol? Shouldn't we protect them? Well, this has been \ngoing on for a very long time--since 2005. To have an industry develop \nthat then becomes dependent on this trifecta of subsidy, mandate, and \nprotective tariff is only going to increase costs in the future. I \nunderstand beginning an industry with some help, giving them a leg up, \ngiving them a toehold. That toehold becomes a foothold, and then they \ngo on their own. The ethanol industry instead wants a continuation of \nthe subsidy that effectively goes to the oil companies--the most \nprofitable industry in the United States--continue the subsidy, \ncontinue the mandate, and continue to protect ethanol.\n  You can be sure that if we don't do this now and we wait for it to \nend at the end of 2012, there will be a fight to continue it. We are \nall talking about saying no. We are all talking about that the time has \ncome when we have to do business differently. We have a lot of major \nproblems out there. We have a lot of people who need help. Would I \nrather help those people or would I rather help Big Oil do essentially \nwhat they are mandated to do anyway? The choice is easy. The choice is \nclear. Would I want to continue a high, protective tariff on the least \nenvironmentally friendly commodity, corn ethanol? It is not even algae. \nIt is not cellulosic. It is not sugar cane. It is the least \nenvironmentally friendly feedstock used to produce ethanol.\n  I have opposed this from the beginning because I am not that \nprescient, I just knew that once we started this it wasn't going to \nend. Once we started it, it was going to be more, more, more. That is \nthe beat. If we can sell it in the next few hours with the proposal \nthat meets the strictures of both sides of this great institution--we \nare trying to do that, but there are people who strongly believe it \nshould be ended quickly, and that is what this cloture vote this \nafternoon will show. It would be the first consequential vote of the \nSenate to say that major subsidies to oil companies, to do what they \nare mandated to do, have come to an end. Protective tariffs of the \nleast environmentally friendly source of ethanol will come to an end, \nand they will come to an end in a timely way. This is what the \ngovernment should be doing.\n  I would like to yield the floor at this time. I know this has been \ntough. The big surprise to me has been how emotional our caucus on the \nDemocratic side has been, and I understand the other side's caucus, the \nRepublican side, was emotional as well. This appears to be much more \nmajor than the legislation itself might signal. I am very hopeful we \nwill have 60 votes. That would send a very loud message from the \nSenate.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Coburn and Feinstein, The undersigned \n     livestock and poultry groups appreciate your leadership with \n     the introduction of ``The Ethanol Subsidy and Tariff Repeal \n     Act,'' which would end 30 years of tax credits for \n     conventional ethanol and end the tariff on imported ethanol \n     on July 1st.\n       At a time when animal agriculture is facing pressures on \n     many fronts, this legislation would ease the economic strain \n     that is heavily affecting the industries that rely so heavily \n     on corn to feed livestock and poultry. Corn-based ethanol has \n     distorted the corn market, and stretched corn supplies to the \n     point production costs have been increased significantly. \n     Additionally, the current import tariff on foreign sources of \n     ethanol harms U.S. consumers by retarding the development of \n     a robust and sustainable biofuels market.\n       If enacted, your legislation would save taxpayers nearly \n     $3.3 billion in 2011. Experts such as the Congressional \n     Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office have \n     already concluded that the subsidy is unnecessary and leading \n     economists agree that ending it would have little impact on \n     ethanol production, prices, or jobs.\n       This legislation will help American consumers by ending the \n     costly and unnecessary protection and subsidization of \n     converting corn into fuel. We applaud you for your leadership \n     on the issue and strongly encourage Congress to pass this \n     legislation promptly.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Meat Institute.\n     California Dairies, Inc.\n     National Chicken Council.\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n     National Meat Association.\n     National Pork Producers Council.\n     National Turkey Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n       My name Paul Cameron and I am a commercial cattle feeder \n     from the Imperial Valley. My company employs 32 hard working \n     men and women. Many of these employees are second and third \n     generation to the livestock business. Our cattle rely \n     primarily on Midwestern grown corn as their primary source \n     for grain. This year 41% of our nation's corn crop will be \n     used up by a heavily subsidized ethanol industry. In a year \n     where nationally our grain inventories have already been \n     reduced by adverse weather conditions, corn has risen in \n     price by 140%. Because of this, any chance of profitability \n     in all protein industries has vanished.\n       The cattle inventory in our own operation is being reduced \n     and we have already begun the process of laying off many of \n     our employees. Coming from a county with 27.9% unemployment \n     (April-EDD), these good, hard-working people will be \n     relegated to trying to find jobs where there are none. These \n     are the very people that take pride in the fact that they not \n     only feed a nation, but also feed the world.\n       Energy independence for our nation is vital, but the \n     production of abundant, safe, and healthy proteins for the \n     world's population is every bit as important. As cattle \n     producers nationwide, who have never asked for a subsidy of \n     any kind, we only ask that ethanol production stand on its \n     own and allow true supply and demand dictate the real price \n     of corn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                    June 13, 2011.\n     Hon.

Continuing to subsidize oil \n     companies to blend ethanol--which they are already required \n     to do by the Renewable Fuels Standard--is wasteful and \n     unnecessary.

Dianne Feinstein\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The plan to extend the ethanol \n     blenders tax credit and tariff in the tax package will add \n     significantly to the economic distress this country's dairy \n     farm families have experienced for the past two years. In \n     addition, if this plan goes forward, these incentives will \n     have been extended without debate while the country's deficit \n     and debt situation grows more alarming nearly every day and \n     responsible people disagree over the environmental benefits \n     of corn ethanol.\n       Producers are still reeling from low prices resulting from \n     the loss of export markets caused by the worldwide financial \n     crisis in late 2008. Throughout that time, dairy farmers' \n     production costs have remained very high. The erosion in \n     equity experienced by dairy farmers in this country over the \n     past 24 months is of staggering proportions.\n       Estimates are that the U.S. will use upwards of one-third \n     of the nation's corn crop to make ethanol this year, and that \n     was before the EPA recently increased the amount that can be \n     blended by 50%. The USDA now estimates this year's average \n     farm price for corn between $4.80 and $5.60/bushel. That is \n     up nearly 25% from the estimate just two months ago and \n     compares to the previous record of $4.20/bushel in 2007/08.\n       The blenders tax credit is also unnecessary. Mandates \n     requiring the use of renewable fuels will ensure significant \n     demand for corn ethanol for the foreseeable future.\n       Please oppose inclusion of corn ethanol incentives in the \n     tax package. An issue that is this costly, in so many ways, \n     deserves significant debate prior to a vote.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                          Michael L.H. Marsh, CPA,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Cattlemen's Beef Association]\n\n    NCBA Supports Legislation to End Ethanol Subsidy, Import Tariff\n\n       Washington (May 3, 2011).--National Cattlemen's Beef \n     Association (NCBA) President Bill Donald said the Ethanol \n     Subsidy and Tariff Repeal Act, which was introduced today by \n     U.S. Senators Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-\n     Calif.), would end 30 years and more than $30 billion of \n     taxpayer support for the corn-based ethanol industry and \n     would finally level the playing field for all commodities \n     relying on corn as a major input. The legislation would \n     repeal both the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) \n     and the tariff on imported ethanol by no later than June 30, \n     2011.\n       ``NCBA supports the development of renewable and \n     alternative fuels and we know ethanol plays a role in \n     reducing our dependence on foreign oil. However, we don't \n     support forcing taxpayers to prop up an industry that should \n     be able to stand on its own two feet,'' said Donald who is \n     also a cattleman from Melville, Mont. ``Senators Coburn and \n     Feinstein should be commended for their leadership on this \n     issue and for introducing this commonsense legislation that \n     will not only level the playing field for a bushel of corn \n     but will also save taxpayers more than $6 billion annually.''\n       Donald said the VEETC and the ethanol import tariff put \n     other end-users of corn, including cattlemen and women, at a \n     severe competitive disadvantage. From December 2007 to \n     February 2010, the cattle feeding sector of the beef industry \n     lost a record $7 billion in equity due to high feed costs and \n     economic factors that have negatively affected beef demand. \n     Between 2005 and 2008, corn prices quadrupled, reaching a \n     record high of $8 a bushel and are more than $7 a bushel \n     today. Donald said this volatility in the marketplace was a \n     result of ethanol mandates and subsidies artificially pushing \n     feed costs higher.\n       ``It's no secret that supplies are tight. In fact, the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture has predicted ethanol will account \n     for 40 percent of this year's corn crop. All we are asking is \n     to compete head-to-head for a bushel of corn. That's what \n     this legislation will accomplish,'' Donald said. ``The \n     federal government shouldn't be in the business of picking \n     winners and losers. We urge all senators to take a stand on \n     the side of good government and support this legislation.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from \nCalifornia, many of the points she made are valid. I came back for the \npurpose of addressing our overspending and that involves all kinds of \ntax expenditures and all kinds of subsidies. It is necessary because of \nour current debt and deficit situation. We have to get control of this. \nIt is the only reason I ran. It is the only reason I am back in the \nSenate, with a commitment from the people of Indiana who supported me \nthat, yes, this is what needs to be done in Washington. So I am not \nhere to criticize the efforts of Senator Coburn or Senator Feinstein \nand others to begin to address these subsidies. That is exactly what we \nneed to do.\n  I think the phrase of the Senator from California: ``This is what we \nare doing in a timely way,'' goes to the heart and the essence of where \nI believe we need to go. We have subsidized, for some valid reasons \nearly on, the production of ethanol. We did that because we said we are \nnot independent in terms of our energy production, and our dependence \non oil--particularly Middle Eastern oil. Our dependence is not only \ncostly to us from the standpoint of OPEC setting the price of oil \nworldwide, based on their output, but also from the standpoint that we \nhave spent a lot of money in blood and treasure to continue this \ndependence on oil, by placing troops in the Middle East. Would anybody \nthink we would pay nearly as much attention to the Middle East as we \nare now were it not for the fact the oil supply that comes from there \nis absolutely necessary for our economy and the world economy? I think \neveryone in this Chamber would say we want less dependence on foreign \nsources and more independence. So the production of homegrown energy \nout of corn or other products grown in the soil which can be converted \nto a form of energy, so we-use less foreign oil and more of our own \nresources to drive our trucks and cars and fuel our planes, is a valid \ngoal.\n  To get that started--I wasn't here--but Congress passed a set of \nsubsidies in order to encourage that industry. On the basis of that, \nStates, private entities, public-private partnerships committed to move \nforward with production of ethanol. We are at a point now where there \nis essentially agreement that this subsidy has to be phased out, taken \naway, and the producers of ethanol agree. Maybe it is a political \nreality or for whatever reason.\n  As I spoke to ethanol producers across my State, I basically said we \ncannot continue this subsidy in our current situation of debt. It has \nalways been designed to become economically feasible, and it would be \nrelated to the price of oil. Well, the price of oil has gone up. This \ngives ethanol producers a more level playing field.\n  The problem many of us from the Midwest have--but I will only speak \nfor myself--many of us from corn-growing and ethanol-producing States--\nand Indiana, by the way, is one of the leading States in the Nation, \nproducing a significant percentage of ethanol--is that this amendment \nbasically says it is over now. A bipartisan group has come together \naround a transition proposal Senator Thune has put forward. I am all \nfor a straight up-or-down vote on the best way to eliminate this \nsubsidy and to phase it out completely. I can't imagine anybody here \nwould think, as we address Tax Code expenditures, that there wouldn't \nbe a transition process in place for eliminating that expenditure for \nan industry or for an individual in the United States.\n  I joined Senator Wyden, a Democrat, in a bipartisan effort for \ncomprehensive tax reform. Our proposal basically eliminates most of the \nspecial provisions in the tax code, totaling almost $1 trillion. We \ntake away these specialized tax provisions in a way to reduce rates and \nmake our companies more competitive, lower individual rates and \nsimplify the Tax Code. But, we know that in doing so, there has to be a \ntransition period. We cannot just yank away from the private sector or \nthe public-private sector an economic basis on which they went forward \nand committed to that particular entity and product. So all we are \nasking for is a transition process.\n  I know there is talk about giving Members a vote next week on this \nproposal and so forth. I don't blame Senator Coburn and Senator \nFeinstein one bit for using a procedural rule--actually, Senator \nFeinstein did not do that and did not support that and I think deserves \na second vote. I don't fault Senator Coburn for using procedural \nmethods which were maybe not necessarily something of precedent, but it \nis possible under our procedures to do what was done in order to get \nhis vote on the floor. He has been asking for that vote for weeks, if \nnot months. It is an issue we ought to be debating. But there ought to \nbe a debate--an honest debate--between essentially the two sides of \nthis issue, both of which agree the subsidy ought to be removed; one of \nwhich says we remove it today on this vote, the other says we remove it \nover a period of time--3 years or so. We take the money immediately \nsaved and donate it to reducing the deficit,\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nbut we take some of the money in order to transition away from the \nsubsidy, which is what Senator Thune is trying to do without getting \ninto all the details, which I don't need to do.\n  What I am here to do is to plead for an opportunity to debate both \nsides of this; to have a vote on the Coburn amendment and a vote on the \nThune legislation, winner take all--that is the way it works here--and \nlet the chips fall where they may. But at least we will have had an \nhonest debate about two alternatives to try to reach the same goal. One \ntakes a longer period of time than the other. The Senate will vote and \nthe yeas will be yeas and the nays will be nays and the yeas will \nprevail and we will move forward on that basis. All we have now is a \npromise that maybe we will give the Senate an opportunity to bring \nsomething up next week so we can vote on the phaseout program.\n  Some Members will say: Hey, this is great. I can vote for both, and \nthen I can go home and say, yes, we need to eliminate the subsidy and \nthat is why I voted for Senator Coburn's amendment. Then I can also say \nthe following week I voted for Senator Thune. One of these should work. \nWe have it both ways.\n  We should make a distinction between which way we want to go and what \nwe want to do. I happen to choose, for I think valid reasons, that we \nought to transition out of this because of the enormous financial \ncommitment made on the part of ethanol producers in my State, and the \nenormous benefit that has come to our agriculture sector which has \ngrown a lot of corn and paid a lot of taxes, helping our economy grow. \nBut to just yank it away from them right away because we say this has \nto be done right now without any transition, I don't think it is fair \nto all those who have made that commitment.\n  Does ethanol need to be economically viable to compete with other \nforms of energy? Yes. Did it need--and I wasn't here, again, but this \nbody of Congress, including the administration, said it needed a head \nstart so we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and they gave \nthem that in the form of these subsidies and in the form of a tariff \nand in the form of some credits. Financially, have we come to the point \nwhere we now need to look at this, as well as hundreds of other \nsubsidies and tax expenditures that we simply can no longer afford? The \nanswer is, yes, we have come to that point. But is the best way to do \nthis, particularly in this instance, where there is more than just an \ninterest for one or two companies, which we find in so much of the Tax \nCode. There is a national security interest in this as well. Our \nmilitary says our continued dependence on foreign sources of oil is a \nnational security issue affecting our troops, affecting our \nexpenditures, affecting our deployments, where these people need to go \nto keep the ceilings open, to keep the oil flowing, and so forth?\n  So there is a national basis on which we need to have competing forms \nof energy that can lessen our dependence, and ethanol is one of those. \nDoes it need to be economically viable? Absolutely. How do we get \nthere? We can get there by pulling the rug out from them now, shutting \nit down, and seeing a precipitous drop in ethanol production because it \nis no longer economically viable or, as Senator Thune has tried to do \nand a coalition of us who support that, we can put in place a sensible \nway to reduce this subsidy to zero, to bring ethanol to a point of \neconomic viability on its own and immediately send a significant \namount--$1 billion--to reduce the deficit. So this could be a \ntransition to allow ethanol to be an economically viable part of our \nability to provide transportation energy without having to call up the \nMiddle East and say: Keep sending it and, by the way, we will send our \ntroops, we will send our money, we will send our treasure because we \nabsolutely have to have this to drive our economy.\n  I think there is compelling reason to allow the Thune amendment to be \nheard on the floor, to give Members an opportunity to debate and make \ntheir case on each side, take a vote, and we will let the chips fall \nwhere they may. But we will at least have had the courage to stand up \nand honestly say: This is where I come down, this is what I stand for, \nand then the voters can decide whether they like that. But I think it \nmakes sense from an economic standpoint and from an energy independence \nstandpoint. Also, it is common sense that anybody who has been \nencouraged by this body to invest in this product to reduce our \ndependence on oil, to at least give them a chance to phase this thing \ndown so they don't necessarily put a padlock on the refining plants and \nbasically put them out of business. That doesn't achieve the goal--the \nvery reason this body put these enhancements and subsidies in place in \nthe first place.\n  Conclusion: We need to phase out the subsidy. There are other \nsubsidies and other expenditures out there we can eliminate now without \nhaving this kind of adverse economic effect and without having a \nnegative effect on our national security, but this is not one of them.\n  I urge my colleagues and I urge the leadership to allow the pleas of \nSenator Thune and others of us to be heard so we have an honest debate, \nan honest choice, and then we accept the results.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that I could briefly respond to \nthe Senator's comments. Senator Coats and I work together on \nIntelligence. I have great respect for him. I understand the regional \nissues involved, so I understand the Senator's thinking. My thinking \nis, we get a strong vote on this today. This is simply a cloture vote. \nWe have 60 votes. We have some time to see if we can work something \nout.\n  One thing I have learned in this whole line of pursuit is, if you \ngive your word, keep it. The only thing you have is your integrity, and \nI give you my word that we will continue to try to bring both sides \ntogether.\n  I know this is a long journey. I know we will be blue-slipped and we \nhave to come back and we will have to have a bill we can put a tax \nmatter on. That is for a later day. I think we are into this, and so \nmany people want kind of a clean vote, that if we have that, I am \nprepared to give you my word to continue to try to discuss this.\n  My own view on these things is to do the very best we can, try to \nreach a compromise when issues are like this, and march on to the next \nthing. This has become far harder than I anticipated. I think we are \nrelatively close to a solution, to a compromise. Whether Senator Coburn \nwill accept it, I do not know. But I know these discussions are going \non, and all I can do is pledge you my best effort to try to get to \nsomething that satisfies everybody.\n  If you come from a large ethanol-producing State, I understand what \nthis means. On the other hand, I also understand this is going to be \nthe first of many coming down the line. We have to change the way we do \nbusiness if we are going to carry out the mandate of a prudent \ngovernment, we have to make a lot of changes. None of it is going to be \neasy, so we might as well get used to it now. But for whatever it is \nworth, you have my word I will continue to try.\n  Mr. COATS. Well, Mr. President, if the Senator would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I accept that fully. Having had the opportunity to work \nwith Senator Feinstein on the Intelligence Committee, I do not hesitate \nfor a second to accept her word and know she will keep it. It has been \na pleasure to work with her on that committee. We spend many hours \nbehind closed doors discussing issues of great importance to this \ncountry, and she has provided great leadership in that effort.\n  I will look forward to working with the Senator from California, \naccept fully her offer. Hopefully, we can find a good solution to this \nissue. I could not agree with Senator Feinstein more that this is the \nfirst of many things, tough decisions we are going to have to make. If \nwe are not flexible in making these decisions at this time of clear \nfiscal distress, we are going to be judged very harshly by the markets \nand by\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\nour constituents. They know we are spending too much. They know we need \nto make decisions, some of which will be painful. We are trying to do \nthis in a way that does not become Draconian, and I appreciate the \nwords of the Senator from California in terms of the willingness to sit \ndown together and work this through.\n  As the Senator said, this will be the first of many difficult days \nahead. But what is encouraging and ought to be encouraging to the \nAmerican people is, there is a bipartisan commitment--first of all, a \nbipartisan understanding of the plight we are in--I wish we were not \nhere, but we are--and a bipartisan understanding, a growing bipartisan \nunderstanding, that working together is the only solution to this. \nBecause if it becomes stalemate, we are doing a great disservice to the \nfuture prosperity of the country and its impact on future generations, \nincluding our current generation and the many people who are out of \nwork who need an economic recovery to take place sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments and look forward to working with \nher, along with others, in this, the first of probably many difficult \nbut important and necessary discussions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein \namendment that would eliminate at long last the subsidies for ethanol, \ncorn-based ethanol in America. In a little while, we are going to have \na chance to vote, and I would ask my colleagues to support the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  I thank the leader for making time on the calendar so we can vote on \nthis issue, and I hope a majority will support this amendment. I know \nwe have a 60-vote threshold, and I hope we would be able to express, at \nlong last, that it is time to eliminate this subsidy.\n  This is an issue that has brought together an unusual and broad-based \nsupport among those who are seeking to eliminate this subsidy. We have \ntaxpayer advocates who understand this is a subsidy that taxpayers \nshould not be underwriting. We have hunger and development \norganizations which recognize the impact on ethanol on the corn crop is \naffecting the affordability of food not only here, but it is having a \nmajor impact around our entire country.\n  We have agricultural groups, including the Maryland poultry growers \nand integrators, who support the repeal of the subsidy for ethanol. \nThat is because the poultry industry understands the impact the ethanol \nsubsidies are having on the poultry industry. I will talk a little bit \nmore about that.\n  We have free market groups that say: Look, let the market work. There \nis no need for us to interfere with the free market. We have religious \norganizations. We have environmental groups--and I will talk a little \nbit more about that--that although the ethanol subsidy was originally \nput on, we thought, for a positive environmental impact, it is having \nthe reverse impact. Because of the amount of energy that is necessary \nto produce ethanol, all the good we thought was being done has been \nlost.\n  Then we have those who are budget hawks who are saying: Look, we are \nbeing asked to do a lot to bring the budget into balance. There are a \nlot of hard decisions. Why don't we at least eliminate these \nunnecessary subsidies in an attempt to bring our budget more into \nbalance?\n  The wide range of interest groups supporting this issue has fostered \nwide bipartisan support for repealing this credit for ethanol. So we \nhave an opportunity to bring together a lot of different groups, to \nwork across party lines, to start the process, to bring our \nagricultural programs into better balance, to have a better energy \npolicy, to help create jobs, and also to deal with our budget deficit.\n  According to the GAO, this credit ``is a wasteful and duplicative'' \nfederally funded support program for an industry that already enjoys a \nmandated market share under the renewable fuels standard.\n  Since 2006, the renewable fuels standard has required oil companies \nto blend increasing amounts of ethanol into our gasoline. So when we \nrepeal this credit, when we repeal the break the ethanol industry \nreceives, it will not impact on the market from the point of view of \nthe amount of ethanol that will be available.\n  Especially during times of fiscal constraint, it simply does not make \nsense to continue giving billions of dollars to a robust and thriving \nindustry from which American consumers see little benefit.\n  We have a huge budget deficit. The Presiding Officer understands \nthat. I understand that. The people of Ohio, the people of Maryland \nunderstand that. We need to look at ways we can bring the budget \ndeficit down. Repealing unnecessary subsidies should clearly be at the \ntop of our list.\n  With more than 40 percent of America's corn crop going into fuel, the \nincreased demand has made feed extraordinarily expensive.\n  Let me share with you what I have heard from my poultry farmers on \nthe Eastern Shore of Maryland. The poultry industry is an important \npart of the economic fiber of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The \npoultry industry translates into jobs for people who live on the \nEastern Shore of Maryland. It is extremely important. Yet the single \nlargest cost factor for the poultry industry is the corn feed that goes \ninto producing the poultry--feeding the chickens.\n  With such a high cost factor, the arbitrary demand factor for corn as \na result of ethanol has raised the cost of producing poultry in my \nState, costing us jobs. The elimination of this subsidy will help us \nmaintain and expand jobs in the State of Maryland and around the \nregion.\n  While corn-based ethanol may be a homegrown fuel, it is an extremely \nenergy and water resource-intensive process to produce. So where we \nthought we were producing an energy source that would be favorable to \nour Nation, it takes so much energy to produce the ethanol that at the \nend of the day, we have used imported energy to produce our own \nhomegrown energy source, and we do not benefit from the point of view \nof having energy independence in America.\n  The energy savings are minimal when you take into consideration how \nmuch energy it takes to produce ethanol, not to mention that ethanol \nburns less efficiently in our engines than regular fuel, and the higher \nthe concentration, the fewer the miles per gallon the driver gets. The \nresult is, we use more energy, when we were trying to save energy. It \ndoes not make sense over the long term.\n  A tax break for ethanol is a gift to the oil companies and the grain \nproducers--a gift that actually harms American consumers and our \nenvironment.\n  Corn is a staple food commodity that is found in millions of American \nproducts from food additives to livestock feed. More than one-third of \nour Nation's corn is now going into the production of ethanol.\n  So this is causing a problem in our food stock--the amount of corn \nthat goes into ethanol in America. It is time we eliminate this \narbitrary subsidy that is causing a disruption, making it more \ndifficult for people to afford their basic products.\n  The increased demand for corn is raising the price of everything from \neggs to milk to soft drinks to chicken to breakfast cereals, and it is \nthe American consumer who is being hit the hardest with these higher \nfood prices.\n  Using corn to make ethanol also harms our environment. Once corn is \nharvested, it is a costly and energy-intensive process to turn it into \nethanol fuel fit for commercial sale. We need to develop sustainable, \nrenewable biofuels--those that are not derived from a food-based \ncommodity such as corn--to make our Nation less dependent on foreign \nenergy sources.\n  I support developing the next generation of algae or cellulosic \nbiofuels. I do not support providing billions of dollars for a fuel \nproduct that is driving up the cost of food, harming our environment, \nand doing little to reduce our\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nconsumption of foreign oil. It is time we stop subsidizing Big Oil to \nproduce a fuel they will produce with or without an additional $6 \nbillion a year of subsidy.\n  I hope my colleagues also support the Feinstein amendment that would \neliminate this subsidy so we can eliminate this unnecessary subsidy, \nhelp make food more affordable for the people of our Nation, and help \nus develop an energy policy that does make sense for America, that will \nhelp our security and help our economy.\n  For all of those reasons, I will support the Feinstein amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on behalf of a \nCoburn-Feinstein amendment that we will be voting on later. It is rare \nthat people in this country who are receiving a tax credit tell us, as \nservants of the United States, that they do not want the tax credit \nthey are receiving.\n  I think most people in this room are aware that we are spending about \n$6 billion a year on something called a blenders tax credit. My \nunderstanding is that the blenders who receive this tax credit have \nshared with us that this is a waste of money, and they would like for \nthis to end.\n  So we have an amendment today--and it is at an especially fortunate \ntime for us, at a time when we are having tremendous fiscal issues in \nthis country--we have an amendment before us today to do away with this \ntax credit, which seems to me to be only something of common sense.\n  I think most people in America know that years ago in Congress we \npassed a mandate that requires a certain amount of ethanol to be used. \nSo this mandate is already in place. This mandate forces the use of a \ncertain number of gallons of ethanol in this country. But on top of \nthat, our country is now paying 45 cents for every gallon that is \nblended. Those people who receive this have told us this is \nunnecessary, that it is a waste of taxpayer money and they do not want \nit.\n  So the Coburn-Feinstein amendment does away with it. It also does \naway with a tariff--importers that import ethanol into our country now \npay a tariff--which actually raises the price of ethanol. It actually \nraises what people are now paying at the pump because they have to pay \na tariff to import this into our country. It does away with that \ntariff.\n  So this is a very commonsense amendment. I certainly thank Senator \nCoburn and Senator Feinstein for offering this amendment at a time when \nour country is in such financial straits. It is rare that we have \nsomething like this, again, where those people who actually receive \nthis credit would like to do away with it.\n  I know it has been argued that at the end of this last year we all \nvoted for certain tax issues. That is an interesting argument--except \nwhat happens at the end of the year is, we do these en masse. There are \nminor provisions within this package that we have no opportunity to \ntake out. So here this massive group of tax credits comes to us, and we \nhave to vote up or down on a package of them. That is huge and has all \nkinds of tax provisions in it.\n  So there are some people in this body who have said: Well, but we \njust voted this in place. Well, we voted a package in place, but many \nof us for years have argued that this tax credit is redundant. We have \nargued that it is a waste of taxpayer money. We have argued that with \nthe mandates in place there is absolutely no need for this, and the \ntariff that goes along with this, where we pay for imported ethanol. We \npay more because of this tariff. It is absolutely a burden to American \nconsumers and certainly, again, to taxpayers.\n  I thank the Senators for offering this amendment. I look forward to \nsupporting it. This is one of those amendments--sometimes we vote on \nthings down here that, candidly, are rather mundane. This is one of \nthose amendments that I not only support, I support with tremendous \nenthusiasm and energy. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this very commonsense amendment that does something that is \nresponsible for consumers; that does something that is responsible for \ntaxpayers; and, obviously, will make our country stronger if it passes. \nI have a sense it may.\n  I urge those on the Senate floor to please consider it if they are \nnow middle ground and have not made a decision.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have spoken on this earlier in the week. \nI will not spend a great deal of time today. Thanks to the majority \nleader, we will have two votes this afternoon on items that I think are \nrepresentative of critical problems in our country.\n  The first is a vote on an amendment by Senator Feinstein and myself \nthat eliminates payment to the largest refining and oil companies in \nthis country to blend ethanol, which they have honestly admitted--and \nthey sent us a letter saying it--they don't want.\n  The second is on whether we will subsidize, with Federal tax dollars, \nadditional pumps to use ethanol.\n  The reason the votes are important is because the way we get out of \ntrouble as a nation is a couple of billion dollars at a time. We have a \nFederal mandate that says X amount of fuel has to be blended with \nethanol every year. That will rise to 22 billion gallons in 2015. So \nthere is no reason for us to pay somebody to blend it when they already \nhave to, and we have seen the shift in the industry from small entities \nto the very large. When this program started, it was about less than a \nbillion dollars in cost. It will now be, on an annualized basis, around \n$6 billion. While we are running a $1.6 trillion deficit, we need every \npenny we can get. So I am thankful this has been brought up. But it \nbegs the larger question--actually there are two. One, can we trust \nmarkets--real markets--to work more effectively than Washington \nmandating and dictating policies?\n  Throughout our history--if you look at it in total--no government can \never do any allocation of scarce resources as well as the market can. \nThe markets are not perfect. There is no question, they make mistakes \nand cause occasional shortages. But overall, in the long run, markets \nwork much better than a bureaucratic Soviet-style mandate of what we \nwill do and what price we will pay for it.\n  The second question it begs is, what is our country's energy policy? \nWe send a quarter of a trillion dollars a year outside this country for \noil and gas, liquids and natural gas. That is a quarter of a trillion \ndollars that we could invest here and pay for our own resources.\n  We are the only nation in the world where our resources are owned by \nthe citizens and our own government limits our ability to utilize it.\n  The CRS just finished a study that shows that the oil and gas \nreserves in the United States are greater than that of Saudi Arabia, \nChina, and Canada combined. So the question is, why aren't we using \nours, rather than sending money overseas and undermining our own \neconomy and not creating jobs?\n  The projections are that if we would truly utilize our resources, we \ncould create close to 190,000 jobs a year in the exploration and energy \nbusiness--without subsidies, without tax credits; that is what would be \nthe result. With oil near $100 a barrel, and we continue to send the \nmoney out of the country instead of going after our own resources, \nwhich are plentiful, we have to ask the question, what are we doing?\n  The final point I will make is, when you buy ethanol-blended gasoline \nand you look at the price and you see, here is regular that has no \nethanol in it, and here is ethanol-blended gasoline that is about 20 or \n25 cents cheaper, it is important that the American people understand \nthat you need to add $1.72 to that to get the real price you are paying \nfor that blended gasoline, because that is what your government has put \ninto the pipeline in the way of loans,\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\ngrants, subsidies, blenders credits, and taxes on imported ethanol. So \neven though it looks cheaper, it is not. It is about $1.40 more, when \nyou look at all the costs taken from you as a taxpayer and put into the \npipeline and given to the special interests, in terms of what we will \nhave, and where we will have it, and when we will have it.\n  I support ethanol alternative fuel, especially now that it has 7\\1/2\\ \npercent of our market. But the best way for ethanol to survive is for \nit to stand on its own two feet, without subsidies, without us spending \ndollars we don't have to get something that we are going to get anyway.\n  I am extremely pleased with my discussions with Senator Reid. I am \nthankful to Senator Cardin, as well as Senator Feinstein. She has been \nworking on this for a long time. She opposed this when it started. She \nrecognizes that what we have actually done is not help ourselves that \nmuch. We have markedly increased the cost of food. We can say 40 \npercent of the corn crop this last year went for ethanol, and corn is \nat historic highs. When you look at a poultry producer or beef producer \nor pork producer or lamb producer or turkey producer or milk producer \nor egg producer, their largest cost has doubled because of this policy.\n  Quite frankly, America is lucky because the worldwide demand for \ngrains--given our wonderful farm community and their ability to \nproduce--is extremely high and our farmers are extremely efficient. So \nthis policy will not affect farm prices significantly right now. But, \nhopefully, in the future it will bring them down to a more moderate \nlevel.\n  Two-and-a-half years ago, corn was at $3 a bushel and most corn \nfarmers made money. It is now above $7, even though their input costs \nhave risen somewhat with the increase of oil prices. The farms in our \ncountry that raise grains have never been in better shape--if they can \nget a crop in. I know we have areas in the country where that hasn't \nhappened.\n  So I think overall we are starting to address some of the misdirected \ncapital formation in this country by backing off on government picking \nof winners and losers, and I am thankful for the opportunity to speak \non that.\n  I yield the floor, as I see the Senator from Iowa is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ncompletion of my remarks, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, be \nrecognized for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I strongly oppose both the amendment \noffered by Senators Feinstein and Coburn and the one offered by Senator \nMcCain that we will be voting on in a couple of hours.\n  My message today is very simple: This assault on America's ethanol \nindustry is both misguided and undeserved. This is truly a homegrown \nindustry built on the investment and labor of many thousands of \nAmericans providing a product that helps us with one of our most \npressing national issues--our dependency on imported oil. Yet here we \nare debating amendments that I think clearly tell the industry: You \naren't important, you don't matter, and you don't have the support of \nthe American people. I think that is not only the wrong message but a \nmisguided message to be sending, and I will tell you why.\n  We have been struggling with our dependency on oil for almost 40 \nyears. One of our strategies over that period of time has been to \ndevelop and commercialize biofuels. I am proud to have been involved \nfrom the beginning and I continue to this day to be a strong advocate \nfor renewable biofuels produced from domestic feedstocks. We started \nworking on this, as I said, over 30 years ago. It has been a long \ncampaign, but it has been a remarkably successful campaign when you \nthink about it. It took about 20 years for ethanol to get to the point \nof contributing just a few percent to our gasoline supply. In the past \n10 years, biofuels, and particularly ethanol have gotten to the point \nwhere they now displace about 10 percent of our gasoline supply. Think \nabout that: 10 percent of our gasoline supply, used basically for \ntransportation, is displaced by biofuels. I think that is a remarkable \nachievement. No other alternative supply comes close.\n  In fact, no alternative supply provides even 1 percent of our \ndomestic fuel demand. Let me repeat that: No other alternative to \nethanol comes even close to displacing 1 percent of imported oil. Yet \nethanol is displacing 10 percent today. Again, a remarkable \nachievement.\n  Our oil dependency problem is still with us. We still depend on it \nfrom many nations that are unstable or unfriendly to us, and it is \ngetting worse. Oil imports are costing us on average, over the last few \nyears, about $100 per barrel.\n  I know many of my colleagues share my strong concern about oil \nimports and the need to find alternatives, and that is why we passed \nnew CAFE standards in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. \nThat is why we adopted a mandate for renewable biofuels in that same \nbill--a mandate for their use. Going back further, that is why we began \nproviding tax incentives for biofuels production already in the 1970s. \nThat is why we promoted alternative fuels in the 1991 Energy bill. That \nis why many of us today are promoting hybrid and electric vehicles. And \nthat is why we need to continue to support the production of ethanol \nand other domestic biofuels.\n  Just as increasing efficiency standards have been a big success in \nreducing demand, promoting biofuels has been, by far, our biggest \nsuccess on the supply side. They have gone from a few percent at the \nturn of the century to about, as I said, 10 percent today. Moreover, \nlooking ahead, the most likely supply-side alternative to displace the \nnext 10 percent of our gasoline demand is biofuels. Again, we \nrecognized this fact in 2007 when we adopted the renewable fuels \nstandard 2 RFS2--that requires 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022--\n36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022.\n  Now, again, we should pay attention to the options. Let's promote \nalternatives, such as electric vehicles. I am all for that. But we \nshould also make sure, since we are going to be using liquid fuels for \nmost of our transportation fleet in the next 10, 20 years and beyond \nthat we look at the biofuels. It is renewable--renewable and clean. Our \nbiofuels challenge isn't production or even economics; our challenge is \nadapting our transportation markets, our fuel markets, to be able to \nutilize the biofuels.\n  Again, as I said, most of our biofuels are in the form of ethanol. \nThat will continue to be our principal biofuel for many years to come. \nHowever, today we can only displace 10 percent of our gasoline in the \nform of a 10-percent blend of ethanol. It is called E10. You can go to \nyour gas stations--and my friend from Oklahoma was referring to the \nethanol blends, which is what we have today--and those are limited. \nMost of it is E10. Again, we need to be able to use higher blends--15 \npercent, 20 percent, even as high as 85 percent of ethanol.\n  In fact, in my State, and in our neighboring State to the north, \nMinnesota, we are beginning to see pumps called E85--85 percent of the \nfuel that comes out of it is ethanol, and only 15 percent is gasoline. \nQuite frankly, the flexible-fuel cars run just fine on that 85 percent \nblend. The problem is we need more blender pumps at our filling \nstations. We don't have them, but we need them. We have them in a few \nStates, but very few States have blender pumps. So we need to pass a \nbill like S. 187, the Biofuels Market Expansion Act, which I introduced \nin January.\n  I remember a few years ago that Senator Lugar and I had a meeting in \nthe Ag Committee room. We had the major oil companies come in to ask \nthem why they didn't put more blender pumps in their fuel stations. \nTheir answer was very clear and very logical.\n  They said: Well, why would we take up valuable space in our filling \nstations for a blender pump when there are almost no flexible-fuel cars \nout there that could use it? Point well taken.\n  So after that we called in the automobile companies. I know we had \nChrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, I believe there was, and we asked them: Why \ndon't you make more flexible-fuel cars? The response, from their \nviewpoint, was very logical: Why should we build more flexible-fuel \ncars when there aren't any blender pumps out there? Point well taken.\n  So here we have the chicken and the egg dilemma. The oil companies \nsay\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\nthey don't want to put in blender pumps with no flex-fuel cars out \nthere, and the automobile manufacturers say they don't want to build \nflex-fuel cars because there are no blender pumps.\n  I might point out that in Brazil almost every car built by Ford, by \nGM, by Honda, or Toyota--those built in Brazil--are basically built for \nflexible fuel. They will burn anything from 10 to 20 to 50 to 85 \npercent--actually, in Brazil, up to 100 percent--of ethanol. That is \nthe direction we need to go here.\n  With these two amendments today, we find ourselves going in exactly \nthe wrong direction. The Feinstein-Coburn amendment tells the ethanol \nindustry that it no longer has the support of Congress. The McCain \namendment would block one of the most critical things we need to do; \nthat is, the installation of flexible-fuel pumps.\n  I have said many times that we can reform our biofuels policy. I am \nmore than willing to give up the ethanol tax credit. I have said that \nbefore on the Senate floor. We can give up the ethanol tax credit if \nthe ethanol industry has access to the market. But when we take the two \namendments together, one pulls the rug out from underneath the ethanol \nindustry in terms of its tax credits--and I am saying: OK, fine. That \nis fine. We can do that, if we have access. Then the McCain amendment \ncomes along and says: No, no, you can't use any of the funds we have \nput in the last Ag bill--which had tremendous bipartisan support, I \nmight add--for blender pumps at fuel stations.\n  So here we have it. Tell the ethanol industry it can't get the tax \ncredits, and guess what. We are going to keep them from getting access \nto the marketplace. That is what we need--market access for ethanol. \nYou can go to Exxon and Mobile and Shell and all those gas stations. Do \nyou think they want to put in an ethanol pump? They are OK with 10 \npercent--they will do the 10 percent now--but we need them to put in \nthose blender pumps, and the automobile companies need to produce cars \nthat are flexible fueled. They do a few of them now, but every car \nbuilt ought to be flexible fuel so people can choose.\n  As I have said, ethanol can stand on its own two feet now, if people \nhave the right and the freedom and the ability to use it. But if we are \nup against monopolistic kinds of filling stations that won't permit a \nblender pump to be put in, then ethanol has no marketplace.\n  We also need to build a dedicated pipeline for ethanol. The oil \ncompanies and the gas companies have their own pipelines. They would \nnot put any ethanol through those pipelines. They say it is due to \nwater and all that, but let's face it. They won't put any ethanol \nthrough their pipelines. The private sector can build--not the \ngovernment but the private sector--and is willing and ready to build a \ndedicated pipeline from the Midwest to the east coast. A couple of \ncompanies have already secured most of the rights-of-way and are ready \nto go. All they need is one simple thing: a loan guarantee. They do not \nneed money, just a simple loan guarantee so they know they can build \nthe pipeline and that the ethanol industry can use it and get the fuel \nto the east coast, where the majority of our population is right now \nand where we don't have enough ethanol in our major population centers.\n  So, again, we need to redouble our national commitment to expanding \nthe use of renewable energy and weaning ourselves off of imported oil. \nBut we are not going to do it with these two amendments today. The \nethanol industry just wants the marketplace to be able to accept it, \nand they will stand on their own two feet. They can do that. That is \nmore important than the tax subsidies.\n  I might also add, I remember debating this issue with the then-\nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. We had a lot of debates on the Senate \nfloor back in the 1980s or 1990s, I guess, on this issue.\n  I pointed out at that time that if you talk about the tax credits and \nsupport from the government the ethanol industry has gotten, it pales \nin comparison to the dozens of years of tax writeoffs and benefits we \nhave given the oil companies in America going clear back to about 1920.\n  If you think about all the tax benefits we have given the oil \ncompanies in America to drill, to produce, to ship, to pipe, to refine, \nto market, and add it all up, ethanol is just a small part of that. But \nthe oil companies have never given up. They have never given up on \ntheir assault on ethanol and on biofuels.\n  The Coburn amendment is precipitous. At the end of the year, the \nethanol tax credits are going to expire. Hopefully, before the end of \nthe year, we will reach some agreement, work out something where we \nhave more access to the marketplace, and then we can do away with the \ntax credits. But we should not take an action that would slash the \nvalue of the ethanol industry's primary product by nearly 20 percent \novernight.\n  Think about it this way. We have a 1-year extension of the ethanol \ntax credits that goes to the end of this year. We did that. The \nCongress did that. We said that to the industry. Investors have come \nin, modifications in plants have been made, plants have been built. Yet \nin the middle of the year we are going to say no? We are going to take \nit away?\n  To all my friends over there who keep talking about the private \nsector and how we need the private sector and don't need the \ngovernment, you are going to pull the rug out from underneath the \nprivate sector on a guarantee that we gave them earlier this year. No \nindustry could survive a shock such as that, and it is wrong. It is \nwrong to do that at this point in time.\n  We all know one thing. This afternoon, people can come down and vote \nagainst ethanol, vote against the tax credits for the ethanol industry, \nvote to cut off marketplace access to ethanol, but nothing is going to \nhappen. The House will blue-slip it, and then we will be on to doing \nwhat needs to be done in a logical way; that is, to reduce the tax \ncredits for ethanol, which I am in favor of doing. In fact, we then can \npromote market access.\n  Senator Lugar and I, in the past, have worked on bills together, \nbasically like the bill introduced this year, that would do three \nthings: It would mandate a certain proportion of blender pumps be \ninstalled at the large gasoline stations, those that are owned by the \nmajor oil companies. It would provide tax credits to the small mom-and-\npop stations that would put in the blender pump in their station, the \nindependents. Third, it would mandate a gradual increase over the next \nfew years of the number of cars produced in America and sold in America \nthat are flexible fueled. If we do all those things, ethanol will stand \non its own two feet.\n  I wished to say one last thing before I yield the floor to the \nSenator and that is this. Right now, much is made of the fact that \nthere is $5 billion of tax credits this year going to the ethanol \nindustry. I understand that. However, because of the lower price of \nethanol, because we are blending 10 percent ethanol into gasoline, all \nthe people in America today are paying less for their gasoline than \nthey otherwise would if we didn't have ethanol. So if you take that \ninto account, the fact that the consumers of America, when they fill \ntheir gas tank, are paying less than they would if they didn't have \nethanol, that more than offsets the $5 billion we have put into the tax \ncredits for ethanol support.\n  So, yes, we have supported the ethanol industry with $5 billion. I \ndare say, we have gotten back probably twice as much as that in savings \nat the gas pump for the consumers of America.\n  Perhaps that is what the oil companies are mad about. Maybe they \nwould like to have that money for themselves. I suppose that is \nprobably true. I understand that. But I think our obligation is to the \nconsumers of America and to the private sector, which is operating on a \nguarantee we gave them that we would have these tax credits at least \nuntil the end of this year, and I think on an implicit guarantee that \nwe gave that we would make sure there would be a marketplace that would \nbe open and accessible for biofuels.\n  So that is what we need to do, to reduce the tax credits but open the \nmarketplace for the ethanol with blender pumps and with flexible fueled \ncars. But that is not before us today. But we will continue to work \ntogether again toward the end of this year to make a reasonable, smooth \ntransition from the tax credits to access to the marketplace, and I \nwill take the floor again and again during the remainder of this year \non these issues.\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\n  I am not doing it today, but I will show the amount of tax benefits \nthat the oil companies have gotten over the last 80 years. Add that up \nand compare it to what the ethanol industry has gotten over the last \nabout 30 years, and you will see that the oil companies have gotten a \nlot more than what ethanol has ever received from the government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of my amendment. I \nwould ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business to speak on \nLibya.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Libya\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, yesterday, the President made an \nannouncement that I believe will strike most of my colleagues and the \nAmericans they represent as a confusing breach of common sense. Two \nadministration lawyers claimed that U.S. military involvement in Libya \nis not in breach of or calls for the War Powers Resolution. In other \nwords, they believe our military activities in Libya do not require a \nWar Powers Resolution because the United States is not engaged in a \nstate of hostilities in Libya.\n  This puzzling assertion seems to be undercut by the very report that \nthe administration sent to Congress yesterday, which makes it clear \nthat the U.S. Armed Forces have been and presumably will continue to \nfly limited strike missions to suppress enemy air defenses, to operate \narmed Predator drones that are attacking Qadhafi's forces in an effort \nto protect Libyan civilians, and to provide the overwhelming support \nfor NATO operations, from intelligence to aerial refueling.\n  I agree actions such as these don't amount to a full-scale state of \nwar, and I would certainly grant that I am no legal scholar, but I find \nit hard to swallow that U.S. Armed Forces dropping bombs and killing \nenemy personnel in a foreign country doesn't amount to a state of \nhostilities.\n  Unfortunately, this only adds more confusion to our already confusing \npolicy in Libya. Our policy objective, as stated by the President \ncorrectly, is to compel Qadhafi to relinquish power. Yet that is not \nour military objective. The administration claims to have turned the \noperation in Libya over to NATO, an alliance in which the United States \nmakes up three-quarters of the collective defense spending, as \nSecretary Gates recently pointed out. The administration sought the \nblessing of the United Nations, the Arab League, and NATO before using \nforce in Libya but still has not sought a similar authorization or \nstatement approval from the elected representatives of the American \npeople. That is wrong.\n  The result of all this, I hate to say, is plain to see in the actions \nof our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol in the House. There \nis massive and growing opposition to continuing the U.S. involvement in \nLibya. There has already been one piece of legislation passed that \nbinds the President's authority as Commander in Chief. There could \nlikely be a vote soon to cut off funding for the entire operation. In \nshort, the accumulated consequences of all this delay, confusion, and \nobfuscation has been a wholesale revolt in Congress against the \nadministration's policy.\n  I take no pleasure in pointing this out, because though I have \ndisagreed, and disagreed strongly at times, with aspects of the \nadministration's policy in Libya, I believe the President did the right \nthing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster in Libya. \nAmid all our present arguments about legal and constitutional \ninterpretations, we can't forget the main point: In the midst of the \nmost groundbreaking geopolitical event in two decades, as peaceful \nprotests for democracy were sweeping the Middle East, with Qadhafi's \nforces ready to strike at the gates of Benghazi, and with Arabs and \nMuslims in Libya and across the region pleading for the U.S. military \nto stop the bloodshed, the United States and our allies took action and \nprevented the massacre that Qadhafi had promised to commit in a city of \n700,000 people. By doing so, we began creating conditions that are \nincreasing the pressure on Qadhafi to give up power.\n  Yes, the progress toward this goal has been slower than many had \nhoped, and the administration is doing less to achieve it than I and \nothers would like. But the bottom line is this: We are succeeding. \nQadhafi is weakening. His military leaders and closest associates are \nabandoning him. NATO is increasing the tempo of its operations and \ndegrading Qadhafi's military capabilities and command and control. The \nTransitional National Council is gaining international recognition and \nsupport and performing more effectively, and though their progress is \nuneven, opposition forces in Libya are making strategic gains on the \nground.\n  I know many were opposed to this mission from the very beginning, and \nI respect their convictions. But the fact is, whether people like it or \nnot, we are engaged in Libya and we are succeeding. So I would ask my \ncolleagues, is this the time for Congress to begin turning against this \npolicy? Is this the time to ride to the rescue of the man whom \nPresident Reagan called the mad dog of the Middle East? Is this the \ntime for Congress to declare to the world, to Qadhafi and his inner \ncircle, to all the Libyans who are sacrificing to force Qadhafi from \npower, and to our NATO allies who are carrying a far heavier burden in \nthis military operation than we are--is this the time for America to \ntell all these different audiences that our heart is not in this, that \nwe have neither the will nor the capability to see this mission \nthrough, that we will abandon our closest friends and allies on a whim?\n  These are questions every Member of Congress needs to think about \nlong and hard but especially my Republican colleagues. Many of us \nremember well the way that some of our friends on the other side of the \naisle savaged President Bush over the Iraq war, how they sought to do \neverything in their power to tie his hands and pull America out of that \nconflict with far too little care for the consequences their actions \nwould have on our friends, our allies, our interests, and our moral \nstanding as the world's leading power. We were right to condemn this \nbehavior then, and we would be wrong to practice it now ourselves \nsimply because a leader of the opposite party occupies the White House.\n  Last week, Qadhafi wrote a personal letter of thanks to the Members \nof Congress who voted to censure the President and end our Nation's \ninvolvement in Libya. Republicans need to ask themselves whether they \nwant to be part of a group that is earning the grateful thanks of a \nmurderous tyrant for trying to limit an American President's ability to \nforce that tyrant to leave power.\n  The goal for all of us in this body, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nshould not be to cut and run from Libya but to ensure we succeed. In \nthe very near future, Senator Kerry and I, along with a strong senior \nbipartisan group of our colleagues, will introduce an authorization for \nthe limited use of military force in Libya. The administration may \nassert that we are not engaged in hostilities in Libya, but the Senate \nshould go on record as authorizing these operations. We are in a state \nof hostilities, and the only result of further delay and confusion over \nCongress's role in this debate will be to continue ceding the \ninitiative to the strongest critics of our actions in Libya.\n  We plan to introduce the authorization soon. I urge the majority \nleader to schedule a vote on it quickly. The Senate has been silent for \ntoo long on our military involvement in Libya. It is time for the \nSenate to speak. When that time comes, I believe we will find a strong \nbipartisan majority that is in favor of maintaining our current course \nin Libya, that supports our seeing this mission through to success, and \nthat is willing to continue standing in the breach with our allies \nuntil the job is done.\n  Madam President, amendment No. 411 would prohibit the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture from funding the construction of ethanol blender pumps \nor ethanol storage facilities--the latest request from the ethanol \nlobby. By prohibiting funding for these pumps and storage facilities we \nwill prevent American taxpayers from spending over $20 billion to \nconvert the 20,000 gasoline pumps currently under construction.\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\n  During Tuesday's cloture vote on the ethanol tax credit amendment, \nsome members that voted against cloture cited concerns with the \nprocedural tactics used to bring up the vote; the ``unfairness'' of \nending the subsidy in midyear, therefore ``pulling the rug'' out from \nunderneath the ethanol industry; and that it was somehow premature to \nend over 30 years of subsidies unless it was coupled with further \nfunding for ethanol infrastructure construction.\n  I hope my fellow critics of the ethanol tax credit have taken notice \nof this new tactic over the past few weeks. For ethanol supporters, \nthis debate has been about where and how to prop up the industry in the \nfuture--not whether the ethanol industry deserves future taxpayer \nsupport.\n  It is time to say enough is enough; this industry has been collecting \ncorporate welfare for far, far too long. For those of us who have been \nfighting against these handouts over the last two decades, it has been \nfar too long since we have had a full debate on this issue.\n  As a reminder to some of my colleagues of how this debate and support \nof corn-ethanol handouts has shifted over the years, I would like to \nread a portion of a floor statement on ethanol subsidies I delivered on \nMarch 11, 1998.\n\n       Mr. President, let me just take a moment and try to explain \n     why we have such generous ethanol subsidies in law today. The \n     rationale for ethanol subsidies has changed over the years, \n     but unfortunately, ethanol has never lived up to the claims \n     of any of its diverse proponents.\n       In the late 1970s, during the energy crisis, ethanol was \n     supposed to help the U.S. lessen its reliance on oil. But \n     ethanol use never took off, even when gasoline prices were \n     highest and lines were longest.\n       Then, in the early 1980s, ethanol subsidies were used to \n     prop up America's struggling corn farmers. Unfortunately, the \n     usual ``trickle down'' effect of agricultural subsidies is \n     clearly evident. Beef and dairy farmers, for example, have to \n     pay a higher price for feed corn, which is then passed on in \n     the form of higher prices for meat and milk. The average \n     consumer ends up paying the cost of ethanol subsidies in the \n     grocery store.\n       By the late 1980s, ethanol became the environmentally \n     correct alternative fuel.\n       Unfortunately, the Department of Energy has provided \n     statistics showing that it takes more energy to produce a \n     gallon of ethanol than the amount of energy that gallon of \n     ethanol contains. In addition, the Congressional Research \n     Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Department \n     of Energy all acknowledge that the environmental benefits of \n     ethanol use, at least in terms of smog reduction, are yet \n     unproven.\n\n  These facts are as true today as they were 13 years ago. In fact, we \nnow have a better understanding of the negative effects corn-ethanol \nhas on both the environment and food prices than we did 13 years ago.\n  But it is important to note that while attention is being paid--and \nrightly so--to eliminating the unneeded and wasteful ethanol tax \ncredit, the corn-ethanol lobby is seeking a new ethanol-stimulus \npackage by attempting a congressional runaround to continue bilking \nAmerican taxpayers out of their money.\n  Instead of seeking approval from Congress, lobbyists have convinced \nthe USDA to change the rules of the Rural Energy for America Program to \npay for new gas station pumps at retail stations at the expense of \nsolar, wind, and energy efficiency projects. In fact, the President has \nannounced his goal to fund the construction of 10,000 ethanol blender \npumps and tanks within the next 5 years--a down payment on future \nethanol-stimulus spending.\n  Supporters of ethanol corporate welfare are happy to tell you that if \nthey get their way, these 10,000 blender pumps and tanks will be the \ntip of the iceberg for billions in new federally funded corn-ethanol \ninfrastructure development.\n  To be perfectly clear: Not content with government support to \nsubsidize ethanol, protect it from competition, or require its use, \nlobbyists now want American taxpayers to pay for the construction of \npumps and holding tanks at retail gas stations.\n  Of course, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is happy to comply with \nthe industry's request to fund infrastructure construction. On April 8, \n2011, Secretary Vilsack issued a rule that would classify blender pumps \nas a renewable energy system qualifying it for funding under the Rural \nEnergy Assistance Program.\n  When Congress created the Rural Energy Assistance Program it had no \nintention of paying gas station owners to upgrade their infrastructure, \nfurther subsidizing the ethanol industry.\n  Furthermore, as a bonus to any gas station owners that take advantage \nof the grant program, once the Federal Government has built the \nblending pumps and holding tanks, retailers will be eligible to receive \nthe ethanol tax credit, double dipping in the Federal Treasury.\n  How expensive will this ethanol stimulus be if the special interest \nlobby gets its way? According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture an \nethanol blender pump and tank cost an average of $100,000 to $120,000 \nto install. With over 200,000 fuel pumps currently operating in the \nU.S. it would cost over $20 billion to convert them all. This is one \nstimulus project that we cannot afford.\n  And for those concerned about the lack of support for wind and solar \nprojects, a recent Congressional Research Service--CRS--report \nindicates that tax credits and subsidies for solar, wind and geothermal \npower will cost $8.62 billion from 2008 to 2012; the ethanol tax credit \nalone would cost over three times more--$26.5 billion. Allowing the \nRural Energy for America Program to continue funding blender pumps and \ntanks will only continue this trend.\n  For my colleagues that really wanted to end the corporate welfare \nhandouts to the corn-ethanol industry but were concerned over the \nprocess issues surrounding the ethanol tax credit vote or concerned \nabout the fairness of ending the tax credit in midyear, you can rest \nassured that those concerns to not apply to this amendment.\n  It is time Congress takes a step towards ending unneeded and \nunnecessary payouts to a robust and strong industry. In a time of \nfiscal constraint, when all are being asked to make a sacrifice, we \nshould expect more from leaders in the private sector than continuing \nto seek handouts--``stimulus projects''--from the Federal Government.\n  I was disappointed, obviously, in the vote that we took concerning \nthe ethanol subsidies and I know probably how the vote on this \namendment will turn out. The message is: Americans, we are not serious \nabout heeding the mandate of last November to stop spending, to stop \nwasteful projects, to stop the unnecessary projects such as ethanol \nsubsidies. We are going to spend 20 billion of your tax dollars in your \nlocal gas station to install a pump.\n  No wonder the American people, according to recent polls, are \ndisillusioned, disappointed, and pessimistic about our future. This \nvote on this amendment will confirm an ample and adequate reason and an \nunderstandable reason for that pessimism.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know we are scheduled to have two \nvotes around 2 o'clock today on the ethanol issue. Once we are past \nthose amendments, we have a number of other important issues to be \ndebated and hopefully scheduled for votes. Senator Hutchison, for \nexample, has one on health care lawsuits, Senator Portman on unfunded \nmandates, Senator Brown on withholding payments, Senator DeMint has an \namendment on the death tax and the renewable fuels standards. In \naddition, our ranking member and manager, Senator Inhofe, has a couple \nof amendments as well.\n  I will be talking to the majority leader during the next votes to see \nhow we can begin to schedule votes on these and other amendments that \nmay need to be considered before we move to final passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I arrived today to speak to the McCain\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\namendment. I noticed my colleague from Arizona was just on the floor. I \nwanted to say I appreciate him offering this amendment. As with the \nCoburn-Feinstein amendment, I support his amendment.\n  I also wanted to make reference to the comments he made regarding our \nconflict in Libya. I agree with him--these are my words--that it is \nbizarre the administration sent over a letter yesterday, referring to \nthe fact that we are not involved in hostilities in Libya. It is really \ntotally bizarre when you look at what is going on in the air in Libya \nright now. I have no idea why Mr. Coe would have offered this argument. \nI know we are going to have a hearing in Foreign Relations in the next \ncouple of weeks to look at this issue.\n\n  Thirdly, I would like to point out one of the reasons we are in this \nsituation right now where Congress has not authorized anything in the \nadministration--I sent a letter to the administration, Secretary Gates \nand Secretary Clinton, 9 weeks ago just asking five questions about our \nengagement in Libya. I received last week a letter from an Acting \nAssistant Secretary that gave me half an answer on one of those five \nquestions.\n  I think most people in this body are aware that Senator Webb and I \nthen authored a resolution asking 21 questions of the administration \nregarding Libya. I thank them for transmitting to us some information \non Libya yesterday. We have not yet gotten access to the classified \nversions of it. We have, obviously like everyone else here, I am sure, \nread the unclassified version. But I think the reason we find ourselves \nin the place we are is we just have not been able to get information \nfrom the administration regarding this conflict.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Massachusetts \nare working on an authorization request, a limited authorization. I \nhope they will potentially wait until we have the answers to all 21 \nquestions, the same questions to which many of the House Members wanted \nthe answer. I share with them the frustration that Congress has not \ntaken any action and would say I am really stunned by the fact that the \nadministration has chosen not to give responses to questions until \nyesterday. And really this was done in response to I know what they saw \nwas a movement in Congress just wondering why in the world they would \nbe so resistant to answering basic questions regarding a conflict.\n  But then secondarily, again, just the bizarre answer that we are not \ninvolved in hostilities--I mean, you can't tell Senators one thing in \nprivate, the same Senators, and tell them something else in public and \nexpect Senators to feel any degree of credibility regarding those \nstatements.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for the comments he has made. We \nhave had an amicable relationship regarding this discussion. We have \nhad like thoughts on several aspects of this conflict, and we have had \nprobably some differing thoughts, but I am here today to say I agree \nwith him that his amendment is an amendment that needs to be passed. I \nagree with him that it is incredible that we have not acted as a \nCongress, and I would say the big reason for that is just the lack of \ninformation. For some reason, the administration has gone to seek \napproval from the United Nations but has not shown any desire to seek \napproval from Congress. It is just, again, odd.\n  Then thirdly is just the bizarre nature of this administration saying \nthat what we are doing there does not involve hostilities when in their \nunclassified version that the whole world has the ability to see, there \nis no way the engagements they have said in an unclassified document \nare occurring in Libya do not involve hostilities. That is just \nabsolutely categorically not possible.\n  I do hope that very soon Congress will take action. I hope that all \nthe questions we have asked for answers to have been answered, and I \nthink all of us will know very soon when we actually gain access to the \nclassified versions of what has been sent over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I see I am joined by the Senator from Iowa, who I know \nwill speak shortly and has been a leader in biofuels and energy for \nmany years.\n  I rise to speak about the votes we will have later today on the \namendments that would immediately cut off support for our homegrown \nenergy industry with I guess a few days' notice. I did not think there \nwas precedent for this decision. If this were to ultimately pass--I am \nnot certain this is the vehicle that would allow it to go into law, but \nif it were to pass, we would have made a decision that is different \nfrom the decision in January affecting an industry that employs nearly \n500,000 people.\n  I wish to talk about the amendment offered by my friend, the Senator \nfrom California. And I would hope, I would say first, that if we were \nvoting twice on an amendment in just a few days, it would be something \nthat creates jobs or decreases our dependence on foreign oil, but that \nis not the case here. We are talking about pulling the rug out from an \nindustry that provides 10 percent of the Nation's fuel supply and \nsupports nearly 500,000 jobs. I don't think people quite understand \nthat about biofuels. I think they think it is some boutique industry. \nMadam President, 10 percent of our Nation's fuel supply at a time when \ngas is up near $4 a gallon.\n  We know there is support for phasing out the current ethanol tax \ncredits. I have a bill to do that. Senator Grassley has another bill to \ndo that. We understand that at a time when our country is facing severe \nbudget constraints. But the question is not if we should do it--we \nwill--it is when and how.\n  We all know homegrown energy has played an important part in reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil and supported thousands of jobs. We also \nknow that as we continue to move our Nation toward energy \nindependence--by the way, we actually are moving up in terms of our own \nenergy independence, which is a goal that I believe every Member \nstrongly supports, and that is that homegrown energy will be a \nsignificant part of our solution. We need a glidepath and not a cliff \nfor the only alternative to oil.\n  Immediately ending all support for the biofuels industry, as the \namendments we are considering propose to do, would stifle investment in \nnot only the existing ethanol industry but also the newly developed \ncellulosic--yes, that is part of this--cellulosic, algae, and the next \ngeneration of biofuels, which I think holds the most hope for this \ncountry. In fact, many of the first advanced biofuel plants are co-\nlocated with corn ethanol plants. You cannot promote next-generation \nfuels by ending a tax policy for existing biofuels 6 months into a 1-\nyear extension with only a few days' notice.\n  Again, the real debate is not about whether we end this tax credit--\nwe know we should do it, and I believe we should do it with oil, too, \nbut right now we are on biofuels--it is about how we do it. That is why \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, and I continue to work toward \nthe bipartisan compromise to reduce our deficit and offer a reasonable \nway to reform the biofuels industry and achieve significant deficit \nsavings immediately. And I appreciate our colleagues talking to us. We \nhave had many meetings, and we are working very hard to get this done. \nWe need to work toward a pragmatic solution that reforms the ethanol \nindustry without harming jobs or driving up gas prices at a time when \ngas is over $3.70 a gallon.\n  An article in the Chicago Tribune underscored the fact that if we \ncease to produce the 13 billion gallons of ethanol we make every year, \nit will drive up prices at the pump by as much as $1.40 per gallon in \nthe short term. Does the Senate actually think we can afford to raise \ngas prices by $1.40? Do my colleagues think we can afford $5-per-gallon \ngas?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on a more responsible \noption that will reduce the deficit and not suddenly disrupt an \nindustry that supports $3 billion in economic activity in my State \nalone.\n  I also wish to say a few words in opposition to the amendment offered \nby my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain. Our current policies provide \nincentives for many different kinds of fuel-dispensing technologies--\nfrom hydrogen to natural gas, to electric hookups, to ethanol--but the \nMcCain amendment singles out only biofuel\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\nblender pumps and proposes to cut all incentives for investment in \nthese pumps at a time when we need to be expanding our fuel supply \noptions, not limiting them to oil from Saudi Arabia. We should be \ninvesting in the farmers and workers of the Midwest and not the oil \ncartels of the Mideast.\n  What the McCain amendment does is focus on limiting those blender \nfuel pumps. Blender pumps do not require customers to use ethanol. That \nis why they are blender pumps. They give consumers a choice at the pump \nand help lower gas prices for all consumers, even those who do not use \nthe higher blends of ethanol.\n\n  From 2000 to 2010, competition from ethanol reduced wholesale \ngasoline prices by an average of 25 cents per gallon, saving American \nconsumers an average of $34.5 billion annually. During the gasoline \nprice runup in 2010, the impact of ethanol and gasoline prices was \nsubstantially larger, reducing gasoline prices by a national average of \n89 cents per gallon.\n  Giving consumers a choice of using higher blends of renewable fuel \nhas allowed the country of Brazil to become energy independent, and we \ncan do the same here.\n  The McCain amendment would also do more than limit consumers' options \nat the pump. I know North Carolina is a good military State. This would \nprohibit the U.S. military from constructing blender pumps or storage \ntanks that can use more fuels that would be more resilient in case of a \nfuel supply cutoff from OPEC or other disruptions in the global fuel \nsupply.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil has been widely recognized by our \nmilitary and diplomatic leaders as a major strategic vulnerability. To \nrespond to this, we have taken important steps in recent years to \nencourage U.S. Government and military fleet vehicles to be fuel \nflexible as part of our efforts to reduce both our spending on fuel and \nour dependence on foreign oil. Shouldn't we allow our homegrown ethanol \nto compete with foreign oil to fuel these vehicles?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain amendment. At a time when \nfamilies and businesses across the Nation are battling high fuel costs, \nwe should be giving them more options at the pump, not less.\n  Today's votes on the Feinstein amendment and the McCain amendment are \npart of a process. We all know it is not the final result. While I \nstrongly oppose both amendments, I also know that regardless of the \noutcome today or even the outcome of that vote 2 days ago, we still \nhave work to do.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Oklahoma to continue to negotiate with Senator Thune and \nmyself. These are serious ongoing negotiations. I am hopeful that in \nthe coming days we can reach a bipartisan compromise. It is not just \nabout one amendment on a bill that is not the vehicle where we can get \nthis done, but, in fact, we actually have a bipartisan compromise that \nbalances our need to continue to support homegrown biofuels with our \nneed to reduce our deficit and to do this in a way that actually puts \nmoney right now back to our government to pay off this debt.\n  I see Senator Grassley, who knows a little bit about finances with \nhis major role on the Finance Committee, and also, as a farmer, a \nlittle bit about the biofuels industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I compliment Senator Klobuchar on her leadership in \ntrying to find, first of all, leadership in supporting biofuels and \nalternative energy but also working very hard for the last few weeks to \nfind a compromise on this issue that is a very difficult issue and very \ndivisive here within the Senate.\n  So we are voting at 2:00 today on these amendments to which Senator \nKlobuchar has already referred. The first is an amendment by Senators \nFeinstein and Coburn repealing the incentive for domestically produced \nethanol. I emphasize ``domestically produced'' because we do not have \nto worry about oil sheiks robbing us of all of our resources when you \nburn ethanol the way you do when you burn imported gasoline. The second \namendment is offered by Senator McCain, prohibiting the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture from using funds for the installation of blender pumps.\n  These amendments won't lower the price of gasoline at the pump. That \nis what people today are concerned about--the price of gas at the pump. \nThese amendments won't lessen our dependence on foreign oil. We spend \n$835 million every day importing oil. And these amendments won't create \na single job in the United States. In fact, they will do just the \nopposite. They will raise the price of gasoline, make us more dependent \non foreign oil, and they won't create a single job. Most importantly, \nthese amendments also won't save the taxpayers any money because they \nstand little chance of being enacted. Even if the amendments were to \npass today, they won't get out of this Chamber because of our \nConstitution that says that revenue measures must originate in the \nHouse of Representatives. So when this bill, if it passes the Senate, \ngoes to the House, they are going to reject it, or they use the term \n``blue slip'' this bill, and it is going to come back to the Senate. So \nthis bill, with these amendments, is dead on arrival in the other body.\n  It is also dead on arrival at the White House. We have had \nindications in a statement that President Obama opposes repealing the \nincentives and is open to new approaches that meet today's challenges \nand save taxpayers money.\n  I remember one of the first policy discussions I had with then-new \nSenator Obama. I was chairman of the Finance Committee. He came up, and \nwe talked about what we could do working together to promote ethanol as \nan alternative energy. His idea was incorporated into a piece of \nlegislation that became law. I was glad to work with him on it. So I \nthank President Obama for the statement he recently gave--again, now, \nas President of the United States--supporting alternative energies, \nbiofuels, and, in this case, specifically ethanol.\n\n  The votes at 2 o'clock, then, are a fruitless exercise. So in a sense \nwe are in political theater here as we debate these issues. We have \nalready had this vote, and it was defeated 40 to 59.\n  Everybody knows oil is now hovering near $100 a barrel, and everybody \nknows, as we hear once a month or maybe are reminded every day, \nunemployment is 9.1 percent. So why has the Senate taken a full week, \nvoting twice, on the same amendment that will increase prices at the \npump, increase dependence upon foreign oil, and lead to job loss, or at \nleast do nothing about the unemployment rate?\n  We should be having this debate in the context of a comprehensive \nenergy plan. This debate should include a review of the subsidies for \nall energy production, not just singling out ethanol. Nearly every type \nof energy gets some market-distorting subsidy from the Federal \nGovernment. An honest energy debate should include ethanol, oil, \nnatural gas, nuclear, hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, and probably a \nlot of other alternative energies I don't think of right now. By \ndiscussing it in the context of an overall energy policy instead of \nsingling out ethanol right now, we would be able to then make sure we \nhave a level playing field for all forms of energy because the \ngovernment shouldn't be choosing between petroleum and alternative \nenergy, as an example.\n  When the oil and gas subsidies were targeted, as the ethanol \nsubsidies are being targeted right now and oil and gas subsidies were \ntargeted last month, the president of the National Petrochemical and \nRefiners Association had this to say:\n\n       Targeting a specific industry, or even a segment of that \n     industry, is what we would consider punitive and unfair tax \n     policy. It is not going to get us increased energy security, \n     increased employment, and it is certainly not going to lower \n     the price of gasoline.\n\n  Well, those very same words could be said about the ethanol debate we \nare having right now because it would surely increase our energy \ninsecurity, it would increase unemployment, and it is certainly not \ngoing to lower the price of gasoline.\n  So it seems to me that the old saying about what is good for the \ngoose ought to be good for the gander applies. So what is good for a \nsubsidy on petroleum and the people who defend that--why would we want \nthe inconsistency we are demonstrating here? Because\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nthat gets back to how I voted on that provision about a month ago. I \nvoted that we ought to deal with oil and gas and ethanol and all of \nthose things in the same context and make sure they fit into an overall \nnational energy policy.\n  In December 2010, Congress enacted this 1-year extension of VEETC, \nthe volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, also known as a blenders' \ncredit. We extended it for 1 year. That is what is being repealed in \nthe Coburn amendment. This 1-year extension has allowed Congress and \nthe domestic biofuels industry to determine the best path forward for \nFederal support of biofuels and for the phasing out of that subsidy.\n  As a result of these discussions, Senator Conrad and I introduced \nbipartisan legislation on May 4 that is a serious, responsible first \nstep to reducing and redirecting Federal tax incentives for ethanol. \nOur bill will reduce and phase out VEETC over a period of a few years. \nIt also would extend through 2016 the alternative-fuel refueling \nproperty credit, the cellulosic producers' tax credit that deals with a \nsecond generation of ethanol from things other than grain, and the \nspecial depreciation allowance for cellulosic biofuels plant property.\n  Earlier this week, I joined Senator Thune and Senator Klobuchar in \nintroducing another bipartisan bill to immediately reduce and reform \nthe ethanol tax incentive. It includes many of the same features as the \nbill I introduced last month with Senator Conrad, but it enacts these \nreforms this year, right now. Senator Thune's approach also leads to \nsignificant deficit reduction.\n  The legislation we have introduced is a responsible approach that \nwill reduce the existing blenders' credit and put those valuable \nresources into investing in alternative-fuel infrastructure, including \nalternative-fuel pumps or, as Senator Klobuchar used the term, blender \npumps. It would also make significant investments in advanced and \ncellulosic ethanol. That is the second generation of ethanol. That is \nwhere we want to go so we are not using grain for fuel. It is a \nforward-looking bill that deserves widespread support.\n  The Thune-Klobuchar bill of which I am a cosponsor will responsibly \nand predictably reduce the existing tax incentive and help get \nalternative-fuel infrastructure in place so consumers can decide which \nfuels they prefer. We shouldn't pull the rug out from under this \nindustry that has made these enormous investments. We need to provide a \ntransition.\n  I know that when American consumers have the choice, they will choose \ndomestically produced, clean, affordable, renewable fuel. They will \nchoose fuel from America's farmers and ranchers, rather than from oil \nsheiks and foreign dictators.\n  Both of the ethanol reform bills I mentioned are supported by the \nethanol advocacy groups. In an almost unprecedented move, the ethanol \nindustry is advocating for a reduction in their Federal incentives. No \nother energy industry has come to the table to reduce or eliminate \nsubsidies. No other energy lobby has come to me with a plan to reduce \ntheir Federal support. For sure, Big Oil hasn't come forward with any \nsuggestions on reducing their subsidies.\n  The best way to get deficit reduction that gets to the President's \ndesk with a Presidential signature is a responsible transition such as \nthe one offered by Senator Thune and Senator Klobuchar. Otherwise, this \nexercise today and these two votes today are a waste of time. This vote \nwill simply put many Members of this body on record in support of a \n$2.4 billion tax increase.\n  I would encourage those who wish to reduce incentives and save \ntaxpayers' money to work with Senators Thune and Klobuchar and the rest \nof us on a responsible transition that has a chance of being enacted \nand, most importantly, signed by the President; therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose these two amendments.\n  I have always said that ethanol shouldn't be singled out, that it \nought to be talked about in the context of an overall energy policy. \nBut one of the reasons it has been able to be separated from all of the \nrest of the alternative energy as well as from all the rest of our \nenergy policies we have for this country is because there is a great \ndeal of ignorance about ethanol. We can tell that in this town when we \nhear a lot of people mispronounce the word ``ethanol'' with a long \n``e.'' So I want to refer to some of these things, and I am going to \nuse statements from the sponsor of the bill and refute some of these \nthings I think are really wrong.\n  The first one:\n\n       We can save $3 billion if we eliminate the VEETC blending \n     subsidy.\n\n  Well, there are a lot of numbers thrown around about how much this \nincentive costs and how much the Coburn amendment would save. I have a \nletter from the Joint Committee on Taxation with a score of the Coburn \namendment. The fact is, the amendment, if enacted on July 1, 2011, \nwould increase revenue to the Federal Treasury by $2.4 billion, not $3 \nbillion as the author stated. Again, the Coburn amendment, if enacted, \nwould be saving $2.4 billion. That is from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation; that is not my estimation. That is the estimation of the \npeople who score for the Congress of the United States what impact \nvarious tax bills have.\n  Another statement:\n\n       All the blenders of gasoline in the United States--all of \n     them--have called and written and said: ``We do not want the \n     $3 billion for the rest of the year.''\n\n  I have a letter from the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of \nAmerica--and they go by the acronym SIGMA--to the Senate majority and \nminority leaders opposing efforts to prematurely and abruptly eliminate \nthe blenders' credit, contrary to the statement I just read that all \nthe blenders want to do away with this.\n  The letter states:\n\n       As the leading marketers of ethanol-blended fuel at the \n     retail level, SIGMA members and customers are the \n     beneficiaries of VEETC. Simply put, SIGMA opposes recent \n     moves to prematurely or abruptly end the subsidies without \n     any consideration for future fuel and fuel-delivery costs. To \n     end this incentive immediately would no doubt result in \n     immediate spike in consumers' fuel costs.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the Society of Independent Gasoline \nMarketers of America.\n  So I hope somebody will put that in their pipe and smoke it because \nthe fact that all of these people, we have been told here on the floor \nof the Senate, don't want this--well, that is an incorrect statement.\n  Another statement:\n\n       According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 40 percent \n     of last year's corn crop was utilized, converted to ethanol.\n\n  It is true that almost 40 percent of the corn crop went into the \nethanol plant to produce ethanol. But what it doesn't tell us is that \nout of a 56-pound bushel of corn, there are 18 pounds of animal feed \nleft over that is more efficient in fattening animals than even the \noriginal corn. That is called dried distillers grain. So I do not want \npeople of this body to come to me in their ignorance and tell me we are \nusing too much corn and saying it is 40 percent of the corn crop when \n18 pounds out of every 56-pound bushel of corn is for very efficient \nanimal feed. So I am going to take credit for that 18 pounds and refute \nthis statement that 40 percent of last year's corn crop was utilized \nand converted to ethanol.\n  One bushel of corn produces nearly 3 gallons of ethanol and 18 pounds \nof high-value animal feed. In 2010, 4.65 billion bushels of corn were \nused to produce 13 billion gallons of ethanol. But ethanol production \nuses only the starch from the corn kernel. More than one-third, or 1.4 \nbillion bushels of dry distillers grain, is left over available as a \nhigh-value livestock feed.\n  On a net basis, ethanol production used only 23 percent of the U.S. \ncorn crop--far less than the 40 percent that Senator Coburn claims. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, feed use consumed 37 \npercent of the U.S. corn supply, much more than the 23 percent consumed \nby the ethanol production.\n  The next statement that is incorrect:\n\n       The American people ought to take into consideration when \n     they go buy a gallon of fuel today--you already have $1.72 \n     worth of subsidy in there. It does not have anything to do \n     with oil and gas drilling.\n\n  I believe Senator Coburn is referring to a report from the \nCongressional Budget Office. For the record, that report relied on the \nquestionable assumption that only a tiny fraction of ethanol \nconsumption is attributable to the ethanol tax credit. Regardless, I am \nglad he raised this point about subsidies and oil and gas drilling.\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\n  Our colleagues may be interested to learn of the hidden cost of our \ndependence upon foreign oil. And these are not my estimates. I am going \nto give you references for you to look up.\n  A peer-reviewed paper published in Environment Magazine in July 2010 \nconcluded that `` . . . $27 to $138 billion dollars is spent annually \nby the U.S. military for protection of Middle Eastern maritime oil \ntransit routes and oil infrastructure, with an average of $84 billion \ndollars per year.''\n  Isn't it convenient to forget those costs of our national defense, \nsuch as keeping oil lanes open so we can get oil to the United States \nthat we spend $835 million every day to import oil?\n  I wish to refer to another one.\n  Milton Copulos, an adviser to President Ronald Reagan, a veteran of \nthe Heritage Foundation, and head of the National Defense Council \nFoundation, testified before Congress in a recent year on the ``hidden \ncosts'' of imported oil.\n  Mr. Copulos stated that by calculating oil supply disruptions and \nmilitary expenditures, the hidden costs of U.S. dependence on petroleum \nwould total up to $825 billion per year. The military expenditure is \nequivalent to adding $8.35 to the price of a gallon of gasoline refined \nfrom Persian Gulf oil. There is no hidden--this is important about \nethanol--because there is no hidden U.S. military cost attributable to \nhomegrown, renewable, environmentally good ethanol.\n  Here is another statement I wish to refute:\n\n       There is a big difference between a subsidy that is a tax \n     credit and allowing someone to advance depreciation because \n     they are going to write it off anyhow.\n       The net effect to the Federal Government's revenue, if you \n     take all of those away, is still zero.\n\n  That statement wants you to believe that all the tax benefits the oil \nindustry gets are just tax benefits; they are not a subsidy. Well, my \nresponse is, I have to refer to a September 2000 report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office. But that report concluded that the \nFederal Government has granted tax incentives, direct subsidies, and \nother support to the petroleum industry. They describe tax incentives \nas Federal tax provisions that grant special tax relief designed to \nencourage certain kinds of behavior by taxpayers or to aid taxpayers in \nspecial circumstances.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the tax break \nallowing for the expensing of intangible drilling costs began in 1916. \nThe percentage depletion allowance was enacted in 1926.\n  The Government Accountability Office estimated that these two tax \nincentives led to a revenue loss of as much as $144 billion between the \ntime studied by the Government Accountability Office, which goes from \n1968, to when the report was given in the year 2000.\n  I would say to my colleagues that those figures I just gave you are a \nfar cry from the zero revenue effect that Senator Coburn claims for the \noil industry. These are the Government Accountability Office's words \nand figures. They refer to them as tax incentives that resulted in the \nloss of revenue of more than $100 billion to the Federal Treasury over \na 32-year period.\n  I have heard Senator Coburn on the floor on many occasions talking \nabout the dire fiscal situation our country is in. I find myself voting \nwith Senator Coburn most of the time. But on this issue, I disagree. \nYet on this issue, it sounds as though he is arguing about semantics. \nOne is a ``subsidy,'' yet the other is a ``legitimate business \nexpense.'' In other words, in the case of ethanol, it is a subsidy. In \nthe case of Big Oil and their taxes, it is a legitimate business \nexpense.\n  I am not sure this argument over terminology will give our children \nand grandchildren much comfort when they are picking up the trillion-\ndollar tab over the next couple of decades.\n  The last statement I wish to refute is this:\n\n       Corn prices are at $7.65 a bushel.\n\n  Well, that had to be a couple days ago because I get a report every \nday on corn prices at my local elevator in New Hartford, IA. They were \n$7.10 yesterday. But let me quote again.\n\n       Corn prices are at $7.65 a bushel. They are 2\\1/2\\ times \n     what they were 3\\1/2\\ years ago. [Ethanol] has been, this \n     last year, the significant driver.\n\n  Let me suggest, first of all, that he is right, 3\\1/2\\ years ago, \ncorn was about $7 a bushel. But 6 months later, it was $3.58 a bushel. \nSo anybody who thinks corn is going to stay at this historically high \nprice is not very smart. And if farmers are spending money according to \nthat, they better slow up because they are going to be caught off guard \nand out of business like they were in the 1980s.\n  So this is my response, in addition to what I said about corn going \ndown to $3.58: Grain used for ethanol accounts for approximately 3 \npercent of the world's coarse grain. Let me reflect on that statement \nfor a minute, because you get the opinion, when they say 40 percent of \nU.S. corn is used in ethanol, that, ye gods, what are people going to \neat? But worldwide--and the grain market is worldwide--the global \nmarketplace decides the price of grain. And worldwide, only 3 percent \nof the coarse grain--and corn is one of the coarse grains--is used for \nfuel. Because of the increased corn production, the amount of grain \navailable for non-ethanol use is growing.\n  In the year 2000, there were 2.4 billion metric tons of grain \navailable for uses other than for ethanol. Even with the growth of the \nethanol industry, last year there were 2.6 billion metric tons of grain \navailable for uses other than for ethanol.\n  It is also important to review the cost of corn in retail food \nprices. The corn price today: The corn cost in a gallon of milk is \nabout 46 cents. The cost of corn in a pound of chicken is 34 cents. One \npound of beef takes 92 cents worth of corn. One pound of pork requires \n39 cents.\n  So you have all these excuses coming from the food manufacturers of \nthe United States that ethanol is the cause of food prices rising. But \nyou can see in the figures I just gave you that what the farmer gets \nout of a dollar's worth of retail food is about 21 cents. And you could \ncut this in half, and it will be cut in half, like it was 3\\1/2\\ years \nago. But when the price of corn goes down, you are not going to see big \nfood manufacturers reducing their cost of food by 20 percent because \nthey need ethanol as a scapegoat to raise the price of food.\n  That is all I have to say about ethanol. But I do have an amendment I \nam submitting to this bill that is before us that is unrelated to \nethanol, but it also brings up the same point: that there are a lot of \nplaces in this budget we can save money.\n  Senator Johnson of South Dakota and I are submitting this amendment \nthat pertains to setting limits that any one farmer, including this \nfarmer, can get from farm program payments.\n  I have been pushing for reform of farm program payments for many \nyears. Some folks from outside of Iowa unfamiliar with this issue may \nbe surprised that I am the Member who keeps pushing these reforms. They \nmay think: Iowa's economy relies heavily on agriculture. Why would a \nSenator from a farm State such as Iowa want a hard cap on farm \npayments?\n  But Iowa farmers understand why I continue pushing for a hard cap. \nThis is about making sure the farm programs provide what they are \nsupposed to provide: a safety net for those who need it; basically, \nfarmers who have the economic incapability of overcoming natural \ndisasters and political issues and international politics that they \nhave no control over that affects the impact of farm income. Those are \nsmall and medium-sized farmers. They are not these megafarmers that are \n10 percent of farmers getting 70 percent of the benefits out of the \nfarm program.\n  These small and medium-sized farmers--as, of course, bigger farmers \ndo--play a vital role in supplying our Nation and world with food. \nHowever, they are continually, as small farmers, faced with the \nchallenge of rising land prices and cash rents. Many times, young and \nbeginning farmers cannot compete because of high land prices and rents. \nThere is no doubt the rise in commodity prices is part of the reason \nfor higher land prices and cash rents.\n  But, currently, farm program payments are also placing upward \npressure on land prices. This is not how it is supposed to work. What I \njust said means we are subsidizing big farmers to get bigger. There is \nnothing wrong with big farmers getting bigger. I do not argue with that \nin any segment of our economy. But we should not be subsidizing big \nfarmers to get bigger.\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\n  The farm program was put in place to provide a safety net for \nfarmers. It is meant to help them get through tough times. The farm \nprogram was not created to help big farmers get bigger. Let me repeat \nfor you--because it cannot get enough emphasis--10 percent of this \nNation's largest farmers receive 70 percent of the farm program \npayments.\n  These large farms do not need these program payments to get through \ntough times. Small and medium-sized farmers do not need nonmarket \nfactors driving up the land prices and cash rents.\n  This amendment is a commonsense solution to this problem. Reform the \nfarm program so it works as a true safety net for those it was intended \nfor. We can do that by placing limits on how much a single farm \noperation can receive in program payments. The government should stay \nout of subsidizing the growth of large farms.\n  In addition, this amendment tightens the requirements for people to \nbe considered an actively engaged farmer. For too long, people have \ngamed the system and received farm payments that the law did not \nintend.\n  There have been a number of amendments submitted to the EDA bill \nbefore us in the name of saving taxpayer dollars. The ethanol \namendment--supposedly that is one of the motives behind it.\n  By setting hard payment caps, and making these other reforms, we will \nsave the U.S. Treasury approximately $1.5 billion over 10 years.\n  The headlines around here are dominated by the problems of the \nbudget. Many of my colleagues have come to this floor in recent weeks \nand discussed government spending and the big debt.\n  If this body is going to be serious about cutting spending, then this \namendment I am laying before you as a limitation on farm payments is a \ncontinuation of that effort. Instead of spending time debating the \nmerits of programs that assist the renewable energy industry, an \nindustry that, by the way, helps us wean ourselves off our need for \nforeign oil, why do we not agree to make cuts in areas we should be \nable to have an agreement?\n  This is a simple and commonsense way for us to save money, while at \nthe same time making sure the farm program accomplishes what it is \nsupposed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 37 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Iowa, who \nhas been a great leader over the years on the issue of biofuels, in \ntrying to transition our country away from the dangerous dependence we \nhave on foreign oil and over the years has worked to put in place \npolicies that have helped build an industry literally from the ground \nup. The ethanol industry, in its inception many years ago, sort of \nstarted with just a few farmers getting together. Today they are \nproducing about 13 billion gallons of ethanol. It represents 10 percent \nof our entire fuel supply. There is not any other fuel in the country \nthat provides the alternative to traditional gasoline ethanol does.\n  That is the result of a lot of investment, a lot of hard work by a \nlot of people over the years. It has also been as a result of a \ndependance upon what has been fairly stable public policy. Now there is \na debate about whether that public policy ought to change. That \ncertainly is a debate we can have. I do not wish to get into the merits \nof the individual elements of ethanol policy because obviously people \nare going to disagree about that.\n  But I am going to point out that we put this policy in place in \nDecember of last year. In December of last year, we told this industry, \nwhich represents--these are 204 American-owned plants. These are \nAmerican companies that employ almost 500,000--indirectly or directly--\nAmerican jobs and American workers in this country. So we told them, in \nDecember of last year, 81 Senators--81 Senators, many of whom are now \nsaying, I am going to vote to do away with this particular tax policy--\n81 Senators voted for it. We had 81 votes in the Senate in December \nthat said these are going to be the rules of the game until December of \nthis year.\n  So now we have this effort to completely change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. I have not been here all that long. I served three \nterms in the House of Representatives. I am in my seventh year in the \nSenate. But I do not recall an occasion where we have ever done \nanything such as this, where the Congress has put policy in place, made \ncommitments to American businesses--in this case, people who employ \nAmerican workers--and then tell them 6 months later, I am sorry, we are \ngoing to pull the rug out. You are out there on your own now.\n  It would be one thing if these decisions were made in a vacuum. But \nmost of these businesses made investment decisions based upon public \npolicy that was put in place by this Congress. We cannot, in good \nfaith, now go tell them we are just going to jerk this policy out of \nthe way. Does our word mean anything around here?\n  To start with, we have an issue with this particular amendment \nbecause it is unconstitutional. We cannot originate a tax measure in \nthe Senate. So it will be blue-slipped in the House of Representatives, \nwhich makes everything we are doing right now largely symbolic. This \nbill is not going anywhere.\n  But there seems to be people who are intent upon making some sort of \nstatement, I guess, or trying to send some sort of a message. But the \nend result, if what they were trying to accomplish today were to become \nlaw, is we would raise gas prices because we are talking about a $2.4 \nbillion increase in taxes on people who inevitably are going to pass it \non. So why would we want to start raising gas prices at a time when we \nhave historically high gas prices and people are already being pinched \nat the pump?\n  So we single out a specific industry. I have heard people get up \ntoday and say: Well, we voted for tax extenders last year, but you know \nwhat, they were part of a bigger package. We did not have to agree with \nall of it. Well, then, do not vote for it and, surely, have the debate \nthen. Why were we not debating the issue last December? If people had \nissues with this, they should have been brought out then when we put \nthis policy in place.\n  What, in effect, we are doing is singling out an industry and saying: \nWe are going to punish you by changing the rules in the middle of the \ngame because we do not like your industry or because we do not like \nthis particular tax provision.\n  Well, we had a similar debate a few weeks ago. There was an effort to \ndo something on oil and gas tax provisions. The argument that was made \nat the time, myself included, was why would we single out a specific \nindustry? If we are going to do this, let's do this in a comprehensive \nway when we look at all types of policies, tax expenditures, favorable \ntax treatment that various industries in this country get, and let's \nexamine them all together. Let's make some changes.\n  This is selectively singling out a specific industry and changing a \ntax policy in the middle of the year. There has been a statement made \non the floor that people who get the benefit or the blenders credit do \nnot want it. It strikes me at least, if they do not want it, they do \nnot have to take it. They have to file for it. They have to file with \nthe IRS. If they do not want the blenders credit, they do not have to \ntake it. But most of the people who file for the blenders credit, it is \nassumed, are going to pass it on to the retailer, to the gas station, \nand ultimately to the consumer so it will result in lower prices.\n  Most of the refiners anyway are large, integrated oil companies that, \nfrankly, do not want the competition that is represented by the ethanol \nindustry. They do not have to take the blenders credit. They have to do \nsomething to get it. They have to file with the IRS in order to receive \nit.\n  One other point I wish to make, because there has been some talk as \nwell about ethanol and the environmental benefits, there are certain \nStates in the country that perhaps would like to have even higher \nstandards. But if we compare ethanol to traditional gasoline, according \nto the EPA, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions--lifecycle greenhouse \ngas emissions--it is 20 percent lower, corn-based ethanol. When we get \nto cellulosic ethanol, which is the next generation of biofuels--if we\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\ncan get there, if we do not completely do away with the platform we \nhave today with corn-based ethanol--it will have a 60-percent lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emission advantage over traditional gasoline.\n  So corn-based ethanol, 20 percent cleaner burning than traditional \ngasoline; cellulosic ethanol, 60 percent cleaner burning than gasoline. \nThat is according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which does \nnot take a particularly favorable view of these fuels because they like \nto include in their calculation types of elements, such as indirect \nland use in other countries around the world, which, frankly, we do not \nthink ought to be part of the calculation, but even with that 20-\npercent cleaner burning than traditional gasoline for corn-based \nethanol and 60 percent for cellulosic ethanol.\n  I wish to read, if I might, from a letter that I received from an \norganization called ACORE. That is the American Council on Renewable \nEnergy. This organization is about 500 deep, represents about 500 other \norganizations; in some cases, American companies, universities, members \nsuch as Walmart, such as DuPont. This is what they say:\n\n       Current domestic ethanol production is also laying the \n     groundwork and infrastructure for the more advanced biofuels \n     of the future including cellulosic ethanol, algae-derived \n     fuels, and drop-in fuels. We have already crossed the \n     threshold of these homegrown biofuels meeting a substantial \n     portion of transportation fuel demand for cars and light duty \n     trucks; but they cannot be further developed without the \n     infrastructure investments that are fostered by current \n     ethanol production today.\n\n  They go on to say that:\n\n       The Thune-Klobuchar amendment ensures ethanol production \n     will continue, while directing limited government resources \n     to support infrastructure development and the transition to \n     advanced biofuels.\n       The ethanol tax credit has been critical to increased \n     domestic ethanol production and corresponding economic \n     growth, job creation, enhanced energy security and lower gas \n     prices. We urge you to oppose the Coburn amendment, which \n     would prematurely terminate support for our domestic ethanol \n     industry while failing to invest in critical infrastructure \n     and advanced biofuels. We ask for your support of the Thune-\n     Klobuchar amendment.\n\n  The Thune-Klobuchar amendment--we are working with the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, on a \nsolution that would hopefully lead us to a result. It would do what \nmany of the folks in this Chamber want to see done. It would do away \ncompletely with the blenders credit, effective July 1, and with the \nethanol tariff. It would also put money back into debt reduction.\n  We think that is a better way to do this. I hope those discussions \nwill lead somewhere. But this vote today is going to be a largely \nsymbolic vote for reasons I just mentioned: It is unconstitutional. It \nwill be blue-slipped in the House of Representatives and, therefore, it \nmakes absolutely no sense for us to be having this vote in the first \nplace. It certainly does not make any sense for us to be sending a \nmessage to this industry that we want to do away with it.\n  I understand my time has expired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nFeinstein amendment. I am a proud cosponsor of this proposal because it \nwill save us money, reduce food prices and do so in a responsible \nmanner.\n  Ethanol enjoys truly unprecedented support from the Federal \nGovernment. First there is the renewable fuels mandate that requires \nethanol to be blended into gasoline.\n  Second, there is a 45-cent-per-gallon subsidy to blend ethanol into \ngasoline that is costing the Treasury nearly $6 billion per year.\n  Third, there is a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol \nprotecting the domestic industry from any serious competition.\n  And to top it all off the Federal Government spends billions every \nyear to subsidize the growth of corn for ethanol.\n  In a time of fiscal constraint we simply cannot afford to prop up an \nindustry with such enormous supports.\n  And these supports are not just costing taxpayers money, but they are \nalso causing food prices to rise and harming our environment.\n  The USDA estimates that 40 percent of this year's corn crop will be \nused for ethanol. This is raising grain prices worldwide, especially \nhurting the needy.\n  For these reasons, the Feinstein amendment has the support of \ntaxpayer rights groups, religious groups looking out for the needy, \nbudget hawks concerned about our deficit, livestock growers who use \ngrain as feed, the grocers and restaurants who are seeing food prices \nincrease, and the environmental community who understand that corn \nethanol requires enormous amounts of fossil fuels to be produced.\n  My support for the Feinstein amendment is not just because it is the \nright thing to do for our country and our Federal budget, but because \nit is the right thing to do for my home State. New Jersey has over \n120,000 flex fuel vehicles, but does not have a single E85 ethanol pump \nin the entire State. 120,000 cars that are built to allow automakers to \ngame fuel economy standards but may never see a drop of E85 fuel.\n  I know that this issue is important to our friends in the Midwest, \nbut ethanol producers already have a guaranteed market for their \nproduct as a result of the Federal mandate. Now we have an opportunity \nto help families across the country by ending this failed ethanol \npolicy and providing relief both in terms of their taxes and their food \nprices.\n  For these reasons, I will be voting in favor of the Feinstein \nAmendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I also think this vote is important for the larger debate over the \ndeficit.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have said revenues cannot \nbe a part of the strategy to reduce the deficit. I think this vote and \nthe one earlier this week in which 34 Republicans voted to end these \nwasteful ethanol tax breaks show there is bipartisan support for \ncutting wasteful tax subsidies and loopholes and that these revenue \nexpenditures must be part of any solution on the deficit.\n  As I speak about that, let me end on another item I think should be \non the table, one I have been promoting. The first place to start in \nterms of tax expenditures is oil subsidies.\n  A bipartisan majority of 52 Senators voted recently to end these tax \nbreaks. If these 34 Republicans come into the fold, we could work \ntogether to make some real progress. Oil companies do not need these \nsubsidies--I am talking about the big five--with oil trading at nearly \n$100 per barrel. They have all the incentive they need in the \nmarketplace. But cutting these subsidies, we can cut the deficit by $21 \nbillion. This year alone these companies are projected to earn up to \n$144 billion in profits--not proceeds but profits. If they can simply \nlive with a mere $142 billion in profits, then they can do their share \nto reduce the deficit without raising gas prices.\n  It is time to come together across party lines and to end wasteful \ntax subsidies and lower the deficit. This vote is an important first \nstep, and I think by doing so we will--notwithstanding the issues about \nblue slips and constitutional impediments--send a clear sense of the \nSenate that will move us in a direction that will end the ultimate \nsubsidies and help us reduce the deficit. I think ending oil subsidies \nwill get us on a path to a bipartisan solution that is critical for the \nNation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator McCain's \namendment to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the construction of \nethanol blender pumps and ethanol storage facilities. My vote today is \nnot a vote against ethanol as a transportation fuel. I strongly support \nthe greater use of alternative transportation fuels and alternative-\nfuel filling stations in the United States. In certain cases, I have \neven advocated for government support of these goals. But government \nsupport for a source of energy should create a temporary boost, not a \nlong-term Federal dependency. It is just as foolish to attempt to build \nan economy on subsidized energy as it is to build a house on the sand.\n  I have been criticized for opposing a Democratic proposal to raise \ntaxes on domestic oil producer, but there is a difference in the size \nof the Grand Canyon between allowing oil companies to keep a portion of \ntheir own profits, which they use for more domestic energy production, \nversus handing out\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nvery large amounts of taxpayer cash to ethanol companies. Ethanol \ncompanies not only have a lower tax rate than oil companies on average, \nthey also benefit from the ethanol excise tax credit, from government \nhandouts for ethanol filling infrastructure, a large Federal mandate \nforcing refineries to produce ethanol whether it makes economic sense \nor not, and an ethanol import tariff.\n  I cannot conceive of any justification for a program that hands out \ntaxpayer funds for an activity as it does for ethanol blender pumps and \nstorage facilities when it already has a Federal mandate forcing it \ninto what used to be the free market. In my book, there is no greater \nsubsidy than Federal mandate, and that alone is more than ethanol \ndeserves.\n  I have supported broad-based incentives for alternative fuels in the \npast, but enough is enough, and in the case of ethanol, it is more than \nenough by far. Affordable energy is basic to a strong economy just as a \nhealthy blood supply is basic to human life, and a long-term handout is \nno substitute for affordability.\n  I will continue to support reducing our dependency on foreign oil by \nincreasing domestic energy production, increasing the efficiency of our \ntransportation sector, and increasing the diversity of our \ntransportation fuels. But those goals should focus on energy sources \nthat can compete in the free market. Reliance on noncompetitive energy \nsources will only drag down our economy.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support more competitive \nAmerica by voting for Senator McCain's amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feinstein \nand Coburn supporting an amendment to repeal the ethanol excise tax \ncredit and the ethanol import tariff. These policies are fiscally \nirresponsible, environmentally unwise, and economically indefensible. \nToday we have another opportunity to take action to end them.\n  Historically, our government has helped a product compete in one of \nthree ways: we subsidize it, we protect it from competition, or we \nrequire its use. Right now, ethanol may be the only product receiving \nall three forms of support.\n  The ethanol tax break is extraordinarily expensive. The Government \nAccountability Office has found that the tax credit costs American \ntaxpayers a staggering $6 billion annually. This is quite a sum to prop \nup a fuel that is causing land conversion for corn production, \ncommodity and food prices to rise, and is barely putting a dent in our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil. With our amendment, we have the \nopportunity to immediately save American taxpayers nearly $3 billion \nfor the remainder of 2011 alone.\n  Ethanol use is mandated under the renewable fuels standard, RFS, \nwhich guarantees market for corn ethanol. Collectively, the first \ngeneration biofuels industry will receive tens of billions in \nunnecessary subsidies through the year 2022. If the current subsidy \nwere allowed to continue for five years, the Federal Treasury would pay \noil companies at least $31 billion to use 69 billion gallons of corn \nbased ethanol that the RFS already requires them to use. We simply \ncannot afford to pay the oil industry for following the law.\n  The data overwhelmingly demonstrate that the costs of the current \nethanol subsidies and tariffs far outweigh their benefits. Just last \nsummer, the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State \nUniversity estimated that a 1-year extension of the ethanol subsidy and \ntariff would lead to only 427 additional direct domestic jobs at a cost \nof almost $6 billion, or roughly $14 million of taxpayer money per job.\n  While expanding our capacity to generate alternative, domestic fuel \nsources is an important step toward becoming less dependent on foreign \noil, I have serious concerns about the effects of increased ethanol \nuse. There are other alternative sources of energy that make far more \nsense.\n  The energy, agricultural, and automotive sectors are already \nstruggling to adapt to the existing ethanol mandates. I have concerns \nwith the partial waiver issued by the Environmental Protection Agency \nfor the use of E15, a blend of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol. \nMany residents in my state have already experienced difficulties using \ngasoline blended with just 10 percent ethanol, finding that it causes \nproblems in older cars, snowmobiles, boats, and lawn mowers. The EPA's \nE15 waiver fails to adequately protect against misfueling and will add \nunnecessary confusion at the gas pump for consumers. We simply cannot \nplace so many engines in jeopardy.\n  These first generation biofuel mandates also present environmental \nconcerns as they could result in energy efficiency losses and increased \nair pollution because the mechanical failures can jeopardize the \neffectiveness of engine emission controls.\n  Over recent years, we have also seen food and feed prices increase as \ncrops have been diverted for the production of corn-based ethanol. We \nshould be raising food crops for food, not for fuel. Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee chairman Joe Lieberman and I held a series of \nhearings in 2008 to examine the impact of corn based ethanol on food \nprices and we found that it certainly had a negative impact.\n  The cost of this policy to our Nation and its taxpayers, particularly \ngiven our current fiscal crisis, can no longer be ignored. At a time \nwhen we are projecting a deficit this year alone of $1.5 trillion, how \ncan we justify spending $6 billion to subsidize ethanol?\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those who questioned the process \nused to bring an identical amendment to the floor just a couple days \nago, to join me today in supporting the Feinstein-Coburn amendment to \nrepeal these fiscally indefensible corn-based ethanol subsidies.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in favor of ending lavish and \nunneeded ethanol subsidies. This is the second opportunity that my \ncolleagues and I have to end unnecessary subsidies to one of the most \nprofitable and wealthy industries in the world. In May, I voted to end \n$2 billion a year in tax breaks to the five biggest oil companies that \nmade more than $36 billion in profits in the first 3 months of 2011. \nAnd today I will vote to end $6 billion a year subsidies for ethanol \nblenders.\n  While the Nation is facing record deficits and families and \nbusinesses in Maryland are getting crushed with high gas, corn and food \nprices, ending $6 billion a year in tax breaks for ethanol producers is \na no-brainer. The numbers speak for themselves. This subsidy doesn't \nhelp the chicken farmers on the eastern shore of Maryland who are \npaying corn costs that are three times higher than they were 5 years \nago. It isn't making us less dependent on foreign oil. And it certainly \nisn't reducing the deficit. The only thing this subsidy is doing is \npadding the pockets of oil companies who blend ethanol. These companies \ndon't need taxpayer help to survive--let alone thrive.\n  At a time when Congress is considering devastating cuts to FIRE \ngrants for our first responders, home heating oil assistance for \nseniors, and nutritious foods for pregnant women and newborns, it makes \nno sense to preserve a $6 billion a year tax break for an industry that \ndoesn't need it. If we are serious about the deficit, we have to make \nsmart decisions, Ending these subsidies is a long overdue answer to \ngetting this country back on track to fiscal sanity, and not in a way \nthat hurts middle class families or traditional industries in Maryland.\n  Ethanol blenders have hit the trifecta of government support. First, \nthe law requires that ethanol be used in gasoline. Second, blenders get \na 45-cent-per-gallon tax credit. And third, it is protected by a tariff \nwhich discourages the import of cheaper, more efficient, and more \nenvironmentally sound types of ethanol. The Feinstein amendment does \nnot change the requirement that ethanol be used in gasoline. It simply \nends the unneeded and lavish subsidy to oil companies that blend the \nethanol.\n  It is time to stop filling up oil industry profits while draining \ntaxpayer's wallets. Ending these subsidies will right a wrong in the \ntax code and ensure that middle class families aren't on the hook for \nmore giveaways. Let's pass this bill, end these subsidies, and put our \nefforts into additional ways to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to oppose both the amendments \noffered today.\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\n  I share many of the concerns of Senator Feinstein and others in this \nbody about the impact of the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit. I am \nparticularly concerned that this credit may increase the price that \nAmericans pay for food, something few families can afford these days.\n  But I cannot support Senator Feinstein's amendment, for three \nreasons.\n  First, I fear that her amendment, while addressing tax credits for \ncorn-based ethanol, would also remove support for other, non-corn \nsources. While I applaud Senator Feinstein for maintaining support for \ncellulosic ethanol production, we should not reduce support for other \nnon-corn sources that have potential to help reduce our dependence on \nimported oil without affecting food prices. For example, companies in \nmy state and elsewhere are working on production of biofuels from \nalgae. I believe any attempt to address tax credits for corn-based \nethanol should leave intact support for these non-corn sources.\n  Second, I fear that ending this credit now, more than 6 months before \nit is set to expire, would unfairly burden business that have made \nplans with the assumption that the credit would remain in place at \nleast until then. These businesses have a right to expect that Congress \nwill not pull the rug out from under them.\n  Third, I am concerned that by attaching this amendment to an \nimportant piece of legislation, we endanger passage of that \nlegislation. I support the underlying bill, which would reauthorize the \nEconomic Development Administration. The EDA is an important resource \nfor communities across the country, and at a time when jobs should be \nour top priority, we should support programs with proven records of job \ncreation. But by attaching a revenue measure to EDA bill, the House \nwill almost certainly ``blue slip'' the bill and thereby doom it.\n  I also will oppose the amendment offered by Senator McCain. I believe \nthat we should support the creation of infrastructure that will support \nalternative energy development. By prohibiting Federal funding for \ncreating infrastructure to support ethanol production and use--\nincluding cellulosic ethanol and other non-corn sources--Senator \nMcCain's amendment would make it more difficult for us to develop these \nnew sources of energy, sources we need to end our dependence on \nimported fossil fuels.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss \ntwo amendments to the underlying bill: amendment No. 411 offered by \nSenator McCain and amendment No. 476 offered by Senators Feinstein and \nCoburn.\n  I oppose these amendments. Abruptly pulling support for ethanol, as \nthese amendments attempt to do, runs counter to vital efforts to reduce \ndependence on foreign oil. The ethanol industry supports over 400,000 \nAmerican jobs, offers consumers a choice at the pump, lowers fuel \nprices, and displaces millions of gallons of foreign oil with a \nhomegrown alternative.\n  Amendment No. 476, offered by Senators Feinstein and Coburn, would \neliminate the blender tax credit for the use of ethanol and end the \ntariff on imported ethanol that ensures tax incentives are limited to \ndomestically produced renewable fuels. Senator McCain's amendment, No. \n411, would block federal efforts to promote ethanol blender pumps or \nethanol storage facilities. Last fall, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack \nannounced a goal of installing 10,000 blender pumps nationwide over 5 \nyears to help give consumers a choice at the pump. Senator McCain's \namendment would end this type of important initiative to promote \nrenewable fuel infrastructure.\n  While I support responsible efforts to reform and significantly \nreduce the cost of tax incentives for ethanol, we must focus on \ndeveloping our ethanol infrastructure that will facilitate the \ntransition toward advanced biofuels and cellulosic ethanol. The \nrenewable fuels industry, and ethanol in particular, has played an \nimportant role in addressing our energy needs. Our support of renewable \nfuels to date has brought us to a point where ethanol displaces \nmillions of gallons of oil. Unfortunately, this amendment would not \nonly hinder our existing ethanol industry, but it would also stall the \ndevelopment of the next generation of biofuels like cellulosic ethanol.\n  Ethanol also has been shown to reduce prices at the pump. A recent \nstudy by the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, CARD, found \nthat the increased use of ethanol reduced wholesale gasoline prices by \nan average of $0.89 per gallon in 2010. At a time when high fuel prices \nare having a detrimental impact of the budgets of millions of \nAmericans, it is important that we not hastily take steps that will \nfurther increase those prices.\n  Rather than voting to abruptly end the current incentives for \nethanol, I have worked with colleagues on an alternative proposal that \nwould transition from the existing blender credit to targeted \ninvestments, while also reducing the deficit. This effort, led by \nSenators Klobuchar and Thune, would end the current form of the \nvolumetric ethanol excise tax credit and redirect a portion of the \nestimated savings toward deficit reduction and the remaining toward \nrenewable fuels infrastructure, a safeguard credit for ethanol should \noil prices fall below certain points, and continued support for small \nproducers and development of advanced biofuels.\n  I support efforts to reform incentives that promote our renewable \nfuels industry and reduce the deficit, but I oppose these amendments. I \nhope that my colleagues will continue to discuss further alternatives \nthat ensure we continue to have a strong renewable fuels industry.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes, \nuntil another speaker arrives on the other side. If I might, I want to \nelaborate on where these discussions are that we have been having with \nregard to getting a result and a solution that I think actually could \nget enacted and become law.\n  Since we first had this vote a couple days ago, I have been in \nconversations, along with Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, Senator \nCoburn, and Senator Feinstein, the sponsors of this amendment, to see \nif there isn't some way we can find something we could actually do that \nwould accomplish what probably many of them would like to see \naccomplished but doing it in a way that is not disruptive, that is a \nthoughtful approach to the future of the biofuels industry, and that \nactually does something meaningful in terms of dealing with the debt \nand deficit.\n  Those discussions continue. I think we continue to get closer and \ncloser to an agreement. I hope my colleagues will continue to talk and \ndiscuss this matter. We will continue those discussions after the vote \nat 2 o'clock. I say that to let my colleagues know that even though \nthis particular vote is going to amend a piece of legislation that \nperhaps isn't going to go anywhere--and certainly this amendment, \nbecause it is a blue slip and has a constitutional issue, isn't going \nto go anywhere--there are earnest discussions going on that I hope will \nyield a result.\n  Again, in my view, there is a better way to do this. Obviously, there \nare people who feel strongly and deeply, and we have heard the emotion \nof this debate over the last few days about this subject. But there is, \nin my view, a right way and wrong way to do this. The right way is to \ndo it so that we are not pulling the rug out from under an industry \nafter we already put in place policy that they have relied on in terms \nof their investment issues.\n  I hope we can get that agreement, and I certainly hope my colleagues \nwill bear that in mind. There are a number of Members here who \nobviously are very supportive of the legislation that Senator Klobuchar \nand I introduced earlier this week, and we heard Senator Grassley speak \nto that point and others who are cosponsors.\n  We continue to work with the sponsors of the Coburn-Feinstein \namendment to see if there isn't a path forward that will enable us to \npass something through the Senate. I wanted to let my colleagues know \nthat and apprise them of the status of those discussions. I hope we can \ncome to a conclusion that will get a result and not\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nsimply have a vote that ends up being largely symbolic. We will \ncontinue to have discussions, and I will continue to keep my colleagues \napprised of the discussions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 476, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \npending Feinstein amendment with the changes at the desk.\n  This modification is to correct a drafting error made by legislative \ncounsel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n             TITLE __--ETHANOL SUBSIDIES AND TARIFF REPEAL\n\n     SEC. _01.

There will be no more rollcall votes this week. We will \nwork on next week's schedule later today. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senators from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Brown, be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes each, and following that time I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                          Hockey Championship\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before Mayor Menino ques the Duckboats for \nthe victory parade on Saturday, I want to take a moment with my \ncolleague on the Senate floor to celebrate an extraordinary victory by \nthe Boston Bruins. After a grueling 39 years of so many ups and downs, \nheartbreaking misses and almosts, the Stanley Cup is coming back to \nBoston. That is thanks to the extraordinary grit of a special hockey \nteam, a team that had remarkable character. I have to say--and I say \nthis, I hope, cautiously because I know pride comes before a fall. \nNevertheless, we in Massachusetts are blessed with an embarrassment of \nriches right now because last night's heart-stopping 7th game victory \nagainst the Vancouver Canucks is now allowing us to celebrate our \nseventh championship for our city in the last decade. Again, I know \npride comes before the fall, but sweeping the Yankees a weekend ago and \nnow winning this isn't too bad.\n  As a lifelong hockey fan and a guy who still tries to get around the \nrink occasionally when my hips allow me to do that, the Bruins' win \nlast night was one of the sweetest ever. That is partly because it was \nin such a long time coming, but it is also because of the determination \nthis team showed in getting there. Not since 1972 have the Bruins \nbrought home a coveted Stanley Cup; and not since the 1970 championship \nof the legendary Bobby Orr's flying goal has there been so much for \nBoston hockey fans to cheer about.\n  This Boston Bruins team made history not just in the championship but \nin the way they got there. They are the first team in NHL history to \nwin a game 7 three times in the same postseason. They did it with a \nkind of hard-nosed, selfless, remember-the-fundamentals, play the \nbasics, gritty kind of teamwork that we in Boston admire so much.\n  During the Bruins' run to the championship, we got to witness a very \nspecial kind of pride and encouragement that came from our city. It was \na black and gold Bruins jersey on the statue of Paul Revere, and before \ngame 7 everybody got to see our injured forward, Nathan Horton, pouring \na bottle of Boston water onto the Vancouver ice. This team couldn't and \nwouldn't lose at home, and last night Horton's magic water turned \nVancouver into our home ice. Today all of New England is home to the \nworld's champion, the Boston Bruins.\n  I have to say with last night's victory, yet another Bruin legend was \nborn, goalie Tim Thomas. In seven spectacular games, again and again, \nTim turned back Vancouver and held the Canucks to eight goals the \nentire series. In the final shutout, Tim had 37 saves. So it was more \nthan appropriate that he was named the playoff's Most Valuable Player. \nI would say what Curt Schilling was to the 2004 Red Sox as Tim Thomas \nis to the Bruins today.\n  This Stanley Cup win is a victory for everyone in Massachusetts who \nhas ever laced up a skate and braved the black ice on frozen ponds \nearly in the morning, for every parent who has packed their kids into a \nminivan at 4 in the morning to get to practice. For everyone who \nremembers their heart skipping a beat when Bobby Orr sailed through the \nair in victory, for everyone who never stopped rooting for this team \nover a four-decade drought, we hear our own voices and the words of Tim \nThomas last night when he proclaimed:\n\n       You've been waiting for it a long time, but you've got it. \n     You wanted it, you got it. We're bringing it home.\n\n  Just as it was for the Red Sox for a long time, some people said this \nday was never going to come. Just as it was for the Red Sox, and a \ncurse that we no longer hear much about, some even blamed fate for the \ndrought. But after last night, Mr. President, Boston proved once again: \nNever underestimate an underdog. So, final score: Bruins 1, Fate, 0.\n  I am proud to offer my congratulations to the Bruins players, the \ncoaches, and the front office for a great series, for a great season, \nand for being great champions. This team never quit. They never lost \nfocus. They believed in themselves as individuals. Above all, they \nbelieved in themselves as a team. So we cannot wait for Saturday when \nwe will see the city of Boston's reflection in the polished silver and \nnickel of Lord Stanley's Cup. Welcome back to Boston.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I am honored to be able to \nspeak as well with my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry, to celebrate \nthis victory. I was 11 years old when it last happened. I come to the \nfloor to recognize the Boston Bruins and their thrilling season and 4-0 \nvictory in game 7 over Vancouver in the Stanley Cup finals.\n  I enjoy not being an avid skater like Senator Kerry. I am amazed at \nthe way they go all out and then just slam each other up against the \nboards and actually get up. I find that amazing. Obviously, they are \nbringing the Cup back, as Senator Kerry said, for the first time since \n1972.\n  We actually have a couple of Boston fans with us today. As my \ncolleagues know, it is also the home of the Beanpot tournament and some \nof the best college hockey in the country.\n\n  The Bruins made history last night by becoming the first team in the \nNHL to win three deciding game 7s in a single playoff run, twice \nrebounding from being down two games to none. For Bruins fans, \nincluding myself and everybody I was with last night, we were very \nexcited about the victories over the rivals from Montreal and then \nPhiladelphia, Tampa, and finally Vancouver. It made for a memorable \nmonth.\n  Being the big underdog before the series began, the Bruins played \ninspired hockey to win Lord Stanley's Cup, and they did it as a team. \nThey played outstanding defense against one of the best offensive teams \nin the NHL. Bostonians will never ever forget the sight of Captain \nChara standing 6 feet 9 inches tall, which I find truly amazing, \naccepting the Stanley Cup and lifting it high above the ice. Chara led \nthe incredible defensive effort in that series.\n  It was also an unforgettable moment for NHL veteran Mark Recchi. \nPlaying in his final NHL game last night, Recchi capped a great career \nthe way most professional hockey players can only dream about--with the \nStanley Cup in his hands moving around the ice. Last night, he said it \nwas one of the best groups of players he has ever played with. For \nthose of us who watched, we can attest that it was one fun team to \nwatch. It was a lot of fun. Everyone was so excited, regardless of \nwhether they were a Bruins fan, just to see the intensity with which \nthe series was played.\n  It was a mixture of youth and experience, hard physical play and \ngreat scoring touch that helped put together this run. Brad Marchand, a \nBruins rookie, has become a household name also with hockey fans after \nscoring an impressive 11 goals throughout the playoffs, setting the \nrecord for the most playoff goals by a Boston rookie and tying for \nsecond most in NHL history.\n  Patrice Bergeron, coming back from an injury that cost him two games \nearlier in the playoffs, scored the first goal in game 7 that set the \ntone. As Senator Kerry said, our clutch goalie, Tim Thomas, took home \nthe Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs. \nI didn't know a body could move like that, quite frankly. He was the \nconsummate professional, literally unbeatable, with shutouts in games 4 \nand 7.\n  Behind the bench, as my colleagues know, Coach Claude Julien led the \n``Bs'' with quiet confidence, even as his team faced daunting deficits \nand the devastating loss of forward Nathan Horton in game 3 of the Cup \nfinals. The home team had won each of the first three games, so while \nhe couldn't play, Horton was there to, as was referenced, take some \nBoston water and put it on the ice to make it our home ice. This is \nvindication for team president Cam\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nNeely, a Bruins great for so many years; Peter Chiarelli, the general \nmanager who put this great team together; and owner Jeremy Jacobs and \nhis team as well.\n  With the Bruins' Stanley Cup victory, the city of Boston can, in a \nclassy manner, celebrate this victory, as we have done before. As \nSenator Kerry also pointed out, we are very blessed in Massachusetts \nand in New England to have the Patriots, Red Sox, and Celtics to round \nout a decade that includes many world championships. Upon the arrival \nof the Stanley Cup in Boston today, the Bay State has hosted all four \nmajor championship trophies since 2005. As we all know, since 2002, the \nPatriots have won the Lombardi Trophy three times, the Red Sox have \ncaptured the World Series Trophy twice, and the Celtics have earned the \nO'Brien NBA Title Trophy once. That is an unprecedented run in sports \nhistory.\n  No longer left out, the Bruins can join a highly decorated group of \nteams that has never been matched. I didn't come down to the floor to \nbrag about Boston's reputation as the home of the greatest champions in \nprofessional sports. No, I have to say that the evidence is pretty \ncompelling on its own.\n  So with great pride as the junior Senator from Massachusetts, today I \nalso honor the 2011 Boston Bruins for their remarkable season and \ncommend them for their relentless pursuit of Lord Stanley's Cup. \nAnother championship banner will hang from the rafters of the TD Bank \nGarden, and I am very optimistic it will not be the last one for \nBoston, the hub of hockey.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, before our time expires, listening to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, he reminded me about Captain Chara, the \ndefenseman who raised the Stanley Cup last night, the tallest person \never to play in the National Hockey League. So that reminds me that, \ntherefore, we are also making history because never has the Stanley Cup \nbeen held so high over the ice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am happy to be here to listen to my \nfriends talk about hockey, and I will talk for just a minute about \nhockey. I was raised in the desert. When I came back as a Member of \nCongress, I wanted my boys to watch a hockey game. I wanted to watch \none. I had never watched one. So we went to a hockey game. I tell my \ncolleagues, it is a game you have to learn something about. For me, \nwith no hockey experience, it was pretty difficult. They are on the ice \njust a few minutes and then off, back and forth, and it is hard to keep \ntrack of it. But I did have the opportunity twice to watch the great \nGretzky and that was a great experience.\n  One of my most difficult, scary experiences of my life: There was a \ntime when--well, they still do--Las Vegas had a minor league hockey \nteam. I was asked to go out in the middle of that ice and drop a puck. \nI don't do very well, as demonstrated when a few weeks ago I slipped \nand fell and dislocated my shoulder on regular dirt. So to walk out on \nthat ice was something that was frightening to me, and I have never \nforgotten that. So to have those men rushing up and down those rinks \nthe way they do is truly astounding. My only heroism in hockey was my \nown heroism in convincing myself I should go out there.\n  Mr. President, our staffs have been working diligently for days now \nto find a path that would allow the Senate to complete action on the \njobs bill which is now on the floor. They have worked so hard on this \nbill because it is legislation to reauthorize the successful Economic \nDevelopment Administration, which has been so important to this country \nsince 1965. It is not an Obama piece of legislation. It was started by \nLyndon Johnson, and every President since then, Democratic and \nRepublican, has wrapped their arms around this legislation because it \nis so good for our country.\n  The Economic Development Administration has created jobs where they \nare most needed--in economically distressed communities. In just the \nlast 5 years, for $1.2 billion of investment, we have created 314,000 \njobs. The merits of reauthorizing this job-creating administration are \nso very clear. EDA works with businesses, universities, and leaders at \nthe local level, so it creates jobs from the bottom up. For every $1 we \ninvest as a government, we get $7 in return. It helps manufacturers and \nproducers compete in the global marketplace, and it is a great \ninvestment. Every $1 from EDA, as I have indicated, attracts $7 in \nprivate sector investment. That is a pretty good return.\n  Because of this agency's success and because each Senator is on \nrecord talking about the importance of creating jobs, including Senator \nBoxer in her capacity as the chair of that most important committee, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, she has produced this bill. \nShe has shown me statements by virtually every Senator in this Chamber \nabout the merits of this bill--Democrats and Republicans alike. So this \nis the kind of bill that should pass on a bipartisan basis, if not \nunanimously, and it has passed in the past unanimously. In the past, \nthat is what would have happened. We would have done this so quickly--\nbut no more.\n  Now we find ourselves struggling just to bring it up for a vote. I \nheard the Republican leader this morning speak earlier about the state \nof play on the EDA bill. He said we have gotten this done. We have this \nto do and this to do and this to do.\n  Here is a brief review for our colleagues, so far, of what we have \nhad on this bill. We have already had votes, again, on matters totally \nunrelated to this bill, including swipe fees, regulatory reform, \nethanol--three votes on that. We have 70 amendments that have been \nfiled. We have pending now a number of amendments relating to the debt \nlimit, to Wall Street reform, health reform, Davis-Bacon, and 66 others \nthat could be pending.\n  In addition, Senators have filed amendments that are related to \nimmigration reform, the border fence, E-Verify, the estate tax, right-\nto-work laws, gainful employment regulation, a series of amendments \ndealing with endangered species, light bulbs and other energy-efficient \nprovisions. There has been not a single amendment that has anything to \ndo with this bill, not a single thing that is germane to this bill.\n  So I am going to continue to work with the Republican leader and \nhopefully find a way to complete action on this extremely important \nbill. But it seems, so far, to be a never-ending process. It is \nfilibuster by amendment--amendment after amendment after amendment--\namendments that have nothing to do with the legislation.\n  We can't continue this. This process has to end so we can pass this \nbill, let the private sector create jobs the American people need, and \nlet the Senate move on to other pressing matters. I hope we can work \nsomething out, but in the meantime, I have no alternative as the leader \nof this Senate but to file cloture on this bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 782, a bill to \n     amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 \n     to reauthorize that act, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Frank R. Lautenberg, Thomas R. \n           Carper, Sherrod Brown, Sheldon Whitehouse, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Christopher A. Coons, Jon Tester, Benjamin \n           L. Cardin, Tom Udall, Jeanne Shaheen, Debbie Stabenow, \n           Patty Murray, Kent Conrad, Richard J. Durbin, Joe \n           Manchin III.\n\n\n                                REIP Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to engage the Senator from \nSouth Dakota in a colloquy to discuss the Reduce Excessive Interest \nPayments Act, the REIP Act, which is a stand-alone bill that the junior \nSenator from Georgia and I introduced in March, and which we offered as \nan amendment, Senate Amendment No. 407, to S. 782, the pending \nlegislation. The REIP Act protects homeowners from paying additional \ninterest on their Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages once \nthey have repaid the loan's principal.\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\n  At present, FHA allows lenders to charge interest on a mortgagor's \nloan through the end of the month, even if the mortgagor pays the loan \noff at the beginning of the month, to cover the contractual obligation \nto pay investors in mortgage backed securities for the full month. \nMortgagors with conventional mortgages or with Veterans Administration-\nbacked mortgages stop accruing interest once the principal is repaid, \ndespite there being a similar contractual obligation to pay such \ninvestors. I have deep concerns about the impact these excess interest \npayments have on FHA borrowers, who typically have limited resources, \nbut may end up paying more interest on their loans than other \nborrowers. While some might argue that this is merely an issue of \neducating the borrowers to encourage them to repay their principal at \nthe end of the month, I am skeptical about whether the FHA mortgagors, \nwho often repay their loans through selling their homes or refinancing \ntheir mortgages, have much ability to choose the day on which their \ntransaction closes and the principal is repaid.\n  I understand that the Banking Committee and the Department of Housing \n& Urban Development, HUD, are willing to work with Senator Isakson and \nme and our staffs to further understand this issue and make sure that \nFHA policies regarding interest charges protect borrowers to the extent \npossible. Is that right?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Yes, that is correct. My understanding \nis that HUD has been working to determine the impact of a change in how \ninterest is accrued on FHA loans and the Department is committed to \nworking with the junior Senator from Maryland on this issue. At the \nBanking Committee, my staff and I will also continue to study the issue \nand work with the Senator's staff and various stakeholders to discern \nthe impact that such a change would have on interest rates and on the \nmortgage-backed securities market. With help from the Department and \nthe junior Senators from Maryland and Georgia, we will move this \nprocess forward to bring about the best outcome for FHA borrowers.\n  I want to assure the junior Senator from Maryland that I share his \nconcern for FHA borrowers and am committed to pursuing policies that \nprotect borrowers while also ensuring robust real estate and mortgage \nmarkets. I thank my colleague for bringing this issue to the attention \nof the Senate and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Dakota for \nhis consideration, and I compliment him for the excellent work he has \ndone thus far in working to strengthen the real estate market and the \neconomy in general during the economic downturn. I am sure the Senator \nwill be pleased to learn that HUD committed to me and my staff that it \nwould deliver within the next 2 to 3 weeks an analysis of how many \nborrowers are affected by the current interest policy and are required \nto pay excess interest. The last data published are from 2000 to 2003 \nbut indicate what is at stake. Total excess interest payments from that \nperiod, according to the National Association of Realtors, amounted to \nmore than $1.3 billion. If hundreds of thousands of FHA borrowers could \nsave hundreds of millions of dollars in excess interest payments each \nyear, those savings could provide an economic stimulus in communities \nacross the Nation that would not cost taxpayers anything. Additionally, \nin the next 60 to 90 days, HUD will complete a study on the impact of \nchanging interest calculations on its systems, and those of large and \nsmall lenders, and share those results with the Banking Committee and \nme.\n  Mr. President, with these assurances and commitments from the \nchairman and from HUD firmly in place, I will withdraw the amendment I \noffered on behalf of myself and the junior senator from Georgia, Senate \nAmendment 407, at the appropriate time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3874-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT EFFICIENCY AND STREAMLINING ACT--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, before I leave the floor, I wish to say a \nword to and about my friend, the Senator from California. As I have \nindicated, she is the chair of this most important committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which I had the good fortune of \nchairing on two separate occasions. She has been tireless in bringing \nlegislation to this floor--attempting to. She has been talking about \nthis bill for months, about how good it is.\n  When she sat down and reminded me of the merits of this legislation, \nI thought: This should be a good one, a job-creating measure. We need \nthat right now. I have been very disappointed that we haven't been able \nto move forward. But it is not because of any lack of effort on her \npart.\n  She and I came to Washington together many years ago and served \ntogether in the House of Representatives. She is my friend, but she is \nalso one of the most outstanding legislators we have had in this body, \nbar none.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3874-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from Nevada, \nmy friend, the majority leader, Senator Reid, for his remarks, And I \nwant to thank him for filing cloture on the EDA bill. He said the \nEconomic Development Administration was started by Richard Nixon. \nActually it was continued by Richard Nixon. It was started by Lyndon \nJohnson in 1965 and supported by Presidents whether they were \nRepublican, Democrat, liberal, moderate, or conservative.\n  Congress has supported this legislation. The last time the EDA was \nauthorized, it was authorized by a voice vote in the Senate when George \nW. Bush was President and he signed it into law.\n  So one has to ask one's self: Why do we find ourselves in the middle \nof a filibuster? Why do we find ourselves with 91 amendments filed to \nthis little bill that takes a $500 million authorization and, because \nof the effect it has on the private sector, draws in private sector \nmatching funds 7 to 1 and means it is a $3 billion a year, basically, \njobs bill? This is a jobs bill. Every Republican and every Democrat I \nknow around here says: jobs, jobs, jobs. But they are killing another \njobs bill. I think the American people have to understand, this list of \namendments that has been filed--Senator Reid went through a few of \nthem. There is even one that relates to the prairie chicken. With all \ndue respect, there may be a lot of issues surrounding the prairie \nchicken, but it has nothing to do with an Economic Development Act \nbill.\n  It goes on and on. It talks about protecting free choice for workers \nto refrain from participating in labor unions. This sounds familiar \nfrom a Governor from the Midwest. It talks about amending the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act.\n  Let's face it, we were not born yesterday. I wish I were, but I was \nnot. The fact is--the print on this list is too small to even show up \non the screen--we have a three-page list of amendments. We have 91 \namendments filed to this bill--which is a jobs bill, which is a simple \nbill to reauthorize the Economic Development Administration's programs.\n  EDA is a great job creator. In our committee, every single Democrat \nand Republican, save one individual, voted for this bill. So it is \nbipartisan. It has been supported by Presidents since Lyndon Johnson. \nIt has created, over time, millions of jobs. We know this particular \nbill, at its current funding level, would support up to 200,000 jobs a \nyear or up to a million jobs over 5 years. And they are good jobs.\n  How does that happen? Because the EDA goes into local communities \nthat have high unemployment rates. They bring together the local \ngovernments,\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nthe State government, the private sector, the nonprofits, and they say: \nWhat do you want to do here to attract industry, to attract consumers \nhere? What do you want to do to rehabilitate this community?\n  Sometimes they say: We need a new road. We need a new water project. \nWe want to build an industrial park for new businesses. And this is \nwhat EDA does. So they are locally controlled ideas and a coming \ntogether of the Federal Government, the local government, the State \ngovernment, and the nonprofits in a beautiful package that has resulted \nin millions of jobs over time since it started.\n  Here is what I want to say today as I go through my statement. The \nfirst thing I want to say is, we know what the other side is doing. \nThey are killing these jobs bills by a frivolous list of amendment \nafter amendment after amendment that has nothing to do with the bill.\n  This is not the first time. In this very spot, a few weeks ago, stood \nanother Senator with a southern accent, Mary Landrieu from Louisiana. \nShe is the chairman of the Small Business Committee. She had a \nfantastic bill called SBIR. It is a small business innovation research \nprogram that has been in place since the 1980s, brought to us by a \nRepublican Senator named Warren Rudman.\n  Again, it is a bill that has always been without controversy. What \ndid they do to that bill, my Republican friends? Death by filibuster, \ndeath by amendment, kill that jobs bill right here on the floor.\n  If you put that in the context of everything the Republicans have \ndone since they picked up more seats around here, and they took over \nthe House, here is the list: They still have not appointed conferees to \nthe FAA, Federal Aviation Administration, bill conference. That bill \nwill create 280,000 jobs. It modernizes our airports. It gets rid of \nthe old ways we track planes and brings our air traffic control system \ninto the 21st century.\n  Senator Rockefeller has worked so hard. It is sitting over there \nwaiting for conferees. I am a conferee here on this side. I am waiting \nto go get this bill done. It is essential. It has a passenger bill of \nrights attached to it, which is so important. It will make sure our \nsystems work properly. It will put in place safety features. Jobs, \njobs, and jobs. They have not done a thing.\n  The patent bill. I had some problems with the patent bill because I \ndid not like one or two provisions. But the bottom line is, the patent \nbill is expected to create 300,000 jobs. It is sitting over in the \nHouse. No action. So since they took over, they have passed a bill to \ndestroy Medicare, destroy education--it is known as their budget. But \nwhen it comes to jobs, there is no beef. And we are perplexed.\n  This bill has attached to it--the EDA bill--now an ending of the \nethanol subsidy. I happened to vote for that. The fact of the matter \nis, whether you supported it or you did not, it is going to save \nbillions. So now the EDA bill is not only a jobs bill that leverages \nbillions of dollars to create jobs from the private sector, but it \nreduces the deficit because it has this amendment on ethanol.\n  I would say to my friends who may be listening from their offices, \nwhen we come back next week, vote ``yes'' to cut off debate and get \nthis bill done. Get this bill done.\n  I have talked about the fact that Senate Republicans have supported \nthis program continually. I wish to tell you some of the things they \nhave said about the EDA. Remember, I am quoting Senate Republicans who \nare trying to kill this bill by loading it up and filibustering it.\n  Twenty-six of the current Republican Senators have made positive \nstatements about EDA or put out great press releases in their States, \nand I agree with what they said.\n  For example, Senator Cochran of Mississippi praised the EDA grant \nintended to help spur economic development in northeast Mississippi. He \nsaid:\n\n       This region has suffered during the economic downturn, but \n     the Three Rivers has been diligent about working to help \n     create jobs. . . .\n\n  This is what he said about an EDA grant.\n  Senator Cornyn of Texas said a $2 million EDA grant for a water tower \nwill ``pave the way for creation of new jobs and business \nopportunities'' in Palestine, TX.\n  But they are filibustering this bill.\n  Senator Crapo says EDA business grants will help ``keep Idaho firms \non the cutting edge in various fields. . . .'' He says:\n\n       This can make Idaho firms successful, which translates into \n     more jobs and revenue in Idaho.\n\n  So my Republican friends, while they are trying to kill this bill by \nfilibuster, have said laudatory things about the EDA. You explain it to \nme. I think I have an answer as to why they are doing it. But I will \ncontinue.\n  Let's see what Senator Wicker said when he got a grant:\n\n       These federal dollars will fund rail improvements and help \n     bring new jobs and economic growth. . . . I am glad the \n     federal government has taken this step to continue its \n     investment in South Mississippi's recovery.\n\n  These are all the Republicans who are killing this bill with a \nfilibuster.\n  Senator Collins--a $1.1 million grant to fund renovations at Loring \nDevelopment Authority. She and Senator Snowe praised the EDA. They \nsaid:\n\n       This investment by EDA will allow for improvements and \n     upgrades . . . which in turn, will help encourage further \n     business growth. Loring will continue to be an economic \n     driver for the region, creating good jobs in Aroostook \n     County.\n\n  This is just a small sample of more than 26 Republican Senators who \nhave praised the EDA. Yet each one of them seems to be supporting \nendless debate, amendments that have nothing to do with the bill. But \nthey all have a chance to do the right thing on Tuesday and vote to cut \noff debate.\n  We have had some tough amendments to this bill already. It has gone a \ncouple of weeks. It is time we had a clean vote because--guess what--\njobs are what it is all about.\n  I am going to not go on too much longer, but I felt it is important \nto explain to the American people--who, by the way, give Congress an \n18-percent positive rating. Hello. Is it no wonder? We are doing \nnothing about jobs. Every time we try to do something, it is stymied.\n  I laid out what they have done, the Republicans. End Medicare as we \nknow it. By the way, pass a slew of abortion bills. It is unbelievable \nto me. And these straightforward jobs bills go nowhere. So do not tell \nme you are for jobs and then come down to this floor and offer \namendment after amendment on the prairie chicken, on the border fence, \non issue after issue that has nothing to do with this EDA bill.\n  EDA creates a job for every $3,000 invested. That is incredibly good. \nWe invest $3,000 and a good-paying job comes about. Why? Because the \nmatching funds come in.\n  This is the time we have a chance to create 200,000 jobs a year over \nthe 5 years of this bill. So here is the thing. Again, we need, in \nthese tough times, as we are going to get our arms around this \ndeficit--and here is the thing I find interesting: There is lots of \ntalk about how to cure the deficit from the other side. But they forget \nsome of the easiest ways to do it. One is, say to billionaires: Thank \nyou very much. You have gotten millions back a year. Let's go back to \nyour rate that you had when Bill Clinton was President. You made a \nfortune then. You will still make a fortune and help out with this \ndeficit, millionaires and billionaires.\n  Oh, they do not want to do that, our friends on the other side. They \nwant to destroy the EPA. They want to destroy the Department of Energy. \nThey want to destroy the Department of Education. They want to destroy \nMedicare. That is their answer. Why? To pay for tax cuts for the \nrichest of the richest of the richest. Explain to me how that helps the \nmiddle class in this great Nation.\n  Another way. You want to cure the deficit and the debt? End the wars. \nEnd the combat mission. Bring home the troops. Let's work \ndiplomatically in Iraq and Afghanistan. I met with the Afghanistan \nwomen who are struggling there. They do not want combat troops. They \nwant help to get a peace and reconciliation process going. It is time \nto end the wars.\n  Our highway trust fund, which is so critical, is short $6 billion. \nAnd it is difficult. That is the trust fund that pays for the highways, \nfor the bridges that are falling down, for the infrastructure \nimprovements for our transportation system. And I know it is hard to \nfind $6 billion.\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\n  But we are spending $12 billion a month on the wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. Bring the money home. It is time we spend it in this country \nfor our people. We are not going to walk away from our responsibility. \nWe are still going to have the counterterrorism going on. We are still \ngoing to protect our personnel who are there. We are still going to \nwork for peace and reconciliation.\n  But you want to talk about the ways to cure this deficit, it is not \nthat hard. We did it before, we can do it again. The Democrats balanced \nthe budget under Bill Clinton--the only time it was done in recent \nhistory--and we created 23 million jobs, not by threatening Medicare \nand Social Security, and the Department of Education, and the EPA, and \nthe Clean Air Act, and all of the things they are going after here, but \nby doing the right thing by our children and our grandchildren and \nmaking the right investment, to become energy independent.\n  So for me, the argument of not being able to do anything because of \nthe deficit, something is wrong with that. You have to cure the deficit \nproblem and make the investments that make sense. Here is an investment \nthat makes sense. For every dollar of EDA investment, you get $7 in \nprivate sector investment. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  I said this before, I will say it again: For every one job we create, \nit costs us approximately $3,000 per job. These are good jobs. It is a \nsmart program for us. That is why it has lasted since the 1960s. I said \nbefore, up to 200,000 jobs a year could be created here, 1 million jobs \nover the life of this bill. What are we doing loading down a beautiful \nbill such as this with all of these extraneous amendments?\n  We will look at a couple more charts. If you want to know how many \njobs were created between 2005 and 2010, 450,000 jobs, and 85,000 jobs \nwere saved. So we are not talking about some ethereal idea of a new \njobs bill. This is a jobs bill that has worked, and it is a jobs bill \nthat should not be filibustered. It should not be stalled. It should \nnot be loaded up with things that have nothing to do with it while the \nAmerican people worry and give us an 18-percent approval rating. I am \nsurprised it is that high at the rate we are going.\n  Look at some of the folks who support this: the United States \nConference of Mayors, the American Public Works Association, the \nNational Association of Counties, the AFL-CIO, the Council on \nCompetitiveness, the Association of University Research Parks, the \nNational Association of Development Organizations, the National \nBusiness Incubation Association, the State Science and Technology \nInstitute, and an arm of the Chamber of Commerce has come in with a \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to share with you the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce Business Civic Leadership Center (BCLC)'s \n     positive experience in working with the Economic Development \n     Administration (EDA). BCLC has worked with EDA on numerous \n     projects over the past ten years to help local communities \n     with their economic development, regional sustainability, and \n     disaster recovery initiatives. EDA has served as a valuable \n     partner in many communities that BCLC has worked in \n     including: San Jose, CA, Seattle, WA, Cedar Rapids, IA, \n     Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, Atlanta, GA, Boca Raton, FL, \n     Minneapolis, MN, Newark, NJ and many others.\n       We have worked with EDA on projects including:\n       Conducting regional forums designed to bring corporate \n     contributions professionals together with economic \n     development experts and civic sector innovators to discuss \n     how businesses' corporate citizenship practices can advance \n     the competitiveness and long-term development of their \n     communities.\n       Providing opportunities to build up relationships between \n     and among companies and government agencies at the local and \n     national levels.\n       Developing a report that maps how and why companies invest \n     in communities across the United States.\n       Writing a report on economic recovery and rebuilding in \n     Cedar Rapids after the flooding in 2008.\n       Sending economic development teams to cities across the \n     Gulf Coast to provide valuable oil spill recovery resources \n     and information.\n       Working with local chambers of commerce in disaster \n     affected areas regions to provide local recovery grants.\n       BCLC is the corporate citizenship arm of the U.S. Chamber \n     of Commerce, and in this capacity we work with thousands of \n     businesses and local chambers of commerce on community \n     development and disaster recovery issues across the country. \n     These local chambers and businesses are consistently looking \n     for national best practices, lessons learned, technical \n     assistance, planning and strategy support, and other \n     insights, tools, and techniques to make their communities as \n     economically competitive as possible.\n       In our experience, EDA staff members have displayed a high \n     degree of professionalism and technical expertise. They have \n     engaged with us on multiple levels, from consultations at the \n     national level, to sharing valuable field experience at the \n     state and local levels.\n       We have canvassed many businesses and local chambers about \n     their community development needs, and they almost \n     unanimously tell us that some of their highest local \n     priorities include business recruitment and retention, and \n     helping small and medium-sized businesses grow. They also \n     tell us that support for regional economic development \n     planning that transcends municipal boundaries is an \n     increasing area of interest, and that this is a unique \n     capability that EDA can and does support.\n       As you consider EDA's future roles and responsibilities, we \n     would be happy to share with you our experiences and lessons \n     learned in working with the agency, and to provide you with \n     additional information upon request.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Stephen Jordan,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                 Business Civic Leadership Center.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is a letter from an arm of the Chamber of Commerce. I \nwill tell you, it is rare when you get the AFL-CIO and an arm of the \nChamber of Commerce singing from the same book. They do not want to see \nfilibusters. They want to see jobs. They do not want to see \nfilibusters. They want to see progress. They want to see us work across \nparty lines.\n  So I kept asking during my remarks, why would they do this to us? Why \nwould they do this to the American people? I have an answer. I wish \nthis were not true, but it has been stated by some of the Republican \nPresidential candidates and it has been stated by the Republican leader \nhere: Their priority is defeating Barack Obama. Their priority is \ndefeating our President. Their priority is not job creation, it is not \nbusiness creation, it is not fair tax policy, it is defeating this \nPresident. When you look as it through that lens, then you say to \nyourself, wait a minute. If we got something done around here and the \nPresident had a signing ceremony--as we used to do in the good old days \nwhen we worked together--and he had a Republican here, a Democrat here, \nand an Independent there, and we all came together as we always have--\nunanimous consent. We passed this in 2004 by unanimous consent. They \nare afraid if we did that, the President would take out his pen and he \nwould sign this bill and we would create jobs. I hate to say it, but I \nam not making it up. That is what they have said. I hope over this \nweekend when we go home and we meet with our people, and they say, \nSenators, you have got to do something about jobs, I hope the public \nwill say to us, be we Democrats or Republicans: Do not filibuster jobs \nbills. We cannot afford to lose more jobs. We need to create jobs.\n  The EDA bill is a jobs bill. It was created as a jobs bill. It has \nbeen a jobs bill since 1965, signed by Presidents, passed by Congress, \nnever loaded down with amendment after amendment that is not germane, \nthat weighs it down. I hope the people at home will pay attention to \nthis.\n  I will say this: There is a pattern. This is not the first bill. I \ntold you about the small business bill, same thing; FAA bill, sitting \nover there, no conferees; patent bill, sitting over there, no action. \nAnd millions of jobs are at stake.\n  I just found this out about the small business bill that they killed \nhere a few weeks ago. Each year that bill provides support for 6,000 \nbusinesses, and over the lifetime of the program it has provided almost \n26,000 awards to firms in California to help them get started. That \nbill was filibustered to death. I do not get it, except if what I say \nis true and that is what the motivation is, and\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nall I can come up with. I have looked into the hearts of my friends and \nwondered how could they do this. They voted for this bill in committee. \nWhy would they load it up like this and put all of these amendments on \nit? There is only one reason, to not make progress. And who gets hurt \nby that? They think the President.\n  But I have news for them. America is going to wake up, because I am \ngoing to be here every day talking about this. I know my colleagues are \ngoing to be here talking about it. Jobs, jobs, and jobs. I hope this \nbill gets cloture and we can move on with it on Tuesday. That would be \na wonderful thing, if we do that. That is a change in the atmosphere. \nThen we can pass this bill and get on with the next jobs bill and pass \nthat bill and get on to the next jobs bill, and the spirits of the \npeople will be lifted. Look, we know government does not create the \njobs. The private sector creates most of the jobs. But the beauty of \nbills such as the SBA bill, that small business bill, is private sector \njobs. The beauty of this bill? Private sector jobs. So it would lift \nthe spirits of the people instead of having them watch this, watch me, \nand think: They will never get together and do anything. Then I will \nnot be shocked if our ratings--the Congress--hit the bottom of the \nbarrel. They are already close. I hope the people will insist on our \npassing these jobs bills. Things are tough out there. People are \nunemployed, they are underemployed. Businesses are sitting on mounds of \ncash. They have learned to be able to be profitable without hiring more \npeople.\n  Things are shifting. The sands are shifting between the middle class. \nThank God this President rescued the auto industry and that we had a \nmajority here to stand with him to do that. Thank goodness we took some \nof the steps that we took to get banks lending again when credit was \nfrozen. But you know what. Our progress is being stymied because \npartisanship has taken over the process. Partisanship means when you \nget bills out of a committee, people who voted for them suddenly \ndisappear. They are nowhere in sight, and they file all of these \namendments to bring down the bill.\n  We can only hope that when we come back next week there will be a \nchange of heart. I certainly hope so. I have been here a long time. I \nhave been in the House 10 years, here a lot of years, since 1993. I \nhave served with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. But I \nwant to say this. I fought hard when election time came. I just had \none. It was tough. You know that, Madam President, 2010 was tough. \nEvery time we have elections they are tough. That is the time that \npolitics is in your blood, it is in your veins. You are out there, you \nare working hard, you are fighting for your life.\n  But when we are here, we have to do the people's business. And \nhowever we feel about who we want to be President, who we admire, who \nwe did not admire, that ought to be left somewhere else. I hope it will \nbe left somewhere else. I hope that on Tuesday we vote for cloture on \nthis EDA bill. I would hate to see this die. I would hate to see this \ndie. Because when you deal a death blow to the EDA, you deal a death \nblow to 1 million jobs.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I come to the floor today, as I do each week, as a \ndoctor who practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, as someone who \nhas taken care of families all around the State of Wyoming, as a doctor \nwho has great concerns about what has happened to the American health \ncare system, and will continue to happen under the health care law that \nhas been passed by this body and signed into law at the insistence of \nthis President.\n  I come as a doctor giving a second opinion, because I have great \nconcerns about this health care law. In talking with patients, in \ntalking with doctors, and from my own personal knowledge, I believe \nthis health care law is going to be bad for patients, bad for \nproviders--the nurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--\nand bad for the payers, the taxpayers of this country who are going to \nbe left to pay the bill.\n  Recently my friends on the other side of the aisle have been using \nwhat I believe to be significant scare tactics about my party and \nMedicare.\n  Medicare is the program for our senior citizens. I believe it is \nimportant that the American people receive the truth. They deserve to \nhave the truth about the future of Medicare, not scare tactics.\n  The fact is, unless Congress takes action, Medicare will go broke in \n13 years. Again, in 13 years, Medicare will go broke. Today, more money \nis going out than is coming in. A bankrupt Medicare equals no Medicare \nfor our seniors. These are people who have paid into Medicare, but a \nbankrupt Medicare means no Medicare.\n  If Washington doesn't show leadership now--today, this year--this \nprogram will run out of money and Medicare patients will run out of \ncare. Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to \nignore the ticking clock and ignore reality.\n  Let's take a look at some of the reality the other side is ignoring. \nThey are ignoring the fact that the life expectancy in the United \nStates has risen significantly since Medicare was signed into law. When \nMedicare became law, in 1965, the average life expectancy was about 70. \nSo, on average, you are talking about people being on Medicare for a \ncertain number of years. Now, with the advances of medicine, the life \nexpectancy is almost 80--the high seventies for men, but the low \neighties for women. People are living about 10 years longer now, on \naverage, than at the time Medicare was signed into law in 1965. It is \nan undeniable fact.\n  Another fact is that there are about 10,000 new Medicare recipients \nadding to the rolls every day as the baby boomers turn 65. An entire \ngeneration of baby boomers is retiring. The other side seems to ignore \nthe fact that there are far more retirees today than ever before, and \nthey are getting more money paid out of the program than they ever put \nin. I have townhall meetings and I travel around my State of Wyoming. \nPeople say: I paid into Medicare. They are absolutely right. On \naverage, a couple who is retiring this week has paid into Medicare \nabout $110,000--that is over a lifetime of working. That is significant \nmoney they have paid in. What kinds of services will they receive over \nthe remainder of their lifetime, adjusted for today's dollars? It is \n$343,000. So you are talking about $109,000 that they paid into the \nsystem, and they are taking out $343,000.\n  American seniors know Medicare is in trouble. They understand the \nmath doesn't add up, that this $3 coming out for every $1 paid in \ncannot work forever and ever. My friends on the other side, who attack \nRepublicans for wanting to address this problem in a responsible way, \ntend to want to ignore this reality.\n  To make matters worse, Members on the other side actually voted for a \nhealth care law that puts Medicare on an even faster track to \nbankruptcy. In fact, the President's health care law cuts $500 billion \nfrom Medicare--not to save or strengthen or secure Medicare for the \nnext generation. No, they took $500 billion from our seniors on \nMedicare to start a whole new government program for someone else. So \nit was no surprise to me when I read recently that those folks who look \nat the numbers, who work for the government, say Medicare is going to \nbe broke 5 years sooner than even they had anticipated. It is odd how \nDemocrats never even mention this when they attack Republican plans to \nsave Medicare. Well, when they run advertisements and hold press \nconferences focused on scare tactics, why don't they ever explain their \nown $500 billion cut to Medicare?\n  It is also odd to me that the Democrats never talk about the other \nvery significant piece of the President's health care law that attacks \nour seniors on Medicare. Hidden away in the bill is the President's \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. As a doctor who practiced \nmedicine for 25 years in Casper, WY, I can tell you what this board is. \nIt is a rationing board--a board to ration the health care of our \nseniors.\n  Rationing, some may say, is a very strong word. But that is exactly \nwhat\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nit is. The President's health care law puts Medicare on the road to \nrationing. This health care law creates an unelected, unaccountable \nboard of Washington bureaucrats, who will decide how much Medicare pays \nfor certain Medicare services.\n  Starting in 2014, after the next Presidential election, members of \nthe board will decide how much they will reimburse hospitals and \ndoctors for taking care of Medicare patients. Then providers all across \nthis country will have to decide whether they can continue to care for \nAmerican seniors.\n  Let's face it, even today doctors are running away from taking care \nof patients on Medicare. According to the American Medical Association, \none in three primary care doctors already limits how many Medicare \npatients they are willing to see. According to the same survey of the \nAmerican Medical Association, 60 percent of doctors say they are \nlooking for ways to get out of Medicare completely.\n  Even more providers are going to stop seeing Medicare patients, and \nthis situation will continue to get worse. If you don't believe me, ask \nseniors in your own community what happens when their doctor retires. \nAsk somebody on Medicare how easy it is for them to find a doctor to \ntake care of them. If they happen to be with a doctor, and they turn \n65, ask if they are allowed to stay with that doctor or if they move to \nanother community to be closer to their children and grandchildren, ask \nthem how difficult it is for those on Medicare to find a doctor. The \nreason is, of course, because Medicare pays a lot less than the going \nrate.\n  Yet, the Democrats' and the President's solution is to pay even a \nlower amount and continue to ration and ratchet down that amount, \nresulting significantly in additional rationing of care as our seniors \nfind it harder and harder to find physicians and nurses to take care of \nthem.\n  The other thing about this rationing board is that it gets worse when \nyou look at the details. It will be practically impossible for this \nCongress--or any Congress--to overturn the rationing board's \nrecommendations.\n  Again, to me it seems very odd that my friends on the other side \ndon't talk about this rationing board when they hold their Medicare \nevents. But as Nancy Pelosi said, first you have to pass it before you \nget to find out what is in it. The American people continue to find out \nwhat is in this health care law, and they continue to oppose it. I say \nto my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if you are so proud of \nthe work you have done on Medicare, then you should stand and defend \nthis rationing board. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nshould explain to American seniors how it will work and how it will \nimpact their care. America deserves a thorough and honest debate about \nthe future of Medicare, how we got to this point, and how we can, in a \nresponsible way, strengthen and secure Medicare for those on Medicare \nand for the next generation.\n  I bring this to you today because today a new study came out in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine. It has to do not with Medicare--a \nprogram for our seniors--but with Medicaid, a program for low-income \npeople--specifically, in many cases, for children. The study from the \nNew England Journal of Medicine today talks about how very difficult it \nis for people--specifically children--on Medicaid to even get an \nappointment to see a doctor.\n  During the health care debate over the last year, I have come to the \nfloor continuously and talked about the fact that many physicians \nrefuse to take patients on Medicaid, because the reimbursement from the \ngovernment is lower than the cost of actually even treating the \npatient--considering rent, office expenses, and other costs.\n  This study out today in the New England Journal of Medicine talks \nabout researchers in Chicago who called a number of doctors' offices \nwith an identical voice, the same person calling--actually, the same \noffice--a month apart with the same symptoms, whether it was for asthma \nor different conditions such as diabetes, for the child's care, and the \nquestion came: Do you have insurance or are you on Medicaid?\n  What they found is that for 89 percent of those with insurance, they \nwere able to get an appointment--regular insurance. Of those saying, \nno, we have Medicaid--and they called hundreds and hundreds of offices \nand clinics--only one in three was able to get an appointment. Think \nabout that. It is something for our seniors to think about, as well as \nthe President's rationing board. It pays less and less for a visit to a \ndoctor.\n  We have talked about the fact that Medicare rates, as a result of the \n$500 billion cut from Medicare, will be in many places similar to \nMedicaid rates. So I would assume that at some point soon seniors will \nhave the exact same amount of trouble getting an appointment to see a \nphysician, as the New England Journal of Medicine found today, for \nchildren on Medicaid.\n  With that, I say that I will continue to come to the Senate floor \nweek after week with a doctor's second opinion about the health care \nlaw, because week after week we see new information, new relevant \ninformation about how the impact of this broad, sweeping law, \nsignificant changes for the health care of all Americans--how it is, in \nmy opinion, bad for patients, bad for providers, the nurses and doctors \nwho take care of them, and bad for taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the proceedings \nthat just occurred in this body with regard to ethanol and to talk \nabout how I see them from the perspective of my home State of Delaware.\n  Today, the Senate agreed on a path forward to end Federal subsidies \nfor corn-based ethanol. As Senators, we are often asked to make tough \nchoices, and the bipartisan votes on today's amendments were largely a \nreflection of where we are from.\n  For Delaware, agriculture is the single largest part of our economy. \nWe grow a lot of corn, we grow a lot of soybeans, we have companies \ninvesting in advanced biofuels, and we have a major poultry industry. \nToday, I voted for Delaware's poultry growers and for our consumers. \nLots of folks across this country in the last few years have lost their \njobs, lost their homes, and lost their livelihoods. It is very \nimportant to me that the people of Delaware know, on the record, that \nthe vote I cast today to end Federal subsidies for ethanol was about \nmaking sure we are supporting our home State poultry industry.\n  My main concerns are that one of the most important economic \nengines--not just in Delaware but in the whole Delmarva Peninsula--is \nthe poultry industry. That industry has its back against the wall and \nis struggling to survive. At a time when many other agricultural \nindustries are seeing record prices--and that is a positive, a boon for \nthem--for the poultry industry, the rising cost of feed is forcing \ndecades-old companies to rethink their business models or, sadly, as in \none case just last week for one of the most important and vital poultry \ncompanies in Delaware, to shut their doors and go into bankruptcy.\n  We need to move away from corn-based ethanol and toward homegrown \nadvanced biofuels if we are going to accomplish three goals at the same \ntime. One is to reduce our deficit, to end unwise and unnecessary \nFederal spending; second is to support and advance and defend our \npoultry industry, whether in Delmarva or throughout the rest of the \ncountry; and third is to continue to make progress toward the future of \nclean, promising biofuels that are not from grain.\n  The amendment I just voted for closes the door on corn-based ethanol, \nbut that should not prevent us from finding a path forward to advanced \nbiofuels, those not from grain, whether cellulosic ethanol or drop-in \nbiofuels from algae or otherwise.\n  Today, I also filed an amendment with Senator Carper, the senior \nSenator from Delaware, that makes it clear that as we close the door on \ncorn-based ethanol, we need to do two other things going forward: \nfirst, use those billions of dollars in savings to reduce the deficit \nand, second, redirect funds, formerly committed to VEETC, to support an \nimportant but just beginning, a nascent advanced biofuels industry.\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\n  Ultimately, the policies we pursue should lead to American consumers, \nproducers, and farmers using less petroleum and, more importantly, \nusing less oil from overseas sources. If we are going to reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels and especially on those we import from \noverseas, we are going to need to continue to pursue a range of cleaner \nand more secure sources of energy. Advanced biofuels are central to \nthis effort. Now that we have taken the important first step by \nadopting the Feinstein-Coburn amendment and signaling the intent of \nthis body to end Federal subsidies to corn-based ethanol, I hope we \nwill also responsibly pay down our Federal deficit and continue a \nstrong path forward toward the advanced biofuels that Delawareans are \nmaking a significant contribution toward making a reality.\n  As my colleague from California has noted, corn-based ethanol has \nhistorically been supported by three policies: the volumetric ethanol \nexcise tax credit, known as VEETC, which provides a 45 cent per gallon \ntax credit to gasoline suppliers who blend ethanol with gasoline; a \ntariff of 54 cents per gallon on imported ethanol, which is largely \ntargeted at sugarcane ethanol from Brazil; and a requirement that \nmandates the use of ethanol in gasoline by set amounts every year, \nincreasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022.\n  VEETC and the import tariff may have been needed in the past to stand \nup the nascent corn-based ethanol industry, but experts agree that the \nindustry has matured, and these two supports are no longer needed.\n  At a time when our federal government is facing a massive deficit and \nspiraling debt, we need to take a hard look at how we spend our \ntaxpayer dollars. These subsidies are expensive, and studies have shown \nthem to have dramatic impacts on our federal budget as well as on the \ncost of corn feed used by chicken farmers, including those in Delaware. \nThis year alone, VEETC will cost taxpayers $6 billion. We just can't \nafford to maintain this duplicative and wasteful subsidy.\n  Delaware's chicken farmers can't afford it either. Most economists \nand market analysts agree that the steady growth in ethanol demand has \nhad a dramatic effect on the price of corn. This cost has trickled down \nto related agricultural markets, including food, feed, fuel, and land. \nThe average annual price of corn has jumped 225 percent just in the \npast 5 years. Last week, corn futures reached nearly $8 a bushel, which \nis 140 percent over last year.\n  The No. 1 cost for chicken farmers is feed, and farmers in Delaware \nare feeling the pinch. One major poultry company declared bankruptcy \nlast week, and it cited the high cost of corn feed as a major factor. \nCouple this with rising energy costs, trade barriers, and low chicken \nprices, and you can see why many poultry companies are nearing a \nbreaking point.\n  Something must be done. The VEETC credit and the tariff are no longer \nworth the investment. It is past time that we repeal these subsidies, \nand I was proud to vote for the Feinstein-Coburn amendment to do so.\n  At the same time, let me be clear: the Feinstein-Coburn approach is \nonly part of a larger effort. In addition to ending VEETC and the \ntariff, we must also do much more to promote investment in the \nresearch, development, and deployment of advanced biofuels, including \ncellulosic and drop-in biofuels. These will help us reduce our \ndependence on petroleum and encourage further innovation. We need to \nprovide greater certainty to help launch a next-generation biofuels \nindustry through the extension of tax credits and other federal \nprograms for certain targeted advanced biofuels.\n  Many concerns are raised because corn ethanol dominates the U.S. \nbiofuels market. But what is our ultimate goal? Shouldn't it be about \ngreater fuel efficiency and product diversity in our domestic \ntransportation sector? First, that can be achieved through increased \nfuel economy standards. Second, it can also come from technological \nalternatives like electrification, natural gas and hydrogen fueled \nvehicles. Third--and most important for what we are debating here \ntoday--it will come from developing commercially viable, advanced \nbiofuels.\n  There are legitimate concerns about corn ethanol's economic and \nenvironmental impacts, but we should also not be cutting off our nose \nto spite our face. For this reason, I have filed an amendment that \nmakes it clear that we should be redirecting the repeal of the VEETC to \ndeficit reduction and the extension of advanced biofuels for 5 years to \nprovide a long-term signal to this small but emerging industry.\n  I want to be part of a solution that provides a strong, long-term \nfuture for our Nation's alternative fuels industry. I want to see \ndomestically produced, next-generation feedstocks grow. This would be \nfrom cellulosic, biodiesel, and drop-in fuels like methanol and \nbutanol. They could come from different feedstocks, such as recycled \ngrease, wood, corn stover, switch grass, municipal waste, algae, and \nlivestock manure. Right now there is little to no commercial \nproduction, but we need to support those efforts with new incentives \nfor these fuels and bio-refineries. Most importantly, we need to work \non bringing down the costs and expanding their markets.\n  In Delaware, inventive companies are already hard at work researching \ncutting-edge biofuel systems, including ones that produce energy from \nsoybeans and algae. One such company is Elcriton in Newark, which is \nproducing drop-in fuels from duckweed, an aquatic plant that can be \nused to produce fuel. Another company headquartered in Delaware--\nDuPont--working with partners around the country on both cellulosic and \nbiobutanol technologies. None of these fuels compete with the price of \nlivestock feed. I am proud of the biofuel innovation taking place in my \nState, and I want to replicate this model across the country.\n  In addition, this growth of advanced biofuel innovation has the \npotential to lead to new economic opportunities not only for energy \ncompanies and consumers but also for Delaware chicken farmers. Today, \nof great concern to them is the price of corn on the input end of farm \noperations, but--hopefully, not too far down the road--a significant \nfactor on their balance-books may soon be earnings from waste that can \nbe sold for biofuels.\n  Ultimately, the policies we pursue should lead to American consumers, \nproducers, and farmers using less petroleum. If we are going to reduce \nour dependence on fossil fuels, particularly those imported from \noverseas, we are going to need to pursue a range of cleaner and more \nsecure sources of energy. Advanced biofuels are central to this effort, \nand, now that we have taken the first step by adopting the Feinstein-\nCoburn amendment, I hope the Senate will take the next step as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our Nation's challenges grow by the day. \nThe citizens of Utah get this. The citizens in this country get this.\n  A recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found that 62 percent of \nAmericans think the country is on the wrong track. Only 37 percent of \nAmericans approve of the President's job of handling the economy. I \nwould like to meet those people, because when I talk to Utahns, the \nnumbers are much lower than that, and I understand why.\n  Applications for unemployment have been above 400,000 for 7 straight \nweeks. Economic growth is stagnant. Job growth is pathetic. The real \nestate market remains in free-fall. Since 2007, housing values have \ndropped by more than during the Great Depression.\n  Medicare is going bankrupt, and when it does, it will take down this \ncountry and tens of millions of seniors with it. Yet President Obama \nand his Democratic allies steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that there \nis a problem with Medicare. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, when asked \nwhere the Democrats' reform plan was, responded:\n\n       We have a plan. It's called Medicare.\n\n  Meanwhile, the President's handpicked chairwoman of the Democratic\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\nNational Committee gleefully demagogs Republicans' efforts to fix this \ndying program.\n  There are legitimate fears that the Federal Reserve's loose money \npolicy is creating yet another stock market bubble that could pop and \ndestroy the retirement savings of millions of Americans. Most \nominously, PIMCO, the world's largest bond fund manager, is looking to \ncountries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, countries \nwithout our massive fiscal problems, to invest. As I have said before, \nthere is a genuine risk that the United States is in a debt bubble. \nBecause of historically low interest rates, we may be totally \nunderestimating how dangerously leveraged this country is. But the \nminute rates start going up, citizens are going to realize how much \nthey are on the hook for. When the word on the street is that U.S. \nTreasurys are not worth investing in, higher interest rates are just \naround the corner.\n  So we have a lot of work to do, but I wish to touch on three things \nwe should be doing now, and I mean right now. The people are demanding \naction, and there are a few things Congress can do that would bring \nrelief to struggling American families.\n  First, the President needs to submit the Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorean Free Trade Agreements to Congress. They are long overdue. The \nfailure to submit these agreements has stalled U.S. job growth at a \ntime when it is desperately needed. There is only upside to these \nagreements. Consider that from Utah alone, South Korea imported more \nthan $294 million of goods in 2009.\n  The former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Doug Holtz-\nEakin, has it right. This is what he said earlier this week in a letter \nto the President:\n\n       Opening Colombia, South Korea, and Panama to U.S. \n     businesses is anticipated to increase total exports by $12 \n     billion, and will add at least $14 billion to the United \n     States gross domestic product, promoting increased investment \n     and job creation at home.\n\n  While the President is down in Florida yukking it up with rich \nliberals about how he wasted nearly $1 trillion on his stimulus \nboondoggle, he seems oblivious to the fact that he could just hit send, \ndeliver these agreements to Congress, and have a trade-driven economic \nstimulus.\n  If given a clean up-or-down vote, I am confident these agreements \nwould pass. I have no doubt who would prevail if that debate were \nallowed to happen. But old habits die hard.\n  The President's spend-first mentality is cluttering what should be a \nclean debate on the benefit of these free-trade agreements for the \nAmerican economy. Rumors persist that the President may include a \nreauthorization of an expanded trade adjustment assistance bill into \none or perhaps all the bills implementing our trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea. This would be a grave mistake. That \ntactic raises serious procedural concerns which could jeopardize \napproval of these job-creating agreements.\n  It also raises serious concerns about the President's commitment to \ngaining approval of our long-stalled trade agreements with these \nimportant allies. It would send a signal that further placating unions \nis more important than growing our economy, a position I simply cannot \nunderstand or support. If the President chooses this course of action, \nhe needs to know I will vigorously oppose him and reserve the right to \nuse all procedural options available to do so. If, as the President \nsays, there is such strong bipartisan support for trade adjustment \nassistance, it should be considered on its own merits and not thrust \nupon an unwilling Congress through procedural shenanigans.\n  These trade agreements are something Washington can do, and should \ndo, to get our economy back on track. But we must also be vigilant in \nfighting against proposals that would undermine our economy and our \nsovereignty.\n  Standard & Poor's recently downgraded Greece's debt rating to CCC, \nfrom a B. This is the world's lowest rating, and S concluded that a \ndefault on Greek debt was increasingly likely.\n  So what was the President's response? Like the Siren's Call, a \nbailout beckoned. He seemed to go all in for an IMF bailout of Greece. \nGreece has already been bailed out once by the IMF, to the tune of $145 \nbillion. We cannot let this happen again. That is why today I am \ncosponsoring the anti-IMF bailout amendment with my good friends, \nSenators DeMint, Vitter, and Cornyn.\n  This amendment, which we filed to the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act, would rescind bailout funds provided in 2009 to the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Under the urging of the Obama \nadministration, additional funding of up to $108 billion was given to \nthe IMF which it can use to bail out heavily indebted European \ncountries such as Greece.\n  The amendment I am cosponsoring would roll that funding back. Now is \nnot the time, when Americans are struggling to find work and have \nbudget problems of their own, to tap innocent American taxpayers in \norder to bail out profligate European governments. Rather, it is time \nto stop our own runaway spending and our continued movement toward \nEuropean levels of government. If we go down that route, the \ndestination is an America very different than the one our Founders \nintended, and it is critical we hit the brakes now and save our limited \nconstitutional government.\n  The American people are tired of bailouts. When ordinary Americans \nare struggling to get by and when our country faces its own debt \ncrisis, the last thing we need is a bailout of irresponsible Socialist \ngovernments and the irresponsible investors who bet on them, which \nbrings me to my final point.\n  Earlier this week, my colleague and friend from Florida, Senator \nMarco Rubio, gave his maiden speech in the Senate. He is certainly to \nbe commended. I sat here and listened to him. It was a tour de force, \nand I recommend that all my colleagues, and, for that matter, all the \ncitizens of this Nation read it. He made it clear that he is confident \nin this Nation and our ability to weather the current storm and emerge \nin rich and steady seas.\n  America's best days are ahead of it. America has been and will always \nbe a shining city on a hill. But for there to be another American \ncentury, a century of liberty and prosperity both here and abroad, we \nhave our work cut out for us.\n  America is over $14 trillion in debt. We face our third straight year \nof trillion-dollar deficits. We have entitlement programs that are \ngoing bankrupt. Under this Presidency, we have lifted the debt ceiling \nthree times and the last one, if I recall correctly, was about $1.9 \ntrillion and we have basically just given the administration an open \ncheckbook. We have entitlement programs that are going bankrupt.\n  Our total obligations, according to one account, are over $62 \ntrillion. This is a debt burden that is simply unsustainable. We need \nto get our spending under control immediately; otherwise, American \nfamilies and citizens will be crushed under the weight of all this \ndebt.\n  The other side keeps telling us the problem is a lack of revenue. \nThey say all we need to do is raise taxes and eliminate tax loopholes. \nNever mind the fact that raising taxes threatens to kill the small \nbusinesses that will be the engines of our economic recovery, and never \nmind the fact that these so-called loopholes include the IRAs, 401(k)s, \nand charitable deductions of American taxpayers.\n\n  Let's not make any bones about it. The left's proposal to gut tax \nexpenditures would put a bull's-eye on the backs of working families \nwho have mortgages and save for the future.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanship, as an aside to some of my friends on \nmy side of the aisle who seem to think all expenditures are wasteful \nspending, consider the following: The third largest tax expenditure is \nthe current lower rates for capital gains and dividends. Be careful, my \nfriends; otherwise, you might end up inadvertently finding yourselves \nsharing the stage with my friend, the junior Senator from Vermont, in \neffect, advocating for a sharp hike in the rates of capital gains and \ndividends.\n  Even if liberal Democrats did all these things, raising taxes on \nmiddle Americans and further hindering economic growth, we still would \ncome nowhere close to balancing the budget.\n  This is the dirty secret of President Obama and Democratic leadership \nto\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nengage in meaningful efforts to balance the budget. As my colleague \nfrom Alabama, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, notes, \nit has been more than 770 days since Democrats passed a budget. That is \ndisgraceful. For over 2 years, congressional Democrats have simply \nabdicated their most basic constitutional responsibility, and here is \nwhy. They have refused to cut spending, and they know balancing the \nbudget for new taxes alone would be perceived as a full-blown assault \non personal liberty and limited government. So instead of offering up a \nbogus budget, as the President did, and get laughed out of town, or \noffering up a proposal for balance that satisfies their liberal base, \nraises the tax burden to historic levels, and inspires the vitriol of \ntheir constituents, Democrats decided to keep their mouths shut.\n\n  Where does that leave us? The answer, to me, is clear. We need to \npass a balanced budget constitutional amendment. This is where the \nentire Republican caucus stands in the Senate. The amendment I \nintroduced, S.J. Res. 10, is supported by every single Senate \nRepublican. I bet it is the first time all Republican Senators have \nsupported it. It is a good amendment that benefited from the input of \nmany Senators, and it is a necessary amendment.\n  Some people--the sophisticated set--argue this is not a serious \nproposal. The American people beg to differ. They know Congress will \nnot balance the budget and shrink the size of government without \nmeaningful constitutional restraints. The actions of Democrats and \nPresident Obama over the last few months are all the evidence we need \nto support this hypothesis. Facing a full-blown debt crisis, they still \nprefer to kick the spending can down the road.\n  I want to be clear that I am deadly serious about this proposal, and \nso are the people of Utah. I have been pleased to work side-by-side \nwith my colleague from Utah, Senator Mike Lee, on the balanced budget \namendment, and Senator Cornyn and all the other Republicans. Some \npeople might say Mike Lee and I are an odd couple. I have a few years \non him, and I don't tend to be as animated as he is. He is a great \nyoung man with a lot of energy. But we share at least one thing, an \nabsolute commitment to passing a balanced budget constitutional \namendment and sending it to the people in the States for ratification. \nThe people are demanding that we act, and it is well past time that we \nrecognize their constitutional sovereignty and allow them to exercise \nit through State ratifying conventions.\n  I would like to commend Senator Lee for his tireless work on this \namendment. He is not the only one who deserves thanks, however. My \ncolleagues, Senators Cornyn, Kyl, Toomey, DeMint, Rubio, Paul, and many \nother Republicans were essential in the development of this amendment, \nbut it is special for me to be working with my friend, Senator Lee, on \nthis critical constitutional amendment. He is a legitimate \nconstitutional scholar, a steadfast advocate of our constitutionally \nlimited government, and a hero to many. I could not be more proud to \nstand with him and lead this fight for the people of Utah and the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  If the American people said anything last fall, it is they want their \nrepresentatives in Washington to listen to them. They know we will not \nget it right every time, but they know we should always do our best to \nrepresent their values and their interests. This Congress needs to \nlisten to the people. It needs to get these trade agreements done \nwithout holding them hostage to unrelated spending. It needs to say no \nto more bailouts, and it needs to pass a balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  In this country, the people are sovereign. I would have to say, if we \nwould pass that constitutional amendment through the Senate, I believe \nwe would get it through the House, and then it is up to the States. We \nstill have to get three-quarters of the States to ratify it.\n  To the extent that Democrats hate the constitutional amendment and \nhate that kind of restraint on their spending practices, they can lead \nthe battle in the States. The problem is, they know this constitutional \namendment would be ratified so fast our heads would be spinning.\n  We need 38 States to ratify a constitutional amendment, and that is \nnot easy under anybody's view. In this country let's let the people \ndecide that. They are sovereign. It is well past time that Congress and \nthe President listen to them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as has the Presiding Officer, I have \nserved both in the House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate, and \nduring the course of my career, I have been called on to make many \nvotes. Most of them fade into obscurity after they are cast and are \nnever recalled, but there are a few we will remember for our lifetimes.\n  I would say the highest level in that category are the times when we \nare called upon as Members of Congress to consider a declaration of \nwar. Many of us have lost sleep over those decisions. We have thought \nabout those votes long and hard. No matter how just the war may be or \nhow important it may be, we cannot help but reflect on the fact that at \nthe end of the day, people will die as a result of our decisions if we \ngo forward in terms of a declaration of war. I have lost sleep over \nthose decisions.\n  I have tried during the course of making those decisions to be guided \nby several principles.\n  First, as Members of the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, \nwe swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. I feel as though that \nConstitution is my starting point for my responsibility and my rights \nas a Member of the U.S. Senate when it comes to this issue.\n  The Constitution is very clear in article I, section 8, clause 11, \nthat only the Congress can declare war. The decision was made by our \nFounding Fathers that the people of the United States literally would \nhave a voice in this decision. It wouldn't be a decision made only by \nthe Chief Executive because ultimately the people and their families \nand their children would pay the price of a war in human terms--the \nloss of life--and, of course, in the cost of war borne by our Nation.\n  I am also guided by my responsibility to the people who were kind \nenough to give me this opportunity to serve. I think about my State of \nIllinois and the families, the mothers, fathers, and children all \nacross that State who could be affected by a decision if our Nation \ngoes to war.\n  I also like to think about whether the war is absolutely necessary in \nterms of the defense of the United States of America.\n  Some cases are easier calls. When we were attacked on 9/11, many of \nus knew that 3,000 innocent Americans had died at the hands of \nterrorists. I didn't hesitate to vote for a declaration of war against \nthose forces in Afghanistan responsible for that attack on the United \nStates.\n  We went through a parallel debate at the same time about the invasion \nof Iraq. I did not believe the previous President made a compelling \ncase for the invasion of Iraq. If my colleagues will recall, at that \ntime the debate was about weapons of mass destruction that could \nthreaten the Middle East or even the United States. I voted against \nthat declaration of war on Iraq. Twenty-three of us did in the Senate--\n22 Democrats and 1 Republican. We came to learn that there were no \nweapons of mass destruction. Many of the threats which gave rise to the \nPresident's request turned out to not be factual at all. Well, we are \nfinally--finally--more than 10 years later, starting to bring those \ntroops home from Iraq, and we have paid a heavy price in Americans\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\nkilled and maimed and in the cost to our Nation.\n  Each time we have been challenged as a Senate and as a House to \nconsider a declaration of war, I have thought long and hard about it: \nmy constitutional responsibilities, my responsibilities to the people \nof my State, and whether such a war was absolutely necessary.\n  Now we are engaged in three wars--wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in \nLibya. Shortly, we will be considering the authority of the President \nof the United States to continue our involvement in Libya. I am going \nto apply the same constitutional standard and standards of judgment to \nthat decision that I have to every other declaration of war or every \nother approval of engagement in hostilities by the United States as I \nhave in the past.\n  This President is my friend. He was my colleague in the Senate. We \nare of the same political party. But when it comes to an issue of this \ngravity, we have to move beyond any personal considerations when it \ncomes to the President and think about our Nation, our Constitution, \nand our responsibility to the people we represent.\n  We have learned during the course of our history that Presidents \ndon't always come to Congress when they initiate a war. President \nFranklin Roosevelt did. He came to Congress shortly after--in fact, the \nday after--the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 and asked for \nthe authority and permission to go forward with a war that would be \nwaged against those who would attack us. Then came the Korean conflict, \nwhich was not characterized in official terms as war because President \nTruman didn't come to Congress asking for that authority.\n  I had two brothers, incidentally, who served in the U.S. Navy during \nthe Korean conflict. They always used to jokingly say it was a police \naction with real bullets, and I know, because many innocent Americans \ndied in the course of that Korean conflict. Yet there was no formal \ndeclaration of war.\n  Vietnam was a war I paid much closer attention to because it came at \na time when I was in college and law school, and my friends were being \nasked to serve. Again, there was no official declaration of war.\n  After Vietnam and after the tremendous loss of life and all the \ncontroversy associated with it, there was a debate in the Halls of \nCongress about whether we needed to be more specific in terms of the \nauthority of a President to go to war. So Congress enacted the War \nPowers Resolution in the 1970s, which spelled out in specific terms the \nresponsibility of the President when he would ask this Nation to go to \nwar.\n\n  That bill, having passed both the House and the Senate, was sent to \nPresident Nixon, who vetoed it. He viewed it, as most Presidents have \nthen and since, as an intrusion on his authority as Commander in Chief. \nBut the Congress decided to pass the War Powers Resolution over the \nveto of President Nixon, reaffirming the constitutional authority and \nright of Congress when it came to a declaration of war.\n  Now we find ourselves in a situation where Congress has voted on \ngoing forward with the war in Iraq--and, as I mentioned earlier, I was \none of those who voted against it--going forward with the war in \nAfghanistan--I was one who voted for it; all Senators did, I might add, \nfrom both political parties--and now a question of Libya.\n  Several months ago, the situation in Libya became so grave that the \nPresident of the United States met with our leaders in the military and \nleaders of other nations to ask what should be done. Muammar Qadhafi, \nthe rogue leader of Libya, was literally attacking and killing his own \npeople in the streets of his country, and there was a widespread public \nreaction against it from the Arab League, of which Libya was a member, \nas well as the European Union, the United Nations, and others.\n  President Obama made the decision then to consult with Members of \nCongress about what we should do. I was fortunate enough, being a \nmember of leadership, to be part of the conference call when the \nPresident was on the line with leaders--Democrats and Republicans--in \nthe House and Senate and spelled out what he believed was the grave \nthreat to the innocent people of Libya.\n  At that point, this was a question as to whether Benghazi was going \nto fall and whether Muammar Qadhafi would consolidate power and take \nretribution against those who had been in opposition to his government. \nHe said he was going to take to the streets with his military and kill \nthem like rats, and we took him at his word, and the President felt the \ncivilized nations of the world had to act.\n  Acting in consultation and in concert with the Arab League and the \nUnited Nations and NATO, the President spelled out a course of action. \nHe told us in these early consultations that the United States \ninvolvement would be very limited, perhaps more intense at the outset \nthan as any conflict progressed, and that we would not commit land \ntroops to Libya, and that basically the leadership of this effort would \nbe under the auspices of NATO, and we would be in a supportive role--a \nrole which would diminish over time. That was the President's promise, \nand that was what was executed.\n  Now, more than 2 months later, the question has arisen: Well, what is \nthis President's responsibility under the Constitution? What is the \nCongress's responsibility under the Constitution? Are we engaged in a \nwar?\n  I might say that I sat down before coming to the floor and carefully \nreread the War Powers Resolution. Although we characterize it in many \ndifferent ways, the language of this War Powers Resolution is, in some \nareas, difficult to apply to every situation. It makes reference \nthroughout ``to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into \nhostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in \nhostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the \ncontinued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations.''\n  We translate that in our debates, and I have been party to many over \nthe course of the time I have served in the House and the Senate, as to \nwhether we are talking about a defensive military action or an \noffensive military action.\n  I do not think there is any question--not in my mind--that a \nPresident as Commander in Chief has the authority, without seeking \ncongressional approval, to defend the people of the United States and \nits territory. Certainly, we would not expect the President to wait for \nCongress to convene, debate, and vote if the United States and its \ncitizens are under attack.\n  But what of those other circumstances where we are initiating \nmilitary action that is not strictly in defense of the United States? \nAre those so-called offensive military actions hostilities? Do they \nrequire a President to come forward and to ask of Congress authority to \ngo forward with the U.S. involvement in those military hostilities? \nThat is where we find ourselves today.\n  More than 60 days after the initiation of our involvement in Libya, \nthe debate is still on in the Senate as to whether we need to authorize \nthe President to continue our efforts in Libya and whether that \nauthorization should be under the War Powers Resolution.\n  I think it should. That is why I have come to the floor today. I \njoined with Senator Ben Cardin in introducing a proposal, a Senate \njoint resolution, which we have circulated, which would give the \nPresident the authority, if passed, to continue the hostilities in \nLibya under the War Powers Resolution, expressly stating that it would \nnot involve land forces, ground troops, and that it would have a time \ncertain to end--in our case, by the end of this calendar year--subject \nto another decision by Congress as to whether it should go forward.\n  I believe that is still the right course of action. I am hopeful that \nbefore the end of the day there will be action taken by some of my \ncolleagues here in Congress to come forward with a bipartisan \nresolution which parallels what I just described.\n  I might add there is some controversy, and it is worthy of at least \ndebate, as to our current situation in Libya and whether it fits \nsquarely within the War Powers Resolution.\n  Bob Bauer, who is general counsel to the President of the United \nStates, argues it does not. Yesterday, in a conference call, Mr. Bauer \nwas asked specifically whether he thought the War Powers Resolution was \napplicable to the current situation in Libya. Here is what he said. \nWhen he was asked: Could you explain? he said:\n\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\n\n       Certainly. As I mentioned, as my colleague was going \n     through the nature of the mission and how it changed, we're \n     now in a position where we're operating in a support role. \n     We're not engaged in any of the activities that typically \n     over the years in war powers analysis is considered to \n     constitute hostilities within the meaning of the statute. \n     We're not engaged in sustained fighting. There's been no \n     exchange of fire with hostile forces. We don't have troops on \n     the ground. We don't risk casualties to those troops. None of \n     the factors, frankly, speaking more broadly, has risked the \n     sort of escalation that Congress was concerned would impinge \n     on its war-making power.\n       So within the precedents of a war powers analysis, all of \n     which typically are very fact-dependent, we are confident \n     that we're operating consistent with the resolution. That \n     doesn't mean that we don't want the full, ongoing \n     consultation with Congress or authorization as we move \n     forward, but that doesn't go to our legal position under the \n     statute itself, and we're confident of that.\n\n  I respect Mr. Bauer, but I respectfully disagree with him. I believe \nthat what we are engaged in in Libya is a matter that should come under \nthe War Powers Resolution. I believe that we should as a Congress \nconsider it under the War Powers Resolution.\n  I think that is the right course of action. It will give the \nPresident clear authority, and it will also establish the clear \nauthority of Congress in this particular situation.\n  Let me add quickly, I think the President was right in what he did \ninitially. I believe the use of American military technology--which was \nprimarily our initial investment--was certainly warranted. Working with \nNATO, we created an atmosphere where the NATO forces could not be in \nharm's way, would be safe in their early efforts to stop Muammar \nQadhafi in his efforts to kill the civilians in his country.\n  I also believe the President was right from a foreign policy \nviewpoint by not doing this unilaterally but working with the Arab \nLeague, the European Union, and the United Nations.\n  The fact that we have for the first time in history NATO forces \nworking in concert with the Arab League is, I think, a very positive \nthing, and I salute the President for doing it.\n\n  I think his goal and motives were good in this effort, and I would \nvote, if asked, to continue this effort under the War Powers Act \naffirmatively based on all the briefings I have received.\n  Having said that, I believe we should pursue the course that Senator \nCardin and I suggested in our resolution, that we should, in fact, deal \nwith this matter under the War Powers Resolution. We should debate and \ntake action on it here in the Senate.\n  I am hopeful that soon--perhaps before the end of the day--there will \nbe some effort under way in a bipartisan fashion to do just that.\n  At the end of the day, we will be asked by future generations if we \nkept true to our oath under the Constitution, which requires us to face \ndifficult debates and decisions, and there are none more difficult than \nthis.\n  We are also going to be asked by the people we represent in terms of \nthe cost in human life and the cost to American taxpayers whether we \nengaged in the debate and determined it was the appropriate thing to \ndo.\n  I have, like so many Members of the Senate and Congress, had the sad \nduty to attend the funerals of those who have fallen in combat in \nservice to our country. It is sad to face their families and realize \nthey have paid the ultimate sacrifice to our Nation. I think that \nrequires us, even in circumstances where the facts are debatable, to \nerr on the side of exercising our constitutional authority.\n  I hope before the end of the day this bipartisan resolution will come \nto the floor--and certainly before the end of the week--and that we \ndebate it and act on it before the end of this work period.\n  Again, let me make it clear, I think the President is right in what \nhe is doing. But I think we have a responsibility that goes beyond Mr. \nBauer's conclusion--a responsibility to decide that this offensive use \nof military force, even for a good purpose, a good humanitarian \npurpose, is one that requires the authorization of the American people \nthrough their Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a serious \nissue that touches on our national security, our economic well-being, \nthe safety of our families, and our privacy; that is, America's \ncybersecurity.\n  I look forward to conducting an in-depth examination of the aspects \nof this issue that falls within the Senate Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction during the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism's June 21, \n2011, hearing, ``Cybersecurity: Evaluating the Administration's \nProposals.'' However, because of the importance of improving our \ncybersecurity, as demonstrated by the recent Gmail spear-fishing \nattacks and hacks at Sony, Epsilon, Lockheed Martin, and even the \nSenate itself, I rise to make some initial remarks today.\n  American technological innovation ushered in the Internet age, \nbringing with it Facebook, YouTube, and the rest of the World Wide Web. \nIt set off an explosion of new commerce, freedom of expression, and \neconomic opportunity even in the smallest details of our lives--\nallowing a car company, for instance, to unlock your car doors remotely \nif you have locked yourself out of your car.\n  However, this increased connectivity allows criminals, terrorists, \nand hostile nations to exploit cyberspace, to attack America, to invade \nour privacy, to loot our intellectual property, and to expose America's \ncore critical infrastructure to cyber sabotage. Entire online \ncommunities are dedicated to stealing and selling American credit card \nnumbers. Consider the disturbing fact that the price of your credit \ncard number stolen online actually goes up if the criminal also is \nselling your mother's maiden name. Some criminals have learned how to \nspy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out \nthrough the video camera attached to the screen. Others run Web sites \nselling stolen entertainment without paying the American companies that \ncreated it. And millions of American computers--millions of American \ncomputers--have been compromised by malware slaved to botnets that can \nrecord your every keystroke and send it instantaneously across the \nworld to a criminal's laptop.\n  I firmly believe that cyber crime has put our country on the losing \nend of the largest illicit transfer of wealth in world history. Whether \nby copying source code, by industrial espionage of military product \ndesigns, by identity theft, by online piracy, or by outright old-\nfashioned stealing from banks--just doing it the electronic way--cyber \ncrime cripples American innovation, kills jobs here at home, and \nundermines our economic and national security.\n  Congress must act to protect Americans from these Internet dangers \nand to protect our civil liberties. Let me say at the outset that the \ngovernment must not be allowed to snoop indiscriminately into our \nonline activity, to read our e-mail, or to watch us online. There \nsimply is no need for such an invasion of privacy, and we must move \nforward with that firmly in mind.\n  The majority leader has introduced a leadership bill that will be a \nvehicle for our work. The Commerce Committee, led by Chairman \nRockefeller and Ranking Member Snowe, both of whom I had the privilege \nto serve with on the Intelligence Committee, and the Homeland Security \nCommittee, led by Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, \nreported key bills last year. Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary \nCommittee have reported important legislation on data breach and other \nissues central to cybersecurity. The Armed Services, Energy, and other \ncommittees have studied the issue from the perspective of their \nparticular jurisdictions and expertise, and under the leadership of \nChairman Feinstein, the Intelligence Committee Cybersecurity Task Force \ncompleted its classified report last July, authored by me, Senator \nMikulski, and Senator Snowe. So we have been ready in Congress.\n\n  The administration has now weighed in with its own proposal, \nrecognizing that we need cybersecurity legislation to make our Nation \nsafer and launching in earnest our legislative process.\n  We have hard work ahead to find the best possible solutions to this \ncomplex and grave challenge to our national and economic security. As \nwe begin, I would like to flag five issues that I believe must be \naddressed as this legislation goes forward.\n  First, we need to build greater public awareness of cybersecurity \nthreats going forward.\n  What is the problem? The problem is that information affecting the \ndot.gov and the dot.mil domains--the government domains--is largely \nclassified. And in the dot.com, dot.net, and dot.org domains, threat \ninformation is often kept proprietary by the victim business so as not \nto worry shareholders, customers, and regulators, or give ammunition to \ncompetitors. The result is that Americans are left in the dark about \nthe level of danger that is actually out there on the Internet.\n  The administration's proposal would require covered businesses to \nnotify customers if their personal information is stolen, expand \nreporting of cybersecurity threats, and require some public assessments \nof cyber readiness.\n  I believe more can still be done on these fronts. I have had the \npleasure of working with Senator Kyl to introduce S. 931, the Cyber \nSecurity Public Awareness Act. I would like to urge interested \ncolleagues to review it and consider including it as part of our larger \ncybersecurity legislation. That is first.\n  Second, the Senate needs to ensure that we give private industry the \ntools necessary for self-defense against cyber attacks.\n  Proper sharing among and within industries of cybersecurity threat \ninformation is vital. The administration took an important step by \nrecommending, subject to various safeguards, enhanced sharing of \ncybersecurity threat information by the government with private \nindustry. But we may also need to remove legal impediments that \nunnecessarily limit the sharing of threat information within \nindustries, and we should be prepared to listen here to the private \nsector's needs as they set up those areas for safe communications about \nthe cyber threats they share.\n  Third, our Nation does not have basic rules of the road for end \nusers, ISPs, and software and hardware suppliers.\n  The administration proposal includes important provisions that would \nmove us in the right direction. Assuming that ISPs--Verizon and Comcast \nand the companies that are actually providing the service--assuming \nthat these companies qualify as critical infrastructure, which is an \nassumption we should clarify before getting too far down this path, the \nadministration's proposal would require them to develop a standardized \nframework to address cybersecurity.\n  Sensible laws and regulations have made our highways safe, and we \nneed similarly to make our information highways safe. Federal \nprocurement can encourage effective cybersecurity standards with \nappropriate supply chain security so as to improve cybersecurity across \nthe hardware and software industries. These improvements will benefit \nthe government directly, but it will also improve the security of all \nproducts on which business and consumers rely.\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\n  Americans are too often unaware of dangerous malware that has been \nsurreptitiously inserted into our own computers, and we do not take \nreadily available measures to protect ourselves and those with whom we \nlink.\n  One leading ISP, Comcast, deserves credit for developing a new \nmechanism to notify and assist its customers when their computers have \nbeen compromised by malicious software or botnets. All other ISPs \nshould work together to join, strengthen, and standardize this program. \nIn Australia, ISPs have developed a code of conduct that may be a model \nfor their American counterparts in this regard.\n  The fourth point: It is vital that the government have an instant \nresponse plan that clearly allocates responsibilities for responding to \na major cyber attack or breach. The administration proposal puts the \nresponsibility for such incident response with the Department of \nHomeland Security Cybersecurity Center envisioned by the proposal. I \nlook forward to working with the administration and my colleagues on \nthat aspect of the proposal.\n  More generally, the administration proposal, like bills that have \nbeen reported in the Senate, gives the Department of Homeland Security \na leadership role in our Nation's cybersecurity. We have to remember \nthis is a relatively new role for the Department of Homeland Security. \nIt is one of a great many different responsibilities that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security bears, and it is a role in which much \nof the government's expertise resides in other agencies than the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's role must be configured to \nattract sufficiently high-caliber cybersecurity professionals to ensure \nthat DHS properly leverages the cybersecurity expertise at those other \nagencies and to assure sufficient independence and credibility of the \nCybersecurity Center to perform this vital mission, even as \nadministration change and attention to cybersecurity waxes and wanes. \nCybersecurity is a real and present danger, so we must also plan for \nand minimize the interim period in which DHS builds up its \ncybersecurity expertise, promulgates necessary regulations, and \notherwise grows into any new role with which it is tasked.\n  Cyber attacks happen at the speed of light, so the best defense \nrequires that we preposition some of our defensive capabilities. Many \nof our Nation's leading experts who have seen the dark heart of the \nInternet's dangers and understand the cyber threat in its dimensions \nrecommend rapidly creating secure domains for our most critical \ninfrastructure--our electric grid being the most obvious example. These \nwould be domains in which our Nation's best cybersecurity defenses \ncould be both lawful and effective. Obviously, this would need to be \ndone in a very transparent manner, subject to strict oversight. But we \nas a country have impressive capabilities in this area, and we need to \nmake sure those impressive capabilities protect our critical \ninfrastructure as soon as possible. They are not deployed to protect \ncritical infrastructure now.\n  Fifth, countries around the world, including countries that dedicate \nsignificant resources to exploiting our cyber vulnerabilities, are \nworking hard to build their cyber workforces. We must not fall behind.\n  This means enabling our colleges and universities, in partnership \nwith private companies, government agencies, and other cybersecurity \ninnovators, to research the next great cybersecurity technology and to \nbuild the cyber human capital our Nation needs to defend itself and \ncontinue to flourish on the Internet.\n  Academic and technological leaders in my State, such as the \nUniversity of Rhode Island and Brown University, have been hard at work \ndeveloping new cybersecurity technologies and strengthening our \nNation's cyber expertise. I look forward to working with them as we go \nforward.\n  There are other vital issues we must address, many of which I have \nspoken about previously on this floor. We must work, for example, to \nscale up our Nation's cybersecurity and law enforcement resources to \nmatch the seriousness of the threat posed by cyber criminals, by \nterrorist organizations, and by hostile nation states using cyberspace \nto attack our Nation.\n  The bottom line is we have a lot of important work to do. I am glad \nthere is every indication that it will be bipartisan work, undertaken \nwith the country's best interests in mind. I look forward to taking on \nthis task with my colleagues in the months ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3885-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WELCOMING HIS EXCELLENCY TSAKHIAGIIN ELBEGDORJ\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the 146th \nanniversary of Juneteenth, the oldest continually celebrated \ncommemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. This \nsignificant historical event is appropriately observed as an important \npart of American history. Though the Emancipation Proclamation \nofficially took effect on January 1, 1863, many slaves did not find \nfreedom until Union troops were able to reach the Southern States to \nenforce the order. Lincoln's order initially directed the Confederate \nStates to end slavery, but allowed the States that remained in the \nUnion during the Civil War to maintain the peculiar institution of \nslavery. It wasn't until December of 1865 that the 13th amendment \nmarked the complete abolition of slavery in this country. Juneteenth \nwas an important first step toward inclusion in the greater American \ndream.\n  It is a time of reflection, healing and an opportunity for our \ncountry to have meaningful discussions about our legacy of slavery and \ninequality and our ambitions for a more perfect Union.\n  With the breadth of technology we have today, it is difficult for \nmany to conceive of a time where news traveled over days, months and \neven years depending on where the communication began and ended. The \nreal-time dissemination of information via mobile phones, BlackBerries \nand Skype video chat makes it easy to forget a time when things moved \nat a much slower pace. In the 1860s horses were widely used for \ncarrying mail, although parts of the country were building out \nrailroads--with locomotives powered by steam traveling approximately 15 \nmiles per hour.\n  On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, TX, to deliver \nfreedom to slaves still held in bondage. Because of the amorphous \nperiod between the Emancipation Proclamation and the official \nimplementation of freedom for America's slaves, Juneteenth is \ncelebrated not only on June 19, but the entire month of June, to \nrepresent the slow spread of freedom during the war. The culminating \nreading of General Order No. 3 on June 19 sparked spontaneous and \njubilant celebration, and the spirit of that celebration has thrived in \nevery African-American community from that day forward.\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\n  While Juneteenth represents an import phase in our history, it does \nnot represent the end of discrimination and prejudice. African \nAmericans would continue to struggle to establish equality as citizens, \nin education, professional careers and socioeconomic status because of \nJim Crow laws and other forms of insidious discrimination.\n  In marking this occasion, it is appropriate to reflect on what was \nresponsible for its creation. Millions of Africans, kidnapped by \ntraders or sold into bondage by warring African kings, were ripped from \ntheir ancestral homes and carried across the Atlantic Ocean under \nhellish conditions known as the Middle Passage. While estimates vary, \nit is likely that as many as 2.5 million Africans died before ever \nreaching the shores of the ``New World.''\n  No comfort found them upon their arrival, as they were treated as \nchattel and sold to merchants and farmers. Their daily lives included \nintense, back-breaking physical labor for long hours in poor \nconditions, with no hope of attaining freedom or economic advancement. \nMaryland was complicit in this bondage, and at one point in the late \n16th century, slaves made up approximately a third of the State's \npopulation.\n  Maryland, however, helped to lead the abolitionist movement as well. \nThe underground railroad, vital to the freedom of many slaves, ran \nthrough Maryland's Eastern Shore and Chesapeake Bay. Its operation \nrelied on the kindness and secrecy of a vast network of often anonymous \ncitizens, many who lived in Maryland, all equally dedicated to ferrying \nfleeing slaves to freedom in New York, Massachusetts, and Canada.\n  Indeed, determined slaves from Maryland would leave an indelible mark \non our national landscape. Harriet Tubman, a slave from Dorchester \nCounty, MD, went on to guide her family as well as 300 other slaves \nover 19 trips into the South out of slavery and into the North. During \nher clandestine daring, she never lost a single ``passenger.''\n  Frederick Douglass, born in Talbot County, escaped northwards at age \n20 and began a long life of fiercely advocating for racial equality not \nonly in the United States but abroad as well. He established the \nhallmark arguments that abolitionists would echo for years to come, \nuntil Emancipation was finally proclaimed.\n  Emancipation was not the end of the struggle. Explicit laws and \nimplicit associations would continue to create and sustain dire \ninequalities in the African-American community. Maryland passed 15 Jim \nCrow laws between 1870 and 1957, laws that would meaningfully segregate \nalmost every area of public life, and would contribute to the man who \nwould later argue the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, \nThurgood Marshall, being denied admission to the University of Maryland \nLaw School. Marshall would go on to become the first Black Supreme \nCourt Justice, and would help to safeguard the rights and freedoms of \nall Americans, regardless of race.\n  This Juneteenth, we must recommit ourselves to fighting racial \ndisparity and prejudice. As we look back at the legacy of Juneteenth, \nand how the slow spread of the news of freedom brought forward a new \nera in our country's history, we must recommit ourselves to the hard \nwork of ensuring that equal representation, equal opportunity, and \nequal justice are spread everywhere as well. Though the progress and \nspread may be slow, it will reach every American if we continue to \nvigilantly demand equality to access to health care, equal treatment by \nfinancial institutions, equal educational opportunities, and adherence \nto the words of our forefathers that ``all men are created equal.''\n  We must continue to eliminate inequality so we can truly honor the \nspirit of Juneteenth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3886-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING TIM THOMAS HOCKEY LLC\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last night, the Boston Bruins completed a \nstunning comeback to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1972. \nThis monumental victory is a testament to the team's workmanlike \napproach to the game, and there is much praise to go around. But one of \nthe key players who contributed to the inspired game 7 win was Tim \nThomas, Boston's fantastic goaltender. Winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy \nof Stanley Cup Final Most Valuable Player--at age 37, the oldest player \nto win this honor--Thomas posted a .967 save percentage in the series, \nstopping 238 of 246 shots, and stopping a record 798 shots in the \nentire playoffs. More than just a team player on the ice, Tim Thomas is \nalso involved in the community with his Tim Thomas Hockey Camps. Today, \nI rise to recognize Tim Thomas and his endeavors to promote both hockey \nand sportsmanship throughout New England.\n  Incorporated in Portland, ME, Tim Thomas Hockey Camps got their start \n4 years ago to help players of all ages participate and develop skills \nin the exciting sport of hockey. Camps are held during the summer \nacross Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts, and campers \nhave expressed tremendous appreciation of the dedication of the camps' \nstaff to teaching the fundamentals of the game. Tim leads a team of 20 \nexperienced staff members, from former National Hockey League players \nto college standouts and coaches, who impart their vast knowledge on \ncamp attendees. Aside from the technical aspects of hockey, the camps \nalso teach players about teamwork, camaraderie, and the importance of a \nstrong work ethic. Additionally, the Tim Thomas Foundation helps both \nhockey players and organizations in need of assistance, and supports a \nnumber of groups and charities from the Greely Hockey Boosters in \nCumberland, ME, to the Hunger Mountain Children's Center in Waterbury, \nVT.\n  Tim's desire to help others attain their goals in hockey comes from \nhis own moving story, which is a case study in hard work, patience and \nperseverance. A star goalie at the University of Vermont, he was \ndrafted 217th overall in 1994 by the now-defunct Quebec Nordiques. \nAfter spending several seasons in the minor leagues and in Europe, Tim \nmade his debut with the Boston Bruins when he was 28 years old and \nbecame the team's starting goaltender 3 years later. Tim has racked up \nnumerous accolades and All Star Game appearances over the course of his \ncareer, including winning the Vezina Trophy in 2009 as the NHL's best \ngoaltender. He is almost certainly a lock to win it again this year. \nFurthermore, what makes this year's accomplishment so special is that \nTim had off-season hip surgery last summer.\n  Tim Thomas' remarkable road to the Stanley Cup is truly noteworthy \nfor aspiring hockey players across New England, and indeed the country. \nTo many, he is a hero who helped bring the Cup back to Boston for the \nfirst time in 39 years. But to many more, Tim Thomas is also a role \nmodel, who inspires children of all ages to pursue their goals and \ndreams in the hopes that, one day, with hard work and resolve, they too \ncan attain the ultimate prize. I thank Tim Thomas and everyone who is a \npart of the Tim Thomas Hockey Camps for their superb work, and offer my \ncongratulations to the Bruins organization on its stellar victory!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3886-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3886-S3887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERRY COUNIHAN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a wonderful \nmember of our Senate family. After 20 years of public service, Gerry \nCounihan is retiring from his post as Senate elevator operator.\n  In 1991, shortly after earning a degree from Franciscan University, \nGerry began his Capitol Hill journey working in the mailroom for \nSenator John McCain.\n  Gerry then moved on to become a Capitol tour guide in 1997, where he \ndistinguished himself with his enthusiasm and strong work ethic. Ted \nDaniel, former director for the Capitol's visitor services, hired \nGerry, and remembers that on Gerry's first day he came to work \nthoroughly prepared, standing head and shoulders above his peers.\n  It was this passion and ``can-do'' attitude that led Gerry to become \nan integral part of the tour guide team that every day bring history to \nlife for visitors. Gerry even made Capitol history himself. He gave the \nfirst public tour following the fatal shooting of two U.S. Capitol \nPolice officers in 1998. And when the Capitol reopened to visitors \nfollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Gerry again was \nchosen to lead the first tour.\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\n  Sadly, in 2007 Gerry was a victim of a home invasion as he was \ngetting ready for work one morning. He suffered a near fatal assault \nand the mailman found him 3 hours later on his neighbor's steps where \nhe had gone for help.\n  Gerry spent 5 weeks in the hospital relearning basic skills, not \ncertain he would ever walk again. While in the hospital, he met Special \nOlympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver. He describes her as \n``marvelous'' during his time of need.\n  With an abundance of emotional and medical support, Gerry was able to \novercome this significant challenge and return to Capitol Hill as an \nelevator operator. I know I am not alone when I say that this is one of \nthe best hires to date. Gerry's welcoming demeanor and caring and \nprotective character have been appreciated by all Senators. He will \ncertainly be missed.\n  Gerry's story is one of strength and determination. While his \npositions on Capitol Hill may have varied, he always strives to be the \nbest at what he does and never lets circumstances bring him down. \nHaving woven his way into all of our hearts, Gerry is an integral piece \nof the social fabric of Capitol Hill. We will remember him always.\n  I wish Gerry Counihan nothing but the best as he moves on to his next \nendeavor at the Department of Health and Human Services. I hope that he \nknows he is an inspiration to many and will forever be a part of the \nSenate community and the Senate family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/16/senate-section/article/S3887-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CATHRYN HILKER\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Kathryn was a renowned storyteller for whom I had \ndeep respect. She enjoyed an accomplished career as an author, \nplaywright, photographer and journalist. Kathryn also demonstrated a \nfierce dedication to her community. I mourn her passing.\n  Born on June 2, 1918, Kathryn spent the majority of her childhood in \nThomasville, AL, where she also began her career in writing and \nphotography. She graduated from Huntingdon College in Montgomery and \nremained supportive of her alma mater for the duration of her long and \nsuccessful career.\n  Kathryn's trailblazing accomplishments include publishing many well-\nloved ghost stories and autobiographical memories as well as three \ncookbooks. She was also recognized as the first woman journalist in the \nSouth to cover a police beat at a major daily newspaper, and she had \nstints at the Alabama Journal, the Birmingham News, the Selma Times-\nJournal, the Area Agency on Aging and WUAL radio. Kathryn also wrote \nseveral plays, including a one-woman show that she, herself, performed. \nShe was also a contributor to NPR's ``All Things Considered'' and a \nregular at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, \nTennessee. Always giving back to her community, Kathryn founded the \nAlabama Tale-Tellin' Festival, which takes place each year in Selma.\n  Kathryn's achievements garnered recognition, both in the State of \nAlabama and nationally. She received the Alabama Humanities \nFoundation's Alabama Humanities Award, the University of Alabama's \nSociety of Fine Arts' Alabama Arts Award, the National Storytelling \nAssociation's Circle of Excellence Award and Lifetime Achievement Award \nas well as numerous other distinguished awards and honors throughout \nher lifetime.

A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to require \naccountability and transparency in Federal spending, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important new \npiece of legislation--the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, \nor DATA Act.\n  Sine I have been in Washington, I have been frustrated by the lack of \ntransparency and useful spending information to help inform the \ndecision-making process. Our taxpayers deserve to clearly see how their \ntax dollars are spent.\n  As Chairman of the Budget Committee's Task Force on Government \nPerformance, I have been working to improve the outcomes and results of \nour Federal investments.\n  Last year, we passed the Government Performance and Results \nModernization Act to more frequently track government outcomes and to \nhelp reduce overlap and duplication. Today, I will introduce the DATA \nAct to help bring a new level of transparency to our Federal spending.\n  I want to start by acknowledging the work of the administration and \nthe Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board--this legislation \nwas built off the important work they have been leading to reduce waste \nfor the Recovery Act investments.\n  Under Vice President Biden's leadership, supported by the Recovery \nBoard Chairman Earl Devaney--they have established a new standard for \ngovernment accountability. The results are impressive.\n  Out of more than 200,000 Recovery Act fund recipients--there are only \n7 recipients that have not filed their required financial reports.\n  I also need to mention the leadership at the Office of Management and \nBudget--including director Jack Lew and our chief performance officer \nJeff Zients. OMB led the charge with the Recovery Board to ensure the \naccountability of the Recovery Act funds and have made transparency an \nimportant goal government-wide.\n  The administration, the Recovery Board and OMB have proved that \ngovernment can respond to the demand for more transparency and \naccountability. Now we need to expand the Recovery Act model across the \nwhole government. The DATA Act does just that.\n  First, this legislation will require recipients of Federal funds and \ngovernment agencies to report spending data into one transparent online \nportal. Much like they did for Recovery Act funds.\n  This data will be analyzed and compared proactively in order to \nidentify and prevent waste, fraud and abuse before it happens. There \nare tremendous opportunities to reduce improper payments by applying \nthe Recovery Board's fraud prevention tactics to the entire Federal \nGovernment.\n  This legislation will also create a new Board to oversee transparency \nefforts and set consistent standards for data across the entire Federal \nGovernment. Board membership will be comprised of a select group that \nwill include senior OMB officials, agency Deputy Secretaries and \nInspectors General.\n  All this information will be made publicly available so the American \npeople can track taxpayer funds more closely.\n  This legislation will create a new structure that could help \ncoordinate and reduce duplicative reporting requirements and burdens \nfelt by many governments, nonprofits and businesses.\n  Finally, this legislation is an example of how Washington should \nwork.
