Following morning business, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2354, the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. We will continue to work on an agreement for the \nbill and notify Senators when votes are scheduled.\n  We have a lot of work to do in the next few days. We cannot have the \nDefense authorization bill eat up a lot of time after we get back from \nthe recess we will have for Thanksgiving. So everyone should understand \nthat we are going to move forward on the Defense authorization bill. It \nmay not be tomorrow, it may not be the next day, but we have to do it \nbefore Thanksgiving. So I hope everyone understands. I know everyone \nwants to get home for Thanksgiving--we all do--but we have an \nobligation here.\n  In the Christmas period; that is, after Thanksgiving, we will have \njust a few weeks to get everything done. As important as the Defense \nauthorization bill is, we can't eat days and days of that time in \nDecember. We have to finish that bill now. I know that won't be easy, \nso I would hope that people understand, if they have an idea that they \nare going to stop us from moving forward on the bill, on the motion to \nproceed, we are going to get that done and more. So that might mean we \nhave to work past Thursday, past Friday, and if we have procedural \nobstacles on that very important legislation, it will mean we will have \nto work the weekend and into next week. So I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands that. So all Senators who are watching and listening, and \nespecially the staff, just make sure you have alternate reservations to \nleave Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7587-7", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7587-S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LIFESAVING REGULATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Democrats and Republicans don't agree on much these days, \nalthough I had a meeting with some veterans groups earlier today, and I \nindicated to them that maybe they are going to bring us some good luck \nbecause we were able to pass part of the President's jobs bill--the \nveterans employment--with an overwhelming majority. That was really \ngood news, and I hope that is the beginning of some good days ahead of \nus.\n  We do agree Congress must do something about the unemployment crisis \nwe face. We have 14 million Americans out of work. There is no more \npressing issue facing Congress or the country than jobs. Our plan, the \nDemocrats' plan to address this problem, has been very straightforward. \nWe have advocated for policies that will create jobs by investing in \nwhat makes this country great--our infrastructure, our education \nsystem, and our innovative workforce. Despite Republican \nobstructionism, we have continued to fight for middle-class jobs, \nbringing to the Senate floor bill after bill designed to bring \nAmericans back to work.\n  I met yesterday with the Business Roundtable, a stellar organization \nwith the finest business executives we have in America today. I told \nthem that I know they are all doing well financially, and I went over \nwhat we had proposed a week or so ago; that is, we need to do something \nabout infrastructure that is deteriorating.\n  I said we were able to put forward a piece of legislation that said: \nLet's\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nspend $50 billion creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We would not \npunish millionaires and billionaires. What we would do is, people \nfortunate enough to make $1 million in a given year, we would say that \non any money they make over $1 million, they would have to pay a surtax \nof seven-tenths of 1 percent. I said: Does anybody out here think that \nis an onerous suggestion? Nobody raised their hand because it isn't. \nBut on a straight party-line vote, it failed.\n  So we are going to continue to fight for middle-class jobs, bringing \nto the Senate floor bill after bill, as we have done, and we will bring \nsome more in the future to put Americans back to work.\n  The Republicans have taken a different approach. I talked about it \nyesterday. They have advocated a wholesale repeal of so-called job-\nkilling regulations. We know and we were able to show yesterday that of \nthe jobs that have been lost, about three-tenths of 1 percent have been \nbecause of regulations. Does that mean all regulations are perfect? Of \ncourse not. That is why the Obama administration--as did the Bush \nadministration, as did the Clinton administration--had a review of what \nregulations are onerous and we should change or get rid of. So we \nunderstand that. For Republicans, that is their job-creating mantra: \nGet rid of regulations. It doesn't work. They say that rolling back \neverything from limits on air pollution to rules that keep our \nworksites safe will create jobs and revive our economy. The problem is \nit is just not true.\n  Business leaders and economists of every political stripe agree that \nthis GOP mantra is a falsehood. A respected academic adviser to two \nRepublican Presidents called this myth spread by Republicans to cover \nup their woeful lack of meaningful work plans to create jobs \n``nonsense'' and ``made up.'' I talked about him in some detail \nyesterday.\n  The evidence, in fact, shows that government safeguards have little \nimpact, if any, on employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics study \nfound that last year only three-tenths of 1 percent of layoffs were \ncaused by regulation. That is according to executives who ordered those \nlayoffs. Nearly 85 times as many jobs were lost last year because of \nthe slow economy.\n  But rather than work with us to turn this weak economy around, \ncreating hundreds of thousands, if not millions of jobs, Republicans \nspent 11 months fighting Democratic policies that would have created \nthese jobs. Meanwhile, they spent these past 11 months focused on \nkilling regulations that make America safer, healthier, more efficient, \nand more productive.\n  For example, Republicans want to halt updates to the Clean Air Act. \nSince its passage 40 years ago during the Presidency of Richard Nixon--\ndo you know why President Nixon and the Congress got kind of interested \nin that? In Ohio, the Cuyahoga River kept catching fire. The river \nstarted burning, they would put it out, and it would start burning \nagain. So President Nixon and others felt that maybe we should do \nsomething about the Clean Water Act. We also, during that same period \nof time, did something about the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Air Act \nalone has reduced emission of key pollutants by 70 percent, while the \neconomy has grown by some 200 percent during that same period of time. \nLong-planned updates to the law would reduce emissions of mercury, acid \ngases, and other life-threatening pollutants into the air, saving \nlives.\n  Last year alone, the Clean Air Act saved the lives of more than \n160,000 Americans, and it prevented 86,000 emergency room visits and 13 \nmillion lost workdays. This is money in the bank for all of us when we \ncan save lives, prevent emergency room visits, and keep people working \nand not being sick. The Clean Air Act has prevented hundreds of \nthousands of cases of heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.\n  It is wonderful that we have helped clean the air, but we also have \nmedicines that help. I can remember as a little boy going out to visit \na woman who lived on the outskirts of Searchlight--that is really a \ncouple miles out of the main part of Searchlight--and I have never \nforgotten this. She had asthma, and my mom went out to see if there was \nanything she could do to help. There wasn't a thing she could do to \nhelp. This woman was in such a state of distress. She said, ``I can't \nbreathe,'' and she was making horrible noises that I have never \nforgotten. So things are better. One reason they are better is because \nof medicines but also cleaner air.\n  The Clean Air Act has prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of \nheart disease, as I have indicated, chronic bronchitis, and asthma, and \nlast year alone it saved American companies and consumers $1.3 trillion \nby reducing medical costs and increasing productivity.\n  Of course, all these benefits come with a price tag, but for every \ndollar spent complying with the Clean Air Act, this Nation saves $30 in \nemergency room bills, lost work days, and environmental cleanup. And \nrepealing the law of the Clean Air Act wouldn't make the costs go away. \nInstead, it would shift them from corporations to consumers. Complying \nwith environmental safeguards is one of the costs of doing business in \nthe United States. It is a part of being a good corporate citizen. That \nis why two-thirds of voters say that scientists at the Environmental \nProtection Agency, not politicians in Congress, should set pollution \nstandards. Seventy-one percent of voters, including the majority of \nRepublicans, support the stronger environmental protections that are \nattacked by congressional Republicans. Eighty percent of voters believe \nthose safeguards will improve public health and air quality.\n  There is plenty of evidence that smart, fair regulations save lives \nand communities lots of money and also consumers lots of money. There \nis more evidence that stronger watchdogs could have prevented disasters \nsuch as the 2008 financial crisis or the West Virginia mining accident \nthat killed 21 people last year. Simply repeating the fiction that \nregulations kill jobs doesn't make it a fact. But even if there is one \nounce of truth in the fable, there are many ways to steer the economy \nout of the ditch and create jobs that don't risk American lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7588-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Today, I would like to begin once again by focusing on \na piece of jobs legislation that Republicans in the House have recently \npassed with significant bipartisan support and by calling on the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate to follow the lead of the House \nRepublicans by taking up this legislation and passing it right here in \nthe Senate.\n  The legislation I would like to highlight is H.R. 2250, the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act. This legislation passed the House overwhelmingly \nlast month. Forty-one Democrats supported it over in the House. Senator \nCollins has introduced a similar bill here in the Senate. It has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Most Americans are probably aware by now that the Obama \nadministration is crushing businesses across the country with a \nmountain of redtape and new regulations that it imposes outside of the \nlegislative process. When asked about their challenges, small business \nowners now rank these regulations at the very top of the challenges \nthey face.\n  One of the chief offenders is the EPA, and one of the most \npotentially damaging regulations this redtape factory has proposed \nrelates to the boilers that are used by just about every manufacturer \nor institution in this country that doesn't get the power it needs from \nstandard utilities.\n  Right now, EPA wants to force anybody with an industrial-sized boiler \nto change their facilities to comply with a burdensome new regulation \nthat, according to one study, could put 230,000 jobs at risk.\n  So here is what Senator Collins has in mind that the EPA Regulatory \nRelief Act would do about all of this problem. Here is what it would do \nto protect jobs right here in America:\n  First, Senator Collins' bill would provide more time for EPA to issue \nregulations for industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers, \nprocess heaters, and incinerators. This is the time EPA itself has \nindicated it needs in\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\norder to collect more data and analysis and to finalize the rules, so \nit gives EPA what it says it needs. More specifically, it would provide \nEPA 15 months from the date of the bill's enactment to repropose and \nfinalize the new boiler rules, which I want to emphasize the EPA has \nactually already requested at this time. This bill would also extend \nthe compliance deadlines from 3 to 5 years, which would allow companies \nadequate time to comply with the new standards and install the required \nequipment.\n\n  Crucially, this bill would also direct the EPA to ensure that the new \nrules are achievable and realistic. We all recognize the vital role the \nEPA plays in keeping the air we breathe and the water we drink clean \nand safe. We also need to get some commonsense limits on its actions, \nand that means putting in place laws that protect Americans against the \nkind of regulatory overreach that too many unelected bureaucrats in \nWashington seem to live for these days, especially in these challenging \neconomic times.\n  As I said, this bill has a lot of support not only from Republicans \nbut from Democrats here in the Senate. In fact, 12 of the bill's \ncosponsors are Democrats. Like me, they understand and appreciate how \nthese new rules would adversely affect jobs and manufacturing in this \ncountry, and they want to work with us to do something about it. So \nthis is the perfect example of an issue on which the two parties \nactually agree. The perfect example.\n  Senator Ron Wyden supports this bill because it directs the EPA to go \nback to the drawing board and craft boiler rules that are more in line \nwith what is realistic from mills and factories, he said. Senator Wyden \nargues that the EPA itself has admitted its boiler rules need to be \nfixed.\n  Here is how Senator Landrieu put it over the summer:\n\n       With manufacturing being one of our bright spots in our \n     economic recovery, we cannot afford to jeopardize the \n     industry's health and the high-paying jobs it supplies to \n     this country. This legislation will give the EPA the time \n     extension it needs to craft a balanced approach that not only \n     keeps our environment clean, but also our economy strong . . \n     .\n\n  This legislation is supported by the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, the National Association of Manufacturing, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe Business Roundtable, the Biomass Power Association, and around 300 \nother business groups. Too many jobs are at stake for the Senate not to \nact on this legislation that has actually already passed the House. I \nhave previously mentioned an Ohio paper mill where 200 jobs are at \nstake as a result of this rule. The American Forest and Paper \nAssociation says 700,000 jobs in the paper industry alone are also at \nrisk.\n  The Republican House has done its job. Now it is time for the Senate \nto act. Let's take up the EPA Regulatory Relief Act, pass it, and send \nit on down to the President for his signature.\n  If Democratic leaders cannot agree to take up and pass legislation \nthe two parties actually agree on, then what will they agree to pass? \nLet's follow the House's lead and show the American people we can work \ntogether on this commonsense, bipartisan bill to protect jobs in \nAmerican manufacturing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7589-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7589-S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND GENE HUFF\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I pay tribute to a good friend \nof mine, and a man who has been a good friend of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky for decades. Whether as a State legislator, a pastor, an \nevangelist, a radio station operator, or as a dedicated and loving \nfamily man, the Rev. Gene Huff of London, KY, has been a good and \nfaithful servant in his community for many years. He has my respect as \na model Kentuckian.\n  Gene Huff was born October 6, 1929. Before he was 20 years old, he \nhad heard the call to preach and began traveling Kentucky as an \nevangelist. His wife of nearly 60 years, Ethel, recalls the first time \nshe laid eyes on Gene when he came to preach at her church.\n  ``On March 13, 1949, he came to Newport, Kentucky, to preach his \nfirst revival at age 19,'' Ethel remembers.\n\n       It was my home church. I had never seen or heard a teenager \n     preach before, so when I first saw Gene, I wondered what he \n     would be able to tell us. He was so young-looking to be a \n     preacher. But I loved his broad, friendly smile and wonderful \n     voice from the very start. And to my surprise, he really \n     could preach!\n\n  At that first meeting Ethel was a 16-year-old church pianist. She \nmust have been smitten with the handsome 19-year-old preacher. They \ndated for 3 years and were married on July 4, 1952. That same year Gene \nfound a permanent home as a preacher when he became the first pastorate \nat the First Pentecostal Church in London, KY, the church that would \neventually become his home for three decades. From 1955 to 1963, he \nfollowed some other pursuits, including serving as pastor at the Upper \nColony Holiness Church and Carmichael Community Church in London, and \nat the Deer Park Christian Assembly of God Church in Cincinnati.\n  He also worked for a time as a public school teacher and a tutor. But \nin 1963, Gene returned to pastor at the First Pentecostal and remained \nin that capacity until 1989.\n  Many Kentuckians have also come to know Gene through his life-long \nexperience in politics. He was first elected to the Kentucky House of \nRepresentatives in 1967. In 1971, he won a seat in the Kentucky Senate \nrepresenting the 21st district and served there until 1994.\n  I worked with Gene in his legislative capacity over the years and can \ntruly say the people of the 21st district could not have asked for a \nmore dedicated, loyal, or hardworking senator. Gene was always true and \nfaithful to his convictions in the State senate. He was the leader of \nefforts to oppose a lottery coming to Kentucky. Although he was \nultimately unsuccessful, I know he was proud of waging that fight. He \nwould eventually rise to serve as both the minority caucus chairman and \nminority floor leader and as the ranking Republican on the \nAppropriations and Revenue Committee for 14 years. In 2000, he was \ninducted into the 5th District Lincoln Club Hall of Fame.\n  Gene continued to serve as a pastor while serving his constituents in \nFrankfort. In 1974, inspired by his son, Marty, who had seen a \npresentation on a bus ministry, Gene found four schoolbuses for his \nchurch to buy and fix up, and he began running these buses across the \nregion to bring people in to hear him preach at First Pentecostal. They \nnamed the four buses Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Before the bus \nservice began, Gene's Sunday school had an average attendance of around \n150. Within three months over 400 people were attending Gene's \nservices.\n  Gene traveled even farther than the back roads of Kentucky when it \ncame to spreading the word. In the 1980s, while serving as a State \nsenator, Gene successfully got a resolution passed to assist persecuted \nChristians in Romania. Shortly afterwards, Gene traveled to Romania to \nsee the situation there himself firsthand. What he saw so moved him \nthat he began an entirely new phase of foreign missions in ministry. \nGene would go on to make 28 trips to Romania, and he and Ethel traveled \nto 33 countries. In 1990 they formed the Good News Outreach missions \norganization to support their work in foreign missions. Here's how \nEthel puts the effect these trips have had on her and Gene: \n``Involvement and support of foreign missions has been a beautiful \naddition to the tapestry of our lives.''\n  As if all this service to both congregants and constituents were not \nenough, Gene succeeded in many other pursuits as well. He has installed \nair conditioners and furnaces, repaired washing machines, rebuilt cars, \nworked in home construction, worked at a car dealership and an ice \ncream shop, and hauled hay, coal, lumber, and watermelons. He once \nworked as a travel agent for KLM Airlines. In the 1970s he became part \nowner of an airplane and earned his pilot's license. On the day he \nresigned from the State senate in 1994, Gene and Ethel raised a 50,000-\nwatt tower for WYGE, a Christian radio station which he continued to \noperate until 2007. I remember doing two interviews with Gene on WYGE.\n  Gene played a key role in seeing the brand-new, state-of-the-art St. \nJoseph-London Hospital completed, an acute-care hospital that serves a \npopulation of over 50,000 in four counties. When construction for the \nnew facility came\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nto a crossroads a few year ago, it was Gene who brought the community \ntogether on a Thanksgiving weekend to lobby for the hospital's \ncompletion. I am sure he is proud to see the new hospital and its \naward-winning cardiovascular services up and running.\n  Gene Huff is not only a well-rounded man but a well-educated one as \nwell. He enrolled in Sue Bennett Junior College in London in the fall \nof 1952, beginning a pursuit of higher education that would continue \nover a period of 25 years. He finished Sue Bennett in 1954 and earned a \nbachelor's degree from Union College in Barbourville, KY, in 1960. His \nmaster's degree was earned at Morehead State University in Morehead, \nKY, in 1976. He also earned an educational specialist degree there in \n1977. He pursued further graduate work at the University of Kentucky. \nIn 1999 Gene was awarded an honorary doctor of public education degree \nfrom Union College.\n  Gene turned 82 years old a month ago, and I certainly hope he took \nthe happy occasion of his birthday to look back proudly at a life \nfilled with achievement. The number of lives he has touched, whether \nthrough his preaching, his public service or his warm and steady \npresence among family and friends cannot be counted.\n  I had the pleasure of talking to Gene on the phone a few days ago and \nwe got to reminisce about old times. I wanted him to know I was \nthinking of him and that I am proud of him for his decades of service \nto his community, to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and to God.\n  It is an honor to come to Washington to represent Kentuckians such as \nthe Rev.

We have just passed through a very significant \nlandmark in this country which is that student debt, the burden of \ncollege loan debt Americans have to carry, broke through $1 trillion. \nThat is $1 trillion in debt. And because of the laws that have been set \nup to favor the banks, in particular in this Congress, the debt is not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. That is a $1 trillion burden on folks who \nrequired loans to get through college that they can never shake off \nthat is going to stay with them for their lives, for as long as it \ntakes to pay it down even when things don't work out for them. So it is \na very significant milestone when it hits $1 trillion of this \nparticular kind of very onerous debt.\n  One of the responses to it is the Pell grant.\n  The Pell grant helps people who can't afford college have the chance \nto go to college. It helps them pay their way through college, and it \ndoes so without leaving that burden of debt behind. It is named after \nSenator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, a Senator and a man who was \nvery important to me in my life and in my development as a political \nfigure in Rhode Island. He was a very dear friend and went almost \ninexplicably out of his way for me on many different occasions. I am \ndeeply indebted to him. But I am also extremely proud to represent \nRhode Island in the Senate and to represent a State that produced \nSenator Claiborne Pell and, particularly as we face this massive burden \nof debt, to come to the floor to participate in this colloquy in \nsupport of the Pell grant.\n  I will turn to my colleague, Senator Tester, in one moment. First, I \nwish to say how important this is to individual people who wouldn't \nhave the chance otherwise. I was at the University of Rhode Island just \na few weeks ago. I met a woman named Amber, who is 29 years old. She is \nnot the standard ``come out of high school and go on to college'' \nstudent. She is actually a mom. She has two kids. She works full time \nand she goes to school full time and she is the mother of two kids. \nThis is a very busy person and a very energetic and capable person. The \nonly way she can make things work in her life and enable her to be a \nfull-time mom, a full-time employee, and a full-time student is because \nthe Pell grant that she gets bridges the gap between what she can earn, \nwhat she can borrow, what she has to pay, and gives her the chance to \nmove into the college-educated status.\n  As we know from looking at this recession we are in right now, there \nare two economies in America. There is an economy for college-educated \npeople--an economy in which the top unemployment rate is below 5 \npercent--and then there is the economy for people who have not had the \nbenefit and the good fortune of a college education, for whom \nunemployment is nearly twice as high and for whom the suffering brought \non by the Wall Street meltdown and the subsequent recession has been \nmuch more acute.\n  I will turn now to Senator Tester. I appreciate so much that he has \ncome to join us today to help our colleagues, I hope, come to the \nrealization that cutting Pell grants as we face our debt and our \ndeficit problem would be a wild mistake, a terrible mistake, would \nundercut the progress we are trying to make, and would be one of the \nworst places to go for spending cuts. Even though I admit we need to \nmake them, the Pell grant is the wrong place to look.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Tester.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. \nWe appreciate his leadership on the issue of Pell grants. I very much \nappreciate the opportunity to address Pell grants and what they mean to \nnot only our young people and to the folks who are being retrained to \nfind different lines of work with the economic slowdown but also to our \neconomy in general overall.\n  If we are going to go to an institution of higher learning at this \npoint in time, it takes money. If Pell grants are reduced or \npotentially even taken away, as some want, it takes away that \nopportunity. It takes away that opportunity for upward mobility within \nour society, within the economy. Without education, if a person is born \npoor, that person is liable to stay poor. Without education, if a \nperson wants to improve their quality of life, it becomes much more \ndifficult.\n  When I meet with students, both traditional and nontraditional, \naround the State of Montana, the first question they ask me or one of \nthe first questions is, What is the Federal Government doing to make \ncollege affordable? Because if one is unfortunate enough to be born \nwithout economic means, these Pell grants are critically important to \nbe able to allow people--students, young people, folks who need to be \nretrained--to go to college and get that training, thereby adding to \nour economy and enabling them to get a better job and potentially \nbecome business owners and down the line.\n  Why is this important? It is because Pell grants have been under \nattack in the House.\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  H.R. 1 would cut $5.7 billion from Pell grants and 1.7 million \nstudents would have been denied access to education because of that \ncut. Some people in the House even call Pell grants 21st century \nwelfare. It couldn't be further from the truth.\n  Then, after H.R. 1 was put down in the Senate in a bipartisan way, \nthe House passed the Labor-HHS bill which cut $8 billion from Pell \ngrants, thereby eliminating Pell grants for folks who are going to \nschool less than half time. That eliminates a good portion of the \nnontraditional students because a lot of these folks are trying to make \na living, trying to support a family, and trying to improve themselves \nin the economic strata of this world. Some of them have been laid off.\n  There is an individual, for example, in western Montana who had a \ntile business, with 27 years' experience in the tile and stone \nbusiness. He had a family, and because of the economic downturn and \nbecause of, quite frankly, physical limitations in a business that is \nvery difficult, he had to find a different line of work. Work had dried \nup and, quite frankly, the back was getting weak. So he was able to get \na Pell grant, go back to school on a part-time basis, and study for a \njob where there was a job once he got out in the culinary arts--\nsomething he had wanted to do and something that would allow him to \nsupport his family. Without those Pell grants, he would have possibly \nbeen on workers' comp or potentially making far less money.\n  So when the Pell grants come forward in the House and they do things \nsuch as cut Pell grants, either their amount or eliminate the numbers \navailable to our students across this country, traditional and \notherwise, we are basically doing bad things to the economy, cutting \nthe economy down because, quite honestly, the affordability issue is \ncritically important as we move forward and people go to get retrained \nand move themselves up in the economic strata.\n  The other issue, finally, is the importance to Indian Country. With \nthe tribal colleges, the Pell grants are used to a great extent there. \nWhy is this important? In Montana, in Indian Country, the unemployment \nrate is very high--70 percent and higher--on many of the reservations \naround Montana. Quite honestly, if we are going to dig into the \nunemployment rate across this country, whether it is Indian \nreservations or wherever, education is a key component to making that \nhappen. Pell grants are a key component to giving access to our \nstudents, both traditional and nontraditional.\n  As we move forward, we need to understand that for men and women \nalike, young people and middle-aged, who need the training to be able \nto get good jobs, Pell grants are a critical component of that.\n  With that, I kick it back to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator. As my colleague knows, we have a \nvery distinguished colleague from the Senate who has now gone on to be \nthe Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ken Salazar. I see \nformer attorney general and now Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut has \njoined us for this colloquy, and he knows Ken Salazar was the attorney \ngeneral of Colorado, an attorney general with both of us. Ken grew up \non a farm in Colorado that, until his generation, didn't have running \nwater and didn't have electricity. His generation was the first \ngeneration to go to college. When I got here, he was a Senator and his \nbrother was a Congressman. It never would have happened if it hadn't \nbeen for the Pell grant. It was the Pell grant that allowed those boys, \nfrom a faraway corner of Colorado, who were eighth-generation \nAmericans, to be the first generation that got their foothold in \ncollege and were able to propel themselves from that to remarkable \nleadership of our country. It shows what ordinary Americans are capable \nof when the Pell grant gives them that launching pad.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from Montana brought up the effects on \nIndian Country as well.\n  I know Senator Blumenthal wishes to say a few words.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nRhode Island for organizing this colloquy, and the Senator from Montana \nhas been a tireless advocate of opportunity for all the people of the \nUnited States and particularly his State. So I am honored to follow my \ncolleague from Montana in this discussion.\n  Claiborne Pell, whose name is on the grant, is an example of how an \nindividual can make a difference in this institution. His contributions \nhave left a legacy not only for himself and the State of Rhode Island \nbut also for the entire country in advancing the cause of higher \neducation and putting it on the map in the American understanding of \nhow critically important it is and how it is evermore important today \nfor the United States to compete in the global economy. It is important \nfor individuals to compete within the United States. It is important \nfor middle-class people to continue to have viable, healthy families. \nIn fact, the Pell grant is important to the economic health and even \nthe viability of our middle class. The failure to fund it and support \nit will endanger educational opportunities for middle-class Americans \nacross the country.\n  What we know about the modern economy is that more and more, a high \nschool education alone means less and less. High school is vitally \nimportant but, economically, it is not enough. That is reflected in an \noverwhelming--almost an avalanche--of statistics and studies. The most \nrecent issue last Friday by Georgetown University Center on Education \nshows clearly and dramatically that Americans who have only a high \nschool education are less likely to have a good income and a good \neconomic status.\n  Workers who had a high school diploma alone, in 1973, were qualified \nfor 72 percent of jobs--much more than two-thirds. Today, people who \nhave only a high school diploma are qualified for only 44 percent of \nthe jobs available. In 2018, that number will drop to 37 percent. That \nset of numbers is more than just a statistic, it is human lives and \nfamilies and income--dollars in people's pockets they can spend in our \neconomy. It affects particularly women who more and more shoulder the \nlargest burden of changes in our educational requirements and have been \nhit the hardest in the unemployment crisis we face. In our advancing \neconomy, employers need highly skilled individuals. More and more, what \nI hear as I go around the State of Connecticut is there are jobs \navailable, but there aren't people with the skills to fill them. When \nwe talk about a Pell grant and college degrees, we are not talking \nabout only a 4-year diploma, we are talking about an associate's degree \nthat enables somebody to run a computer on an assembly line or do \nwelding or the other kinds of practical skills that enable people to \nfill those jobs, enable America to compete, and enable employers to \ncompete successfully.\n  In 2018, only one-third of the jobs available to noncollege-educated \nworkers will provide a living wage. That is a statistic that ought to \nbe a wake-up call to the Congress and to Washington. I think it is \nreflected not just in the overall picture but in the individual human \nstories that both my colleagues expressed in their remarks and that I \nhear from people who not only have benefitted from Pell grants but who \nhope to benefit from them, including educators who believe they are \nvital to the future of American education.\n  I wish to cite a few this morning and quote first from a letter I \nreceived from Norma Esquivel, who lives in Greenwich, CT, and who said \nto me in her letter:\n\n       I recently received news regarding the possible elimination \n     of the Pell Grant. As a recipient of the Pell Grant, the mere \n     thought of losing such an essential feature of my financial \n     aid package is devastating. . . . I was brought up in a \n     Latino household where the lack of money was often a catalyst \n     for stress and hopelessness. Neither of my parents could \n     afford to attend college. My father worked as a janitor and \n     is currently retired due to his debilitating Parkinson's \n     disease while my mother is a housewife.\n\n  She goes on to talk about how her parents gave her the hope and \naspiration to attend college and how she is now doing it at Sarah \nLawrence because of the Pell grant.\n  Gena Glickman, who is the president of Manchester Community College, \nwrites to me about the students whom she meets and she sees every day \nwho benefit from these programs. She says:\n\n       Pell grants not only help low-income and first-generation \n     students to access postsecondary education and training, they \n     enable them to complete degrees and certificates.\n\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n\n  Senator Whitehouse has given us this statistic that is astonishing \nand alarming: $1 trillion of debt that our students now bear--larger \nthan the amount Americans owe on their credit cards, I believe, and \nthreatening not only their futures but all of our economic futures and \nthe viability of our economy.\n  I would like to ask my colleague from Rhode Island whether and how \nmuch funding is projected to be necessary for the continued viability \nof this program and for America and Americans to compete in the global \neconomy?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I say to Senator Blumenthal, one of the things that \nhas taken place is that the value to the individual student of the Pell \ngrant has actually declined quite a lot over the years since it was \nfirst initiated.\n  When the first Pell grants came out, they paid for nearly three-\nquarters of the typical 4-year public college tuition; 72 percent of \nthat tuition. Now they are down to 32 percent; less than one-third. So \nthere is a lot of room to increase what we can spend on Pell grants. I \nthink it is pretty clear from what the Senator has said and from what \nSenator Tester has said that once someone is college educated, they \nstep into a different economy with a top unemployment rate through this \nawful recession of below 5 percent, they step into a whole new set of \nopportunities, and they step into opportunities that have a higher \nincome potential for them, all of which redounds back to the benefit of \nour country in higher revenues, in a stronger economy, and in more \ninnovation and economic development.\n  So we are going in the wrong direction is the way I would respond, \nand it is time, instead of doing what the Republicans in the House have \nsuggested, which is to go even further in the wrong direction, even \npotentially eliminating this grant, calling it welfare, for Pete's \nsake--remember Amber. This is a woman with two children, working full \ntime and going to school and what enables her to tie that together--the \nlast piece, the keystone in the arch--is the Pell grant. You call that \nwelfare? This is a welfare recipient? I do not think so. But that is \nthe kind of attack these things are under, and it is not just \ninstitutions like Connecticut is famous for and Rhode Island is famous \nfor--super high-end institutions that are internationally renowned--but \nit is also basic community colleges and technical colleges, places \nwhere people can get a solid career.\n  I know Senator Tester wants to say a few words about that and then \nSenator Landrieu.\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes, I do. I thank Senator Whitehouse.\n  We have talked about the unemployment rate and job opportunities for \npeople who get higher education. I was talking to a welding shop in \nFort Benton, MT. Fort Benton is in the north central part of the State. \nThe oil play in the east has been having some impacts even in that area \nof the State. This welding shop that is in Fort Benton--I talked to the \nfellow, and he had some issues he wanted to talk to me about.\n  I said: What is one of the biggest things you have to deal with right \nnow?\n  He said: Right now, I could hire a half a dozen welders. I could hire \nthem tomorrow. The work is out there for them to do.\n  When we talk about getting this economy going again and getting \nthings moving, it is so critically important we not only talk about the \n4-year colleges that develop our entrepreneurs and businesspeople but \nwe also talk about the community colleges, the technical colleges, the \ntribal colleges that do a great job developing a well-trained \nworkforce.\n  With that, I will kick it over to Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am so happy to join my colleagues \nwho have done a beautiful job this morning expressing the importance of \nPell grants to not only the individuals and their families but to the \neconomic vitality of our Nation. I thank Senator Whitehouse, who has \ntaken up this as a cause. We need a champion for Pell grants.\n  I am here to help him and to help Senator Tester, who stepped forward \nto be a leader as well, to say to them that when I go back to my State \nand check--the Senator from Connecticut knows this--when I go back to \nmy State, what I hear is: Senator, without Pell grants, I could not \nmake this happen. Senator, without Pell grants, my parents could not \nafford it.\n  It is not the whole part of tuition, but I think, as Senator \nWhitehouse has said, it is the keystone, it is the cornerstone, it is \nthe centerpiece, it is the foundation of what our students--and some of \nour students who are parents who are raising two and three children, \nholding down one or two jobs--we cannot pull that out from underneath \nthem, I say to the Senator. We just cannot do it.\n  Secondly, I would say I know we have to find a way to balance our \nbudget. I just left the Go Big Conference. I am one of the ones who is \nstanding in the middle, hoping we can come up with not a $1.2 trillion \nsolution but a $4 trillion solution. This is tough. This is hard. But \none of the things that should not be on the chopping block is Pell \ngrants, not because it is a government program--we have to cut back \ngovernment programs--this is the seed corn. This is the seed corn, I \nsay to the Senator, for our future vitality as a nation. We need to be \nsending more kids to college, not less. We need to be producing more \nengineers, not less; more mathematicians. This is our basic grant \nprogram.\n  So I just wanted to come to the floor and join you all. I say to the \nSenator, I want to personally give you letters from people--children \nand adults--from my State. I have a letter from a student from Tulane \nUniversity, a letter from a freshman named Araisa at Loyola University, \nand a letter from a young man named David, who attends Louisiana Tech \nUniversity. These letters speak for themselves. I will put them in the \nRecord, but, I say to the Senator, I wish to also actually give them to \nyou because I want you to be able to hear from students from Louisiana \nas well as Rhode Island, and I tell the Senator that I want to join the \nSenator in this movement to not throw out the seed corn while we are \ntrimming the hedges.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Landrieu, I am a third-year pre-medical student at \n     Tulane University with a major in Cell and Molecular Biology \n     and minors in Spanish and Business. . . .\n       I am in support of the Pell Grant because I would like to \n     continue my education at Tulane. . . . I've watched my \n     parents struggle over the years just to enroll me into \n     private schools to ensure that I receive a good education, \n     and I seek to follow their honorable example. Their financial \n     hardships have inspired me to pursue an improved lifestyle. I \n     hope to take these obstacles and utilize them for what \n     they're worth, applying persistence, dedication, and passion \n     towards my ultimate goal of attaining a medical degree.\n       I love being challenged by my classes and having the \n     opportunity to represent my hometown of New Orleans in an \n     extraordinary way, and Tulane allows for both of these \n     things. I know that with the help of the Pell Grant, I can \n     continue to study at Tulane University and someday be of \n     great service to my family and community. . . .\n           Sincerely,\n     Concerned College Student.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, My name is Araisa and I am a \n     freshman at Loyola University New Orleans. I am majoring in \n     accounting and music industry studies. . . . The Pell grant \n     makes it possible for me to go to Loyola, a university that \n     has a much higher graduation rate than the other schools I \n     was considering. The Pell grant also helps my family avoid \n     the burden of loans. I'm so grateful for the opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n     Araisa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, My name is David. I attend Louisiana \n     Tech University. I major in Business-Marketing. I would like \n     to create my own products and put them on the market. The \n     Pell grant makes a huge difference, because without it I \n     would not be able to afford the classes required for me to \n     receive my degree. Without the Pell grant, my plan would not \n     be what it is today actually, and thanks to the Pell grant, I \n     will guarantee success out of what I was given. I'm so \n     thankful for the Pell!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                            David.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I hope people understand there are differences in some \ngovernment programs. This is a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and our own individual citizens, a partnership with them and \na partnership with the universities, saying: We\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nbelieve in you. We believe in the future of our country and this is our \ninvestment and it should not be cut.\n  I am sure the Senator from Connecticut hears this in Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Senator. If the Senator will yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I agree wholeheartedly with everything the Senator \nhas just said so eloquently about the importance and the partnership of \nthe Pell grants, and I would like to again ask a question to my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, whom I thank, by the way, for organizing \nthis colloquy. His leadership on this issue has been so instrumental, \ncarrying on the great legacy and tradition of Senator Pell.\n  Isn't it a fact, I ask Senator Whitehouse, that throughout its \nhistory, the Pell Grant Program has enjoyed strong bipartisan support; \nthere has been nothing partisan or Republican or Democratic about \nadvancing American higher education in this way?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes. That is a great point, I say to the Senator. One \nof the unfortunate aspects of the current condition we have in \nWashington, DC, is that a party that has long supported Pell grants--it \nhas long enjoyed bipartisan support--has suddenly, after--what has it \nbeen, 30 years of support for the Pell grant--has suddenly walked away \nfrom it, has suddenly decided: No, we have a new agenda. Helping people \nwho cannot otherwise afford college to have a chance to go to college, \nwithout carrying that trillion-dollar burden of debt and to be able to \nmove up into the college-educated economy and into the opportunities \nand potential that creates, that is not what we are interested in any \nlonger. We are interested in other things.\n  Clearly, they are interested in protecting the tax breaks for people \nmaking over $1 million. We tried to get jobs legislation through here. \nIt was paid for with a tiny tax only on the dollars over $1 million \nthat people earning over $1 million earn. On the first million dollars, \nthere is no difference. The second million dollars is where it started \nto kick in. No, no. We stopped jobs legislation over that. But when it \ncomes to a kid who cannot afford college, that is a program they \nsuddenly want to take a whack at. I think it is regrettable because \nthere is a long history of very honorable, sincere, and enthusiastic \nRepublican support for the Pell grant. Frankly, there is nothing \nDemocratic or Republican about an American young person having the \nchance to begin to climb the ladder of success. That is a common \nAmerican dream. That is common to both parties. Yet now, in this \nstrange environment we now have to inhabit in Washington, this other \nparty has decided: No, we are walking away from that.\n  In the House, they tried to knock more than $1,750 out of the average \ngrant. They would have put nearly 5,800 students in Rhode Island off \nthe Pell grant. When we hear from people such as Amber, who would not \nbe able to do it but for that--this group I spoke with at URI was so \nimpressive. We had regular students who were right in line. We had the \nnontraditional students, such as Amber, who had their kids. We had \nfaculty who years ago had gotten their Pell grants and now they are \nteaching others. They have made a career in academia as a result of \nthat first foothold they got in higher education through the Pell \ngrants. How one would want to cut it at that point by that much, when \nwe have these people--it is just enough to make it possible for them. \nWhen we cut it by over $1,750 for a lot of those kids, for a lot of \nthose working moms, it means: No, we are pulling, as the Senator said, \nthe rug out from under them. They do not get that chance.\n  We all win when young Americans step forward. Everybody in America \nwins when young Americans reach their full potential and create \nindustries and do a great job and save lives as surgeons or nurses or \nEMTs and pay revenues through their taxes through their successes to \nsupport our great country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would say this program is one of the most effective \nantiwelfare programs in the country that we fund in Washington. A \nstudent from Xavier University wrote in. This student is a first-year \nstudent majoring in biology, in premed. This is an African-American \nCatholic University--the only one in the country and it produces more \npremed students and more doctors than almost the largest.\n  Madam President, I know we have just 1 minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President is the product of a single-family home \nand was the only individual employed in her household. So as she is \ngoing to school, she is also employed, supporting the whole household, \nbasically keeping them off other government programs that might not be \nas effective.\n  The Senator's, leadership is to be commended. I thank him for it.\n  I am going to submit more of these specific stories from specific \nstudents and families for the Record so people understand this is not \npolitics. This is just trying to do what is smart for our country and \nto do what is right for these young people who are trying so hard.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Additional Stories From Louisiana Students\n\n       Student A from Xavier University is a sophomore, majoring \n     in chemistry/pre-pharmacy. During the last two years of high \n     school, she became homeless. She relied on friends and \n     grandparents until she found an apartment during the end of \n     her senior year of high school. Then she worked two jobs to \n     keep a roof over her head. As a student without parental \n     assistance or scholarship funding, she receives $5,500 per \n     year. She would be unable to remain in college without Pell \n     Grant assistance.\n       Student B from Xavier University is a first-year student \n     majoring in biology/pre-med with the goal of becoming a \n     specialized surgeon. She is the product of a single-parent \n     home, and was the only individual employed in her household \n     before enrolling at Xavier. She has paid the balance of her \n     tuition and expenses but still owes Xavier $3,000. This \n     amount must be paid before she can take her final exams. If \n     she loses her Pell Grant, she would owe an additional $5,500. \n     She is the first person in her family to attend a four-year \n     college. Receiving the Pell Grant helped make that possible.\n       Student C from Loyola University at New Orleans is a first-\n     year visual arts student. He had a 3.0 GPA at the midterm of \n     his first semester. He is a work-study student in graphic \n     arts and has to spend a lot of his earned money on art \n     supplies. He receives the full Pell Grant, $5,550 per year. \n     Without these funds, his mom would not be able to afford to \n     send him to Loyola, or likely to any 4-year university. His \n     mom is his primary next of kin--she is not employed and \n     currently lives in a shelter.\n       Student D from Loyola University at New Orleans is a \n     sophomore pursuing biochemistry. She is from Mississippi and \n     wants to be a doctor or biomedical engineer. She has a work \n     study job on campus. She receives the full Pell Grant, $5,550 \n     per year, and could not afford to be there otherwise.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I will yield the floor with \nappreciation to my colleagues, Senator Landrieu, Senator Tester, and \nSenator Blumenthal, for coming together to urge our colleagues to \nsupport the Pell grant.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, is it time to begin the Republican \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, will you let me know when I have used \n4\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7593-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7593-S7594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BOILER MACT RULE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, last week during the debate on clean \nair, in which I opposed overturning a rule that allows dirty air from \nother States to blow into Tennessee, costing us jobs, and hurting our \nhealth, I said: Why should we be picking on a good rule when the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is a happy hunting ground of \nunreasonable regulations.\n  I just wish to take a moment to talk about perhaps the foremost of \nthose unreasonable regulations, which we call the boiler MACT rule. \nThis is a regulation that will force thousands of industrial boilers \naround America to\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\ninstall the maximum available control technology on their boilers. This \nis important in order to clean the air of such pollutants as mercury.\n  That is a good idea. What is a bad idea is EPA only gives 3 years for \ncompanies to install this technology, a time frame that is completely \nunrealistic. This is not like a lot of the other clean air laws and \nrules that have been around for years; this is an unexpected new rule \non thousands of industrial boilers which are essential to our \nmanufacturing jobs in America.\n  First, there is not enough time to comply with the rule, and second, \nEPA used a flawed methodology in determining what fuels could be used. \nAs a result, little businesses and big businesses all over America are \ngoing to be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to \ncomply with this rule instead of spending that money on creating jobs.\n  That is just not one Republican Senator saying this. We have 12 \nDemocratic Senators and a number of Republican Senators who have \nintroduced legislation. Senator Collins is the leader of this effort. I \nam a part of it. So is Senator Wyden, Senator Pryor, and Senator \nLandrieu. What we are saying is, let's give the EPA enough time to fix \nthe rule. Fifteen months is what EPA has asked for. Let's give the EPA \nadditional authority to use the correct methodology so they can write a \nrule that makes some sense and does not act as though it is delivered \nfrom Mars or Venus or some other planet, and then let's give the \nindustries enough time to comply with the rules, instead of 3 years, \nwhich is what the rule suggests, we will give them 5 years.\n  Let me try to give some sense of the impact of this unworkable rule. \nIts estimates that this rule will result in a loss of 340,000 jobs \nnationwide. We just passed, in a bipartisan way, three trade agreements \nwhich the President said would create 250,000 jobs. It took us 3 years \nto do that. It was something Republicans and Democrats agreed on. We \nthought that was a big step forward. Yet here we are allowing this \nagency to go forward with an absolutely unworkable rule that will cost \n340,000 jobs. In my State of Tennessee, the cost to businesses is $530 \nmillion.\n  I have talked to owners of small businesses who are facing a $1 \nmillion cost to try to implement this unworkable rule on their boilers. \nThey have told me they will close their plants. They cannot possibly \nafford it comply with this rule in this short of a time period.\n  I have talked to large industries that are affected. Eastman \nChemicals is one, they've been in Tennessee forever. It is as an \nimportant part of our State as the Great Smoky Mountains are. Thousands \nof Tennesseans work there. This is what they say: They are going to \nspend more than $100 million over and above the work they have already \nplanned in order to bring five Eastman boilers into compliance with the \nEPA regulations.\n  This is a company with $7 billion in revenue. They are going to \nsurvive. But some jobs will not. Instead of creating jobs with that \nmoney; they will just be trying to comply with an unworkable government \nregulation. The majority leader said on the floor: Regulations don't \ncost jobs. Here is a prime example that shows unworkable regulations do \ncost jobs. And 12 Democratic Senators and at least as many Republican \nSenators agree on that. We have a bipartisan way to fix this rule. The \nHouse, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, agreed with us by passing \nsimilar legislation.\n  I want to call this Collins-Alexander-Wyden-Pryor-Landrieu \nlegislation to the attention of the public, to the attention of the \nSenate, and say, there are some regulations that are before us that \nneed to be changed. They are costing jobs. This is not Republican \nrhetoric or Democratic excuses. It is Republicans and Democrats saying \nto the EPA: We want to give you the authority to write a good rule. We \nwant you to fix the rule. We want a clean air standard. We do not want \nto change the end result of the rule, but we want to give you enough \ntime to write the rule. We want you to be able to use the correct \nmethod in writing this rule so companies can comply. And we want to \ngive companies enough time to install these technologies so they can \nmake reductions in these harmful pollutants.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This is a rare piece of legislation, something we \nagree on across the aisle, that could immediately save 340,000 jobs, \nthat keeps the clean air rule the EPA has proposed, but simply gives \nthem time to write it properly, the authority to write it properly, and \nbusinesses the opportunity to comply with it within a reasonable period \nof time.\n  I hope we will adopt it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded, and Senator Coons and I be allowed to \nengage in a colloquy for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7594-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7594-S7596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AGREE ACT\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, we are going to start today by talking \nabout job creation in America. I wish to turn it over to Senator Coons \nto begin this conversation about a very important piece of legislation \nwe filed jointly yesterday.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Senator Rubio and I have come to floor today to talk about our shared \nexperiences. In my home State of Delaware, over the 1 year I have been \na Senator--and over the years before that, I served in county \ngovernment--I have heard from hundreds, even thousands, of families and \nindividuals looking for work, deeply hurt and challenged by the ongoing \nslow economic recovery. Folks have come to us asking for opportunities \nfor assistance, for promise and hope.\n  In reality, I think what is causing some real concern in this \ncountry, in my State and most likely in yours, Madam President, and \nmost likely in Senator Rubio's as well, is a broadly shared concern \nthat we here in the Capitol, we in Congress, are not capable of getting \npast the partisan politics and making real progress in tackling the \njob-creating challenges before us.\n  Let me, if I could, quote from a couple of letters I have received \nfrom Delawareans in the last few months. Lawrence from Milford wrote my \noffice: Congress needs to stop the political arguing and take positive \naction to make America and our economy strong again.\n  Janet from Wilmington wrote: I am the owner of a very small business. \nI have been in business 29 years and I have never seen it as tough as \nit is today.\n  Joseph in Smyrna summed it all up in a letter he wrote: Our economy \nneeds jobs now.\n  Delaware is a great place to grow a business, to raise a family, to \nachieve success. But we have the toughest economy we have seen in \ngenerations. The folks we represent expect us to act, and they expect \nus to find ways to work together and to get past the partisan divide \nthat has made it so difficult for us to make progress.\n  I ask the Senator what sorts of things has he heard from his \nconstituents in Florida, and how has that motivated the Senator to act?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Let me point out a couple of things before we begin; that \nis there are a lot of issues in this process we are not going to agree \non. There is an ideological divide about a lot of major issues--the \nrole of government, how do we get the economy growing again, and what \ngovernment can do about it. The people of America recognize that. They \nrecognize that issues of that magnitude ultimately are solved at the \nballot box. You elect people. People run for office on their competing \nvisions of government's role, and you decide those elections. We are \ngoing to have one in November of 2012.\n  But what do we do over the next 12 months? Do we stand around and do \nnothing and continue to bring up pieces of legislation from both sides \nof the aisle that we know are going to fail, just to make political \npoints, or do we actually begin to act? There are a lot of reasons why \nI think we need to act.\n  I want to share with you an e-mail I received from Stephanie, who \nlives in Vero Beach. It breaks your heart. I\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nthink it is very typical of the ones Senator Coons probably has gotten, \nand I bet you all of the other Members of this institution have gotten.\n  She writes: I am not sure who to turn to with this question. I am a \ntrue Floridian. I was born and raised in Florida. As you know, the \nunemployment rate is horrible and I had to file for unemployment \nbenefits for the first time ever. And I was just informed that I \nexhausted my benefits. Where do I turn for help? There are no jobs \navailable. I have searched for a job daily and get excuses such as: You \ndon't have enough experience, or you are overqualified, or I am \nsuggested to go back to school. How am I going to go back to school if \nI have no money to pay for school or have no job and no money to pay my \nbills.\n  It goes on to outline other problems. But at the end it says: Many \npeople like myself have nowhere to turn. Hopefully you can help me or \nat least suggest what I can do. Thank you for your time.\n  There is the voice of real desperation, of real people in the real \nworld who want to work, have always worked, and cannot find a job. This \nis the No. 1 issue in America. There are a lot of issues floating \naround here and they are important issues. But this is the No. 1 issue \nin America of everyday, hard-working people who cannot find a job.\n\n  Can government create jobs for them? In government. But, by and \nlarge, there are things government can do to help create an environment \nfor job creation. So what we have done is we have sat down and we have \nanalyzed what things we have agreed on. There are things that are the \nPresident's plan, that are also in the Republicans' plan that the House \nhas passed, that our colleagues have filed. What we came up with is \nthis piece of legislation that Senator Coons is going to describe in a \nmoment.\n  It is literally sitting down. It is a collection of bills we have \nagreed on. What people want to know is, I understand you are going to \nhave arguments about the things you disagree on, but why are you \narguing about the things you agree on?\n  Maybe this is a good segue for Senator Coons to start describing some \nof the measures that are in this bill, the things we agree on, the \nthings we can act on and do right now to help people such as Stephanie \nand people in your home State and people in every one of the States in \nthis country who are struggling to find a job and are looking for some \nray of hope that this process here in Washington has an understanding \nabout what they are going through and are actually willing to do \nsomething about.\n  Mr. COONS. We together yesterday announced the introduction of the \nAGREE Act, the American Growth Recovery Entrepreneurship and \nEmpowerment Act, which conveniently spells out ``agree.'' The core \nprinciple, as Senator Rubio described, was for a real Republican and a \nreal Democrat to look through all of the different ideas that have been \nput out there, in the President's jobs bill, by the President's Council \non Jobs and Competitiveness, by Members of the Senate and the House \nfrom both parties, that we could come to agreement on, and to put them \ninto a bill packaged to assemble all of these ideas and to put them out \nand hopefully we will pick up cosponsors, hope it will pick up steam, \nand hope we can demonstrate to the American people, to the families \nSenator Rubio and I have heard from in letters and e-mails and tweets, \nwho have expressed real concern.\n  The basic big-picture proposals in this bill are, first, extending \ntax relief for small businesses. There are three different provisions \nthat have already been in law but that would be extended by this bill: \nfor capital gains exclusions for 5-year investments in qualified small \nbusinesses, for accelerated depreciation, and for increased expensing, \nall of which would help small businesses invest in growth; encouraging \ncutting-edge research and innovation by making permanent the R tax \ncredit, and by adding something to it that I think has real potential, \nan added incentive for companies that invent something here to \nmanufacture it here; another, commonsense regulatory relief for fast-\ngrowing businesses that seek to go public; another, an idea originally \nchampioned by Senator Casey, providing incentives through the Tax Code \nfor veterans to become franchise owners and entrepreneurs; reducing \nsome immigration barriers that prevent highly skilled workers who \nstudied here from staying here; and now the last point, protecting \nAmerican businesses from intellectual property theft, strengthening our \nability to prevent counterfeit goods from coming into American markets \nby fixing a small but real barrier to effective border protection \nagainst counterfeiting.\n  All of these provisions are provisions that have already enjoyed \nbipartisan support in other settings. We have simply assembled them \ntogether, put them into a commonsense package, and want to move them \nforward.\n  I ask Senator Rubio, what sort of response has our action gotten so \nfar from people in Florida, around the country, who might have \ncontacted the Senator about this initiative?\n  Mr. RUBIO. It has been a very positive response, and I will tell you \nwhy, for a couple of reasons. No. 1 is, every time people open a \nnewspaper or turn on the television, what they get from Washington is \nbad news. A week ago, in a speech I gave, I said it resembles \nprofessional wrestling to them. It seems as though there are people \nfrom the Republican side and Democratic side who go on TV and scream at \neach other about what is happening. People watch it. And they get it, \nthat there are differences between us. But is there anything--don't we \nall live in the same country? Are we not seeing the same economic \nconditions? What are the things we can work together on? Why are we not \nhearing that?\n  Let me tell you the impact in the real world of all of that bad news. \nThe impact is that people get scared. So imagine for a moment, you are \na job creator. You have got some money to invest this year. You have to \ndecide, do I leave it in the bank or do I take this money and use it to \ngrow my business?\n  Well, the safe thing to do is to leave it in the bank. But what job \ncreators and entrepreneurs want to do is to create new jobs. They want \nto grow their businesses. Who does not want to grow their business? Who \ndoes not want to add customers? Now you have to make a decision. Is now \nthe right time to grow my business or the wrong time?\n  One of the things people look at is the political climate. Are the \npeople in charge of government--in Washington especially? That is the \none that gets the most attention. How are they working? Are they \ngetting things done? Is it positive or negative things that are \nhappening?\n  As much as the measures here are meaningful--and we are not claiming \nthis solves all our economic problems, but they are meaningful--if you \nare a small business looking to invest next year in buying capital \ninvestment for your business, there is an incentive to extend the tax \ncredits to help you do that. More importantly, they will be able to \nopen the newspaper and read that Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether and passed a piece of legislation on which they agreed.\n  I don't think you can underestimate or, quite frankly, really measure \nthe kind of psychological impact that could have on job creators--to \nactually have some optimism that the future will be better, that \ntomorrow may be better than today. That, as much as anything else, is \ncritical. All of us in public service, particularly those of us who \nserve in this institution--the Senate is a big deal. People pay \nattention to what we say here, to the good stuff and the bad stuff. \nThey pay attention to what we do here and to what we fail to do here. I \nthink it is important for all of us to recognize that our actions have \nconsequences and the way we speak and comport ourselves in these \ndebates. I think we need to recognize that some of the rhetoric and \nnoise that has been made over the last 6 months to a year has hurt job \ncreation because it has created negativity around the economics of this \ncountry.\n  We have an opportunity, with the passage of legislation such as this, \nto send a message on the things on which we agree; we can get things \ndone. That is the impression I have gotten from people, which is a \nlittle bit of a surprise, but it is a sense of optimism that before \nthis year is out, we will be able to pass legislation that is \nmeaningful and bipartisan. Is that the same reaction the Senator from \nDelaware has gotten?\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n  Mr. COONS. That is right. I have gotten immediate response from \nTwitter, e-mail, et cetera, in my office account. I got a tweet from \nJason, who wrote:\n\n       Kudos . . . for introducing jobs-creating legislation. Good \n     to see detailed plans rather than partisan bickering.\n\n  Another tweet said this:\n\n       If AGREE is a jobs act that can get passed, I, an American \n     that cares about the unemployed, say ``thanks.''\n\n  Mary June from Delaware City wrote:\n\n       I think it is great to see a bipartisan approach to solving \n     the jobs crisis in the United States. Thank you for getting \n     past party lines and coming together to provide commonsense \n     solutions.\n\n  Maria from Middletown wrote:\n\n       I think it is time for both parties to come together as you \n     and Senator Rubio have to bring our country back to where we \n     have people working again and families striving to achieve \n     the American dream. The same dream that I had when I was \n     growing up. The dream I thought my sons and granddaughter \n     were going to live. The business as usual in Washington has \n     to stop, and through this bill you will both prove to your \n     fellow Senators that if you all work together, anything is \n     possible.\n\n  To be clear, as Senator Rubio said, there are real differences, real \nthings that divide the parties. There is time ahead before the election \nto resolve those fundamental differences in values, approach, and \npriorities. But, while we can, we should come together with commonsense \nproposals that demonstrate to the American people that we can take \nideas, Republican and Democrat, House and Senate, put them in a package \nand pass them on to the President, because 12 months is too long to \nwait.\n  As we all wait for the outcome of the supercommittee this week, I \nknow confidence is one of the major issues we have concerns about--\nconfidence in the marketplace, the confidence to take risks and invest, \nand the confidence to grow. In my view, this bill, this initiative \nshows that both parties can and do have confidence in American \ninventors, American investors, our veterans, and America's \nentrepreneurs.\n  I am grateful for a chance to work on this. I ask the Senator, what \nis the next step and where do we go from here?\n  Mr. RUBIO. The next step is to get as many people in this Chamber and \nin the House to sign on to this legislation and to get this done. We \nare open to suggestions about how to improve it. Maybe there are some \nthings that should be in there. Maybe there are questions involving \nparticular measures. We are open to suggestions. We need to get the \nball rolling. Our time is about to run out.\n  I want to recognize that one of the ways to lose credibility is to \nexaggerate. The differences between our parties about the role of \ngovernment, about the Tax Code, and about the debt situation are real. \nWe will debate those. To my friends on the right and left--both sides--\nwe have real differences, and this is the place to deal with it. We are \nblessed to live in a republic where we can debate our points of view as \nto the role of government. We do agree on certain issues, and we should \nwork on that.\n  Today is an open invitation to our colleagues to join us, look at \nthis bill, analyze it, and see if there is something you would like to \nadd or maybe that we left out that should be in there. The more the \nmerrier. To those who think there are things that maybe should be \nchanged or improved in this bill, we are open to that as well. We want \nto get this done and deliver something to the American people as soon \nas possible that shows that here in Washington, DC, we can agree. I \nbelieve that would be a positive first step in the right direction.\n  Our time has expired.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, what is the parliamentary status \nnow?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is still in morning \nbusiness.

That part I am not disputing at this point.\n  The language in the bill that we are concerned about is on page 41. \nIt says in that part of the bill:\n\n       Notwithstanding various other provisions, the Secretary of \n     Energy shall sell $500 million in petroleum product from the \n     reserve not later than March 1 of 2012, and shall deposit any \n     proceeds from such sales in the general fund of the Treasury.\n\n  In the words of the Department of Energy:\n\n       The Strategic Petroleum Reserve exists, first and foremost, \n     as an emergency response tool the President can use should \n     the United States be confronted with an economically \n     threatening disruption in oil supplies.\n\n  The SPR is our Nation's insurance policy against oil supply \ndisruptions, and keeping it well stocked and operational is important \nto our energy security. I believe that is a view shared by Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  The SPR became filled to its maximum capacity of roughly 727 million \nbarrels for the first time in its history in the year 2009.\n  The President, in the budget he submitted--the 2012 budget--proposed \na sale of oil from the SPR that would generate $500 million in revenue \nfor the Federal Treasury. The administration explained that because the \nSPR was at maximum capacity, it needed to sell off some oil for \noperational purposes. They needed extra space in the SPR in order to \nmove oil around within the system and to refurbish some of the \nunderground salt caverns in which the oil is stored.\n  However, this past June, there was an emergency drawdown, and there \nwas a sale of 30 million barrels of SPR oil. I understand that the \nemergency sale generated more than $3 billion. This indicates to me \nthat more than six times the amount of oil that the President thought \nwas necessary to be sold for operational reasons has now been sold.\n  Clearly, the President's proposal from February to create a little \nfree space in the SPR is no longer necessary. The concern we have is \nthat the SPR sale provision in this legislation remains part of an \nappropriations bill,\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nand the sale is no longer necessary for operational purposes; it is \nsimply a way of generating revenue.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the long-term implications of \nusing our strategic oil stocks just to generate revenue for the \noperation of government on a weekly and monthly basis. I believe this \nis a bad precedent. I believe we should reject this part of the \nlegislation, and if the opportunity presents itself to offer the \namendment, I will urge our colleagues to join us in deleting this \nprovision and ensuring that future revenue-generating sales of SPR oil \nnot be accomplished or proposed simply to pay the ordinary operating \nbills of the various agencies covered by the legislation.\n  I know my colleague from Alaska is expected to come to the floor in \nthe next few minutes and give her views on this same legislation that \nshe and I are cosponsoring, the amendment I have just spoken about. \nUntil then, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Bingaman for his \ncomments. He has been an excellent chair of the committee.\n  It is our understanding that these points were never brought to the \ncommittee. However, I am told the Energy Department has told my staff \nthat the budget request is valid due to the Department's need for \noperational flexibility.\n  I want everybody to know that the floor is open. If you filed an \namendment, please come down to speak on it. If you want to file one, \nplease do so as quickly as possible. The floor is open for amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have come to the floor this morning \nto discuss a provision in the Energy and Water appropriations bill that \napparently Senator Bingaman has just spoken to. This would require the \nsale of $500 million worth of oil from our Nation's Strategic Petroleum \nReserve or we call it the SPR. I do believe this is an inappropriate \nuse of our limited emergency stockpiles, and I think it would also set \na dangerous and an unsustainable precedent for the future.\n  As I understand it, the administration first requested this sale in \nits fiscal year 2012 budget proposal and justified it by asserting \nthere was an integrity issue in one of the caverns where the SPR oil \nwas stored. We heard this discussion before the Energy Committee some \nmonths ago. He asserted the sale was necessary because DOE had to drain \nthe oil in that cavern to perform some repairs that were apparently \nnecessary.\n  The House Appropriations Committee subsequently authorized the sale \nin its version of the bill which was then released in June. At that \npoint in time, based upon DOE's representation, I guess it was kind of \nhard not to argue the sale was not justified. But then events took a \ndifferent course. Several weeks later, as part of a coordinated effort \nwith the IEA to increase global supplies, the President chose to sell \nabout six times more crude from the SPR than the House had originally \ncontemplated.\n  Whether one supported that sale or not, I think it would have been \nreasonable to assume or to expect the administration would sell the \ncrude from the cavern that needed the repairs. They needed to get that \nout so they could do the necessary repairs. So when an unannounced sale \ncomes along, one would think they would take the oil from that cavern, \nthereby solving at least one of the problems and obviating the need of \na future maintenance-related sale. Enough oil has now been sold from \nour emergency reserves to fill not one but six troubled caverns.\n  The only justification that can remain now is the need for more cash. \nWe need more money. Given that background, I would encourage the Senate \nto consider that selling $500 million worth of our emergency oil \nreserves right now simply to help offset other appropriations is akin \nto cashing out our insurance policy in order to cover the cost of a \nmortgage we can't afford in the first place.\n  The SPR was designed to be that emergency safety net, if you will, or \nlike an insurance policy. Remember, there is a very good reason why we \nhave this insurance policy in the first place. Congress created the SPR \nin the aftermath of the oil embargo back in the 1970s to serve as a \nsafety net in the event we were to see a major supply disruption. Given \nthe volatility that continues to churn the global markets, our \nstrategic stockpile is arguably more important today than ever before. \nAs long as we maintain a large volume of oil within the SPR, we will \nensure Americans have some level of protection against future \ndisruptions. If we decide not to take the long view, we face the very \nreal risk of being forced to spend more tomorrow to repurchase the oil \nthat is being sold today.\n  One may ask: How likely is any kind of a future disruption? I would \nsay the odds are still higher than we would like. Our Nation remains \nroughly 50 percent dependent on foreign oil, importing close to 9 \nmillion barrels a day at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars a \nyear. The world, as we know, is not exactly stable. Large volumes of \nLibyan oil remain offline. Iran continues to provoke its neighbors, \nraising the specter of future attacks. Saudi Arabia's leadership is \naging rapidly, leaving the door open to perhaps future unrest and \nupheaval. China, India, and many of the other countries are rapidly \nexpanding their oil consumption and, in the meantime, forging close \nrelationships with major suppliers that can be leveraged in times of \nemergency.\n  Here at home, the Federal Government continues to hinder the \ndevelopment of new supplies that would improve our energy security and \nreduce the need for a strategic reserve. We have seen development \nhalted or delayed in Alaska in the northern part of the State, in the \nRocky Mountain West, and a number of other areas. The new 5-year \nleasing plan for offshore development does take a few small steps, but \nit keeps both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts under a de facto \nmoratorium through at least 2017. The administration has also delayed \nits decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. We just saw that news this \nweek. This would have carried significant volumes of Canadian oil. \nAgain, that is oil from an ally, from a neighbor, that would have \nbrought that into this country.\n  The result is, we are not doing, in my opinion, nearly enough to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil, so we still need a Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, and we cannot treat it as a national ATM that can be \ntapped when the money is tight. That is not the reason we should have \nor the way to utilize the SPR.\n\n  I wish to share a quote from a witness who testified before the \nEnergy Committee earlier this year. His name is Kevin Book. He is a \nreal expert on energy policy, and I think he made quite an impression \non our committee. He encouraged us to seek alternatives to petroleum, \nbut he also said:\n\n       Selling oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay \n     for efficiency gains and alternative fuels could seriously \n     diminish U.S. energy security without necessarily delivering \n     financial benefits.\n\n  For anybody who might be interested, I am happy to provide a copy of \nhis testimony. I think it was quite useful in understanding why this \napproach is not appropriate at this point in time.\n  As we seek to pay for legislation that comes before us--whether it is \nthis appropriations bill or something else--I continue to believe one \nof our best paths forward is to produce more of our own abundant \nresources and then put the resulting Federal revenues to good use. \nInstead of selling our emergency oil and risking future dilemmas, we \nshould, instead, put policies in place that expand and that accelerate \nthe pace at which we develop our immense natural resources.\n  Right now, Alaska has about 40 billion barrels of oil that are just \nwaiting\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\nto be tapped for the good of the Nation. I keep saying we have money \nthat is buried in the ground up there. If we harness those resources \nand more of the resources in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rocky Mountain \nWest, we would be dramatically increasing our energy security, we would \ncreate tens of thousands of new jobs, and generate billions and \nbillions of dollars year after year that could be applied to both \ndeficit reduction and the development of new energy technologies.\n  I would encourage the Senate to support any amendment that strikes \nthe SPR provision in this bill and encourage us, instead, to focus on \nthe development of a more viable long-term energy policy.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7598-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7598-S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SUPERCOMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. During the summer, Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress, as Americans well remember, had a big fight over trying to \nreduce spending as we approached the Nation's debt limit.\n  As we know, the product of that fight was a leadership-brokered deal \nthat promised long-term savings in discretionary spending of around \n$900 billion over 10 years, not just in 1 year. It also created the \nSupercommittee, which has been meeting in secret to find another $1.2 \ntrillion in possible savings. We hope they do and they should, frankly, \nfind more in savings. Whatever they come up with must be voted on in \nthe Senate without any amendment and cannot be altered in any way. This \nis concerning to me. Virtually every deal we have seen this year has \nbeen filled with promises of savings, but when we analyze them, the \nsavings are not nearly as real as promised. So we do not need another \nplan with tax hikes that never go away and promises of spending cuts \nthat do not materialize or are not continued.\n\n  Indeed, the debt limit deal, which produced the Budget Control Act \nthis summer, claims to contain a spending cap, but that is not \naccurate. It is a phony cap. The cuts that matter most are, in many \nrespects, those that of course take place right away. But, after all of \nthe bickering and drama, we ended up with a deal that cut discretionary \nspending by only a paltry $7 billion from the fiscal year 2011 \ndiscretionary budget. To put this number in perspective, the total \noutlays for 2011 are $145 billion greater than 2010, and our deficit is \nnearly $1.3 trillion--$1,300 billion deficit. We are talking about \npromising a $7 billion reduction in spending. Nevertheless, $7 billion \nin discretionary cuts, at least, is real and a small step, in the right \ndirection; right?\n  We are supposed to spend $1,043 billion this year. That is $7 billion \nless from the $1,050 billion in discretionary spending from last year. \nUnfortunately, this is one more empty promise, because the legislation \nwas rushed through--this Budget Control Act--in the eleventh hour at \nthe fifty-ninth minute. Nobody, at that time, knew there was a gimmick \nin it.\n  Here is how it worked: The Budget Control Act created a cap \nadjustment for disaster relief funding. It took a 10-year average for \nemergency spending and estimated that to be $11.3 billion for 2012. \nBut, this $11.3 billion in the Budget Control Act is a new fund, and it \nis spent by regular appropriations, not by 60 votes--as in the past for \nemergency spending--and it is above the $1,043 billion figure. So the \ntruth is, the bill is not and never was $1,043 billion, as promised, a \nlimit on spending to that amount, but $1,054 billion. Therefore, \nspending for discretionary accounts this year will be larger than last \nyear.\n  The writers of the Budget Control Act went even further. They changed \nthe Senate rule in this bill that was passed at the fifty-ninth minute \nof the eleventh hour to eliminate the 60-vote rule even for emergency \nspending, creating another loophole. So a 60-vote point of order--which \nhas been used here over the years to challenge a designation as \nemergency spending--has been stripped as part of a bill denominated as \na Budget Control Act, so the new fund can be spent--this $11.3 \nbillion--at any time as a normal appropriation, as if it were within \nthe budget and without a 60-vote requirement. This eliminates the \npressure to stay within the budget to offset annual disaster spending \nas a number of us have been attempting to do in recent years.\n  For instance, if you have $2 billion in disaster spending as part of \na specific appropriation, instead of eliminating $2 billion in waste \nsomewhere else in order to keep your total spending within the budget, \nyou have free access to the $11 billion fund and do not have to worry \nabout offsetting a penny. You also do not need a vote for disaster \nfunding approval. As a result, this little offset issue has grown as a \ntribute to the effectiveness of Senator Tom Coburn, who has been \nfighting to offset so-called emergency spending designations. The 60-\nvote requirement to pass the emergency bill gave him some leverage and \nability to challenge the spending and challenge the appropriators in \norder to find offsets for the new spending. Instead of calling this the \nBudget Control Act, we should call it the Coburn control act. This is \nnot a step forward for us.\n  The real spending cap now is $1,054 billion, $4 billion more than we \nspent last year. You only need to go through an emergency designation \nprocess if you want to spend even more than that, but you do not need \n60 votes even for that. The irony here is that there was widespread \nbelief, in this Chamber, that we needed to tighten the emergency \nspending designation, because it was being abused.\n  To give one unbelievable example, the Senate counted $210 million in \nthe routine funding for the census as emergency spending. The census is \nin the Constitution and is required to be conducted every 10 years. How \nin the world can we say this is unexpected emergency spending? It is as \nroutine as anything can possibly be. It was done because otherwise \nspending would be needed to have been cut by $200 million somewhere \nelse. The Budget Control Act has succeeded in actually weakening the \nstandard for emergency spending and creates one more loophole for the \nspender.\n  Again, the effect of the $11 billion fund is that it effectively \nnullifies the cap we were promised. The appropriating committee will \nhave no incentive to achieve savings when they can spend every penny of \nthe $1,043 billion base budget all while knowing there is still another \n$11 billion to be spent when they exhaust the first allotment. The \nevidence of this is before our very eyes. To date, in one form or \nanother, seven appropriations bills have come before the Senate floor. \nFour of them have been voted on and passed. The Energy and Water bill \nis before us this week. We should have been considering each of these \nbills individually and doing our due diligence, but we haven't. They \nhave been moved through in groups. But, I am glad this legislation, the \nEnergy and Water bill, will be considered on its own, and not bundled \nwith others as a mini-bus or omnibus as the Washington parlance goes. \nThe bad news is that the seven bills we have seen on the floor have \nalready increased spending by $9 billion. We are well on our way to \nusing every cent of the $11 billion fund, with no effort to achieving \nsavings elsewhere to stay under budget.\n  The Energy and Water bill on the floor now increases spending by $1 \nbillion. That may seem small in Washington terms, but it is the reason \nwe are going broke. A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon it is \na great deal of money. If we can't, honestly, even reach the paltry \ngoal of $7 billion in savings, how on Earth can we tackle our $15 \ntrillion debt?\n  Or consider food stamps. Federal welfare spending is now about $700 \nbillion a year. It is more than $900 billion a year when you count \nstate obligations or contributions to the same programs. Food stamps \nare the fastest growing major item in the welfare budget. They have \nquadrupled in 10 years. The Food Stamp Program is one of 18 federal \nnutritional support programs in the budget--1 of 18. The number of \npeople receiving food stamps has climbed from about 1 in 50, when the \nprogram went national, to almost 1 in 7 today.\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\n  Some of the more than 45 million people receiving food stamps exceed \nthe program's eligibility requirements. They have higher income or \nhigher assets than you are supposed to have to qualify. But, they \nreceived the benefits because they get them as a reciprocal benefit for \nother Federal benefits they get. If they qualify for one program, they \nare then categorically entitled to the Food Stamp Program even though \nthey do not meet the basic requirements. And reports of fraud and abuse \nare widespread.\n\n  We were promised recommendations by the chairwoman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Stabenow, for how the supercommittee could achieve \nsavings in the agriculture budget of which food stamps is the largest \ncomponent of the entire agriculture budget, by far, dwarfing other \nexpenditures, such as aid to farmers. They were supposed to arrive, the \nSenator promised, by November 1, but as of now, we are still waiting.\n  The sad truth is our Democratic-led Senate has not met its \nresponsibility to help this Nation confront its most serious threat, \nand that is the debt we have. It is the greatest economic danger of our \ntime, as we have repeatedly been warned. If we ultimately fail to \ncontrol Federal spending, which has nearly doubled in 10 years, we will \nexperience a debt crisis that leads to loss of jobs, loss of growth, \nand loss of economic opportunity. Such a crisis will hurt those with \nless income the most. It is our duty to stop the occurrence of this \nvery preventible tragedy.\n  Instead of the irresponsible spending favored by the political class, \nit is time for Washington to be more accountable, to focus on the \nmiddle class. That means creating jobs through the private sector, \nproducing more American energy, keeping our wealth at home, making the \ngovernment lean and productive, a servant of the American people, \nconfronting our dangerously rising debt, which threatens our economy \nand jobs, adopting a globally competitive tax code, upholding the rule \nof law and trade, eliminating unwise, damaging regulation, and finally, \ndelivering the good people of this country the honest and responsible \nbudget they deserve.\n  We have a long way to go. I am disappointed we cannot even comply \nwith the intent of the Budget Control Act passed this summer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Chained CPI\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the supercommittee we all talk \nabout--and it meets mostly in secret--is putting out plans and ideas to \ndeal with the deficit--some, I am sure, good; some a little less good. \nI am concerned about one thing the supercommittee has been talking \nabout--the stories that have come out that I know about, and that is \nsomething called the chained Consumer Price Index.\n  I know that many conservative politicians in this body and down the \nhall in the House of Representatives have advocated that we change the \nConsumer Price Index to something called the chained Consumer Price \nIndex.\n  The way the Consumer Price Index is calculated is especially \nimportant for senior citizens because their Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustment--called the COLA--is predicated on how the cost of \nliving is calculated.\n  Right now, the cost-of-living adjustment is based on the Consumer \nPrice Index-W, which means it is determined by wages, the cost of \nliving for people in the workplace. It is not determined by the cost of \nliving for retirees even though it affects what retirees get in their \ncost-of-living adjustment.\n  That sounds like a lot of words, but here is what that means. It \nmeans that when you figure the average increase in the cost of living \nfor the American people--and you are only looking at those who are \nemployed, so they are more likely to be in their twenties, their \nthirties, their forties, their fifties, maybe in their early sixties or \na little older. So if you are only looking at that, the cost of health \ncare is a less significant cost for them in their daily expenses and \ntheir monthly expenses and their annual expenses than for someone who \nis retired.\n  So I am going to introduce legislation soon that will change the \nConsumer Price Index-W--wages--to the Consumer Price Index-E, for \nelderly. The reason is because if you are 70 years old, your cost of \nliving is much more fueled by the cost of health care than if you are \n30 years old.\n  I know Senator Mikulski has been a real leader in this, and she is \none of the immediate prime cosponsors of our legislation. She has had a \nterrific record here in the Senate, the senior Senator from Maryland, \nin fighting for fair play, a fair, strong Social Security and Medicare \nsystem, against these plans from conservatives around here to take \nSocial Security and turn it over to Wall Street, to take Medicare and \nturn it over to the insurance companies.\n  But our legislation would make it fairer so that seniors would \nactually have a cost-of-living adjustment based on their cost of \nliving. What is wrong with that? Instead, conservatives around here \nwant to go the other direction, which would reduce the cost-of-living \nadjustment by this thing called a chained CPI.\n  The way this chained CPI works in a nutshell is this: If your cost of \nliving is $100 a week, and the chained--instead of eating beef, you \ncould save money by changing to chicken. So they are saying, under this \nchained CPI, that you should change to chicken and save X number of \ndollars so your costs would be less.\n  What this would mean--and I want to read you some statistics--if they \nget their way, if anti-Social Security conservatives around here get \ntheir way, it will mean that senior citizens will get significantly \nless than they would under the way it works now, let alone the way that \nwe want to change it to, that Senator Mikulski and I want to change it \nto, this CPI-E. It would mean that seniors, by the age of 85, would be \ngetting about $1,000 less in their Social Security. That is just not \nsomething we can do.\n  Here are the exact numbers. Under the chained CPI, a typical 65-year-\nold would get $136 less today than they would get under the CPI as \ncalculated today. A typical 75-year-old--this is calculated each year, \nso it is a little bit like the reverse of compounding interest--a \ntypical 75-year-old would get $560 less a year. A typical 80-year-old \nwould get $984 less per year. A typical 95-year-old would get $1,392 \nless a year.\n  So what conservative politicians around here want to do--I know you \nhave been on the right side of this, Mr. President, from Minnesota your \nwhole career and before you came to the Senate too--what the \nconservatives want to do is cut the cost-of-living adjustment even \nmore.\n  The last 2 years, there was no COLA, there was no cost-of-living \nadjustment for seniors. What conservative politicians--the ones on the \nsupercommittee who want to do the chained CPI--what they are arguing is \nthat you should have gotten a cut; that instead of no COLA, you should \nhave gotten even less; that this way we do the COLA now is too much \nmoney for seniors.\n  Social Security is not part of the budget deficit. It is not the \nproblem. It does not need fixing. Of course, we always need to make \nsure Social Security is viable, and it will be for decades in the \nfuture. We can make some minor adjustments. But in the name of cutting \nthe budget, cutting Social Security cost-of-living adjustments really \naffects poor seniors and middle-income seniors. We know that in my \nState of Ohio and the Presiding Officer's State of Minnesota, Social \nSecurity--more than half of the people in my State get more than half \nof their income from Social Security. So we have no business cutting \nSocial Security.\n  My legislation would actually be a fairer reflection of the cost of \nliving and is preferable to what some people in this body and some \npeople in the House of Representatives and in the supercommittee want \nto do--the so-called chained CPI. It is a terrible idea, the chained \nCPI. It is not fair to our seniors. It is not fair to our country. It \nis something that should be rejected out of hand.\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\n  Then, as we figure this out and move forward, we should think about, \ndo we want to do the CPI-E based on the elderly cost of living, not the \nCPI-W, based on a 35-year-old's cost of living and how that is \nreflected.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Lloyd G. Jackson\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an honorable, \ndedicated public servant and a good friend from West Virginia whom we \nlost last month on October 29.\n  Lloyd G. Jackson was a true West Virginian, born in our southern \ncoalfields in a small town in Lincoln County on May 30, 1918. \nThroughout his 93 years, Lloyd Jackson always answered the call of \nservice--whether it was for our great Nation or for the beautiful \npeople of West Virginia.\n  Lloyd is the type of person who was well thought of by everyone who \nmet him. From my own personal experience with Lloyd, I can say that I \nhad the utmost respect for his humanitarian approach to every problem, \nmost importantly for his professionalism.\n  Lloyd's love for country and deep commitment to public service \nstarted when he was a young man and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941, \nduring World War II. Before he left the military, Lloyd rose to the \nrank of master sergeant.\n  After returning from war, Lloyd's commitment to his beloved family \nand public service continued. He pursued and expanded his family's oil \nand gas business, and through his business he created good-paying jobs \nand touched the lives of countless West Virginians.\n  In 1946, he was elected to serve in the West Virginia State Senate, \nrepresenting his home region of Bonne, Lincoln, and Logan Counties. \nThat same year a man well known to this body, Senator Robert C. Byrd, \nwas elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates, and joined Lloyd \nJackson in the West Virginia Senate in 1950. The two became lifelong \nfriends. For nearly 25 years, Lloyd Jackson represented the people of \nthe southern part of our State with the utmost distinction. Lloyd was \nknown for his leadership qualities as a State senator, and he took an \nactive role in national legislative organizations, such as the National \nCouncil of State Legislatures and the Council of State Government.\n  His peers recognized his leadership abilities and made him president \nof the West Virginia Senate. As Senate president, Lloyd demonstrated \ntrue characteristics of a dedicated public servant--leadership, \npassion, commitment, and persistence.\n  Lloyd G. Jackson will forever be remembered for his many years of \nunwavering service to the Mountain State and its people. However, Lloyd \nwill also be remembered for his passion and dedication to his community \nand for touching the lives of so many. He was a faithful member of the \nCentral United Methodist Church in Hamlin.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 973 through 976\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about the four amendments I \nfiled on this bill. I will say right upfront, all four are supported by \nmy Missouri colleague, Senator McCaskill, so they are bipartisan \namendments. Two of them would deal with a property ownership issue \ncreated by an infringement by Federal regulators, by FERC. They both \ndeal with a private power generating dam that was built in 1931. It \ncreated a lake called Lake of the Ozarks, and over the years private \nproperty owners have constructed literally thousands of homes that on \nthis map beside me are impacted. The houses are the red dots. The other \nareas in there are thousands of buildings of one kind or another on a \nlake that is one of the most used lakes in the country. Some people go \nto those houses on the weekend and a lot of people live there all the \ntime. This is their home.\n  Since the 1950s, the Lake of the Ozarks has been the most visited \nlake by boaters in the Midwest. It is a lake that is not owned by the \nFederal Government. Tourism at this lake totals about $200 million \nannually. Because of this tourist industry there is lots of private \ninvestment.\n  In 2004, Ameren Electric, the current owner of the lake--it was \nbuilt, again, in the 1930s by Union Electric, which later became Ameren \nElectric--applied to FERC to renew their license to generate power at \nBagnell Dam, which is the dam that was built to impound the water that \ncreated the Lake of the Ozarks. This application also made sure that \nvirtually all of the homes and structures would no longer be subject to \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but FERC rejected this \nrequest. The result has been a back and forth between Ameren and FERC \nand the property owners for the past 7 years.\n  This finger-pointing by everybody involved--except the property \nowners, who simply think they own the property--has been nothing short \nof outrageous and it has left property values, businesses, tourism, tax \nrevenues, and jobs in question. FERC has taken its role too far. FERC \nis acting as though they are the Corps of Engineers and somehow the \ntaxpayers of America own this property instead of the taxpayers who \nactually are the individual taxpayers who own the property.\n  On every acre of land covered by water, taxes have been paid. \nProperty taxes have been paid on that land since the first dream that \nthis lake would be created--so 80 years of taxpayer money. This is not \na Corps of Engineers work where the Corps of Engineers can say we own \nthe lake, we own the shoreland, we are going to decide what you are \ngoing to do. FERC has taken its role too far and it is engaging in a \npattern of enforcing shoreline management rules.\n  My first amendment would simply modify the Federal Power Act by \nchanging the definition of what could be considered a ``project \npurpose.'' Currently, FERC recognizes public recreational use of land \nbut not private ownership. We would not say they could no longer \nrecognize public recreational use of land, but we would say that they \nhave to recognize private ownership. If FERC, at a lake such as this, \ncan decide access to the land, why can't FERC or some other Federal \nagency drive by a farmer's farm and say: That is a nice pond out there. \nI will bet it has some fish in it. Why don't we ensure that everybody \nwho wants to have access to that farmer's pond has access to that \nfarmer's pond?\n  Maybe I should not suggest that. Maybe some Federal agency would hear \nthat and say: It is water, it is pleasant, people ought to be able to \nenjoy it; everybody ought to be able to enjoy it just like the people \nwho own the property and build the property and do their work.\n  My amendment would stop FERC from putting the commission's policy \npreferences above those of ratepayers and private landowners in \nlicensing this dam.\n  My second amendment would simply redraw the boundaries of the Lake of \nthe Ozarks to reflect the 662-foot contour as necessitated by changing \nwater levels over the past 80 years. It would limit FERC's ability to \nissue an order to remove structures in what they now consider a project \nboundary until that boundary has been more finally settled. It would \nlimit FERC's ability to reject applications as long as power generation \nis still preserved.\n  The purpose of FERC is to see that a power generating dam generates \npower. It is not to control everything that is\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nbehind that dam. That is not the job of FERC. In fact, let me leave \nthose two amendments with a few stories of Missouri homeowners who \nshared their stories with me about how FERC and FERC's actions affected \ntheir lives.\n  This is a 30-year-old house that these homeowners have paid property \ntaxes on for 30 years. In fact, you can see this large pine tree in \nfront of this house. It was a seedling when they started paying \nproperty taxes, and that is a big tree. They paid property taxes the \nwhole time. It is their first home. It is their only home. They have \nbeen informed that they are within the Bagnell Dam boundary, meaning \nthey risk losing their house. In fact, it is one of 17 homes in this \nsubdivision facing the same problem.\n  In another home, Fred and Barbara Lowtharp purchased this home 15 \nyears ago. It was built 35 years ago. These are not new homes that \nsomebody has just put on this property in the last couple of years and \nFERC has come in and said you made a mistake. This is a 35-year-old \nhome that the current owners have lived in for 5 years. Barbara shared \nthis with me on Facebook. She said:\n\n       We have been paying taxes and upkeep on our homes and new \n     homes have been built around us within the last 2 years with \n     permits and titles. These homes are not cabins. The majority \n     of us live here year round.\n\n  This is according to the owner:\n\n       We have our money invested in these properties in good \n     faith when we bought them, going through the right procedures \n     and thinking you are a property owner for over 16 years, then \n     being told your deed isn't worth the paper it is written on \n     is something that you cannot understand how this can happen \n     in the U.S.A.\n\n  This is the Facebook note continued: ``Really feel bullied by the \nFERC agency and Ameren.''\n  We owe it to the citizens involved to see that the Federal Government \ndoesn't come in and just simply take their property. It is not fair. \nImagine, you get a new job somewhere, this is your home, you cannot \nsell your home and buy a new home because FERC suddenly decided, after \n16 years of paying taxes, that your land is not owned by you even \nthough the county tax collectors thought it had been owned by you the \nwhole time.\n  Let me discuss quickly the other two amendments that deal with flood \ncontrol. The Missouri and Mississippi Rivers have both been impacted \ndramatically by flooding this year. In Holt County alone, there was an \nastonishing 165,000 acres under water, most of it for 3 and 4 months. \nIn Birds Point in the boot heel of Missouri, another 130,000 additional \nacres of farmland is under water. In total, we had over 400,000 acres, \n600 square miles--something about the size of the entire State of Rhode \nIsland--under water during parts of this year. Vital transportation \ncorridors have been closed, highways washed out, businesses shut down \nand people have been dealing with this now for months.\n  My first amendment, amendment No. 976, cuts the bureaucratic redtape \nif all you are doing is putting back something that was there before \nthe flood. If you are rebuilding a levee, if you are putting back \nthings that were there before the flood, to rebuild levees or locks or \ndams that were damaged by the flood, you should be able to do it. You \nshould not have to go through all kinds of studies to decide if the \nlevee that you are putting back as it was and where it was can be there \nagain. This is the only chance we have to get these structures back in \nplace before the 2012 flooding season starts.\n  Of course, in 2012 it would not have to be a flood of this size to \ncreate great problems if the levee is already gone. That is what that \namendment would do. It gives the Corps the tools they need to restore \nflood protection to the 2011 levels, hopefully before the 2012 runoff \nseason begins.\n  I want to talk about amendment No. 975, which restricts funding of \nthe Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery Program to $22 million. \nThis still leaves a lot of money for that program, but it takes the \nother money that has been available for that program all year and makes \nit available to meet the critical flood control crisis.\n  We have already spent more than $616 million on that program. This is \nessentially a program that is one of the big projects where the \ngovernment buys land from willing sellers who want to let it become \nmore of a wetland or a wildlife reserve, something such as that. I am \nnot saying that willing sellers should not be able to do that, but I am \nsaying for right now $22 million--not something more like $72 million--\nis enough.\n  In fact, we have had citizens in some of these counties call the \nCorps to be told truthfully: No, we don't have sufficient funds to \nrestore the flood protection you are eligible for, but we could buy \nyour farm. Imagine if you are on the other end of that call and you \nhave a family farm and you are calling to find out what you can do \nabout the levee or what you can do to get flood protection back, and \nthey say: We cannot do anything about the levee, but we could buy your \nfarm. If you want to go back to the kitchen table and decide if you \nwant to sell out, the taxpayers of America have plenty of money to buy \nyour farm, but, no, we don't have money to restore the levee that was \nprotecting your farm just a few days ago. That is not acceptable.\n  That is why Senator McCaskill and I are cosponsoring all four of \nthese amendments. We recognize that these issues are critically \nimportant in our State. In fact, the last two amendments are critically \nimportant in the seven States that start in Montana and end in St. \nLouis, MO, that are impacted by flooding in all seven of those States \nthis year.\n  I hope we are able to consider these amendments, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in trying to do what is right for the people we \nwere sent here to work for.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch and Mr. Barrasso pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1880 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment \nNo. 1045 to H.R. 2354, which is the Energy and Water appropriations \nlegislation. This amendment rebalances funding for the fossil energy \nresearch and development account in the U.S. Department of Energy from \nwithin the existing budget. I want to point out that this action \nresults in no additional spending. It is simply an adjustment within \nthe existing budget.\n  You may have heard recently about the tremendous progress we are \nmaking in the State of North Dakota when it comes to oil and gas \ndevelopment. We are also developing many of our other energy resources \nas well. Over the past decade, through a comprehensive energy plan \ncalled Empower North Dakota that we have put together, we have advanced \nall of our energy resources in tandem, and we have done it with good \nenvironmental stewardship. That includes coal, wind, biofuels and, of \ncourse, oil and gas.\n  In a little more than a decade, North Dakota has grown from the ninth \nto the fourth largest oil and gas-producing State in the country, \nhaving surpassed oil-producing States such as Oklahoma and Louisiana. \nIf our current estimates are on target, we will soon pass California \nand become the third largest oil-producing State in the Nation. That \ngrowth is the product of a progrowth legal, tax, and regulatory \nenvironment that we have built with the right kind of pro-business \npolicies. At the same time we have, as I said, developed a \ncomprehensive approach and a comprehensive energy policy called Empower \nNorth Dakota. In addition, we have put in place cutting-edge research, \nwhich has also been a very important part of our energy strategy for \nthe State. It was new technologies and\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nmethods such as directional drilling that brought the innovative \nresearch over the past decade to tap the abundant petroleum reserves of \nthe Bakken formation and other shale formations in North Dakota's oil \npatch. Directional drilling has not only enabled the recovery of oil in \nhard-to-reach vertical layers of shale, but it has also enabled \nmultiple well bores to be drilled from a single pad. The result is more \noil but also a much smaller environmental footprint. That is good for \nthe energy industry, that is good for the environment, and that is good \nfor American workers, with tremendous job creation, and, of course, for \nour consumers.\n  My amendment would redirect research dollars within the budget of the \nfossil energy research and development provision in this appropriations \nbill, and that would include $5 million that would be provided for in \nthe natural gas technologies research and development, and also $10 \nmillion would be provided for unconventional oil or fossil energy \ntechnology development. Both of these research and development areas \nare very critically important, not only for more energy development but \nagain for doing it in an environmentally sound way.\n  Because this $15 million is offset with funds from within the fossil \nenergy research and development budget, it results in no additional \nexpenditure to the account. Obviously with our deficit and our debt, \nthat is very important. What the amendment will do is empower research \ninto the next generation of petroleum and natural gas technologies to \nproduce more energy, again, with better environmental stewardship.\n  This amendment will fund research in a range of important areas, \nincluding using carbon dioxide to enhance oil recovery in mature \noilfields and reducing the environmental impact of natural gas and oil \ndevelopment. Notably, this research will continue to drive and develop \nnew technologies for gas purification to achieve near zero atmospheric \nemissions, an economic as well as an environmental goal.\n  In short, this is the kind of research that will help to increase our \nsupplies of domestic energy, reduce our reliance on foreign energy and \nforeign sources, and hold down the cost of foreign energy for American \nconsumers and American businesses--all with better environmental \nstewardship.\n  This amendment will help us do all of these things and much more, and \nI ask for my colleagues' support.\n  Also, while I have the floor, I wish to express my support for two \nother amendments to H.R. 2354. These include amendment No. 975 and also \namendment No. 976. I am pleased to have cosponsored both of these \namendments with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri.\n  As you are well aware, there has been extensive flooding along the \nMissouri River over the course of this past year, all the way from \nMontana and North Dakota and the upper basin, down through the State of \nMissouri and the other lower basin States. As a result, we have been \nworking hard with our citizens to recover from that flooding.\n  One of the things we have pressed the Corps of Engineers to do as \naggressively as they can is to provide more flood protection so we not \nonly help our citizens recover from the flooding this year, but so we \ncan do all that we can to prevent flooding next year. At the same time \nwe are pressing them to take all of the preventive measures they can to \nreduce lake levels, reduce reservoir levels so we have adequate room \nand protection to prevent flooding next year, we are also working \nwithin their budget to make sure they have the resources to address \nthese needs.\n\n  Amendment No. 975 essentially takes $50 million that is within the \nCorps of Engineers' budget that is now used for the Missouri River \nrecovery program--meaning things such as building sandbars and some of \nthe riparian areas along the river. Currently there is a total of $72 \nmillion in that Corps of Engineers account. What we are doing is saying \nthat $50 million of that should be made available so they can utilize \nit to enhance flood protection. This is a critical need right now. They \nare working diligently to repair dams, dikes, and levees.\n  We are pressing for them to do more in terms of preparing as far as \nwater levels throughout the upper and lower basin, and at the same time \nwe are providing assistance in their budget by giving them the \nflexibility to use dollars where they need them to enhance flood \nprotection. This is $50 million within their budget that can now be \nused to enhance flood protection, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport amendment No. 975 to H.R. 2354, again, giving the Corps of \nEngineers needed flexibility to provide flood protection that is so \nimportant to the people along the Missouri River in the upper basin and \nlower basin.\n  Amendment No. 976 essentially provides that same flexibility and \nassistance. Essentially it eliminates the redtape. It prevents the \nCorps from having to get new permits, new licenses, or new approvals as \nthey work to repair and restore levees, locks, and dams. So as they \nwork along the Missouri River--the entire length of the Missouri \nRiver--to restore those flood protection measures--whether it is a \nlevee, a lock, dike, or dam, whatever it might be--we are waiving those \nrequirements to get new permits and new licenses and new approvals so \nthey can get that work done now, this year, and be prepared for next \nyear.\n  Again, the flooding has been devastating and extensive along the \nMissouri River. In my home State, it is not just the Missouri River but \nalong the Souris River, as well as other areas. The Red River and \nCheyenne had a terrible time with flooding. We need to take the kind of \nsteps that will help our people recover but will also help us prepare \nfor the future so we don't face these types of floods next year or any \nother year in the future.\n  Again, I encourage support from my colleagues on these very important \namendments.\n  I thank the Chair for this time.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Washington's Spending Addiction\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I was just listening to the news in my \noffice, and I heard the report that the United States has gone over $15 \ntrillion in debt. Of course, that is just our short-term debt. It \ndoesn't really include our unfunded liabilities, which some estimate to \nbe $100 trillion. But, nonetheless, $15 trillion is the size of our \ntotal economy--a condition that would mean certain bankruptcy for \nalmost any business.\n  All of us in these Chambers have stood in awe, I guess, looking \nacross the Atlantic at Greece and Italy and some of our European \ntrading partners, and it seems amazing to us that despite their \nterrible fiscal condition, the politicians in Greece cannot even cut \nspending. They talk about cutting it, but the government employees are \nout in the street demonstrating, and one just has to think, can't they \nsee what is happening? Why do they want to keep spending? It is like \nthere is an addiction.\n  But here we are in the land of the free, the city on the hill for the \nworld as far as the country that sets the example for free markets and \nfree enterprise--a country that has fought wars to keep the rest of the \nworld free--and here we are in a situation where we have to borrow well \nover $100 billion every month just to keep the lights on in this place, \njust to keep our country going.\n  All year long, we have been having these public showdowns about how \nwe need to cut spending. We have threatened government shutdowns over \nthe continuing resolutions and over increasing the debt limit. One \nwould think that by this point we would be cutting spending to some \ndegree. We have established this supercommittee, supposedly to deal \nwith our huge deficits. Yet we are passing spending bills this week--\ntoday--that increase spending versus last year. Last year, we spent 5 \npercent more than the year before.\n  In reality, in some ways, our country is worse off than Europe \nbecause we have Federal debt, we have State debt, we have municipal \ndebt, we have counties declaring bankruptcy, we have\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nStates approaching bankruptcy, and yet we continue to spend more now \nthan we did last year. After all of the fuss and fighting and \nbrinkmanship and supercommittees, we can't seem to cut anything here. \nIn fact, we are increasing spending.\n  The goal of the supercommittee is not to cut spending; it is not to \ncut our debt at all. The goal of the supercommittee is to reduce the \namount we are going to borrow over 10 years--maybe reduce it from $10 \ntrillion to $8 trillion or $9 trillion.\n  We are not even on the same page with reality right now. We have \nincreased spending so dramatically over the last few years--we have \nadded $4 trillion to our debt since President Obama came into office, \nwe passed a $1 trillion stimulus, and we passed ObamaCare, adding \ntrillions of dollars in spending.\n  Instead of talking about cutting, the debate now seems to be, how can \nwe take more from the American people in taxes to feed our addiction? \nWe have focused our guns on those very people who create our jobs and \ncreate most of the opportunity in our country, people who are already \npaying the largest portion of national taxes of any country in the \nworld because we have shifted so much of the tax burden onto the top \nincome earners. We are blaming them for the wealth gap when, in fact, \nthe real blame for the wealth gap comes from the government taking so \nmuch out of the private sector, regulating with such a heavy hand, and \nhaving the second highest corporate tax rate in the world.\n  The problem with the middle class is not those who are making too \nmuch money; it is a Federal Government that doesn't understand that the \nmore we spend and borrow, the fewer jobs there are going to be in our \ncountry today. Yet that is the big argument here. Instead of cutting \nspending, we are actually talking about taking more from hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers and bringing it in here and giving it to the people \nwho have created that $15 trillion in debt. How could anyone make sense \nof that?\n  It is really pretty amazing, after all the promises we have made to \nthe American people, that we are watching our debt go up like this--\npassing $15 trillion--and we still can't talk about any substantive \ncuts.\n  Let me give one example of something that makes so much sense. Over \nthe last two decades, we have seen welfare spending increase nearly 300 \npercent. There are 77 means-tested welfare programs, and over the last \ncouple of decades, since welfare reform, the spending has increased \nnearly 300 percent. That is more than the combined increase of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It is more than the increases in education or in \ndefense. Are we helping people? Not at all. We have more people in \npoverty than we ever have had, and we are discouraging self-sufficiency \nwhile encouraging dependency on government.\n\n  In the last 4 years alone, we have nearly doubled what we are paying \nfor food stamps, from $40 billion to $80 billion in this year's budget. \nIf all we did was return welfare spending to 2007 levels, we could save \nalmost $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years. That is twice the goal of \nthe supercommittee in cuts. But are we even thinking about it? Is it \neven on the table? Absolutely not, because the one thing I have seen \nwith this place is we are very good at getting bipartisan agreement on \nincreasing spending in areas of need, but we seldom see bipartisan \nagreement on any cuts. Would we look at responsible caps on welfare \nspending? Not even a chance. It is not even on the table with the \nsupercommittee discussions.\n  With Medicaid alone, if we return spending to 2007 levels, we could \nsave more than the goal of the supercommittee of $1.2 trillion, but we \nare not willing to discuss cuts.\n  I think it is a sad day for America that we are plowing past $15 \ntrillion, pretending to be responsible to the American people, while \nlast week and this week and on into the rest of the year, we are going \nto be passing spending bills that spend more than we spent last year. \nAt the same time, we are supposedly in a recession, Americans are \ntightening their belts, many are out of work, and what we are talking \nabout here is, let's continue to spend and take more from hard-working, \ntax-paying Americans so we can keep our spending addiction going here \nin Washington.\n  It is utterly irresponsible, what we are doing. All the President can \ndo is point at those whom he calls millionaires, who are generally the \npeople who are creating the jobs, running the small businesses, and \nhaving the most to do with creating the investment that makes our \neconomy grow, and try to blame them for the problems we create here in \nWashington.\n  It is time we keep our promises to the American people. I know it is \nhard for some in these Chambers to cut spending because dependency on \ngovernment often means a dependable vote for many politicians. It is \ntime we look at the future and the debt that we are loading onto \nourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. This country will not \nsurvive the types of policies we are producing here in Washington \ntoday.\n  This supercommittee should look at real cuts in spending. If our \nDemocratic colleagues are not willing to go along with responsible \nspending caps on programs such as welfare, then we need to walk away \nfrom the table and take our case to the American people and tell them \nwhat is really the truth, which is that the elections in 2012 may be \nour last chance to turn this around. We cannot keep spending at this \nlevel and keep taking more and more from the private sector, from the \njob producers in our country, bringing it here to Washington, and \nspending it on wasteful programs that are fraught with fraud and \nduplication and not even ever consider cutting any of them.\n  Last week, Dr. Coburn had a couple of amendments to an appropriations \nbill that had some very small cuts to what had been deemed wasteful, \nineffective programs. On one of his amendments, he only got 13 votes. \nSo this is clearly a bipartisan problem.\n  We need to cut spending. Washington has a spending problem, it does \nnot have a low-tax problem. It is time we focus our attention on \nreducing the size and scope of the Federal Government and having it \nlive within constitutional boundaries. We need to eliminate programs \nthat are wasteful, return others to the States, and trim our budget to \nthe point where we can pay for what we are spending so that we will not \nkeep adding trillions and trillions of dollars of debt on to our \ncountry and our citizens and our next generation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we started out this week hoping we could \ncomplete a minibus--that means to do what we did a couple weeks ago and \ncomplete three appropriations bills at the same time. We had three good \nsubjects. We had the underlying bill, Energy and Water. We moved from \nthat and added to that Financial Services and Foreign Operations. We \nwere unable to get a consent agreement that we could treat the package \nof bills the same way we treat other appropriations bills; that is, you \ncannot legislate on an appropriations bill and there have to be germane \namendments offered. I was disappointed that we didn't get that \nagreement. I accept that.\n  The best news out of this is that, with the underlying bill, we have \ntwo of the finest Senators the Senate has ever had, Senators Feinstein \nand Alexander. They are knowledgeable,\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\neasy to work with, and they understand that legislation is the art of \ncompromise. They have done a wonderful job in the last 24 hours, \nworking down the amendments. We have a number of amendments on the \nRepublican side--a finite list--and we should have a Democratic list \nvery quickly. We need to work it down a little more.\n  I appreciate very much the good work of Senator Alexander and Senator \nFeinstein. The normal process would be to pull the bill. We are not \ngoing to do that. We are going to leave the bill on the calendar so we \ncan move to it in a minute's notice, really. We will keep it around, \nand we hope to be able to move to that soon. We are going to have some \ndown time, and anytime we do that, we should be able to finish this \nbill in a day or day and a half once we get the amendments worked out.\n  This will give us the opportunity to move to the Defense \nauthorization bill. I indicated to Senators Levin and McCain well over \na month ago that I would move to this bill. Not everything is worked \nout in it, but that is nothing unusual. It is a huge bill.

Res. 324\n\n       Whereas the United States Government enhanced its \n     relationship with the Governments of Australia and New \n     Zealand with the signing of the Australia-New Zealand-United \n     States (ANZUS) Treaty on September 1, 1951, and subsequently \n     engaged in annual, bilateral Australian-United States \n     Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations between the Australian \n     Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the United \n     States Secretaries of State and Defense, including a meeting \n     in San Francisco in September 2011 that commemorated the 60th \n     anniversary of the United States-Australia alliance;\n       Whereas the alliance remains fundamental to the security of \n     Australia and the United States and to the peace, stability, \n     and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and is one \n     dimension of a broad and deep relationship between the two \n     countries that encompasses robust bilateral strategic, \n     intelligence, trade, and investment relations based on shared \n     interests and values, a common history and cultural \n     traditions, and mutual respect;\n       Whereas numerous visits by Presidents of the United States, \n     including this week by President Barack Obama, and by the \n     Australian Prime Minister to the United States, including in \n     2011 when Prime Minister Julia Gillard addressed a Joint \n     Session of Congress, have underscored the strength and \n     closeness of the relationship;\n       Whereas members of the United States and Australian armed \n     forces have fought side-by-side in every major conflict since \n     the First World War, with the commitment to mutual defense \n     and security between the United States and Australia being \n     longstanding and unshakeable, as was demonstrated by the \n     joint decision to invoke the ANZUS Treaty in the aftermath of \n     the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     continue to share a common approach to the most pressing \n     issues in global defense and security, including in \n     Afghanistan, where about 1,550 Australian Defence Force \n     personnel are deployed, and in response to natural disasters \n     and humanitarian crises, such as in Japan following the \n     earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently stated, \n     ``We are expanding our alliance with Australia from a Pacific \n     partnership to an Indo-Pacific one, and indeed a global \n     partnership. . . . Australia's counsel and commitment have \n     been indispensable.'';\n       Whereas Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently remarked \n     that ``the United States has no closer ally than Australia. . \n     . .

Res. 302\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children in the \n     foster care system in the United States, approximately \n     107,000 of whom are waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 56 percent of the children in foster care are age \n     10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is more than 2 years;\n       Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas in 2010, nearly 28,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster \n     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a \n     permanent home;\n       Whereas everyday, loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that though ``Americans \n     overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in \n     particular foster care adoption . . . foster care adoptions \n     have not increased significantly over the past five years'';\n       Whereas while 4 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, a \n     majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of adopting children from foster care and the children who \n     are eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 71 percent of those who have considered adoption \n     consider adopting children from foster care above other forms \n     of adoption;\n       Whereas 45 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 46 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in the month of November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, more \n     than 35,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas in 2010, adoptions were finalized for nearly 5,000 \n     children through 400 National Adoption Day events in all 50 \n     States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and\n       Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual \n     proclamation to declare the month of November as National \n     Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day is on November 19, \n     2011: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider \n     adoption during the month of November and all throughout the \n     year.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the resolution just approved by \nunanimous consent is a very important resolution that Senator Grassley \nand I are proud to support, along with Senator Inhofe and others. It is \na resolution recognizing that this Saturday is National Adoption Day.\n  I am happy to report that on this Saturday, there will be over 3,500 \nchildren who will be adopted into permanent families.\n  This day was started about 10 years ago by some very enterprising \norganizations, and the Senate and the House of Representatives have \nbeen helping to promote the concept of National Adoption Day for many \nyears now, maybe as many as 10. We sure have been working to help \nhighlight this special day. It was started by nonprofit organizations \nto highlight the fact that we have orphans in the United States.\n  People don't believe this, but there are over 100,000 children in our \nfoster care system between the ages of 0 and 21, who are in our foster \ncare system, whose parents' rights have been terminated for good \nreason--maybe terrible or gross abuse or neglect. Those parents are \nunable or unwilling to raise their biological children. These children \nneed a forever family, a relative to step up, a cousin or an aunt or a \ngrandmother to step up, or they need someone in the community to step \nup and say: You can be a part of our family.\n  People don't stop needing families when they are 21 years old. They \nage out of the foster care system, unfortunately, at 21 despite the \ngood work we have done here to extend that time from 18 to 21. \nUnfortunately, every year 25,000 children age out of our foster care \nsystem, as the Senator from Iowa knows--he has been a phenomenal leader \non foster care reform--without ever having been adopted.\n  When you are 25 or 24 or 23 and you are trying to apply for your \nfirst job, it would be nice to have a mother, father, grandmother, or a \ngrandfather to call and ask: How do I dress? What should I say? Does my \nresume look OK? These children don't have that. When you are engaged, \nit would be nice to be able to call a parent and say: Can you help with \nthe expense of the wedding or can you be there for me? These children \ndon't have that. That is what National Adoption Day is about, \nhighlighting the fact that there are children in our foster care \nsystem--beautiful, strong, intelligent children who need a forever \nfamily. We are doing our best to promote adoption for them.\n  Not only in our system in the United States, but sadly there are \naround 163 million children around the world living outside of family \ncare. We think that number is conservative because we have reason to \nbelieve that even those who do a lot of counting are not really \ncounting all the children in orphanages. The number is probably larger \nthan that.\n  It sounds overwhelming--and it can be at times--to think about our \ngoal to try to find a home for every one of these children. But just to \nput in perspective the U.S. numbers, it is 107,000 children. But the \ngood news is that we have 300,000 churches in America alone--not \ncounting synagogues or mosques. Mr. President, you can easily do that \nmath. If just one family out of every three churches adopted one of \nthese children in foster care, we would not have any more orphans in \nAmerica.\n  That is why we are promoting this today and this week, National \nAdoption Month and National Adoption Day. You don't have to be perfect \nor wealthy; you just have to have a big heart and step up and be \nwilling to add this blessing to your family. So many families have been \nblessed by adoption. As many people know, our family has been blessed \nby adoption.\n  This day is to commemorate National Adoption Day. In fact, I said \n3,500, but it is 4,500 children who will be adopted on this day, and 5 \nwill be\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nadopted in New Orleans, LA. I thank Judge Ernestine Grey and all of the \njudges for their good work to make that possible. We want to finalize \nthese adoptions in all 50 States.\n  Saturday, we will celebrate families who adopt and encourage others \nto adopt children from foster care, build stronger collaborations among \nlocal adoption agencies, and, again, raise awareness about the 107,000 \nchildren who are waiting. Many of these children, despite our laws that \nmandate an 18-month wait period, maximum, sometimes wait more than 3 \nyears.\n  In conclusion, let me just say we need to do more. We can do more. I \nwish to highlight for the record two wonderful organizations that, in \nmy mind, have been going above and beyond the call of duty.\n  One is the Dave Thomas Foundation Wendy's Wonderful Kids Program. \nThey are a great example of just one organization that is doing great \nwork to find homes for children who are considered ``unadoptable'' or \n``hard-to-place'' simply because they are 7 or 8 or 10 or 12 and not 1 \nor 2. They are ``too old'' to be adopted. I never thought I would hear \nthe words ``too old'' when referring to a child who is 7, 8, 10, or 12, \nbut that is what people think. They have worked hard--Wendy's Wonderful \nKids--and have come up with a new approach, a better approach. They \nhave had extraordinary success in piloting a new child focus \nrecruitment plan and finding 2,500 children permanent homes since 2004. \nRita Soronen, executive director of Dave Thomas Foundation, is a \nleader, and Wendy's Wonderful Kids is a great example.\n  Let me just put into the Record another organization that has a \ngallery right here, the National Heart Gallery, which has an exhibit \nhere at the Capitol in the Russell Senate Rotunda. The National Heart \nGallery is another very organic, nonprofit, community-based movement. \nThey took beautiful portraits of these children to show their \npersonalities and life. When people are looking at their portraits, \nthey could be pulled in by the beauty and true reflection of the \nchild's personality. So the National Heart Gallery is another wonderful \norganization, and I want to recognize those two. There are many others.\n  In conclusion, I thank the Senator from Iowa. He and I chair the \nfoster care caucus together. It has been a pleasure working with him. \nWe look forward to another great year ahead. We have had some success--\nactually, a great deal of success--in promoting adoption out of foster \ncare and reforming the foster care system. It is a pleasure to work \nwith Senator Grassley.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the \nSenator from Louisiana. Likewise, it is a pleasure not only to work \nwith her, but the two of us have been able, on most foster care and \nadoption issues, to find a broad coalition of Senators. Many people \ndon't have permanence because of the lack of adoption or because of \nfaults within the foster care system. These Senators are very \ninterested in bringing changes in legislation that makes that \npermanence and stability more a fact and creates a better quality life \nfor these young people. I thank Senator Landrieu for her leadership.\n  I likewise, as she has, rise to honor National Adoption Month. I will \ntake a few minutes to discuss my support for S. Res. 302 and for \npolicies that promote and encourage adoption.\n  For years, I have championed efforts to increase awareness of \nadoption and help streamline the process for families who open their \nhearts and homes to children who have no other family. S. Res. 302 \nhelps promote national awareness of adoption and the children awaiting \nfamilies, celebrates children and families involved in adoption, and, \nlastly, encourages the people of the United States to secure safety, \npermanency, and well-being for all children.\n  As cofounder and cochair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have \ntaken a keen interest in helping children who find themselves in the \nfoster care system. In the United States today, more than 400,000 \nchildren live in the foster care system. Many of these children have \nbeen welcomed into adoptive homes. However, over 105,000 of those in \nfoster care are still waiting to be adopted.\n  According to the Administration of Children and Families in my home \nState of Iowa, more than 4,700 kids entered the foster care system last \nyear, a total of 6,500 kids were in my State's foster care system in \n2010.\n  Foster youth simply desire to have what so many of us were blessed to \nhave; that is, a home with caring, loving parents and siblings. In \nother words, in a short statement, they want permanency. They want \nstability. Too many older children in foster care, especially those \nwith special needs, are often the ones who wait the longest to leave \nfoster care. These kids are less likely than younger children to find \nwhat we refer to as ``forever homes.''\n  While research shows that 40 percent of the Americans have considered \nadopting, many are reluctant because they are unsure of the adoption \nprocess. They have inaccurate perceptions about the children who are \neligible to be adopted. Some believe children in foster care are there \nbecause of delinquency and other behavioral problems. The unfortunate \nfact is most children who are in foster care are there because they are \nabused, neglected or abandoned. These vulnerable children desperately \nneed a family structure. They need parents who serve as positive role \nmodels, helping them become bright and successful members of their \ncommunity.\n  While progress is being made to increase adoption, there is always \nmore work to be done. Helping in this process are numerous agencies and \nnonprofit organizations that work tirelessly to find worthy American \nfamilies who want to be adopting parents. In Iowa, one such agency is \nFour Oaks Family and Children Services of Cedar Rapids, IA. Four Oaks \nhas had a recruiter working with Wendy's Wonderful Kids since 2005.\n  Wendy's Wonderful Kids is an innovative program of the Dave Thomas \nFoundation for Adoption, named after the late American business icon \nwho founded Wendy's Restaurants. The foundation's mission is to promote \nadoption. It recently released a report about the success of the \nWendy's Wonderful Kids Program. Specifically, the program is more \nfocused on hard-to-place children. Recruiters work with children to \nfind them the most appropriate placement. This program is a success \nstory.\n  Congress has also adopted and acted on legislation. In 2008, I was \npart of a bipartisan effort to pass the Fostering Connections to \nSuccess and Increasing Adoption Act of 2008. This new law represented \nthe most significant and most far-reaching improvement in child welfare \nin over a decade. It provided additional Federal incentives for States \nto move children from foster care to adoptive homes. It included \nlegislation that I had introduced to make it easier for foster children \nto be permanently cared for by their own relatives, including \ngrandparents, aunts and uncles, and to stay in their home communities. \nThat, of course, is one way of bringing about greater stability.\n  Provisions in the law also made all children with special needs \neligible for Federal adoption assistance. Previously, that assistance \nhad been limited to children who were removed from very low-income \nfamilies. The law broke new ground by establishing opportunities to \nhelp kids who age out of the foster care system at age 18 by giving \ntheir respective States the option to extend their care and by helping \nthem pursue education or vocational training.\n  In late 2009, Senator Mary Landrieu and I formed the Senate Caucus on \nFoster Youth to give older youth in and out of care and their families \na place where their voices could be heard. We wanted foster youth to be \npart of this legislative process. By hearing from young people and from \ntheir families who have experienced the foster care system firsthand, \ncongressional leaders will become more aware of the issues facing young \npeople and their families.\n  The caucus has and will continue to generate new ideas to prevent \nnegative outcomes and create new opportunities for success. We wanted \nto focus on helping young people when they age out of the foster care \nchildren, typically at age 18. As many as 29,000 children age out every \nyear without ever having found adoptive placement. Without the security \nof a family, they often end up homeless, end up incarcerated or end up \nmaybe addicted to\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\ndrugs. Children who age out of the system enter adulthood without \nknowing what it was like to be raised having their own families because \nthey were under the State's supervision. In a sense, the State was \ntheir family, and that is not much of a family. They missed out on \nhaving a mom and a dad and maybe brothers and sisters to grow up with \nand to learn from and with whom they would have relationships for the \nrest of their life. They missed out on a very important part of \nchildhood that they will never know, one that too many of us take for \ngranted.\n\n  They are thrown into the world and forced to take care of themselves. \nThey struggle to pay bills, to find and hold a job, and to simply make \nends meet.\n  That is why adoption awareness is so very important and hence the \nresolution we are talking about. Since the First National Adoption Day \nin 2000, more than 35,000 children have joined ``forever families'' \nduring National Adoption Day. In 2010 alone, adoptions for almost 5,000 \nchildren were finalized through 400 National Adoption Day events in all \n50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n  These are impressive numbers--numbers that make us proud of the work \nbeing done to help foster children get the proper care. But there is \nalways more work to be done. I have said that twice but can't say it \ntoo many times. It is through awareness such as this that we can help \nthe work to continue.\n  In passing S. Res. 302, this body will make an important statement \nabout our collective support for the needs of foster children. It \nrecognizes the families who took the giant leap to open their homes to \nother children. National Adoption Month is about kids who need a home, \nit is about kids who just want a mom and a dad, it is about helping \nchildren who are victims of neglect and abuse, and it is about giving \nchildren living in foster care the ability to live their dreams.\n  We need to keep working together to break down the barriers to \nadoption so every child feels the relief of a solid family. I am proud \nto support the many kids who wait for permanency and stability but, \nmore importantly, I want to salute the many organizations that are \nhelping to make their dreams come true.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     National Debate on Gun Control\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, because of the attack against \nCongresswoman Giffords, there has been some legislation introduced for \nmore gun control. We are going to have to take a good look at that \npiece of legislation, as we have unanimously passed legislation after \nthe tragic shooting in Virginia Tech in April of 2007. I am not going \nto deal directly with that specific piece of legislation, but I wish \ntalk about some of the general approaches to gun control that are being \ndiscussed.\n  Getting back to Virginia Tech, the national debate surrounding \nupdating Federal gun laws gained national attention following the \ntragic shooting at Virginia Tech and now, of course, has come up again \nbecause of the attack against Congresswoman Giffords.\n  Following the terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech, Congress passed the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System. That goes by the \nacronym of NICS, N-I-C-S, so I will be referring to the national \ninstant criminal background check by that acronym.\n  This bill, as I said, passed the House and the Senate by unanimous \nconsent and was signed into law by President Bush. Despite the strong \nbipartisan support the NICS Improvement Act had, the improvement act \nwas not a perfect piece of legislation and is a good example of why we \nneed to be very careful when we legislate to avoid unintended \nconsequences. So I am raising some of these issues in regard to the \npossible consideration of legislation that has been introduced because \nof the terrible attack on Congresswoman Giffords.\n  For example, in the next bill it actually--with unintended \nconsequences but still doing it--stripped thousands of veterans and \ntheir beneficiaries of their second amendment rights simply because \nthey had a fiduciary appointed on their behalf. Oftentimes, a fiduciary \nis appointed simply for managing disability compensation pensions or \nsurvivor benefits.\n  Under an interpretation by the Department of Veterans' \nAdministration, veterans who have a fiduciary appointed are often \ndeemed ``mentally defective,'' and are then consequently reported to \nthe FBI's NIC system and consequently prohibited from purchasing a \nfirearm.\n  Under the NICS Improvement Act--and that was a bipartisan bill--with \nunintended consequences, this happened: Around 114,000 veterans and \ntheir beneficiaries have been automatically denied their second \namendment rights.\n  It is a terrible irony that veterans, who have served their country \non the battlefield, who have been entrusted with our national security \nand have been provided firearms by their very government, are the same \npeople the NICS Improvement Act harmed by taking away their second \namendment rights, all without a hearing or formal adjudication.\n  We honored and celebrated Veterans Day last Friday. Yet, we are \npossibly going to be debating new legislation to restrict the second \namendment rights of citizens without fixing the unintended consequences \nof our last major gun law, the NICS Improvement Act.\n  While the horrific events in Tucson are still fresh in our memories, \nas we discuss new gun control laws we also need to move forward on \nbipartisan legislation, such as the Veterans Second Amendment \nProtection Act, introduced by a bipartisan couple, Senator Burr and \nSenator Webb. This bill would fix the unintended consequences to \nthousands of veterans caused by the NICS Improvement Act.\n  A hearing we had this week offered me an opportunity to discuss \nillegal firearms tracking and the government's efforts to stop it. At \nthe forefront of this is the Department of Justice's failed operation \ncalled Fast and Furious, where the ATF knowingly allowed illegal \npurchasers to buy guns. The more we learned about Fast and Furious, the \nmore we have discovered that senior Justice Department officials knew \nor should have known about these nearly 2,000 guns ending up in the \nhands of criminals, including the drug cartels in Mexico.\n  At the first House oversight hearing on Operation Fast and Furious, \nmultiple ATF agents testified that fear spread through the Phoenix \nfield division every time there was news of a major shooting event. So \nthat brings us back to the tragedy for Congresswoman Giffords.\n  Specifically with regard to the Congresswoman's shooting one agent \nsaid:\n\n       There was a state of panic, like, . . . let's hope this is \n     not a weapon from that case.\n\n  And ``that case'' was the Fast and Furious case, where our government \ndecided to encourage licensed gun dealers to illegally sell guns to \nstraw purchasers with the idea that we would follow them across the \nborder. But there wasn't any following. So it was an effort doomed to \nfailure in the first place. The Fast and Furious operation was failed \nin concept, in design, and in execution.\n  As the Attorney General said last week, before our Judiciary \nCommittee: It should never have happened. And the Justice Department \nofficials who knew about this program, including those who allowed \nfalse statements to Congress, need to be held accountable.\n  I thought it was fitting that late last week, Attorney General Holder \nfinally wrote to the family of Agent Terry, the person who was murdered \nwith two of these Fast and Furious guns found at the murder scene. This \nis the very same Attorney General who had an opportunity to apologize \nto the Terry family when he was asked by Senator Cornyn, Have you \napologized to the Terry family? The Attorney General said, No. He said, \nWould you like to apologize now? That is what Senator Cornyn asked him. \nHe gave an answer, but it wasn't an apology. So we have a letter late \nlast week going to the Terry family. In his letter, he stated he was \nsorry for their loss, although he refused to take responsibility for \nthe Department's role in Agent Terry's death.\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\n  At the root, then, of Fast and Furious--and a lot of rhetoric \nsurrounding gun control legislation--have been the gun trafficking \nstatistics provided by ATF. These unclear statistics have fueled the \ndebate and contributed to undertaking such a reckless operation as Fast \nand Furious.\n  For example, in 2009, both President Obama and Secretary of State \nClinton stated that 90 percent of the guns in Mexico were from the \nUnited States. But that statistic later changed to 90 percent of the \nguns that Mexico submitted for tracing to the ATF were from this \ncountry. This year, that number has become 70 percent of the guns \nsubmitted by the Mexican Government for tracing were from the United \nStates. All the different percentages beg the question, what are the \nreal numbers?\n  Articles discussing the 70-percent number misrepresent the facts, as \nI pointed out in a letter to then-ATF Acting Director Melson in June of \nthis year.\n  First, there are tens of thousands of guns confiscated at crime \nscenes annually in Mexico. The Associated Press stated that in 2009, \nover 305,424 confiscated weapons were locked in vaults in Mexico. \nHowever, the ATF has acknowledged to my staff, in a briefing on July \n29, 2011, that ATF does not have access to the vault in Mexico \ndescribed in that story.\n  ATF also acknowledges that only a portion of the guns recovered in \nMexico are actually submitted to the United States for tracing. In a \nNovember 8, 2011 court filing, the chief of ATF's firearms operation \ndivision made a declaration saying--now, remember, this is in a court \nfiling:\n\n       It is important to note, however, that ATF's eTrace data is \n     based only on gun trace requests actually submitted to the \n     ATF by law enforcement officials in Mexico, and not on all of \n     the guns seized in Mexico.\n\n  That court filing further states that:\n\n       In 2008, of the approximately 30,000 firearms that the \n     Mexican Attorney General's Office informed ATF that it had \n     seized, only 7,200, or one quarter, of those firearms were \n     submitted to ATF for tracing.\n\n  So if Mexico submits only 25 percent of the guns for tracing, then \nthe statistics could be grossly inaccurate one way or the other.\n  The discrepancies in the numbers do not stop there. ATF also informed \nmy staff that the eTrace-based statistics could vary drastically by a \nsingle word's definition.\n  We have an example of different definitions. The 70-percent number \nwas generated using a definition of U.S.-sourced firearms. That happens \nto include guns manufactured in the United States or imported through \nthe United States. Thus, the 70-percent number does not mean that all \nguns were purchased at a U.S. gun dealer and then smuggled across the \nborder; it could simply mean that the firearm was manufactured in the \nUnited States.\n  So when my staff asked ATF, how many guns traced in 2009 and 2010 \nwere traced to U.S. gun dealers, the numbers were quite shocking in \ncomparison to the statistics we previously heard. For 2009, of the \n21,313 guns recovered in Mexico and submitted to tracing, only 5,444 \nwere sourced to a U.S. gun dealer. That is around 25 percent.\n  For 2010, of the 7,971 guns recovered in Mexico submitted for \ntracing, only 2,945 were sourced to a U.S. gun dealer. That is only 37 \npercent, a far cry from 70 percent or 90 percent that we have been \nhearing over a long period of time, not to mention that the guns in \n2009 and 2010 from gun dealers could include some of the nearly 2,000 \nfirearms that were walked as part of our own Justice Department's \nOperation Fast and Furious.\n  We need clearer data from ATF and from Mexico. Mexico needs to open \nthe gun vaults and allow more guns to be traced, not just the ones the \nMexican Government selects. We need to know if military arsenals are \nbeing pilfered as a source--as media articles have claimed the State \nDepartment points to in diplomatic cables.\n  When it comes to the diplomatic cables, I sent a letter to--actually \nit was yesterday--Secretary of State Clinton seeking all diplomatic \ncables discussing the source of arms from Mexico, Central America, and \nSouth America. I believe this information is relevant to Congress, \ngiven that I discovered in a July 2010 cable, as part of my Fast and \nFurious investigation, that cable titled, ``Mexico Weapons \nTrafficking--The Blame Game,'' seeks to dispel myths about weapons \ntrafficking. Among other things, the State Department authors discussed \nwhat they perceived as ``Myth: An Iron Highway of Weapons Flows from \nthe U.S.''\n  These cables are vitally important to Congress's understanding of the \nproblem. Further, given that they appear in documents that ATF \nsubmitted to Congress as part of Fast and Furious, there should be no \nreason for the State Department to withhold them as part of our \nlegitimate oversight, even if they are classified.\n  There is a lot more to be said about the specific problems with the \nlegislation that might be coming before the Judiciary Committee as a \nresult of Congresswoman Giffords' tragedy. We have to ask a lot of \nquestions to flush out some of these serious problems. We don't want to \nhappen in this legislation what happened in the NICS Improvement Act \nwhen 114,000 veterans were denied their second-amendment rights and, \nconsequently, avoid these unintended consequences. We should not be \nlegislating away any constitutional rights people have under the second \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7608-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7608-S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am not going to speak very long \ntonight, and I am not going to speak very formally either. But I did \nwant to come back to the Senate floor and make a point again that I \nhave made repeatedly here on the Senate floor before; that is, there is \na path to reform of our health care system that will improve the \nquality of care for patients, will improve the experience of care for \npatients, will improve the outcomes of care for patients and for our \nNation, and will lower costs for our country.\n  The reason I come to raise that point again is that the Senate is now \nawash with rumors that the 12 Members of Congress--Senators and \nCongressmen--who have been tasked with trying to create a solution to \nour deficit problem are going to cut Medicare benefits by hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. That is, as best I can tell, only a rumor. I \ncertainly cannot vouch for it being true. Indeed, I hope it is not \ntrue.\n  The time I wish to spend this evening is to remind my colleagues it \nis a very unfortunate and mistaken path to take to follow the road of \nbenefit cuts at a time when the road to reform is so promising in terms \nof the win-win of better care at lower cost.\n  It is not just me saying this. The President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers has said the annual savings that could be accomplished with \nhealth care delivery system reform, without reducing anybody's quality \nof care or access to care--indeed, I would hypothesize actually \nimproving quality of care--is $700 billion a year in the American \nhealth care system.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers is not alone in that \nopinion. The Institute of Medicine has just said it is around $770 \nbillion a year. A few years back, the New England Healthcare Institute \nsaid it was $850 billion a year. And the Lewin Group, which is a fairly \nwell respected health care consultancy here in Washington, as well as \nGeorge Bush's Treasury Secretary, Secretary O'Neill, have both agreed \nannual savings could be $1 trillion a year--all by improving the \nquality of care and the coordination of care.\n  I do not know if it is exactly going to be $700 billion or $1 \ntrillion, but my point is, there is a big savings target out there that \neveryone from President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to George \nBush's Treasury Secretary, to a lot of very well thought of groups in \nbetween, including our National Institute of Medicine, all agree on. So \nI think that makes it a very important target to pursue in this \ndiscussion.\n  It is not just me in believing, at this potential split in the road, \nwe should work and fight very hard to make sure we are taking the right \npath and we do\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\nnot go down the easy-to-score but unnecessary and unhelpful path of \nbenefit cuts, which singles out seniors in Medicare and does nothing \nabout the underlying costs of the system and makes it the wrong road to \nfollow when we have a well illuminated path that can move us toward a \nbetter, more efficient delivery system that provides better quality \nhealth care, better outcomes, fewer hospital-acquired infections, \nbetter coordinated care, stronger electronic health records--all of the \nthings that will support a truly modern health care system that can be \nthe envy of the world.\n  That is the choice we have. I think it would be a terrible mistake to \ngo the benefit cuts route instead of the reform route, and it is not \njust me who says that. George Halvorson is the chief executive officer, \nthe CEO, of Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser Permanente is one of the biggest \nhealth care systems in the country. It provides health care in many \nStates, and George Halvorson is a very serious individual who knows his \nstuff in health care. He would not be the CEO of that big company if he \ndid not.\n  Here is what he said the other day:\n\n       There are people right now who want to cut benefits and \n     ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in \n     this country. And that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost \n     criminal. It's an inept way of thinking about health care.\n\n  That is not me. That is the CEO of Kaiser Permanente.\n\n       There are people right now who want to cut benefits and \n     ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in \n     this country and that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost \n     criminal. It's an inept way of thinking about health care.\n\n  Yet that is the direction that it looks like we may be taking, the \ninept direction. I had a hearing in the HELP Committee--the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Bennet of Colorado, is a member of that HELP \nCommittee--and we had some very interesting witnesses. Because the path \ntoward savings through reform is not just a HELP Committee path, this \nis not something that some academic has constructed and maybe if you \ntake that path things will work, this is a path that major \ncorporations, major health systems, major hospitals in this country are \nalready walking. They are already walking down that path.\n  Kaiser is one of them. Blue Shield of California is another. \nIntermountain out in the West is a third. Mayo, Geisinger, Gundersen \nLutheran--there are a number along the East Coast. These are companies \nthat have determined this is the right path, and they are walking that \npath.\n  Two folks were there from such companies. One was Dr. Gary Kaplan, \nwho is at the Virginia Mason health system in Seattle, WA. Despite its \nname, Virginia Mason, it is actually in Seattle, WA, on the other \ncoast. He pointed out that they went through a quality management \ntransformation in their hospital with a cultural transformation, with a \nprocess transformation.\n  As a result, they have made significant improvements. Just in one \nback pain reform process they did with 2,000 patients, they calculated \nthey have already saved $1.7 million on 2,000 back pain patients, and \nthose patients are happier with the new regime, the less-expensive \nregime, than before because they are getting better quality care.\n  He testified they saved $11 million in planned capital investment, \nreduced inventory costs by $2 million through supply chain expense \nreductions, reduced staff walking distance by 60 miles per day, reduced \nlabor expenses and overtime and temporary labor by half a million \ndollars in just 1 year, reduced professional liability insurance \npremiums by 56 percent, reduced their self-insured retention fund by 70 \npercent, reduced the time it takes to report lab tests by more than 85 \npercent, and improved their medication distribution, reducing errors, \nreducing the time when a patient first calls Virginia Mason's breast \nclinic with a concern to the time they receive a diagnosis from 21 days \nto 3 days, and many patients receive their results on the same day.\n  These are the kind of improvements that have put Virginia Mason at \nthe front end and make them, according to the Leapfrog Group, one of \nthe top hospitals in the country. They are walking the walk of \nimproving the quality of their operations, improving the quality of \ncare and saving money by doing so.\n  The other witness was Greg Poulsen from Intermountain. He described \ntwo examples. One was a sepsis program for people who are admitted to \nthe hospital suffering from sepsis throughout their system. Sepsis is a \ndangerous condition. Sepsis, on average, has a 40-percent mortality \nrate. So 4 out of 10 people with sepsis die of it. They have reduced \nthe 40-percent mortality rate from sepsis to 5 percent--from 4 in 10 \ndying to 1 in 20 dying. Did it cost a lot of money to do that? Was that \na big investment they had to make? Did it cost the taxpayers a lot to \nsave those lives? No. What they found is they saved $10 million with \nthat improvement.\n  Similarly, they have a diabetes program that has been described by \nthe former CEO of the Mayo Clinic as the diabetes program he would go \nto if he were sick with diabetes that has ``the best outcomes and \nlowest costs in the country.''\n  They saved $5 million a year on diabetes treatment by going to better \nhealth care providing. There is a problem, as he pointed out. That $10 \nmillion they saved is actually a revenue loss. Because when they saved \nmoney by not having unnecessary care, by not having complications, by \nhaving things be more efficient and streamlined, what they did was they \nreduced their billing to the insurance companies, and it is actually \nthe insurance companies, it is the payers who saved the $10 million.\n  What the providers spend is a revenue loss. So we have our system \nupside down in that respect, and that is one of the ways we need to \nreform our system. A third witness who was there was a Rhode Islander. \nHis name is Chris Koller. We have a unique office in Rhode Island, an \noffice of health insurance commissioner. He is the only health \ncommissioner in the country. Also, I tease him that he is the tallest \ninsurance commissioner because he is unusually tall, but that is easy \nbecause he is the only one.\n\n  But he has done a very good job of bringing our hospitals and \ninsurance companies together to try to focus on the ways we can deliver \ncare better. One way is through prevention and primary care. It turned \nout that in Rhode Island, the amount of every health care dollar that \nwas spent on primary care was 5.9 percent. So every $1 spent on health \ncare in Rhode Island, less than 6 cents, went to primary care, went to \nyour regular family doctor and the basic health care providers. Less \nthan 6 cents out of every $1.\n  The insurance companies have more overhead than that, administering \nthe system. The costs of administration of the health care system is \nmore than the primary care providers get out of the system. That is \nanother sign that the system is upside down. He is encouraging them, \nand they have agreed, to step up the spending on primary care by 1 \npercent a year for 5 years. We believe that is going to make a very \nsubstantial cost savings because there is so much that a primary care \nprovider can handle without having to go to a specialist, without \nhaving to go to the emergency room, without the condition getting worse \nbecause they could not find you, by simply making primary care more \naccessible and more available.\n  So the additional expense for primary care should bring down system \ncosts overall and having it designed more intelligently.\n  I will close with a few words from the witness, Dr. Kaplan, who said \nthat through the work they have been doing on reform and efficiency, he \nsaid: ``We have demonstrated that the path to higher quality, safer \ncare is the same path to lower costs.''\n  He actually said that if we could get more transparency to the system \nabout who is doing a better job and who is not, what the outcomes are \nfor different hospitals, that basically where we are right now in the \ndelivery system reform provisions that were in the Accountable Care \nAct, he described them as one of the last chances of a market-based \nsystem.\n  This is somebody who is in this business all the time and is actually \nrunning a hospital that is actually producing results. This is a person \nwho is steeped in the reality of health care, and contrary to what we \nhear in the cartoon version that infects Washington, where ObamaCare is \nsocialized medicine and is a step away from market-based care, this \npractitioner says the potential of the Accountable Care\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\nAct, as I see it, is one of the last chances of a market-based system.\n  It could actually lead to a market, whether it was Medicare and \nMedicare Advantage as parts of Medicare or the commercial sector, that \nwe would actually be able to understand what we are buying and what we \nare paying for.\n  That is the kind of commonsense transformation we need. You remember, \nDr. Kaplan said: We have demonstrated the path to higher quality, safer \ncare is the same path to lower costs.\n  Gary Paulsen, Intermountain, and other organizations have shown that \nimproving quality is compatible with lowering costs. Indeed, high-\nquality care is generally less expensive than substandard care, and the \nprimary challenge for us and the main reason more organizations do not \nadopt the high-value model discussed in the hearing that we held is the \nunderlying fee-for-service payment system which predominates, of \ncourse, in the United States. We pay doctors for doing more, not for \ndoing better. We pay doctors for doing more things to you rather than \ngetting you well.\n  Because we do that, we have the results we have. When you look at \nthat mess, you can say, OK, we are going to leave all that alone. We \nare not going to follow the path that Intermountain, that Gundersen, \nLutheran, that Virginia Mason has proven, that Kaiser has argued for \nand proven, that so many systems around the country are doing, you can \nsay, we are going to forget all that. We are going to leave it in \nplace. We are going to leave it a mess, and we are just going to cut \nbenefits away from seniors, from our elderly, from the people who need \ncare the most, from the people who paid into the system, from the \npeople who do not have a chance to recover, very often from people who \nare not in a position to direct their own care and make effective \nchoices if they are the very elderly on Medicare or worse, the \nMedicare-Medicaid dual eligibles.\n  We are going to go after those people. We are going to cut their \nbenefits, and we are not going to take the trouble to follow the path \nthe professionals who are doing this are already showing is a path that \nleads to saving, is a path that leads to a better health care system, \nis a path that leads us out of the difficult position of being the only \ncountry in the world that spends 18 percent of our GDP on health care, \nof being the most inefficient country in the world in health care by a \n50-percent margin. The next closest country in terms of inefficiency in \nhealth care is about 12 percent of GDP. We are at 18. Why is it \nnecessary that America has to be the most inefficient health care \nprovider in the world of all the countries we compete with by a factor \nof nearly 50 percent? That is half again worse than the most \ninefficient competitor we face. It makes no sense to be in that \nposition.\n  There is enormous room for improvement. The path to that improvement \nis clear. It is already being walked by serious and responsible \ninstitutions that have set this as their corporate goal. That is where \nwe should go. I will close again by repeating George Halvorson's \nexhortation. He is one of the great health care leaders in this \ncountry. He is a savvy corporate manager. He runs an enormous health \ncare corporation. This is not an idle opinion of his.\n  There are people right now who want to cut benefits and ration care \nand have that be the avenue to cost reduction in this country and \nthat's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost criminal. It's an inept way of \nthinking about health care.\n  Those are CEO George Halvorson's words, not mine.\n  I hope that they ring through this body and we don't make the \nmistaken decision to go after Medicare benefits and instead take the \npositive path of reform and improvement.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, November marks National Family Caregiver \nMonth, a chance to thank those who provide care for our loved ones in \ntheir time of need. According to the most recent census data, my home \nState of Maine has the oldest population in the United States, and \ntherefore I am acutely aware of the tremendous role wonderful, \ncompassionate individuals play as caregivers. Today I rise to commend \nand recognize Care & Comfort, a small business that successfully helps \nto fill the need for high-quality health care professionals in Maine.\n  Care & Comfort, headquartered in the central Maine city of \nWaterville, specializes in care for elderly and special needs \nindividuals. Within their home health division, Care & Comfort provides \nnursing services, caring companions, in-home care, and long-term care. \nThroughout various other divisions, the company offers outpatient \ntherapy, behavioral health and community support services, children's \ncase management service, home and community support services for \nchildren, adult community support, and home modifications. As a company \nwhich strives ``to provide the best possible care to clients and \nfamilies across Maine,'' Care & Comfort not only helps its clients \nthrough its high quality customer service, it also serves as a \ncommunity resource on health care for the entire Maine community.\n  In 1991, Susan Giguere started Care & Comfort with just two employees \nafter realizing the lack of home health solutions in Maine following \nher mother's illness. In order to expand her business, Susan applied \nfor and received guaranteed loans from the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA. The first loan Susan obtained was for $100,000 in \n1996, and the second for just over $330,000 in 2000. These loans \nallowed her company to grow from two employees to 475 staff members. As \na result, this August Care & Comfort was named to the SBA 100 list, \nwhich features 100 small businesses that have created at least 100 jobs \nsince receiving SBA assistance. This honor is richly deserved, as the \ncompany has vividly demonstrated the tenacity and strength found in so \nmany of our Nation's small businesses in these challenging economic \ntimes.\n  Care & Comfort now helps 890 home health and 748 mental health \nclients out of five regional offices located across the State. \nFurthermore, this small business goes above and beyond the call of duty \nto routinely give back to the community through volunteer efforts and \ncharitable donations. Their hard work, along with exceptional staff, \nhas led to several accolades for the company including awards from the \nSBA, two Fleet Bank Awards for Community Service, and an award from \nKennebec Valley Community College.\n  Care & Comfort has assisted many families through difficult times. \nTherefore, it is only fitting that we celebrate this firm's successes, \nas they have simultaneously helped support our loved ones and created \nnumerous jobs throughout Maine. I am proud to extend my congratulations \nto Susan Giguere and everyone at Care & Comfort for their tremendous \nefforts and offer my best wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7610-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7610-S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING EMORY FOLMAR\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Emory \nMcCord Folmar, who passed away on Friday, November 11, 2011. Emory \nlived a life dedicated to service to his country, holding many military \nand civic leadership roles, and was a true inspiration to many. I am \nglad to have known such a remarkable individual and fellow public \nservant.\n  Emory Folmar was born on June 3, 1930, in Troy, AL. He graduated from \nthe University of Alabama with his B.S. in business and was a member of \nSigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Emory's career in the military began at \nthe University of Alabama as well. During his college years he served \nas a cadet colonel of the Army ROTC. Upon graduating, Emory attended \nparachute training and instructors' schools and was assigned to the \n11th Airborne Division of the 2nd Infantry Division of the Army. During \nhis years of service in the military, Emory received the Silver Star, \nthe Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart during his service in the Koren \nwar. He was a brave defender of\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nthe United States of America and continued his dedication to the \nmilitary throughout his career as a public servant.\n  In 1954, Emory moved to Montgomery, AL, where he began a successful \nconstruction business with his brother, James Folmar and Henry Flynn. \nHis political career began in 1975 as president of the City Council \nDistrict 8, and then he served as mayor of Montgomery from 1977 to \n1999. As mayor, Emory made great strides in developing the downtown \narea and improving Montomgery's infrastructure. Staying true to his \nmilitary roots, Emory worked hard for the wellbeing of Maxwell and \nGunter Air Force Bases, which are vital to our national security and to \nAlabama's economy.\n  Additionally, Emory worked on the Presidential campaigns of Ronald \nReagan and George H.W. Bush and ran for Governor of the State of \nAlabama in 1982. He has earned the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues, who have referred to him as the ``grandfather of the \nState's modern Republican Party.''\n  Emory is loved and will be missed by his wife, Anita Pierce Folmar, \ntwo children, Wilson Bibb Folmar III and Margaret Folmar Dauber, and \nmany more family members and friends. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthem as they mourn the death of a wonderful husband, father, friend, \ncommunity leader. He was a role model to many, and the citizens of \nAlabama and of Montgomery are very fortunate to have benefited from his \ncommitment to public service as mayor for 22 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7611-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE ALLOCATION PROVIDED FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012 TO \nTHE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AND THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES FOR FISCAL \n                               YEAR 2012\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. Today, I am further adjusting some of those levels, \nspecifically the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for \nfiscal year 2012 and the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2012.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Senate will be considering the conference report to H.R. 2112, the \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012. That \nconference report includes funding designated for disaster relief. In \ntotal, the amount of such designations is lower than amounts passed by \nthe Senate earlier this month. Consequently, I am lowering adjustments \nmade previously to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations \nand to the aggregates by a total of $847 million in budget authority \nand $79 million in outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n [Pursuant to section 106(b)(1)(C) of the Budget

A bill repeal the health care law's job-killing health \ninsurance tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend from \nWyoming, Senator Barrasso, for his work on this and other issues \nrelated to the President's health law. He is a leading orthopedist, and \nI have nothing but respect for him. As a former medical liability \ndefense lawyer defending doctors, nurses, hospitals, and other health \ncare providers, I appreciate good doctors, and this is one good doctor. \nHe and Dr. Coburn are two of the best people I have known and are a \ncredit to their profession.\n  I thank him for his work on this and other issues related to the \nPresident's health care law. He has been tireless in his careful \nanalysis and fair criticism of the health spending law, and I believe \nwe are in agreement on that bill's fundamental flaw.\n  The President and his allies repeatedly promised that the health law \nwould decrease costs. That is not going to happen. The so-called \nAffordable Care Act is going to, in fact, drive up the cost of \ncoverage.\n  Among the biggest reasons for this inflationary impact are the taxes \nthat will be imposed on the American people to pay for the lost $2.6 \ntrillion in new spending. At the top of the list of senseless cost-\nincreasing taxes is the law's tax on health insurance. It is not clear \nto me how the cost of health insurance will decrease by taxing it.\n  Many people probably don't even know this tax exists. Like most of \nthe taxes in ObamaCare, its implementation was conveniently delayed \nuntil after the 2012 Presidential election. But this tax is coming. It \nis going to hurt employers and employees. It is going to be a drag on \nour economy, and it is going to depress wages.\n  I am glad to be standing here with Senator Barrasso as we introduce \nthe Jobs and Premium Protection Act, a bill that repeals this onerous \nand counterproductive tax on American workers and job creators. The \nPresident speaks about the need for Congress to do something about \njobs. Well, we would go a long way toward creating the conditions for \njob growth by passing this legislation.\n  Unemployment in this country remains a full-blown crisis. Millions \nare out of work, and the 9-percent unemployment rate doesn't begin to \ncapture the full extent of our jobs deficit. We need policies that will \nencourage businesses to invest and expand. Yet the health law's \ninsurance tax does just the opposite. According to a recent analysis, \nin just the first 10 years, the insurance tax would impose $87 billion \nin costs on businesses and their employees. Revenue that could be spent \non higher wages, new hires, and capital investment--increasing jobs and \ngrowing the economy--will instead go to pay this tax. And that is just \nthe start. In the second decade, this tax will cost businesses and \ntheir employees $208 billion.\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\n  It is important to understand how this insurance tax will work. \nStarting in 2014, the health insurance companies will have to pay a tax \nbased on their net premiums written in the fully insured market. This \nis the market where 87 percent of small businesses purchase their \nhealth insurance. It is the market where the self-employed and \nuninsured go to purchase insurance.\n\n  So who will pay this tax? Someone has to pay it. Contrary to the \ntalking points that all too often come out of this administration, all \nof these new mandates and regulations are not free. Someone has to foot \nthe bill. Ultimately, it will be those least able to afford it who are \npaying it. Primarily small businesses--and their employees--will be \nresponsible for paying this tax. When the cost of coverage goes up due \nto this tax, employees will pay for it in lower wages or higher health \ncare costs.\n  According to a recent study, the average employee with a family plan \nwill see his or her take-home pay reduced by $5,000 over the next \ndecade because of this tax. The American people should remember that \nstatistic the next time they hear their liberal supporters of the \nhealth care law talk about wage stagnation or income inequality.\n  The costs of this tax will be felt by citizens even beyond those \nsmall businesses. The factories that lose orders because their \ncustomers' health care costs are going up will pay for this tax. Those \nsearching for work will feel it too, because money that could go to new \nwages for new employees will instead go to pay for this tax and \nincreased health care costs for existing employees.\n  This tax will hit wide swaths of the American economy, with millions \nof businesses and individuals impacted. A study by the National \nFederation of Independent Business shows this tax alone will lead to a \nloss of 125,000 to 249,000 jobs between now and 2021.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help to reverse this \ntrend. Ultimately, all of Obamacare must be repealed. I am fully \ncommitted to uprooting it in its entirety. It undermines our \nConstitution and it undermines personal liberty. It exacerbates the \nNation's debt crisis by creating and expanding entitlement spending, \nand it also undermines our economy, destroying existing jobs and \npreventing the creation of new ones.\n  The people of Utah and people all over the United States need a jobs \nagenda. Repeal of the health insurance tax through the Jobs and Premium \nProtection Act we are introducing today would do much to address the \nscourge of unemployment and get our economy moving again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, I wish to congratulate and thank \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, for his \ncontinued leadership on the issue of health care. As the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, he has been a stalwart and strong supporter \nin efforts to get for the American people the health care they need, \nfrom the doctor they want, at a price they can afford, and amazing in \nhis fight against what this body, what the House of Representatives, \nand what the President have forced onto people all across this country, \nwhich, to me, has been bad for patients, bad for the providers of those \npatients--the nurses and doctors who take care of them--and terrible \nfor taxpayers.\n  That is why week after week I come to the floor to give a doctor's \nsecond opinion about the health care law, and why I am so pleased to be \nhere with my colleague today to join in the introduction of this piece \nof legislation.\n  As people all around the country know--those who listened to the many \nspeeches given during the debate on health care--the President and \nDemocrats in Washington promised the American people this trillion \ndollar health care spending law would lower health insurance premiums. \nThat is what the President promised, that health insurance premium \ncosts would go down. Well, the American people have now had 19 months \nto review what is in the health care law, and they are finding that the \nPresident and the Washington Democrats sold them a bill of goods.\n  On September 27 of this year, the Kaiser Family Foundation issued its \nannual survey of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums. The \nreport showed that employer-provided health insurance premiums rose--\nwent up, not down--$1,303 for an average family last year alone. \nRemember--and we do--that the President repeatedly promised his health \ncare law would reduce the average annual family premium by $2,500. Yet \nthe exact opposite of what the President promised has occurred. The \nKaiser Family Foundation report shows significant premium increases, \nnot savings as the President promised.\n  Not only are premiums continuing to climb, but the President and \nWashington Democrats paid for their health care spending law by \nimposing billions of dollars in new taxes on American business and \nAmerican consumers. Independent experts agree these taxes only serve to \nincrease an individual, a family, or a small business's cost to buy \nmedical coverage. Specifically, section 9010 of the health care law \ncreates a new $60-plus billion tax on health insurance plans starting \nin 2014.\n  The health care law slaps this tax on all health insurance companies \nbased on net premiums in what is called the fully insured market. This \nmeans the tax an insurance company must pay is equal to the percent of \ntheir market share. The larger the insurance company's market share, \nthe higher their annual health insurance tax becomes. The aggregate tax \nin 2014 is $8 billion and climbs to $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, \neventually reaching over $14 billion in 2018. After that, the law \nmandates the health insurance tax grow by premium inflation. More \ninflation, higher taxes.\n  Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin \nreleased a study in March of this year estimating the health insurance \ntax could exceed $87 billion between 2014 and 2020. Some on the other \nside of the aisle want to message this tax as a ``health insurance \nfee.'' I would say to my friends all across this country, Do not be \nfooled. This new tax directly hits small business.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation makes it clear the insurance tax will \nbe borne by consumers in the form of higher prices, by owners of firms \nin the form of lower profits, by employees of those firms in the form \nof lower wages, or by other suppliers to the firms in the form of lower \npayments.\n  Remember, this tax only hits health insurance companies that sell \ntheir products in the fully insured market. As we have learned, and \nheard earlier on the Senate floor, 87 percent of small businesses buy \ntheir health insurance in this fully insured market.\n  The fully insured market is also the place that uninsured individuals \nand the self-employed go when they need to purchase medical insurance. \nInsurance companies selling plans to individuals and small businesses \nare the ones that are hit with the tax. The new tax doesn't hit large, \nself-insured businesses. Ultimately, uninsured individuals, small \nbusinesses, and their employees are the ones who are going to end up \npaying this unfair tax. This new punitive tax will add hundreds of \ndollars to family and small business insurance premiums every year.\n  The Wyoming Blue Cross Blue Shield Association tells me that a \nWyoming family of four will see a premium increase because of this tax \nof over $300 in 2014. In 2018, that same Wyoming family of four will \nsee over a $500 premium increase as a result of the tax. These premium \nincreases will have been passed through to consumers as a direct result \nof this health care law's tax component--what the President and the \nDemocrats in this body have foisted on the American public.\n  Additionally, the Holtz-Eakin March 2011 study proves the health \ninsurance tax will raise premiums by as much as 3 percent or nearly \n$5,000 for a family of four over the next decade. What American family, \nI ask you, can afford to see their take-home pay reduced by $5,000 over \nthe next decade thanks to the President's new tax. The Nation's \nunemployment rate stands at 9 percent. There are 14 million Americans, \npeople across our country, unemployed and looking for work. Struggling \nAmerican families cannot bear the brunt of President's Obama's new tax.\n  A recent study by the National Federation of Independent Business \nfound this health insurance tax will force the\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nprivate sector to shed somewhere between 125,000 and 249,000 jobs \nbetween now and 2021. More than half of those losses will fall on the \nbacks of small businesses.\n  Two million small businesses across this country cannot afford \nPresident Obama's new tax. Twenty-six million workers, who get their \ninsurance through their employer, cannot afford President Obama's new \ntax. And the 12 million people who buy health insurance plans on their \nown in the individual market cannot afford President Obama's new tax. \nThat is why today we introduce legislation called the Jobs and Premium \nProtection Act.\n  I introduced this bill along with my friend, the ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senator Hatch. Our legislation is simple \nand straightforward. It eliminates the health care law's punitive tax \non every individual, family, and small business that chooses to do the \nright thing and buy health insurance. Unbelievably, the health care law \npunishes individuals and punishes small businesses, the very two groups \nwho find buying health insurance at an affordable price extremely \nchallenging. Why would the Federal Government implement policies that \nmake it harder by imposing a tax on the products these individuals buy?\n  Some must believe that insurers will simply be able to absorb the \ntax. Well, experts tell us that assumption is false. Here is what the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said in a letter to Senator \nJohn Kyl in June of this year:\n\n       We expect a very large portion of the insurance industry \n     fee to be passed forward to purchasers of insurance in the \n     form of higher premiums.\n\n  A very large portion, they say. Then they go on to say:\n\n       Eliminating this fee would decrease the average family \n     premium in 2016 by $300 to $400.\n\n  Isn't that what we want, to lower the cost of insurance for \nindividuals? This is the way to do it.\n  Finally, the Joint Committee on Taxation letter confirms the \nfollowing:\n\n       Repealing the health insurance industry fee would reduce \n     the premium prices of plans offered by covered entities by 2 \n     to 2\\1/2\\ percent.\n\n  This ill-conceived discriminatory tax must be eliminated. It must be \nstopped well before it starts to impact individuals, families, and \nsmall businesses. Our bill is a critical piece of pro-business \nlegislation. It has the support of organizations such as the National \nFederation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Blue \nCross Blue Shield Association, and America's health insurance plans.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are concerned about \nthe cost of insurance for families of America, who are shocked and \nsurprised, some in disbelief, that what the President promised the \nAmerican people--of a reduction in premiums--isn't true, and who want \nto try to in a little way right that wrong to do so by cosponsoring and \nsupporting the Jobs and Premium Protection Act.\n  I thank the Chair and the ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Hatch--especially Senator Hatch--for his leadership \nand for joining me in introducing this legislation today. The time has \ncome to eliminate a bad policy that not only increases health insurance \ncosts but also negatively impacts America's job creators.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. \n        Brown of Ohio.\n  S. 1882. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure that valid generic drugs may enter the market; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Vitter, \nMerkley, and Brown of Ohio to introduce the Fair and Immediate Release \nof Generic Drugs Act of 2011. The FAIR GENERxICS Act is an important \nstep in addressing the root cause of the growing cost of healthcare--\nthe delay of generic drugs entering the market. This legislation has \nbroad support from consumer advocates, the generics industry, and \nexperts including: AARP, Apotex generics manufacturer, Families USA, \nU.S. PIRG, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Center for \nMedicare Advocacy, the National Legislative Association on Prescription \nDrug Prices, Alliance for Retired Americans, and Community Catalyst.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, prices for brand-name \nprescription drugs have continued to outpace inflation. Overall \nspending on prescription drugs also has increased sharply. In 2008 \nspending in the U.S. for prescription drugs was $234.1 billion, nearly \n6 times the $40.3 billion spent in 1990. Generic drugs can be an \nimportant source of affordable prescription drugs for many Americans. \nOn average, generic drugs are four times less expensive than name brand \ndrugs.\n  Pay-for-delay patent settlements brand and generic pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers, however, are delaying timely public access to generic \ndrugs, which costs consumers and taxpayers billions of dollars \nannually. In 2010 the Federal Trade Commission reported 31 such \nsettlements, a 60 percent increase since 2009, and in 2011 FTC reported \n28 such settlements. Many experts and consumer advocates have called \nfor legislation to address this problem and ensure access to affordable \nmedicines for all Americans.\n  The FAIR GENERxICS Act of 2011 addresses the root cause of anti-\ncompetitive pay-for-delay settlements between brand and generic \npharmaceutical manufacturers--the unintended, structural flaw in the \nHatch-Waxman Act that allows ``parked'' exclusivities to block generic \ncompetition. By doing so, the legislation ensures consumers will \nbenefit from full and fair generic competition at the earliest, most \nappropriate time.\n  The legislation would prevent ``parked exclusivities'' from delaying \nfull, fair, and early generic competition by modifying three key \nelements of existing law. First, the legislation would grant the right \nto share exclusivity to any generic filer who wins a patent challenge \nin the district court or is not sued for patent infringement by the \nbrand company. The legislation also maximizes the incentive for all \ngeneric challengers to fight to bring products to market at the \nearliest possible time by holding generic settlers to the deferred \nentry date agreed to in their settlements. Finally, in order to create \nmore clarity regarding litigation risk for pioneer drug companies and \ngeneric companies, the legislation requires pioneer companies to make a \nlitigation decision within the 45 day window provided for in the Hatch-\nWaxman Act.\n  As a result of these changes, companies who prevail in their patent \nchallenges and immediately come to market may be the sole beneficiary \nof the 180 day exclusivity period. In addition, companies will \nunderstand litigation risk before launching generic products.\n  Taken in concert these changes will ensure that generic markets are \nopened as they were originally envisioned under the Hatch-Waxman \nexclusivity periods; and will generate significant savings for the U.S. \nconsumers, the Federal Government, and the American health care system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1882\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair And Immediate Release \n     of Generic Drugs Act'' or the ``FAIR Generics Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. 180-DAY EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD AMENDMENTS REGARDING FIRST \n                   APPLICANT STATUS.\n\n       (a) Amendments to Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 505(j)(5)(B) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(B)) is amended--\n       (A) in clause (iv)(II)--\n       (i) by striking item (bb);

Res. 324\n\n       Whereas the United States Government enhanced its \n     relationship with the Governments of Australia and New \n     Zealand with the signing of the Australia-New Zealand-United \n     States (ANZUS) Treaty on September 1, 1951, and subsequently \n     engaged in annual, bilateral Australian-United States \n     Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations between the\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\n     Australian Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the \n     United States Secretaries of State and Defense, including a \n     meeting in San Francisco in September 2011 that commemorated \n     the 60th anniversary of the United States-Australia alliance;\n       Whereas the alliance remains fundamental to the security of \n     Australia and the United States and to the peace, stability, \n     and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and is one \n     dimension of a broad and deep relationship between the two \n     countries that encompasses robust bilateral strategic, \n     intelligence, trade, and investment relations based on shared \n     interests and values, a common history and cultural \n     traditions, and mutual respect;\n       Whereas numerous visits by Presidents of the United States, \n     including this week by President Barack Obama, and by the \n     Australian Prime Minister to the United States, including in \n     2011 when Prime Minister Julia Gillard addressed a Joint \n     Session of Congress, have underscored the strength and \n     closeness of the relationship;\n       Whereas members of the United States and Australian armed \n     forces have fought side-by-side in every major conflict since \n     the First World War, with the commitment to mutual defense \n     and security between the United States and Australia being \n     longstanding and unshakeable, as was demonstrated by the \n     joint decision to invoke the ANZUS Treaty in the aftermath of \n     the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     continue to share a common approach to the most pressing \n     issues in global defense and security, including in \n     Afghanistan, where about 1,550 Australian Defence Force \n     personnel are deployed, and in response to natural disasters \n     and humanitarian crises, such as in Japan following the \n     earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently stated, \n     ``We are expanding our alliance with Australia from a Pacific \n     partnership to an Indo-Pacific one, and indeed a global \n     partnership. . . . Australia's counsel and commitment have \n     been indispensable.'';\n       Whereas Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently remarked \n     that ``the United States has no closer ally than Australia. . \n     . . [We] affirm this alliance, affirm that it remains strong, \n     and that we are determined to deepen our security cooperation \n     even further to counter the threats and challenges that we \n     face in the future.'';\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     agreed to set up a Force Posture Working Group at the \n     November 2010 AUSMIN to examine options to align respective \n     force postures consistent with the national security \n     requirements of both countries and to help positively shape \n     the regional security environment;\n       Whereas the United States and Australia committed in a \n     Joint Statement on Cyberspace during the 2011 AUSMIN meeting \n     to consult together and determine appropriate options to \n     address any threats;\n       Whereas the Government of Australia is a major purchaser of \n     United States military resources, approximately 50 percent of \n     Australia's war-fighting assets are sourced from the United \n     States, and the Government of Australia has plans to spend a \n     substantial sum over the next 10-15 years to update or \n     replace up to about 85 percent of its military equipment;\n       Whereas, on September 29, 2010, the Senate provided its \n     advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty Between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation, signed at \n     Sydney, Australia, September 5, 2007, which will facilitate \n     defense trade between the two nations and enhance \n     interoperability between military forces;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     support open, transparent, and inclusive regional \n     architectures to preserve and enhance peace, security, and \n     prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     cooperate closely in regional and global forums, as evidenced \n     by Australia's support for the United States as the host this \n     month of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in 2011 \n     and the United States' support for Australia to host the G-20 \n     in 2014;\n       Whereas the United States and Australia elevated their \n     trade relationship through the Australia-United States Free \n     Trade Agreement that entered into force on January 1, 2005, \n     and exports of United States goods to Australia have risen by \n     53 percent since that time, totaling $21,900,000,000 in 2010;\n       Whereas the United States is Australia's largest \n     destination for foreign investment, helping create jobs for \n     United States workers, with Australian companies employing \n     more than 88,000 people directly in the United States;\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     Australia work closely to advance and support human rights, \n     the rule of law, and basic freedoms worldwide;\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     Australia work jointly and separately to support democracy, \n     economic reform, and good governance in the Pacific Islands, \n     Southeast Asia, South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and \n     North Africa, among other areas of the world; and\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia \n     are working through their respective aid agencies (USAID and \n     AusAID) and also exploring opportunities for collaboration \n     across a wide variety of areas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 60th Anniversary of the United States-\n     Australia alliance and takes this opportunity to reiterate \n     the enduring significance of this historic friendship that \n     serves as an anchor of peace, stability, and prosperity in \n     the Asia-Pacific region and in the world;\n       (2) supports United States efforts to strengthen military, \n     diplomatic, trade, economic, and people-to-people cooperation \n     with Australia, including initiatives to positively shape the \n     evolving strategic and economic environment that connects the \n     Indian and the Pacific Oceans; and\n       (3) urges close consultation between the Governments of the \n     United States and Australia in preparation for the East Asia \n     Summit to be chaired by Indonesia on November 19, 2011, and \n     encourages other, new forms of cooperation with the \n     Government and people of Australia that strengthen regional \n     architectures to enhance peace, security, and prosperity in \n     the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/16/senate-section/article/S7618-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 325--RECOGNIZING THE 2012 WORLD CHOIR GAMES IN \n  CINCINNATI, OHIO, AS A GLOBAL EVENT OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THE \n UNITED STATES AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF JULY 2012 AS \n              WORLD CHOIR GAMES MONTH IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Mr. Brown of Ohio) submitted the \nfollowing resolution;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration en bloc of the following \nresolutions which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 326, S. Res. \n327, S. Res. 328, S. Res. 329, and S. Res. 330.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions en bloc.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I am sponsoring a resolution, cosponsored by Majority Leader \nReid, Vice Chairman Barrasso, and several members of the committee, \ndesignating November as Native American Heritage Month and November 25 \nof this year as Native American Heritage Day.\n  This resolution recognizes the contributions of Native Americans. We \nsee the influence of the Iroquois Confederacy on the Founding Fathers \nof our country as they drafted the Constitution. And today, Native \nAmerican contributions in modern agriculture, medicine, music, \nlanguage, and art are undeniable. In that tradition of service, Native \nAmericans have had the highest representation, per capita, in our Armed \nForces in every war since World War II.\n  As a veteran of World War II and as a Native Hawaiian, I celebrate \nthe heroic work of the Code Talkers, and the countless American \nmilitary victories that were achieved in both World Wars with the \nunbreakable military code founded on indigenous languages and cultures.\n  As we reflect on Native American Heritage Month, it is important to \nremember our history and the promises we made. It is time to account \nfor those promises, kept and unkept.\n  As a nation, we were built on the highest principles. Our Founding \nFathers embraced equality, liberty, and justice and incorporated them \ninto the very fabric of our Constitution. They contemplated the unique \nrole of indigenous peoples in our country, and acknowledge their \nsovereignty in article I, section 8 of the Constitution.\n  The Founding Fathers set a high standard. As Americans and as Members \nof this body, it is our duty to continue to legislate policies in \nkeeping with our founding principles. For this reason, I applaud \nPresident Obama's recent commitment of U.S. support for the United \nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples--an \ninternational standard that I have been championing for more than a \ndecade.\n  In the Committee on Indian Affairs, I held an oversight hearing on \ndomestic policy implications of the declaration. We found that while \nthe United States is a world leader in recognizing and protecting the \nrights of indigenous peoples, there is more work to do. The rights of \nself-determination and self-governance contained in the declaration are \nAmerican ideas, ones we have embraced as official Federal policy for \nmore than 45 years. I am committed to working with my colleagues to \nenact legislation that gives real meaning to the high principles \nexpressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \nPeoples.\n  In the United States, November--Native American Heritage Month--is a \ntime when we reflect and give thanks. I encourage my fellow Americans \nto learn more about the Native peoples of this land and celebrate \nNative American Heritage Day on the day after Thanksgiving.\n  As we honor the contributions of Native Americans, let us recommit \nourselves to the high principles of self-determination and self-\ngovernance and strive for what is ``pono,'' just and right, for all, \nincluding our first Americans.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be \nagreed to, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc with no intervening action or debate, and \nthat any statements related to the resolutions be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 326\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which the United States was founded;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, \n     roughly 48,000,000 people in the United States, including \n     16,200,000 children, continue to live in households that do \n     not have an adequate supply of food; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental \n     principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 17, 2011, as ``Feed \n     America Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to sacrifice \n     2 meals on Thursday, November 17, 2011, and to donate the \n     money that would have been spent on that food to the \n     religious or charitable organization of their choice for the \n     purpose of feeding the hungry.\n\n                              S. Res. 327\n\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (referred to in this preamble as ``CDC''), nearly \n     26,000,000 people of the United States have diabetes and \n     79,000,000 people of the United States have pre-diabetes\n       Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that \n     affects people of every age, race, ethnicity, and income \n     level;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that Hispanic, African, Asian, and \n     Native Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes \n     and suffer from diabetes at rates that are much higher than \n     the general population;\n       Whereas according to the CDC, someone is diagnosed with \n     diabetes every 17 seconds;\n       Whereas each day, approximately 5,082 people are diagnosed \n     with diabetes;\n       Whereas in 2010, the CDC estimated that approximately \n     1,900,000 individuals aged 20 and older were newly diagnosed \n     with diabetes;\n       Whereas a joint National Institutes of Health and CDC study \n     found that approximately 15,000 youth in the United States \n     are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes annually and approximately \n     3,600 youth are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes annually;\n       Whereas according to the CDC, between 1980 and 2007, \n     diabetes prevalence in the United States increased by more \n     than 300 percent;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that over 27 percent of individuals \n     with diabetes are undiagnosed;\n       Whereas the National Diabetes Fact Sheet issued by the CDC \n     states that more than 11 percent of adults of the United \n     States and 26.9 percent of people of the United States age 60 \n     and older have diabetes;\n       Whereas the CDC estimates as many as 1 in 3 American adults \n     will have diabetes in 2050 if present trends continue;\n       Whereas the CDC estimates that as many as 1 in 2 Hispanic, \n     African, Asian, and Native American adults will have diabetes \n     in 2050 if present trends continue;\n       Whereas according to the American Diabetes Association, in \n     2007, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United \n     States was $174,000,000,000, and 1 in 10 dollars spent on \n     health care was attributed to diabetes and its complications;\n       Whereas according to a Lewin Group study, in 2007, the \n     total cost of diabetes (including both diagnosed and \n     undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, and gestational diabetes) \n     was $218,000,000,000;\n       Whereas a Mathematica Policy Research study in 2007 found \n     that, for each fiscal year, total expenditures for Medicare \n     beneficiaries with diabetes comprise 32.7 percent of the \n     Medicare budget;\n       Whereas according to the CDC, diabetes was the seventh \n     leading cause of death in 2007 and contributed to the deaths \n     of over 230,000 Americans in 2007;\n       Whereas there is not yet a cure for diabetes;\n       Whereas there are proven means to reduce the incidence of, \n     and delay the onset of, type 2 diabetes;\n       Whereas with the proper management and treatment, people \n     with diabetes live healthy, productive lives; and\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\n       Whereas American Diabetes Month is celebrated in November: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Diabetes \n     Month, including--\n       (A) encouraging the people of the United States to fight \n     diabetes through public awareness about prevention and \n     treatment options; and\n       (B) increasing education about the disease;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of early detection of \n     diabetes, awareness of the symptoms of diabetes, and the risk \n     factors that often lead to the development of diabetes, \n     including--\n       (A) being over the age of 45;\n       (B) having a specific racial and ethnic background;\n       (C) being overweight;\n       (D) having a low level of physical activity level;\n       (E) having high blood pressure; and\n       (F) having a family history of diabetes or a history of \n     diabetes during pregnancy; and\n       (3) supports decreasing the prevalence of type 1, type 2, \n     and gestational diabetes in the United States through \n     increased research, treatment, and prevention.\n\n                              S. Res. 328\n\n       Whereas research has shown that between 1980 and 2005 the \n     majority of jobs in the United States were created by \n     entrepreneurs and the young companies of those entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas the economy and society of the United States, as \n     well as the country as a whole, have greatly benefitted from \n     the everyday use of breakthrough innovations developed and \n     brought to market by entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA is an initiative \n     to celebrate the innovators and job creators who launch \n     startups that bring ideas to life, drive economic growth, and \n     improve human welfare;\n       Whereas Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA helps existing and \n     aspiring entrepreneurs to acquire the knowledge, skills, and \n     networks needed to create vibrant enterprises that will \n     improve the lives and communities of the entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas, in 2010, more than 445,896 individuals \n     participated in the more than 3,200 entrepreneurial \n     activities held in the United States alone during Global \n     Entrepreneurship Week;\n       Whereas, in 2010, more than 1,300 partner organizations \n     participated in Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA, including \n     startup accelerators, business incubators, chambers of \n     commerce, institutions of higher education, high schools, \n     businesses, and State and local governments; and\n       Whereas, in 2011, thousands of organizations in the United \n     States will join in the celebration by planning activities \n     designed to inspire, connect, mentor, and engage the next \n     generation of entrepreneurs throughout Global \n     Entrepreneurship Week/USA: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 14 through 20, 2011, as \n     ``Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA''; and\n       (2) supports the goals of Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA, \n     including--\n       (A) inspiring young people everywhere to embrace \n     innovation, imagination, and creativity; and\n       (B) training the next generation of entrepreneurial \n     leaders.\n\n                              S.
